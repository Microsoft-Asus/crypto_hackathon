Investigators working on the case claim that he was responsible for cyber attacks on over 100 companies between July and December 2015.\nOften, West’s criminal activities played out via phishing emails that lured suspects into sharing their personal and banking information with him.\nWest, who went by the online pseudonym ‘ Courvoisier ‘,’ reportedly used the dark web to sell passwords and credit card numbers that he acquired through the hacks. His proceeds from the illegal sales were converted into Bitcoin.\nThe arrest of West was made on a train by British police. Law enforcement was able to access his online cryptocurrency wallets through discovering their passwords on the unlocked laptop he was using at the time of his arrest. The funds were successfully sequestered.\nA British court said Wednesday that West’s sentence would be given on 25 May. The trial also found his girlfriend, Rachael Brooke, an accomplice to the crimes. While she was sentenced to just two years of community service, it is expected West’s sentence to be far more severe. Criminal activity and crypto\nSpeaking out on incidents involving online fraud, police investigator Mick Gallagher noted what he found a critical element to West’s arrest: ” These people generally feel they can operate with impunity, that they can’t be touched. We have now debunked that .”\nSome criminals believe that Bitcoin can offer them full anonymity, but investigators are frequently able to track the movement of cryptocurrencies. Even if they cannot identify the owner through the transactions themselves, tracking a publicly available trail of transactions on the blockchain may eventually lead them to the perpetrator.\nWhile it may seem like this incident is more bad press for cryptocurrencies, less than 1% of Bitcoin transactions actually involve illicit activities . Indeed, it is valuable for cryptocurrency traders to know that should any fraudulent activity be pursued against them, the police are becoming more equipped to deal with these situations and protect peoples’ online funds.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post $700K in Bitcoin Sequestered by London Police in Hacking Inquest appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

The move will likely have the most impact in the Chinese market, where Huawei is the biggest mobile phone seller. The nation has been a hotbed for cryptocurrencies. The Chinese government blocks Android’s Google Play Store and some sections of Apple’s iTunes, limiting access to apps like BTC.com’s. While China has shut down cryptocurrency trading platforms and initial coin offerings, people can still own virtual currencies.

Huawei is considering developing a mobile phone targeting blockchain-based applications, Bloomberg News reported in March. “From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future,” Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei’s mobile services said in a statement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bloomberg huawe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alejandro de la torre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei technologies co.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T12:43:36.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d4f5a0e4c6b38126246e0ac41c9ea9a0dfdc99d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdaqVWjHIN51z0oKZvRTR5BhLk4I5JMomCrRs8ly16qxJamG800amnK", "site_full": "www.moneygrows.net", "site": "moneygrows.net", "site_section": "http://www.moneygrows.net/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Moneygrows", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for 14/05/2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for 14/05/2018", "published": "2018-05-14T11:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/JEX9OvKu1wPvpgm-Yo-9ItPaqZuc4ssbG7VMBY6Iht7t8NmA8GhopdD4NjQ6lyopK4Y-Mhu5UCmcApl7IW8O8jZ3q-SZAFiommX__ElyrSGplHpSjXNYMxnI96BUvLPCy5azO0w=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d4f5a0e4c6b38126246e0ac41c9ea9a0dfdc99d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdaqVWjHIN51z0oKZvRTR5BhLk4I5JMomCrRs8ly16qxJamG800amnK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (MG Network)", "published": "2018-05-14T11:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for 14/05/2018", "text": "Contact Us Bitcoin analysis for 14/05/2018\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has banned banks and other financial institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions in the country. In response to this coalition consisting of four platforms for the exchange of cryptocurrencies and other startups, the regulator filed a petition in court, questioning the RBI directive. The decision of the Supreme Court will be considered on May 17.\nThe Central Bank of India has banned banks and other regulated financial organizations from dealing in cryptocurrency transactions last month. The regulator maintained that such a decision was in the interest of investors, citing the fact that cryptocurrencies constituted a tool for dishonest actions. According to RBI, the huge number of threats associated with the cryptocurrency market forced the central bank to take action. Many opponents responding to the ban expressed their opposition to this decision. They believe that this movement threatens the growth and development of the domestic cryptocurrency market. Others point to the unclear language of the ban, questioning its constitutionality.\nBefore the ban was introduced, the RBI issued three separate press releases warning against cryptocurrency investments. The country's government is also hostile to cryptocurrencies. Despite this hostility, there are reports that RBI wants to create a national cryptocurrency for India.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. After the three wave advance to the upside, the marked is reversing again towards the local lows at the level of $8,200. This small wave up might be a wave x, which indicates a possible drop lower towards the level of $7,712 as the correction evolves into a complex one. Moreover, the golden trend line is still providing the dynamic resistance for the price, so as long as this line is not violated, the outlook remains bearish.

BTC.com, based in Amsterdam and Beijing, has become the first bitcoin wallet on Huawei’s new app store. This brings an important mobile payments opportunity to Chinese consumers behind the “Great Firewall.”\nThe Huawei mobile payments will make it easier for Chinese residents to access cryptocurrency wallets, according to a CNN report . Both the Chinese government and telecom companies have jointly blocked Android mobile device users from being able to access Google Play, the Android app store. This means that the majority of Android apps are not available to consumers behind what is known as “China’s Great Firewall.”\nMoreover, there is an existing and growing rift between American intelligence agencies and Huawei, as was recently reported by QR Code Press . There is a lack of trust between these agencies and the company regarding the handset maker’s lack of transparency and ties to the Chinese government. Huawei mobile payments will be available through the new app store on all P20 and up Honor phones.\nThe Huawei app store will be automatically installed on these new devices. That said, owners of older models will also be able to enjoy the app store soon. The company announced that it will arrive on their phones later in the quarter.\nThis means that anyone there who wants the new bitcoin wallet will be able to find it as BTC.com in the App Gallery. The app is owned by Mitmain, a cryptocurrency miner manufacturer from China. Moreover, CNN reported that the app is setting up to encourage greater downloads right off the bat by offering to “gift a starting amount of cryptocurrency” to Huawei users who install a wallet.\n“BTC.com is democratizing Bitcoin by breaking down barriers to entry and ensuring new users can access Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in a simple, secure and trusted environment,” said Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of business operations at BTC.com in a press release about the new Huawei mobile payments opportunity.

For any answers to questions contact Clyde Thorburn at http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn .\nAuthor : Bitcoin.com\nKnowing how to buy Bitcoin Core (BTC) is an essential first step in getting started with the digital currency. However, knowing which bitcoin exchange to choose can be one of the most important first steps. Since you will be investing your funds into Bitcoin Core and the exchange from where you buy them, making sure you are choosing the right one becomes critical. (Update: Bitcoin Core is less usable as money due to much higher fees and delayed transaction times. The Core team has also expressed an interest in keeping these fees high since they view BTC as a “store-of-value” and not something to be transacted on a daily basis. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash’s transaction fees cost pennies and payments can be validated even with zero confirmations. These facts make BCH the ideal cryptocurrency for sending and receiving money anywhere in the world.) In this guide we will take you through the top items in our checklist we recommend reviewing before making the decision to select a Bitcoin exchange. Remember, these are just suggestions to help you make the right decision. In the end, things can always change based on the exchange and the market. But doing your homework first is highly encouraged. What country is the exchange located in? Knowing your country and where the exchange is based out of is important, as laws and regulations can vary country to country. Buying bitcoin in your home country is typically recommended. For a full list of exchange country locations, go to Buy Bitcoin at https://www.bitcoin.com/buy-bitcoin?utm_source=get-started&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=guides&utm_content=How-to-Choose-Best-Exchange and from the dropdown menu, select your country to start. Despite the exchange being based in your home country or not, the exchange may accept multiple currencies.\nMake sure to check the fine print; usually exchanges post in their terms of service what currencies they do and do not accept. How can bitcoins be purchased? Can you pay with wire transfer, cash, credit cards at https://buy.bitcoin.com/, at PayPal, and so on. Use what works best for you at your convenience. Please make sure to consider your privacy levels, for example credit cards may be the least private way versus a cash transaction. Exchange fees. You will want to make sure that the exchange fees are within reason and aren’t exorbitant compared to the rest of the market. Fees can change overtime and can vary from exchange to exchange. Some exchanges charge additional fees on top of bitcoin transaction fees at https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Transaction_fee. Order book volume. Most exchanges with a decent customer base will publish their order book. An order book is simply a list of buy and sell orders on the exchange that are being offered. A higher volume order book is an indicator that people are using the exchange and the exchange has liquidity. Although this is an important indicator, an exchange that doesn’t publish an order book doesn’t mean it’s not legit, it just might not have that function yet and/or has a smaller volume than other bigger exchanges. Is the exchange transparent? Exchanges that are fully transparent will publish cold storage addresses or audit information on how to verify their bitcoin reserves. Bitcoin audits are a good way for an exchange to prove to customers that they have liquidity and can cover all bitcoin exchange sales, and aren’t running a fractional exchange. How quickly will you get the bitcoins after purchasing them? This may vary person-to-person, but it’s good to know how long before the bitcoin will be sent to you after purchase.\nMake sure to also check if the exchange offers ‘locked in’ pricing; meaning that the price you buy at, is the price you will be charged for even if the bitcoins take a few days to arrive. Is anonymity important to you? Staying completely anonymous is difficult, unless you buy locally from someone in cash through a person-to-person marketplace. Make sure to check if the exchange follows Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in your country. If they do, then some identity information will have to be sent to them before buying. Security is paramount. Knowing the exchange is secure is very important and shouldn’t be overlooked. Is the exchange site HTTPS or HTTP? For it to have a secure protocol it must be HTTPS. Does the exchange offer secure logins along with two-factor authentication (2FA)? These are just a couple things to think about before selecting an exchange. Is the exchange reputable? This is an important question that can only be answered by discussing it with your peers. If you want to make sure the exchange has good customer reviews, search for feedback about the exchange on internet forums such as the Bitcoin Reddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/ or the Bitcoin Forum at https://forum.bitcoin.com/ .

Fundstrat experts expect that Consensus conference will reverse the trend.\nBitcoin is back below $8,400 again. A recovery attempted on weekend, failed to get the digital currency No.1 above $9,000 threshold. BTC/USD is trading at $8,346 at the time of writing, off the Asian high of $8,712. The coin has lost 4.5% since the start of the day and reversed all Sunday and Saturday gains.\nMeanwhile, crypto enthusiasts are flocking to New York for one of the largest crypto event of the year – CoinDesk’s Consensus conference. Fundstrat’s managing director and technical strategist Robert Sluymer expect that the event will serve as a good bullish trigger for Bitcoin and other coins, dispelling pessimism about regulatory risks.\n“The regulatory risk, the fundamental risk around what’s happening with cryptos has hit a bottom and now we’re in a state of general recovery,” he said on CNBC’s “Fast Money” Thursday.\nHe explained that Bitcoin increased each year after Consensus, though it remains to be seen if the market follows the tradition this year.\nBitcoin’s technical picture\nOn the longer-term scale, Bitcoin is jammed between 100-DMA and 50-DMA ($8,826 and $8,263 respectively). A sustainable break in either direction will trigger a strong movement with the next upside target seen at psychological $9,000 and support at $8,000.

Now, one artist has come up with a new way to benefit directly from this still-nascent technology by inviting passersby to donate to him using a Bitcoin QR code, which he affixed to his murals.\nThe brainchild behind the idea is French street artist Pascal “PBOY” Boyart, and the artist’s embrace of the digital currency is already paying dividends. As of this writing, Boyar has made 0.11 Bitcoin (about $1,000) from 23 donors thanks to his clever embrace of cryptocurrency. The feat has even caught the attention of Reddit .\nBoyart was intrigued by the idea of being able to connect directly with the public and to receive money for his work without going through a middleman. So, he took six months off from painting to learn about this new technology. The donation process that resulted is decidedly simple: Anyone with a smartphone and a Bitcoin wallet can scan the QR code on the mural and make a digital payment that goes directly to the artist.\n“I think that the times we are living are difficult for free-minded artists,” the artist told artnet News in an email. “It looks like the Impressionist era, with a official art of academic artists and the others that you have not much chance to see in an international art fair.”\nPascal “PBOY” Boyart, Rembrandt dos au mur , a mural in Paris featuring a QR code that allows the public to donate to the artist using Bitcoin. Photo courtesy of the artist.\nOne of Boyart’s recent murals shows Rembrandt van Rijn reading through a large tax bill—the celebrated Dutch Gold Age master struggled to make money throughout his career, despite creating some of art history’s best-known works. The piece is titled Rembrandt dos au mur , or Rembrandt Back Against the Wall , a pun on the artist’s financial situation and the work’s wall mural nature.\nThe work can be found on the Rue Riquet, where an over 1,640-foot street art wall was created in December 2015, on a bridge going over the railroad tracks. The artist created his addition to the outdoor display without permission, having previously painted Vincent van Gogh on the same wall three years ago. He has described his style as blending the Pointillism of Georges Seurat with Jackson Pollock’s drip paintings.\nPascal “PBOY” Boyart, Vincent van Gogh mural. Photo courtesy of the artist.\nBefore the Rembrandt mural, Boyart’s first QR-tagged work was painted last November. It shows a boy’s face with the caption “Papa, c’est quoi l’argent?” or “Dad, what is money?” Setting up the Bitcoin account was easy, so all he had to do was order a laser cut stencil for the QR code.\nBoyart isn’t sure whether other artists have tried this before, but he thought it could be a good way to offset the considerable costs for materials and supplies for his street art. “I diversify my sources of income,” he said. “Sometimes I do live painting performances on events, collaborations with brands and storyboarding… Occasionally, I sell some artworks and I organize my own art exhibitions. Most of the time, my street art pieces are made without remuneration, just for the pleasure to paint and share with the people.”\nPascal “PBOY” Boyart, Papa, c’est quoi l’argent (detail), a mural in Paris featuring a QR code that allows the public to donate to the artist using Bitcoin. Photo courtesy of the artist.\nWith Bitcoin, the artist has an easy way to set up direct financial transactions with the people. “I think it’s great news for the future and it will bring more sense, talent, freedom, and creativity from the artists,” Boyart said.\n“The most interesting aspect is decentralization—a peer-to-peer horizontal system,” he told the Next Web , which first wrote about the project. “Art and creation need that, I believe.”\nBoyart, who is now planning an exhibition of cryptocurrency art, is thankful for the donations he’s received so far. “I’ll use this money to purchase more art material and ‘hold’ another part because Bitcoin’s value will surely increase in coming years,” he said. Who knows—cryptocurrencies might not only revolutionize the world. If we’re lucky, they may also end once and for all the tired trope of the starving artist.\nYou can find Boyart’s Bitcoin address here .

However, since the bill became law, quite a few people and businesses in Israel’s digital currency ecosystem have failed to remit their taxes.\nNow, the authorities have gone all out to start fishing out defaulters.\nAccording to reports, tax offices in Israel have started sending notices to all those they suspect are involved in digital currency related activities. The authorities are demanding for all information concerning their crypto operations including transaction history and portfolio details, bitcoin mining activities, and more.\nThe tax authorities seem to have very reliable sources of information, as some offices don’t even go through the due process of requesting for crypto-related details from suspected bitcoin investors. Instead, they’d open a business case for the people they think are digital currency investors and mandate them to pay income taxes as businesses, fill in their trade reports back from 2013 while keeping balanced books. The tax offices also require their ‘victims’ to report taxes on salaries to employees just like other businesses.\nWith this latest development, Israel becomes the first nation to begin hunting down bitcoin tax evaders even though it is not the only country facing the challenge. Advertisement advertisement Tax Collectors Globally Want a Share of the Crypto Pie\nIn February 2018, BTCManager reported that the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the body in charge of tax-related matters in the state stated that less than a 100 people out of the over 250,000 hodlers in the country declared their crypto gains.\nIn spite of this fact, authorities have not resorted to chasing bitcoiners all around town like Israel is doing presently despite having made frantic efforts to identify bitcoin investors. Notably, in November 2016, the IRS issued a John Doe summons on Coinbase, in a bid to get the bitcoin exchange’s customer data. However, the move proved futile as the exchange refused to grant the request of the tax agency.\n“We want to work with law enforcement, that’s generally our policy. But we can’t tolerate sweeping fishing expeditions. We are very concerned about the financial privacy rights of our customers,” said Coinbase’s head legal counsel, Juan Suarez back in November 2016. Banks and Social Media Aiding the Chase\nAlthough the Israeli tax authorities have not disclosed their sources of information concerning bitcoiners in the region, it is, however, possible that Israeli Banks have been aiding the entire process.\nIn recent times quite many crypto-related businesses have filed lawsuits against banks in the region for denying them banking services. Also, sources close to the matter have hinted that officials are now monitoring residents to find out peer-to-peer crypto transactions on social media such as Telegram, Facebook, and others and cross-referencing them with other available evidence.

This has increased the number of scams in the industry as well. Scrupulous people are robbing people of their hard-earned money. However, there are still many places where you can mine cryptocurrencies and get its value transferred to your wallet.\nBitcoin mining is still a lucrative option for earning the now valuable currency (valued at over $10,000 at the time of writing). Here is all that you need to know about Bitcoin mining as well as a list of websites where you can earn Bitcoins without any deposits. What is Bitcoin mining?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is completely decentralized and democratized. There is no central bank regulating the flow of this currency and no government whose decisions can make fluctuations in its value. However, Bitcoins must originate from somewhere. The answer to this query is mining.\nMiners are people who are ready to put in their time and resources for creating new bitcoins. They solve certain math puzzles and create new coins. They get some of these coins in exchange for the work they have done. This is a smart way of earning money, considering that Bitcoin is the hottest crypto in the market. Earning coins is the only incentive for miners. They do not form a government or a central bank that is politically motivated. There can only be a set number of Bitcoins in the world, which means that no government can create more Bitcoins at will.\nThis is not all that miners do. They play a major role in keeping the entire blockchain secure. They do the job of approving transactions before confirmation. This helps in fair transfer of money from one wallet to another and makes the network security for everyone to use. Additionally, it reduces the chances of frauds by providing proof-of-work. Miners are an integral part of the blockchain.\nBitcoin mining is neither an easy nor an inexpensive project to undertake. You will have to dedicate resources to buying devices that will be used for mining. Most people are unable to dedicate such resource which ultimately discourages them from becoming a miner. Even some good coin mining websites ask you for deposits for using their cloud platforms.\nThese websites have all the hardware themselves, and they simply rent it out to you. You can use it to mine coins and earn some profit, a part of which goes in paying the rent of the equipment. This fee is not less, and there are chances that you may end up paying more rent than your earnings. Additionally, there are upfront deposits as well that simply increase the chances of paying off more than you can earn. Best Bitcoin Mining Websites 2018\nThe good news is that all websites do not ask you to make deposits upfront. Some websites simply let you pay the rent for their physical hardware while others will provide you free accounts where you could be earning a few coins (albeit a very small fraction). Let’s talk about a few websites that will be providing you deposit free Bitcoin mining services. #1 Bitminer.io\nThis website calls itself an ‘industry leading Bitcoin mining pool.’ BitMiner allows you to get physical miner backed Bitcoins in your account. You will only need to sign up with your Bitcoin wallet address and start mining almost instantly. You don’t have to pay anything for this bitcoin mining activity up front. In fact, you can sign up for their affiliate program where you can earn at least 20% for each referral, which can go as high as 100%, depending on the kind of account you own.\nCheck recent offer – bluehost coupon code april 2018 – max discount promo offer\nThe website takes all the hard stuff away from mining and leaves you with a simple and easy way to earn Bitcoins for free.

Finally, there is the BitMiner 1.4 which provides 100% affiliate bonus and earnings up to 1 BTC per day. It is available for 5 BTC.\nCheck Out Bitminer.io #2 CoinMaker\nThis website is quite similar to Bitminer. Signing up is very simple. All you will have to do is visit the website, provide your Bitcoin address, and then suggest the number of Bitcoins you would like to mine. Rest of the process is automated. This website claims to be 5400% faster than any other Bitcoin mining site in the world which looks like a very tall claim. This is not all; CoinMaker suggests that they multiple private servers around the world. This helps them in maintain better uptime than their competition.\nAn advantage of using a website like CoinMaker is that you don’t have to download any software or go through a lengthy sign-up process. You can simply provide you bitcoin address and start mining. Another good thing to note about this website is that it lets you decide the number of Bitcoins you want to mine. This gives you more power to decide how much you will be able to earn. Note that CoinMaker also supports Ethereum mining. This way, you will be able to mine two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world.\nCheck Out CoinMaker #3 MinerFarm\nThis website calls itself a virtual Bitcoin miner that could deposit real income in your wallets. It is a simulation game that mimics real mining. If you want to experience how Bitcoin mining really works, this is the best place to do so. This is not all. It lets you earn real coins for mining virtually. Leave alone mining alone; you even get to create a pool where you earn through collective efforts. This cloud mining system claims to create real-world situations, where you must strategize to maximize your virtual earnings. Bitcoins are generated because of these activities. You can decide if you want to transfer those Bitcoins to your own wallets or use them for increasing your production capacity.\nSigning up for MinerFarm is really easy, and you even get a welcome present- a basic miner and some power supply, to start mining. In order to produce more Bitcoins, you should be buying mining devices from the shop section of the game. This helps you in getting more coins for your efforts. You will have to buy power supplies along with mining devices. Heat generated due to mining will decrease the efficiency of your miners. Hence, you will have to buy coolers as well. Apart from this, you will be spending on maintenance and repair of your devices as well. Overall, this stimulation game tries to mimic real life as closely as possible and give you coins for your efforts. Note that the game is not affiliated with or related to the Bitcoin network.\nCheck Out MinerFarm #4 CoinWorker\nThis is another deposit free coin miner. Just like its peers, it asks you to register and then enter a bitcoin address. Once done, you can start solving a few analytical tasks. They are usually simple and do not require high-end calculations. You will be collection points on this platform for completing these analytical tasks.\nOnce you gain 200 points in the account, you can turn them into Bitcoins. This currency can be paid directly to your wallet, instantly. The site identifies more as a Bitcoin faucet than a Bitcoin mining service. However, in either case, you will be earning coins for the work you do.\nCheck Out CoinWorker How to stay away from frauds?\nAs we mentioned above, Bitcoin mining is a sector where you will find more frauds than legit links. In the Bitcoin environment, there are two difficulty levels of mining. When the difficulty level is easy, more miners try to enter the sector which leads to a quicker mining time. It should be about 10 minutes per block. After that, the mining gets complex as you get to next level. This discourages many miners from pursuing their activities further, because of which the rate of mining comes back to normal.\nWhile this is the inbuilt feature of Bitcoin’s blockchain network, there is nothing that stops fraudulent websites from offering you ‘too-good-to-be-true’ offers. Some of these websites may lure you into with Ponzi schemes while others may simply pay you extremely small fractions of Bitcoin for your time and effort. You need to be careful about these sites.\nSo how does one know if a website is legit or fraud? First, note what the website is asking for. Fraudulent websites could be asking you for an upfront deposit. They will take your money and pay you a small share of it to appear legit. You will keep dedicating your resources to the website while they make money at your expense. Most of these websites try to hide their details. Some even go to the extent of showing themselves as a company to appear more honorable. However, most of their records are false.\nYou should check whether the website you want to associate with has any physical mining equipment or not. Most will be making false claims about their equipment and fail to provide any proof of their assets. Additionally, they claim to have data centers and servers located across the world but do not show you exactly where they are located.\nAnother important thing to notice while finding a coin mining website is the language used on their website. Fraudulent websites tend to rely more on tall claims than on real mining capabilities. They will tell you about the number of coins you will be able to make, the kind of money you will receive and more.\nThe language is often designed to make you click the button and sign up for their website. That’s it! They fail to provide any verifiable and authentic information about what they really do. Innocent investors are fooled by such lofty language and sign up for these websites out of sheer curiosity. This makes them lose money.\nAs investors have become aware, these fraudulent companies have also become smarter. Now, you could even find these websites providing you verifiable Bitcoin addresses and send you small fractions of the coin as well. This helps them in gaining your trust because of which you invest more money and time into the website. One day, the payments stop coming through and there is always a technical fault or a glitch.\nFinally, check if the website provides you any customer support. A good website, whether or not it is asking for upfront payments or rent, should have a good customer support staff. You should be able to generate support tickets and talk to the company’s representatives directly if the need be. Fraudulent websites do not invest in these services. They usually have very basic websites. Most of them do not have any customer support, only a ‘Contact’ page where they get to choose whether they want to talk to you or not.\nBitcoin mining can be safe if you only spend time in finding the right website to work with. As a rule of thumb, stay away from any website that promises too much and does too little. You should try to find real customer reviews on the website as well. Check what people are saying about a website on every platform possible. If you are still unable to find any credible information, it would be better to leave this option behind.\nThese were some basics that you should know about Bitcoin mining and find the right websites to work with.

Yes they are dividing us again, under everyone nose. lol Ignored Wow I agree with that 100%. Never once had faith in Satoshi story. (see PM) Yes I believe in the Bitcoin revolution. Actually I believe it will be an alternative crypto-currency. The initial development of Bitcoin, like all things, had inherent flaws and possible improvements. These improvements made by alternative crypto-currency's are at times vastly superior to that of Bitcoin. An example is LITECOIN, which has 81,000,000 in potential circulation vs Bitcoins 21,000,000. Other developments include increased privacy, central fund, etc. Right now, I believe the main concern is Government intervention. We are all unclear about their views and potential actions, with many considering that Governments will ban or limit it's use. (Using 'Black Market' arguments to stem its progression.) Once Authority's views are quite clear, me say see further market involvement by those that are on the sidelines. Funds, investors, retail and other market participants.

The creator’s name is unknown, however the alias Satoshi Nakamoto was given to this person.\nAdvantages of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin transactions are made directly from person to person trough the internet. There’s no need of a bank or clearinghouse to act as the middle man. Thanks to that, the transaction fees are way too much lower, they can be used in all the countries around the world. Bitcoin accounts cannot be frozen, prerequisites to open them don’t exist, same for limits. Every day more merchants are starting to accept them. You can buy anything you want with them.\nHow Bitcoin works.\nIt’s possible to exchange dollars, euros or other currencies to bitcoin. You can buy and sell as it were any other country currency. In order to keep your bitcoins, you have to store them in something called wallets. These wallet are located in your pc, mobile device or in third party websites. Sending bitcoins is very simple. It’s as simple as sending an email. You can purchase practically anything with bitcoins.\nWhy Bitcoins?\nBitcoin can be used anonymously to buy any kind of merchandise. International payments are extremely easy and very cheap. The reason of this, is that bitcoins are not really tied to any country. They’re not subject to any kind regulation. Small businesses love them, because there’re no credit card fees involved. There’re persons who buy bitcoins just for the purpose of investment, expecting them to raise their value.\nWays of Acquiring Bitcoins.\n1) Buy on an Exchange: people are allowed to buy or sell bitcoins from sites called bitcoin exchanges. They do this by using their country currencies or any other currency they have or like.\n2) Transfers: persons can just send bitcoins to each other by their mobile phones, computers or by online platforms. It’s the same as sending cash in a digital way.\n3) Mining: the network is secured by some persons called the miners. They’re rewarded regularly for all newly verified transactions. Theses transactions are fully verified and then they are recorded in what’s known as a public transparent ledger. These individuals compete to mine these bitcoins, by using computer hardware to solve difficult math problems. Miners invest a lot of money in hardware. Nowadays, there’s something called cloud mining. By using cloud mining, miners just invest money in third party websites, these sites provide all the required infrastructure, reducing hardware and energy consumption expenses.\nStoring and saving bitcoins.\nThese bitcoins are stored in what is called digital wallets. These wallets exist in the cloud or in people’s computers. A wallet is something similar to a virtual bank account. These wallets allow persons to send or receive bitcoins, pay for things or just save the bitcoins. Opposed to bank accounts, these bitcoin wallets are never insured by the FDIC.\nTypes of wallets.\n1) Wallet in cloud: the advantage of having a wallet in the cloud is that people don’t need to install any software in their computers and wait for long syncing processes. The disadvantage is that the cloud may be hacked and people may lose their bitcoins. Nevertheless, these sites are very secure.\n2) Wallet on computer: the advantage of having a wallet on the computer is that people keep their bitcoins secured from the rest of the internet. The disadvantage is that people may delete them by formatting the computer or because of viruses.\nBitcoin Anonymity.\nWhen doing a bitcoin transaction, there’s no need to provide the real name of the person. Each one of the bitcoin transactions are recorded is what is known as a public log. This log contains only wallet IDs and not people’s names. so basically each transaction is private. People can buy and sell things without being tracked.\nBitcoin innovation.\nBitcoin established a whole new way of innovation. The bitcoin software is all open source, this means anyone can review it. A nowadays fact is that bitcoin is transforming world’s finances similar to how web changed everything about publishing.

For any answers to questions contact Clyde Thorburn at http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist- johannesburg .strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn .\nAuthor : Bitcoin.com\nKnowing how to buy Bitcoin Core (BTC) is an essential first step in getting started with the digital currency. However, knowing which bitcoin exchange to choose can be one of the most important first steps. Since you will be investing your funds into Bitcoin Core and the exchange from where you buy them, making sure you are choosing the right one becomes critical. (Update: Bitcoin Core is less usable as money due to much higher fees and delayed transaction times. The Core team has also expressed an interest in keeping these fees high since they view BTC as a “store-of-value” and not something to be transacted on a daily basis. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash’s transaction fees cost pennies and payments can be validated even with zero confirmations. These facts make BCH the ideal cryptocurrency for sending and receiving money anywhere in the world.) In this guide we will take you through the top items in our checklist we recommend reviewing before making the decision to select a Bitcoin exchange. Remember, these are just suggestions to help you make the right decision. In the end, things can always change based on the exchange and the market. But doing your homework first is highly encouraged. What country is the exchange located in? Knowing your country and where the exchange is based out of is important, as laws and regulations can vary country to country. Buying bitcoin in your home country is typically recommended. For a full list of exchange country locations, go to Buy Bitcoin at https://www.bitcoin.com/buy-bitcoin?utm_source=get-started&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=guides&utm_content=How-to-Choose-Best-Exchange and from the dropdown menu, select your country to start. Despite the exchange being based in your home country or not, the exchange may accept multiple currencies.\nMake sure to check the fine print; usually exchanges post in their terms of service what currencies they do and do not accept. How can bitcoins be purchased? Can you pay with wire transfer, cash, credit cards at https://buy.bitcoin.com/, at PayPal, and so on. Use what works best for you at your convenience. Please make sure to consider your privacy levels, for example credit cards may be the least private way versus a cash transaction. Exchange fees. You will want to make sure that the exchange fees are within reason and aren’t exorbitant compared to the rest of the market. Fees can change overtime and can vary from exchange to exchange. Some exchanges charge additional fees on top of bitcoin transaction fees at https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Transaction_fee. Order book volume. Most exchanges with a decent customer base will publish their order book. An order book is simply a list of buy and sell orders on the exchange that are being offered. A higher volume order book is an indicator that people are using the exchange and the exchange has liquidity. Although this is an important indicator, an exchange that doesn’t publish an order book doesn’t mean it’s not legit, it just might not have that function yet and/or has a smaller volume than other bigger exchanges. Is the exchange transparent? Exchanges that are fully transparent will publish cold storage addresses or audit information on how to verify their bitcoin reserves. Bitcoin audits are a good way for an exchange to prove to customers that they have liquidity and can cover all bitcoin exchange sales, and aren’t running a fractional exchange. How quickly will you get the bitcoins after purchasing them? This may vary person-to-person, but it’s good to know how long before the bitcoin will be sent to you after purchase.\nMake sure to also check if the exchange offers ‘locked in’ pricing; meaning that the price you buy at, is the price you will be charged for even if the bitcoins take a few days to arrive. Is anonymity important to you? Staying completely anonymous is difficult, unless you buy locally from someone in cash through a person-to-person marketplace. Make sure to check if the exchange follows Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in your country. If they do, then some identity information will have to be sent to them before buying. Security is paramount. Knowing the exchange is secure is very important and shouldn’t be overlooked. Is the exchange site HTTPS or HTTP? For it to have a secure protocol it must be HTTPS. Does the exchange offer secure logins along with two-factor authentication (2FA)? These are just a couple things to think about before selecting an exchange. Is the exchange reputable? This is an important question that can only be answered by discussing it with your peers. If you want to make sure the exchange has good customer reviews, search for feedback about the exchange on internet forums such as the Bitcoin Reddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/ or the Bitcoin Forum at https://forum.bitcoin.com/ . If you can’t find any feedback about it, ask in those forums if your peers have used it and what their experience was. Avoiding fraud. Not becoming a victim should be a high priority. This means avoiding any scam exchanges that are designed to steal from you.

In addition to the described success, we can even see BCH keeping it busy in the market as we can see it rising up against the dollar even though the majority of currencies are still under the impression of the latest market trend, which means that a great portion of the market is going down against the dollar at this moment. Let’s find out more about BCH airdrop, Bitcoin Cash’s latest partnership, as well as check out how BCH has been doing these days. Bitcoin Cash and the New Partnership\nBitcoin Cash has, as of the recent events, acquired a very meaningful partnership that will most certainly help it sky-rocket while gaining more on the exposure of BCH units. In order to step into the next stage of following up with the mass adoption of crypto assets, Bitcoin Cash has partnered up with YeeCall.\nYeeCall is a mobile application for online communicating, making chatting and video and voice chat far easier to use. Bitcoin Cash Fund is targeting over 33 million YeeCall users, hoping to be able to become a part of a massive adoption of BCH by the side of YeeCall users.\nDue to the most recent partnership, Bitcoin Cash has also organized an Airdrop that took place 3 days ago as the story about the partnership between YeeCall and BCH was slowly kicking off.\nThat is how Bitcoin Cash had an Airdrop on May 9 th due to the agreement that the team behind BCH had with the YeeCall representatives.\nThe part of the arrangement was to have an Airdrop organized for YEE token holders where 20 BCH units would be awarded as a part of the initial airdrop that took place about 3 days ago.\nThe requirement needed in order to have eligible users for getting a portion of those 20 BCH as a part of the initial airdrop, was to have at least 10.000 of YEE tokens in your digital wallet at the moment when the system makes a snapshot.\nThe users who were rewarded during the Airdrop were decided based on the number of tokens they were holding, where the number of YEE tokens could have been greater than the minimal amount of 10.000 YEE. Bitcoin Cash Had an Airdrop\nIn order to reward the faithful holders of YEE tokens and celebrate the partnership between YeeCall and Bitcoin Cash Fund, Bitcoin Cash in agreement with YeeCall decided to organize an Airdrop that took place on May 9 th .\nAs a part of the initial airdrop, Bitcoin Cash has made an arrangement with YeeCall to have 20 BCH units awarded to YEE holders. The requirement needed in order to become an eligible holder for winning some of those 20 BCH was to have at least 10.000 units of YEE tokens in your digital wallet.\nThe awarded holders were being decided based on the amount of YEE tokens, so anyone with the highest number of YEE tokens could win a portion of 20 BCH units.\nGiven the fact that Bitcoin Cash is being traded above 1000$ per one unit, 20 BCH makes up for a pretty fruitful airdrop.\nWith the above-mentioned airdrop, the partnership between YeeCall, which represents one of the biggest messaging platforms in Asia with over 33 million users, officially started.\nBy having BCH implemented into YeeCall application as one of the payment methods available for their users, YeeCall is adding more up to BCH’s exposure, representing it to the wide range of potential BCH holders, which could most probably sky-rocket Bitcoin Cash even further. How is Bitcoin Cash doing at the Current Moment?\nBCH showed a slight case of trading up against the dollar despite the fact that the majority if currencies were going down against the dollar while trading in the red. After showing a trace of doing better in the market when compared to the rest of its peers, Bitcoin Cash then immediately went down although the drop was minor.\nIn the period of the last 60 days, BCH didn’t make any serious movements given the fact that a great part of this period was in the sign of the market dip. That means that BCH only had a rise of 33% in total against the dollar over the period of two months.\nHowever, we could see it rising up while being traded in the green almost for the entire April, so BCH made it with collecting 110% of rises over the course of the last 30 days.\nAfter the latest change in the market, BCH showed trading up in the green for a moment, despite the market trend, while it went down for -0.81% against the dollar a couple 0of hours ago.\nHowever, we can still see it rising up against BTC, going up against this crypto by 2.45%.\nAfter the most recent change in its value, Bitcoin Cash can be traded at the price of 1411$ per one BCH unit, which is still far from its all-time high of above 4000$ per one Bitcoin Cash unit.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The Original Cryptocurrency by 0\nBitcoin is almost synonymous with the term “cryptocurrency”, as it is the first one to be developed, the most well known, and still by far the largest by just about any metric one might use to compare it to others. That may change though, as new cryptocurrencies emerge to fill niche markets and offer different approaches to issues of security, speed, and privacy.\nBitcoin originally started out as an attempt to build an online cash system, which are the terms used to describe it in the original whitepaper that defined its creation in 2009. Since that time, various interested parties have disagreed about that original vision, and Blockstream, the organization most in control of Bitcoin’s development, proposed that Bitcoin should be a “settlement layer”.\nUnder this paradigm, Bitcoin would not be accessed directly by end users, as Bitcoins themselves would be too valuable and expensive to move for most people. Instead, all transactions would be handled through secondary systems such as “SegWit” and “Lightning” and then be settled in aggregate on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nThis approach has been compared to how money has sometimes in the past been a secondary system that stands in for high-value assets like gold. People transact in cash, and then banks collectively settle large groups of transactions by trading between themselves in gold.\nA large community of people want Bitcoin to operate in a similar fashion, partly because they believe that high fees for transacting Bitcoin is critical for incentivizing miners to keep the network running. Bitcoin’s blockchain is mined on dedicated computers known as an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC.

BOOST: Wall Street TITAN Goldman Sachs gives ‘BACKING’ to cryptocurrency\nGoldman Sachs is to become the first regulated financial institution to offer its clients to trade Bitcoin futures via one of its New York desks.\nThe company is making the foray into the crypto futures market after pressure mounted on the bank from clients singing the praises of virtual currencies.\nCryptocurrency analyst Matthew Newton said the move was not a “huge surprise” given the vast amount of attention given to virtual money in the last year and a half.\nHe said: “This shouldn’t come as a huge surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to cryptocurrencies over the last 18 months.\n“Any forward-looking financial institution needs to understand this technology and accept its enormous potential.”\nAlthough the bank will offer a trading desk for Bitcoin, it will only offer the service in a limited capability initially.\nBut Mr Newton said although the move could be a positive sign for the future of Bitcoin, because the bank is not yet buying or selling coins there is still some “scepticism” about crypto.\nHe went on: “Despite some initial posturing, the reality is most big banks have already invested significant amounts in research and development into blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies themselves.\n“It will still take time for institutional investors to fully come around – and the fact that Goldman won’t be buying or selling actual coins suggest some scepticism remains – but there’s a growing acceptance that these assets are here to stay.”\nThe initiative from the bank will be led by its “digital assets” trader Justin Schmidt – Bitcoin futures will be traded with Goldman Sachs’ own funds on behalf of its clients.\nDespite the renowned bank making its first foray into the crypto space, Barclays CEO Jes Staley recently said virtual markets are a “real challenge” and expressed doubts over security.\nHe explained: “Cryptocurrency is a real challenge for us because, on the one hand, there is the innovative side of it wanting to stay in the forefront of technology’s improvement in finance.\n“On the other side of it, there is the possibility of cryptocurrencies being used for activities that the bank wants no part of.”\nBitcoin is trading at $8,688.86 at the time of writing – the move from Goldman Sachs could increase investor confidence and bump up prices.\nIn the last month the cryptocurrency has seen its value rise by 8.2 per cent.\nThis marks a whopping rise of $658.64 to its price.\nBut Bitcoin has seen rapid declines and price spikes because of the monstrous volatility of the crypto space, making investment a high-risk venture.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Plans For 'Physical Delivery' Of Bitcoin Pave Way For Major Crypto Adoption [ link to www.zerohedge.com (secure) ] Analysts Dominic Chu and Bryan Kelly weighed in on recent reports that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) plans to offer Bitcoin (BTC) swap contracts, on CNBC Tuesday, May 8. Both Chu and Kelly argued that the fact that these contracts would be settled with the delivery of BTC itself is an important factor in Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption.Both commentators were unanimous in considering that the plans of NYSE’s parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) - news of which comes from “multiple reports citing sources familiar,” if true, could be of momentous consequence for the future of crypto.Whereas the futures contracts currently being offered on CME and CBOE are ultimately settled in fiat, Kelly emphasized that ICE’s suggestion that crypto swap contracts will be settled in BTC is a significant milestone that could herald major Wall Street crypto adoption. Kelly explained:“[The] physical delivery of Bitcoin…means that ICE has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets? These are generally bearer instruments…and so you have to have a third-party custody person. That’s the big deal, they have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders.”Cold storage custodian solutions are currently offered by small operators, and ICE has not confirmed whether it plans to build an in-house cold storage solution or to outsource it. Indeed, ICE has so far declined to comment on the reports at all.Kelly said that if ICE can offer a custodian solution that is SEC-qualified and fits with the SEC’s compliance requirements, this would “open the floodgates” to institutional capital, resulting in some “big price moves” in the crypto markets.A custody solution would also open the door for pensions and endowments, he said, leading him to conclude that cryptocurrencies now “look to be becoming an emergent asset class…most obviously at the expense of gold.”Kelly noted that the markets have been slow to respond, suggesting that many are underestimating the significance of the news.ICE’s plans come just days after investment banking giant Goldman Sachs announced it will be opening a crypto trading desk “within weeks,” as well as recently hiring a cryptocurrency trader as vice president of their digital asset markets. This week, BTC stopped short of breaking the $10,000 resistance, trading around $8.600 currently...

The last fork that took place was in November 2017.\nWhat Is A Fork?\nActually there are two types of forks – “hard forks” and “soft forks”. A hard fork is when a single crypto currency splits in two. It occurs when a crypto currency’s existing blockchain diverges into two potential paths forward — either with regard to a network’s transaction history or a new rule in deciding what makes a transaction valid. So when you own one form of crypto currency and another form is now being created as a result of a hard fork you should now become the hold of two forms of crypto currency. Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork. A soft fork essentially follows some same variation in the blockchain; however, only one blockchain (and thus one coin) will remain valid as users adopt the update. So under a soft fork you still only hold one form of crypto currency. Segwit was a soft fork.\nWhat Is An Airdrop?\nAn airdrop occurs when a crypto currency is distributed to the community for free. This is usually done in connection with new offerings of a crypto currency to spread awareness to future investors. You don’t need to be a current owner of the crypto currency but you do need to be in the community to receive whatever crypto currency is being distributed. The community could developed from investors who were included in other crypto currency blockchains or even lists developed from social media. Byteball, Stellar Lumens and OmiseGo started out as airdrops.\nTaxation Of Crypto Currency\nCrypto currency transactions are apparently wildly taxable – far more so than investors may think. Although the IRS has not issued much formal guidance, the position of IRS is that any transaction involving virtual currency can trigger a taxable event including air drops and fork transaction as well as conversions or trades from one virtual currency to another virtual currency.\nThe IRS in 2014 issued Notice 2014-21 stating that it treats crypto currency as property for tax purposes. Therefore, selling, spending and even exchanging crypto for other tokens all likely have capital gain implications. Likewise, receiving it as compensation or by other means will be ordinary income.\nSome would think that if bitcoin is property, trades should be tax deferred under the like-kind changes rues of IRC Sec. 1031. Under that theory someone who owned Bitcoin could diversify their holdings into Ethereum or Litecoin, and plausibly tell the IRS it created no tax obligations. Unfortunately, the new Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 does away with that loophole making it clear that “like kind exchanges” which lets people swap an asset for a similar one without triggering a tax obligation are not available for non-real estate assets.\nWhile bitcoin receives most of the attention these days, it is only one of hundreds of crypto currencies. Everything discussed with regard to bitcoin taxation applies to all crypto currencies.\nHere are the basic tax rules followed by IRS on specific crypto currency transactions: Trading crypto currencies produces capital gains or losses, with the latter being able to offset gains and reduce tax. Exchanging one crypto currency for another — for example, using Ethereum to purchase an altcoin — creates a taxable event. The token is treated as being sold, thus generating capital gains or losses. Receiving payments in crypto currency in exchange for products or services or as salary is treated as ordinary income at the fair market value of the coin at the time of receipt. Spending crypto currency is a tax event and may generate capital gains or losses, which can be short-term or long-term. For example, say you bought one coin for $500. If that coin was then worth $700 and you bought a $700 gift card, there is a $200 taxable gain. Depending on the holding period, it could be a short- or long-term capital gain subject to different rates. Converting a crypto currency to U.S. dollars or another currency at a gain is a taxable event, as it is treated as being sold, thus generating capital gains. Air drops are considered ordinary income on the day of the air drop. That value will become the basis of the coin. When it’s sold, exchanged, etc., there will be a capital gain. Mining crypto currency is considered ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the coin the day it was successfully mined. Initial coin offerings including certain forks do not fall under the IRS’s tax-free treatment for raising capital. Thus, they produce ordinary income to individuals and businesses alike.\nGiven the limited guidance by IRS, there are still tax positions that can be advocated or structured so that taxpayers dealing with crypto currency can defer gains and minimize taxes. That is why it is essential you seek qualified tax counsel.\nPenalties For Filing A False Income Tax Return Or Under-reporting Income\nFailure to report all the money you make is a main reason folks end up facing an IRS auditor. Carelessness on your tax return might get you whacked with a 20% penalty. But that’s nothing compared to the 75% civil penalty for willful tax fraud and possibly facing criminal charges of tax evasion that if convicted could land you in jail.\nCriminal Fraud – The law defines that any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax under the Internal Revenue Code or the payment thereof is, in addition to other penalties provided by law, guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, can be fined not more than $100,000 ($500,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution (Code Sec. 7201).\nThe term “willfully” has been interpreted to require a specific intent to violate the law (U.S. v. Pomponio, 429 U.S. 10 (1976)). The term “willfulness” is defined as the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty (Cheek v. U.S., 498 U.S. 192 (1991)).\nAnd even if the IRS is not looking to put you in jail, they will be looking to hit you with a big tax bill with hefty penalties.\nCivil Fraud – Normally the IRS will impose a negligence penalty of 20% of the underpayment of tax (Code Sec. 6662(b)(1) and 6662(b)(2)) but violations of the Internal Revenue Code with the intent to evade income taxes may result in a civil fraud penalty. In lieu of the 20% negligence penalty, the civil fraud penalty is 75% of the underpayment of tax (Code Sec. 6663). The imposition of the Civil Fraud Penalty essentially doubles your liability to the IRS!\nWhat Should You Do?\nThe IRS has not yet announced a specific tax amnesty for people who failed to report their gains and income from Bitcoin and other virtual currencies but under the existing Voluntary Disclosure Program, non-compliant taxpayers can come forward to avoid criminal prosecution and negotiate lower penalties.\nWith only several hundred people reporting their crypto gains each year since bitcoin’s launch, the IRS suspects that many crypto users have been evading taxes by not reporting crypto transactions on their tax returns.\nAnd now that like – exchange treatment is prohibited on non-real estate transactions that occur after 2017, now is the ideal time to be proactive and come forward with voluntary disclosure to lock in your deferred gains through 2017, eliminate your risk for criminal prosecution, and minimize your civil penalties. Don’t delay because once the IRS has targeted you for investigation – even if it is a routine random audit – it will be too late voluntarily come forward. Let the tax attorneys at County (Irvine), San Francisco Bay Area (including San Jose and Walnut Creek) and offices elsewhere in California get you qualified into a voluntary disclosure program to avoid criminal prosecution, seek abatement of penalties, and minimize your tax liability.

As of now the price is growing in a gradual manner with more and more corporate firms showing interest towards the adoption of bitcoin and creation of blockchain for their own necessity. In this regard growth is assured to take place longer.\nThere is no need to worry about the future prices of bitcoin because we all know that this coins has never made its supporters regret their decisions of getting involved with it. I believe that we need to simply support bitcoin in order to be the most successful investors by the end of the day. No need to sell off bitcoin at the moment because the prices will skyrocket by the end.\nIncreased support and never panic are steps to maintain bitcoin price developments. As long as we believe we will get a satisfactory condition.

A recovery attempted on weekend, failed to get the digital currency No.1 above $9,000 threshold. BTC/USD is trading at $8,346 at the time of writing, off the Asian high of $8,712. The coin has lost 4.5% since the start of the day and reversed all Sunday and Saturday gains.\nMeanwhile, crypto enthusiasts are flocking to New York for one of the largest crypto event of the year – CoinDesk's Consensus conference. Fundstrat's managing director and technical strategist Robert Sluymer expect that the event will serve as a good bullish trigger for Bitcoin and other coins, dispelling pessimism about regulatory risks.\n\"The regulatory risk, the fundamental risk around what's happening with cryptos has hit a bottom and now we're in a state of general recovery,\" he said on CNBC's \"Fast Money\" Thursday.\nHe explained that Bitcoin increased each year after Consensus, though it remains to be seen if the market follows the tradition this year.\nBitcoin's technical picture\nOn the longer-term scale, Bitcoin is jammed between 100-DMA and 50-DMA ($8,826 and $8,263 respectively). A sustainable break in either direction will trigger a strong movement with the next upside target seen at psychological $9,000 and support at $8,000. Both levels are critical for Bitcoin, as move below $8,000 will signal that a recovery from April's low at $6,400 is over.\nBTC/USD, the daily chart", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T15:12:42.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54381d3ed740a3c306be7220567700ad9e5100aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdTz_pqHPcAQHOlrf12ECqeFOnV.Kz7S2mIDeGKITi9GOnQ2_oi5Xfe7M-", "site_full": "earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Earn Money", "title": "Did you get your Bitcoin today?", "title_full": "Did you get your Bitcoin today?", "published": "2018-05-14T08:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54381d3ed740a3c306be7220567700ad9e5100aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdTz_pqHPcAQHOlrf12ECqeFOnV.Kz7S2mIDeGKITi9GOnQ2_oi5Xfe7M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "earn money (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T08:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Did you get your Bitcoin today?", "text": "This ad is from a PRO or GOLD HERCULIST member.

Investors can then use their newly-acquired Bitcoin or Ethereum to buy Super Bitcoin using one of the aforementioned exchanges.\nnew TradingView.widget({ “height”: 400, “width”: 650, “symbol”: “SBTCUSD”, “interval”: “D”, “timezone”: “Etc/UTC”, “theme”: “White”, “style”: “1”, “locale”: “en”, “toolbar_bg”: “#f1f3f6”, “enable_publishing”: false, “hideideas”: true, “referral_id”: “2588”}); Receive News & Updates for Super Bitcoin updates for Super Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies CryptoBeat newsletter .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.marketbeat.com/cryptocurrencies/newsletter/?symbol=CURRENCY:SBTC&utm_source=MarketBeatPopup&utm_medium=MarketBeatPopup", "https://medium.com/@sbtc.org", "https://www.marketbeat.com/cryptocurrencies/super-bitcoin/", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://supersmartbitcoin.com/", "https://www.twitter.com/SuperBTC2", "https://www.marketbeat.com/newsletter/default.aspx"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joulecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sbtc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tgc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "super bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T05:08:07.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd153e886294041b38032b7bdadfde9d7947c5ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWRt0Rtux5vB5OnesJrvHkI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=180.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Haberleri", "title": "Charlie Leeden Bitcoin öldü iddialarına yanıt", "title_full": "Charlie Leeden Bitcoin öldü iddialarına yanıt", "published": "2018-05-14T08:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.087, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd153e886294041b38032b7bdadfde9d7947c5ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWRt0Rtux5vB5OnesJrvHkI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pancupan1903", "published": "2018-05-14T08:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Charlie Leeden Bitcoin öldü iddialarına yanıt", "text": "Litecoinin yaratıcısı Charlie Lee, Bitcoin öldü tartışmalarıyla ilgili olarak bir yorumda bulundu.

By Eddie Taylor Mon 14 May 2018 08:53 AM\nDubai-based cryptocurrency exchange BitOasis will no longer be processing deposits or withdrawals in dirhams from Tuesday, May 15.\nThat means anyone wanting to access the dirham balances in their account, or wanting to transfer additional dirhams into it via wire transfer, will have to initiate the order by the aforementioned date for it to be actioned.\nThe company sent out a communication to account holders in the small hours of Monday, May 14 stating that “AED wire deposits and AED wire withdrawals will be temporarily disabled”, although credit card deposits – with a discounted fee of four percent per purchase until June 16 – will still be allowed.\nBitOasis claimed the problem was down to their issuing bank and that the usual means of buying and selling of cryptocurrencies on the platform, which include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and the recently added Monero and Zcash, will remain unchanged. Withdrawals of coins into external wallets is also unaffected.\n“If you decide to leave your fiat balances the only way for you to withdraw your funds at any time after May 15th would be to convert it to cryptocurrency and send it to an external wallet,” the statement continued.\n“If you choose to keep your AED fiat balances after May 15th, currently we do not have any date on when we will be reactivating AED fiat withdrawals, but we are hard at work to provide our customers with this service.”\nBitOasis was founded by Jordanian entrepreneur Ola Dudin back in 2014 and currently operates in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\nIn January, 2018, the bank also suspended withdrawals to Emirates NBD, Noor Bank and Mashreq bank account holders.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitoasis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie taylor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T11:58:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d4314350d1b73f6380983dd0d469399e5b6ff63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYL_DMxByXzYD87CwToTdKg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Investing in Bitcoin?

Memproses daya untuk menebak solusinya dikenal sebagai hash power, yang diperkirakan Fundstrat akan tumbuh 350 persen hingga tahun 2019.\nKami percaya bahwa jalur pertumbuhan hash power saat ini mendukung harga BTC sekitar $ 36.000 pada akhir tahun 2019, dengan kisaran $ 20.000- $ 64.000, Sam Doctor, kepala penelitian ilmu data di Fundstrat, mengatakan dalam sebuah laporan.\nBitcoin diperdagangkan mendekati level $ 9.300 dalam perdagangan pada hari Kamis (10/5). Sementara di tahun lalu, bitcoin melonjak dari level dibawah $ 1.000 hingga ke atas level $ 19.000, karena besarnya minat investor terhadap mata uang virtual tersebut. Namun, kekhawatiran tentang tindakan keras regulasi telah membantu mengirim harga lebih rendah sepanjang tahun ini.\nNamun, ekonomi pertambangan bitcoin kemungkinan menciptakan tingkat dukungan untuk cryptocurrency. Penambang bitcoin lebih cenderung memegang bitcoin karena harganya jatuh ke titik impas untuk biaya operasi, dan menjual ketika harganya naik, yang mengarah ke keuntungan yang lebih besar. Hal tersebut dikarenakan penjual bersih utama adalah penambang bitcoin, dan sisanya adalah transaksi antar investor.\nPenambangan cryptocurrency tergantung pada faktor-faktor seperti biaya listrik, peralatan pendingin dan perangkat keras khusus, yang dikenal sebagai rig.\nPada 6 Mei, Fundstrat memperkirakan harga cash break-even untuk model lama Antminer S7 adalah $ 6.003 per bitcoin, dan $ 2,368 untuk Antminer S9 yang lebih baru.

TALLINN, Estonia - May 14,\nDecentralization is the basis for blockchain technologies. Decentralization ensures the security, transparency and integrity of all transactions in the network. But are the popular cryptocurrency exchanges really decentralized, and safe? Most DEX’s are not able to accept BTC without using an unreliable gateway between the two blockchains.\nExploring the Token Swap Ecosystem\nThere are several different types of DEX (Decentralised Exchange) such as pseudo-decentralized, working in the Ethereum network only; for example, projects that link blockchains to each other using their own tokens, and decentralized exchanges that use “Hashed Timelock Contracts”.\nEarlier, it was common knowledge that a crypto exchange that did not store user keys, was decentralized and therefore safe. However, most of these exchanges are built on a single blockchain, which makes them vulnerable – in order to get funds from the Bitcoin network to such a crypto exchange; for example, one needs to use a gateway, which takes Bitcoin and produces a “holding” kind of Bitcoins in another network in return. A similar principle lies with Ethereum-based exchanges, for example, EtherDelta.\nSecurity: Paramount\nDevotees of centralization believe that storing private keys on a secure server is safer than storing encrypted keys in the user’s browser. However, if a central server is hacked, everything will be stolen (as it was with a million Bitcoins), and paranoids can remove signing of transactions from the browser into the application on the computer and encrypt it.\nSince all code is executed in the user’s browser, the greatest risk is the intrusion of extraneous scripts into the code. It is likely to be made by the extensions the user installed in the browser, or by a hosting provider.\nTo prevent such attacks, Swap.Online will use cloudflare.com together with Workers, a solution that, in response to any request to the domain, sends a “Content Security Policy” header with the hash of the JS code allowed for execution in the user’s browser. Thus, server hacking and most attacks based on the introduction of malicious code will be eliminated. To understand how this works, see the video of the system operation below, or try to make an exchange yourself at https://alpha.swap.online .\nThe Swap Online Platform\nBy using Bitcoin.js, web3.js, and the libp2p library in IPFS, Swap.Online created a cross-blockchain swap system directly in the browser. The full details of the system can be found below: The solution operates on an average 2 to 10 times faster than the existing stock exchanges (taking into account the time to deposit and withdraw funds). On average, the exchange takes 2 to 3 minutes. Swap Online does not store secret user keys. Moreover, even messages between users do not pass through our servers (we use IPFS ). The exchange works right in the browser – users do not need to download or install anything. The platform already works between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, with Tether, and Lightning Network planned. Theoretically, Swap Online is able to work with most cryptocurrencies, except for those where there is no scripting language.

Xapo, the “Fort Knox of Bitcoin,” has raised $40 million from big name VC’s like Benchmark, Greylock Partners, Index Ventures, Fortress Investment Group, and more.\nLawrence Summers, a former Secretary of the Treasury is listed as an advisor. Xapo claims to have developed a new standard in bitcoin security that protects assets with “even a mountain to keep your money safe.” And they are not kidding.\nThe report says Xapo has a “network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.” The “three layers” of security are not just technical but very much bomb proof physical. Apparently the profound security has paid off as Xapo, “has more “deposits” than 98 percent” of the more than 5000 banks in the US.\nRyan Radloff of CoinShares states; “Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.” Xapo also caters to institutions by providing financial firms a management platform to handle BTC investments. Xapo views institutions a promising vehicle for growth.\nXapo believes Bitcoin is the one digital currency to rule them all. The company is betting that widespread adoption by consumers globally will eventually bring stability, and significant appreciation to the worlds most popular crypto.

The data provided was current at the time of publication. For current information regarding any of the funds mentioned in these presentations, please visit the appropriate fund performance page.\nMay 14, 2018\nLast week I had the opportunity to sit down with Marco Streng, the wunderkind bitcoin visionary behind Genesis Mining. Genesis, as many of you reading this might know, is the world’s largest cloud bitcoin mining company, with over 2 million customers worldwide. It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm.\nThis week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation.\nTell us how you got started in this industry.\nI’ve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin—it progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it.\nHow would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It’s a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.\nThe conventional banking system really shows its limitations when we try to move money between developed and underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa. There are some serious inefficiencies that, frankly, many of the big banks just aren’t interested in fixing. But with bitcoin, you don’t have to worry about that. You can send money to, say, a coffee farmer in Africa, and he’ll receive it directly.\nMoney transfers are only one among a number of many other uses. Bitcoin is also a store of value. It’s one of the few assets that I would say are uncorrelated to the broader financial markets.\nAs for blockchain, it has innumerable world-changing applications across a wide range of industries. That’s why I believe it’s crucial that people have the right information about blockchain and understand it. If people don’t understand it, and it gets overhyped, I’m afraid it could start going in the wrong direction.\nWe recently mined the 17 millionth bitcoin, leaving only four million left. Explain why it becomes exponentially more difficult to mine coins the closer we get to that 21 million-coin ceiling.\nIt’s not that the mining itself becomes more difficult. To answer this, I think we have to look at two components.\nOne component is the daily supply of bitcoin. At the moment, only 1,800 bitcoins can be generated every day by the whole network, meaning all the miners worldwide. But it’s important to remember that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined, the rewards are halved. What this means is that after the next halving, which I believe is expected sometime in 2020, the number of bitcoins mined a day will fall from 1,800 to 900. And then after the next halving, it’ll be 450. This helps reduce the supply in a natural way.\nclick to enlarge\nThe second component is a measure of how many miners and how much computing power is in the network. If more miners come online, then of course the competition becomes greater. Because the daily supply is already fixed, your market share shrinks.\nclick to enlarge\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank holmes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco streng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "genesis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hive blockchain technologies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T02:08:09.009+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32210, "moreResultsAvailable": 4710, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=27500", "requestsLeft": 387}
