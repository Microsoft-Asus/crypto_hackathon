What is really unique about AML Bitcoin is the integration of checks and balances into the block chain itself for identity verification and theft protection. Essentially, every transaction made on this block chain platform is traceable, and that is exactly what you need for full compliance with government regulation worldwide. Essentially, you cannot use AML Bitcoin in the dark market like other cryptos available. Recently, the National Aten Coin (NAC) Foundation, the owner and creator of AML Bitcoin received US Copyright, European Patent and Australian Patent on the Systems and Methods for Providing Block Chain-Based Multifactor Personal Idendtity. I am showing below the EU patent information. https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&NR=2017279801A1&KC=A1&FT=D Also to gain more in depth background about the unique feature of AML Bitcoin, please read the following article. As of right now, there is no AML Bitcoin yet, there are AML Tokens. These AML Tokens became recently tradeable, but unfortunately not on credible exchanges especially for US customers. I am hoping that the company will get into more credible exchanges such as HitBTC as they promised and even CoinBase if possible. That would be a tremendous achievement. I am hoping that they can do that before the conversion of tokens to a Crypto currency ABTC.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&NR=2017279801A1&KC=A1&FT=D"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "aml", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nac) foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national aten coin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aml tokens", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T21:35:38.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77dbe18270d371164df37874ef7bc663b736f8ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTmoZXdhX3X37OkC2xePMTE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is it the best time to buy cheaper crypto while Bitcoin is at high price?", "title_full": "Is it the best time to buy cheaper crypto while Bitcoin is at high price?", "published": "2018-06-03T16:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77dbe18270d371164df37874ef7bc663b736f8ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTmoZXdhX3X37OkC2xePMTE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sexie", "published": "2018-06-03T16:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is it the best time to buy cheaper crypto while Bitcoin is at high price?", "text": "So many crypto currencies are coming UP .

The new policy, which comes into effect this month, follows similar bans from Facebook and Twitter. Google announced the ban in a blogpost in March, stating: “Ads for the following will no longer be allowed to serve … Cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice.” Both Google and Facebook have recently revealed their interest in cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology, leading to speculation that the advert ban is not solely motivated by a desire to confront criminality. “I understand that Facebook and Google are under a lot of pressure to regulate what their users are reading, but they are still advertising gambling websites and other unethical practices,” Phillip Nunn, CEO of Manchester-based investment firm Blackmore Group, told The Independent . “I suspect the ban has been implemented to fit in with potential plans to introduce their own cryptocurrency to the market in the near future and therefore removing other crypto adverts allows them to do it on their own terms.” In May, Google reportedly approached the founder of ethereum – the world’s second most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation – in the hope of potentially securing his services. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on either the ban or speculation surrounding its cryptocurrency and blockchain ambitions, however a spokesperson told Business Insider in March that it was looking into the technology. “Like many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential use of blockchain, but it’s too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans,” the spokesperson said.

Adverts for bitcoin, litecoin, ripple, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies will be banned on Google platforms from this month (Getty) More Story Continues The blanket ban by Google is self-imposed and follows a pattern of large tech platforms pre-empting regulatory bodies by policing their own platforms. As cryptocurrencies have become more popular, scammers are increasingly using Facebook and Google to promote shady cryptocurrencies and exchanges and defraud customers. Recent research into initial coin offerings (ICO) – the process of selling units of a cryptocurrency ahead of its launch – found that as many as 80 per cent of ICOs were fraudulent. Clamping down specifically on these types of adverts is seen as a positive thing, as the proliferation of these adverts hurts the perception of the space in general. However, the nature of the ban is seen as unfairly targeting this emerging industry. “Unfortunately, the fact that this ban is a blanket ban will mean that legitimate cryptocurrency businesses which provide valuable services to users will be unfairly caught in the crossfire,” Ed Cooper, head of mobile at digital banking startup Revolut, told The Independent . “A more targeted approach would definitely be preferable: it would seem heavy handed for example to put a blanket ban on all ads for job postings, anti-virus software or charities just because ads for these products and service are also sometimes used as an entry point by scammers to target consumers.” ​ Gareth Malna, a fintech solicitor at the UK law firm Burges Salmon, goes as far as to suggest that Google’s ban contradicts the very purpose of the world’s largest search engine. “The decision by Google to act as a quasi-regulator in this context is a potentially troubling development given its vast commercial power,” Mr Malna said. “​For Google to step in and block that market may sound like consumer protection, but is potentially overstepping its perceived role as gatekeeper to information.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-cryptocurrency-launch-bitcoin-blockchain-david-marcus-a8343261.html&quot;", "http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-clouds-blockchain-experiment-could-upend-cloud-computing-2018-3", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-ethereum-cryptocurrency-vitalik-buterin-a8362066.html", "https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/7648803?hl=en&ref_topic=29265", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/telegram-ico-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ton-a8334551.html&quot;", "https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/7648803?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=29265&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/telegram-ico-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ton-a8334551.html", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-ethereum-cryptocurrency-vitalik-buterin-a8362066.html&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-cryptocurrency-launch-bitcoin-blockchain-david-marcus-a8343261.html", "http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-clouds-blockchain-experiment-could-upend-cloud-computing-2018-3&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anth", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "getty more google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuthbertson google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T16:35:28.055+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9935d5dd6840dd99d19348a05bb322ea4238034", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfiF_XycCS.x3OvoWGLNPuEqcLTv7N5SDIHyvxF4fjDF2N1O9zrcFs0xmjwUztWpfXaoW.64LuCnHUFwnz8ow8iqM6bdcGUteDeFIAPz9mkrz4savtySjZPLekD6M3DPQ0guuLzCBGM4eodrsmkg5T6CE.UgIz2QYLTzZpG0Vofg--", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent", "title": "Google bitcoin ban: New policy on cryptocurrency is &apos;heavy-handed&apos; and &apos;unethical&apos;, say experts", "title_full": "Google bitcoin ban: New policy on cryptocurrency is &apos;heavy-handed&apos; and &apos;unethical&apos;, say experts", "published": "2018-06-03T16:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/30/18/gettyimages-951165770.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9935d5dd6840dd99d19348a05bb322ea4238034", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfiF_XycCS.x3OvoWGLNPuEqcLTv7N5SDIHyvxF4fjDF2N1O9zrcFs0xmjwUztWpfXaoW.64LuCnHUFwnz8ow8iqM6bdcGUteDeFIAPz9mkrz4savtySjZPLekD6M3DPQ0guuLzCBGM4eodrsmkg5T6CE.UgIz2QYLTzZpG0Vofg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anthony Cuthbertson", "published": "2018-06-03T16:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google bitcoin ban: New policy on cryptocurrency is &apos;heavy-handed&apos; and &apos;unethical&apos;, say experts", "text": "Click to followThe Independent Tech\nGoogle’s decision to ban all bitcoin and cryptocurrency adverts on its platforms is ill-thought-out and potentially even unethical, according to industry experts.\nThe new policy, which comes into effect this month, follows similar bans from Facebook and Twitter. Google announced the ban in a blogpost in March, stating: “Ads for the following will no longer be allowed to serve … Cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice.” Both Google and Facebook have recently revealed their interest in cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology, leading to speculation that the advert ban is not solely motivated by a desire to confront criminality. “I understand that Facebook and Google are under a lot of pressure to regulate what their users are reading, but they are still advertising gambling websites and other unethical practices,” Phillip Nunn, CEO of Manchester-based investment firm Blackmore Group, told The Independent . “I suspect the ban has been implemented to fit in with potential plans to introduce their own cryptocurrency to the market in the near future and therefore removing other crypto adverts allows them to do it on their own terms.” In May, Google reportedly approached the founder of ethereum – the world’s second most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation – in the hope of potentially securing his services. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on either the ban or speculation surrounding its cryptocurrency and blockchain ambitions, however a spokesperson told Business Insider in March that it was looking into the technology. “Like many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential use of blockchain, but it’s too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans,” the spokesperson said.

Robert Sluymer, Managing Director and Technical Strategist at Fundstrat seems to be joining the company’s growing group of cryptocurrency bulls. Promising Signs for Bitcoin?\nOn CNBC’s “Futures Now” segment , Sluymer stated:\n“We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here.”\nSluymer also noted that he has a three-phase technical analysis process that allows him to try to predict future price movements of cryptocurrencies. The first phase, which is the deceleration or bottoming out of momentum indicators, may be just starting.\nSluymer pointed out that the first phase seems to be in effect when he said:\n“While it is premature to conclude the correction is over, there was a positive technical development this week suggesting the first stage of a three-stage bottoming process is developing. Short-term momentum indicators are beginning to bottom.”\nFor the past week, Bitcoin has been hovering around the low to mid $7000s, in a low volatility state, as shown by the bottom most indicator in the chart below.\nVolatility has become a key characteristic often attributed with the price of cryptocurrencies and seeing a slowdown in volatility might leave some market players in a confused state. I personally would attribute this decrease in relative volatility to the increased institutional involvement in the industry.\nHowever, take volatility with a grain of salt in this case, as volatility levels we are currently residing at were seen just before the crypto boom of 2017.\nBut some have begun to believe that this is a promising sign, as they believe that Bitcoin is consolidating before the eventual retesting of ATHs. $6500 Triple Bottom. Is it Possible?\nHowever, Bitcoin is still over $1000 away from 2018’s low, which amounted to around $6500 back in early April. The low in April was actually a double-bottom, with Bitcoin reaching similar price levels back in February after December’s $20,000 Bitcoin. This has led some analysts who are more critical of Bitcoin’s price, to think that a triple-bottom could occur in the future. However, even if Bitcoin was to revisit those prices levels, past indicators show that there is a large amount of support at $6500.\nDespite fears of a triple-bottom at $6500, the relative strength indicator (RSI) has been trending upwards (as seen by the chart above), finding a bottom of around 30 earlier this week. This RSI indicator, which is still located in the ‘oversold’ zone, may show that Bitcoin is prepared for upwards price action.\nOver the course of this year’s price drops to $6500, RSI indicators often went as low as 30, with run-ups in price and positive indicators quickly following the aforementioned price drops. If historical values and patterns are of any merit, as they often are, this means that we could see a rapid Bitcoin run-up in the near future.\nHowever, Sluymer believes that before that Bitcoin breaking past $7800 will have to be a precursor to the run-up which many have been waiting for.\nDespite the potential for Bitcoin’s short-term success, Sluymer believes that the largest cryptocurrency may lose some dominance as some players like EOS and Tron (TRX) may outperform Bitcoin in the near future. He also mentioned that other cryptocurrencies residing in the top-40, such as IOTA, 0x, and WaltonChain have shown that they may also begin to encroach on Bitcoin’s 38% market share.\nBut Sluymer made it clear that he is still adamant about his belief that Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, will begin to see some upward price action very shortly.\nHe put it best when he said:\n“If you’re short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.”\nCharts from Tradingview.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/bitcoin-finds-a-bottom-after-plunging-from-highs-technician.html", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/03/asian-cryptocurrency-trading-update-eos-lifts-off-on-successful-mainnet-launch/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "recovery very soon fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T16:30:08.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52178f0484f8c807b017299ebf59aac3311b1277", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNpZyINmpylEhCxut8YyyvUE0QncbBysifGTTKv4YwenwUAUdHGrZLEiu7FW0d2bWbXkaCaavtjW_MVJiylI8.d3ZuKfzQIyGX", "site_full": "redliontrader.com", "site": "redliontrader.com", "site_section": "https://redliontrader.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RedlionTrader", "title": "Bitcoin Price Sets Sights On $8,000 As Investors Watch For ‘Buy’ Signal", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Sets Sights On $8,000 As Investors Watch For ‘Buy’ Signal", "published": "2018-06-03T16:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "52178f0484f8c807b017299ebf59aac3311b1277", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNpZyINmpylEhCxut8YyyvUE0QncbBysifGTTKv4YwenwUAUdHGrZLEiu7FW0d2bWbXkaCaavtjW_MVJiylI8.d3ZuKfzQIyGX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MrTopStep", "published": "2018-06-03T16:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Sets Sights On $8,000 As Investors Watch For ‘Buy’ Signal", "text": "Bitcoin Price Sets Sights On $8,000 As Investors Watch For ‘Buy’ Signal Posted By: MrTopStep June 3, 2018\nOn June 3, the price of Bitcoin broke through ten-day highs to once again challenge $8,000 — as multiple investors eye fresh ‘buy’ signals.

Moreover, more and more analysts are pointing to some financial crisis after another as each day goes by. Whether it is because of the cessation of QE, or because of the issues in Italy, or trade wars, etc., we are clearly not lacking for any reasons as to why this market should crash.\nThe problem is that most bubble-callers have no objective perspective through which they can determine that any market is in a bubble. As an example, one article I recently read suggests we are in a bubble in the Nasdaq because we have exceeded the 2000 bubble high in the market. Well, along those lines, maybe the Dow should not have exceeded the “bubble high” it struck in 1929!?\nNow, I want to highlight the ultimate intellectual dishonesty and inconsistency in most of their thinking regarding bubbles. You see, many of these same analysts are looking for a massive rally in gold. Yet, one has to wonder why they can logically see gold rally well past its “bubble high” struck in 2011, but they are unable to accept any other market rallying beyond their “bubble highs” struck in recent history? I think one has to start viewing much of the analysis being published today as more emotionally-based rather than analytically-based.\nFor those that have followed my analysis through the years, you know that I use Elliott Wave analysis to provide me with an objective context through which I am able to analyze markets. This methodology allowed me to identify the high in gold in 2011 within $6 of the high struck, as well as buy back into the market right at the lows almost 2 years ago. This same methodology allowed us to catch the lows in the US Dollar in 2011, and called for a multi-year rally in the DXY to the 103.50 region when most everyone else at the time was looking for a dollar crash, especially when you consider all of the QE thrown at the market (another fundamental analysis failure). And, this methodology has kept us on the correct side of the equity market, as we have been looking to exceed 2600SPX for years, when most others were quite certain this bull market was going to end years ago.\nYou see, Elliott Wave analysis provides the context for viewing markets objectively, and in a non-linear fashion. So, just because one views a market as having struck a “bubble high” years ago does not mean that the market will not well exceed those highs in the future. And, the perfect example we are seeing set up like that is in the crypto-world as well.\nWhile many have told me that the fundamentals suggest that crypto’s should be closer to zero than they are today, the structure of the market suggests that we could be setting up for a major rally in 2018. And, anyone who really wants to understand the crypto market’s should be following Ryan Wilday , as he is the most accurate crypto-analyst I have seen. In fact, he nailed the bottom we struck in ETH last week, and is now providing guidelines to determine when that bottom is confirmed.\nWeekly Opportunities In Cryptocurrency: Bottom Held - Can We Go?\nSo, based upon Ryan's analysis, it does not look like it is highly likely that the crypto-bubble-callers will be correct in their assessments.\nAnd, I don’t think the bubble-callers for the stock market will fare any better. You see, the action we have seen over the last several months have been corrective, and support our expectation that the S&P500 is still pointing to 3000.\nLast weekend, I noted that once we break below 2700SPX, it will have us looking down to the 2600-2650SPX region. While I had initially thought we could see one more micro rally towards my ideal target at 2758SPX, the market only reached a high of 2742SPX, so we came up about 16 points short of my ideal target. It certainly reminds me that there is no way one can be 100% accurate when dealing with our non-linear markets.\nBut, the break down below 2700SPX still came up short of our target below as well. This now places the market in a position wherein it will likely tell us in the coming week whether the drop below 2700 has completed all the pullback we are going to see before we rally to 3000, or if we are still setting up to drop to the 2600-2650SPX region.\nAs long as we remain below the 2742/53SPX resistance, the market still retains the potential to drop down to those lower targets. However, if we rally through 2753SPX, then it certainly increases the probabilities we have begun our trek to 3000SPX in 2018.\nI want to add one more note here.

These complex computers run advanced algorithms and mathematical equations to verify transactions and keep a running ledger.\nAccording to The Balance , a mining rig can cost between $3,000 and $10,000. They also use a significant amount of power with the average energy used to mine a single bitcoin running at least $3,000 in low-cost utility markets.\nAs a result, semiconductor manufacturers are in what Cryptoslate calls a “ASIC arms race” to produce more powerful and energy efficient mining rigs. In 2017, a spike in shares of Nvidia and AMD were partly attributed to a rise in the price of Ethereum. In 2017, demand from Ethereum miners created a temporary shortage of some graphics cards and estimated additional sales from the crypto demand were estimated to be as high as $875 million, according to Bloomberg .\nEven though Bitcoin is very volatile and is trading at less than half of what it was in December, it is still an equipment-intensive industry. Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier is looking to raise up to $2 billion in an IPO, according to Bloomberg . The company sold more than 300,000 mining rigs last year alone.\nThe crypto influence on the semiconductor market has become so strong that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in April noted uncertainty over cryptocurrency mining due to lower values as one of the reasons for its weaker than expected guidance for the rest of 2018. These mining chips accounted for 4.5 percent of the manufacturer’s total revenue in the third quarter, contributed to $900 million in 2017, according to CNBC.com .\nSamsung also announced in January it has begun manufacturing ASIC chips used to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “Samsung’s foundry business is currently engaged in the manufacturing of cryptocurrency mining chips. However, we are unable to disclose further details regarding our customers,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch .\nWhile crypto mining semiconductors would pale in comparison to the company’s phone semiconductors, the entry of a big-name player into the market was considered a notable event. Intel is also set to enter the space but recently announced a delay in the production of its 10nm units until 2019.\nPatrick Moorhead, founder and president of Moor Insights & Strategy, wrote in Forbes.com that while cryptocurrency mining ASICs existed in the past, they were low volume and very expensive. The only way for prices to fall is to reduce the cost of producing the chips which are manufactured in semiconductor fabs (fabrication plants) with a mix of power, performance or price.\n“With the right fab process node at the right semiconductor fab, ASIC miner manufacturers could significantly drive down the price of ASIC mining machines, and ultimately the cost of mining for everyone,” Moorehead said.\nMany analysts have said that Bitcoin’s extreme energy consumption is its Achilles heel. Ars Technica noted that Bitcoin mining could consume 7.7 gigawatts by the end of 2018, roughly half of the world’s electricity consumption.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/19/a-global-chipmaking-giant-blames-lowered-outlook-on-bitcoin-mining.html", "https://cryptoslate.com/gmo-to-release-worlds-first-7nm-bitcoin-mining-card/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2018/05/29/how-semiconductor-manufacturers-can-drive-the-next-phase-of-cryptomining/#4ea1d94e48c4", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canaan-ipo/as-bitcoin-world-wobbles-mining-rig-company-plans-2-billion-ipo-idUSKCN1IN01X", "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/new-study-quantifies-bitcoins-ludicrous-energy-consumption/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-17/chipmakers-nvidia-amd-ride-cryptocurrency-wave-for-now", "https://www.thebalance.com/can-bitcoin-mining-make-a-profit-4157922", "https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/samsung-confirms-asic-chips/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency influence semiconductor manufacturing bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nvidia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T18:14:03.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29cd98dcd67f6e29022a3f13eb1106763f5b078f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfOFNRF6Bdv47QSgaF5pdEZ.3miRV2E6iXH91mHVlRH1uOBaJgRXsEuse3F6Tq6pn3jpRDe_uLPnBZZ5oQsFZFLoo-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Why is this subreddit deeply religious like Mormon religious extremists towards the Bitcoin whitepaper?

The country now has 46 bitcoin ATMs with 10 just being deployed in the Prague subway system. It’s probably good news then that the price of bitcoin has seemed to find a relatively stable triangle on its price volatility to encourage more real world use. But it seems that some speculators are starting to suffer from addiction to that volatility. Scotland’s largest addiction treatment facility has developed a treatment program for those investors who have maybe gone too far with their enthusiasm and just can’t stop.\nCan conventional stock markets take advantage of the concepts of Atomic Swaps that we are seeing developed in the cryptocurrency space? It’s all part of the growing trend towards decentralization of everything and removing as many middlemen as possible.\nFeatured stories by Jimmy Aki, Erik Kuebler, Giulio Prisco, Nick Marinoff and Bitcoin Schmitcoin\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs\nLocated in Prague, ATM manufacturer General Bytes has installed 10 new cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague subway. Over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway on a daily basis, making it one of the busiest metros in Europe. With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. Scotland Hospital Opens Rehab Center for Crypto-Trading Addicts\nCastle Craig Hospital — Scotland’s largest addiction treatment facility — has developed a center specifically dedicated to helping cryptocurrency addicts. Representatives explain that “cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a ‘high’ when they buy or trade a winning currency” and that “this can be exciting but also addictive and … financially disastrous.” The hospital has produced a list of 10 questions that individuals can ask themselves. If they answer “yes” to 5 or more, they likely fall into the “addict” category. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move\nAfter days of sudden, strong selling, bitcoin has managed to find a local bottom in the low $7000s where it has been drifting around aimlessly. Traders have noted that we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle. Symmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile.\nThere is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. However, it is important to note that symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside. Op Ed: How Atomic Swaps Could Work for Stock Market Trading\nIn traditional stock exchanges, retail investors in public markets are unable to switch from one position to another without first going into cash. For example, an investor looking to trade his or her Amazon shares for PayPal shares must first exchange these Amazon shares for U.S. dollars, before buying PayPal shares with these dollars.\nAtomic swaps allow direct conversion between two cryptocurrencies without having to use a third-party intermediary or exchange. By employing hash time-locked smart contracts, atomic swaps guarantee that parties will deliver the currency needed for the trade, or else the transaction is automatically canceled. These “all or nothing” trades preserve atomicity because they either take place or are canceled immediately. Advancing Toward a Decentralized Internet in the Real World\nThe recently aired Season 5 of the popular HBO comedy Silicon Valley features a decentralized internet powered by end-user devices and an internal blockchain-based crypto economy. As usual, the fictional treatment in the show, which has been rightly praised for providing an entertaining but accurate portrait of contemporary tech trends, is based on real developments. In this article, our reporter Giulio Prisco looks at some of the actual projects underway in the real-life, blockchain world.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/advancing-toward-decentralized-internet-real-world/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/crypto-go-prague-subway-gets-10-new-bitcoin-atms/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-analysis-consolidation-leans-toward-strong-bitcoin-move/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/scotland-hospital-opens-rehab-center-crypto-trading-addicts/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/", "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bitcoin-addiction-rehab-cryptocurrency-trading-castle-craig-hospital-a8373801.html", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hospital-launches-rehab-clinic-to-treat-cryptocurrency-addiction-2018-05-29", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-how-atomic-swaps-could-work-stock-market-trading/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erik kuebler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giulio prisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy aki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick marinoff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T22:11:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecda4a12df60795e724c9d23763ee8d1c80dee9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaMZLmH_yKHULZ1H0lKWLcLHTbKz.EBonBl8sBF675TZPhwMREm.meMRk8hQfWKZe7F.HtL9F4KkM-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoCurrency", "title": "Evolution on money from IMF -> bitcoin", "title_full": "Evolution on money from IMF -> bitcoin : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-03T15:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ecda4a12df60795e724c9d23763ee8d1c80dee9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaMZLmH_yKHULZ1H0lKWLcLHTbKz.EBonBl8sBF675TZPhwMREm.meMRk8hQfWKZe7F.HtL9F4KkM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mrbooly", "published": "2018-06-03T15:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Evolution on money from IMF -> bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/mrbooly\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/index.htm"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T11:17:48.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46736828a27658c59d927925270918ef9a10bd88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa4C6zlFqtcV70kvLw8zsrdosSATUc_b9LM4yK5N3Mc3Uh_zFbjFShV5olGm9dX7p8VjVA73FBtFiVnQoeIbGTgz9bhqSEgCU5", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoCurrency", "title": "Why You Shouldn't Use Cloud Mining + Bitcoin Merch Giveaway!", "title_full": "Why You Shouldn't Use Cloud Mining + Bitcoin Merch Giveaway!

highs to once again challenge $8,000 — as multiple investors eye fresh ‘buy’ signals. Brandt Watches For Sunday ‘Buy’ Chart\nData from across major exchanges showed BTC/USD move through $7,700. As of press time on Sunday, it is hovering between $7,720 and $7900.\nBitcoin’s newfound support upends a weekly downturn, which saw prices bottom out at $7,096 on May 29. A strong support at $6,900 remains untested since early April.\nSources from within the cryptocurrency industry remain hawkish on the potential for a more decisive return to form for Bitcoin — which has so far failed to regain ground lost through May, where it hit a peak of $9,922 .\nWhen analyzing charts over the weekend, veteran trader Peter Brandt suggested BTC/USD “could” produce a ‘buy’ signal by Monday — while tapering enthusiasm about the pair sustaining further support. A chart buy signal could (I said \"could,\" not \"would\") occur in $BTCUSD over the weekend. Stay tuned pic.twitter.com/GlVCtKabhb\n— Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 1, 2018 Pantera Capital Weighs In On Institutional Investor ‘Pile-In’\nEarlier in the week, more confident cues came from Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead, who once again repeated calls to buy Bitcoin .\n“All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now,” he told CNBC on May 31. “It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.”\nMorehead’s statements were made in consideration of 2018’s wider narrative on Bitcoin prices , which has seen traders weigh the possibility of institutional investors entering the cryptocurrency market en masse — which would almost assuredly boost prices significantly.\nRather than a sudden influx as some foresee, Morehead acknowledged that any further engagement would instead be a “process.” He stated:\nThere’s an image out there where there’s an ‘on-off switch’ and it’s off now and they’re going to flick it on on some particular date and institutions will pile in. […] It’s a process. Obviously, risk and reward go together; a couple of years ago there was a lot of risk but there was a lot of reward, and we’ve yet to get to the point where we have an SEC-regulated custodian which is the one silver bullet everyone’s waiting for — but many institutions are buying the rumor and selling the fact.”\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s price action this weekend?

Because if you lose, at least your obligations are all settled.\nYeah I totally agree with you, investing your money is not a bad thing but it is risky and even if it has the slightest chance of risk, this can cause you some trouble. Therefore, you should have a wise plan for using your money, like 50% for school fees and 30% for daily needs and the rest for investing, etc. But if you invest your tuition fees and it doubles and you use the profit to pay school fees then how wrong could this be?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T16:46:33.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c8065b133850d22f66da22ad2f2869314b10dbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYxCsWaKaVK0Lv3rFd3L2sd591ifZ2XGroV9GLRg.aBKEy8Kzf.vhmxgh859G_ZL4jg--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round", "title_full": "This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round", "published": "2018-06-03T15:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c8065b133850d22f66da22ad2f2869314b10dbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYxCsWaKaVK0Lv3rFd3L2sd591ifZ2XGroV9GLRg.aBKEy8Kzf.vhmxgh859G_ZL4jg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-03T15:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round", "text": "This week we saw that despite some countries being less open to cryptocurrency than we would have wanted to, this amazing innovation continues to fascinate the whole world . This was evident in stories from all over the globe that were covered in this week's daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App\nPoloniex Responds to Complaints On Monday we reported that Poloniex, the US-based cryptocurrency trading platform which was taken over by Circle earlier this year, has finally responded to complaints by its clients about frozen accounts. The company tried to reassure clients their funds were safe and that it has taken steps to increase the speed of the identity verification process. Additionally covered was the fact that the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone.\nMcAfee Warns of War on Crypto John McAfee (Photo by Gage Skidmore) The big news on Tuesday was that cybersecurity expert turned pump and dump guru John McAfee has issued another bullish prediction. Bitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicted. His prediction was in contrast with Russian analysts who expect that value of BTC will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold.\nMcAfee also also talked about \"the war we are all engaged in\", Claiming that the banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto. He advised crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. McAfee called on his followers to also write the SEC and ask \"to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.\"\nChina Fights Impersonators and Fraudsters A couple of stories that show cryptocurrency is still a hot topic in China were our focus on Wednesday . First, Chinese social media has erupted in anger this week after the use of a Mao Zedong impersonator at the Boao Blockchain Forum for Asia in Hainan province. Second, a Chinese procurator's office has reportedly prosecuted 98 people and recovered 1.7 billion yuan (about $270 million) in an alleged Onecoin pyramid scheme. Additionally covered were high market awareness in Germany, a London mosque that accepts bitcoin donations, a new green mining farm in Canada and an MMA champ's love for crypto.\nAsus Creates 20-GPU Mining Motherboard Asus H370 Mining Master On Thursday we reported that Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer Asus has created a new motherboard with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The company explains that: \"Mining is a numbers game; it's only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. \" We also reported about a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin.\nExpanding Horizons in Uganda, Bahrain and Georgia Countries not often mentioned in the news made headlines on Friday . First, Binance could be opening a new office in Uganda, CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference. \"I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,\" CZ stated. Second, Bahrain has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency due to an absence of limiting regulations and a shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in Riffa. Lastly, we reported that a luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins in Georgia.\nBlockchain on the Agenda in Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Hungary Governments all across Europe were our focus on Saturday . Lawmakers in Spain have issued a unanimous call for adopting regulations that favor the implementation of crypto and blockchain technologies. The government of Slovenia has adopted an action plan to underpin the implementation of blockchain technology in the country and create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In Estonia, officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. And in Hungary, \"The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,\" said Péter Benedek, the CEO of Blockchain Competence Center (BCC).\nThis Week in Bitcoin Podcast Catch the rest of this week's news in the This Week in Bitcoin podcast with host Matt Aaron.\nWhat other stories in the bitcoin world caught your attention this week?

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices.

Brandt Watches For Sunday ‘Buy’ Chart\nData from across major exchanges showed BTC/USD move through $7,700. As of press time on Sunday, it is hovering between $7,720 and $7900.\nBitcoin’s newfound support upends a weekly downturn, which saw prices bottom out at $7,096 on May 29. A strong support at $6,900 remains untested since early April.\nSources from within the cryptocurrency industry remain hawkish on the potential for a more decisive return to form for Bitcoin — which has so far failed to regain ground lost through May, where it hit a peak of $9,922 .\nWhen analyzing charts over the weekend, veteran trader Peter Brandt suggested BTC/USD “could” produce a ‘buy’ signal by Monday — while tapering enthusiasm about the pair sustaining further support. A chart buy signal could (I said \"could,\" not \"would\") occur in $BTCUSD over the weekend. Stay tuned pic.twitter.com/GlVCtKabhb\n— Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 1, 2018 Pantera Capital Weighs In On Institutional Investor ‘Pile-In’\nEarlier in the week, more confident cues came from Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead, who once again repeated calls to buy Bitcoin .\n“All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now,” he told CNBC on May 31. “It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.”\nMorehead’s statements were made in consideration of 2018’s wider narrative on Bitcoin prices , which has seen traders weigh the possibility of institutional investors entering the cryptocurrency market en masse — which would almost assuredly boost prices significantly.\nRather than a sudden influx as some foresee, Morehead acknowledged that any further engagement would instead be a “process.” He stated:\nThere’s an image out there where there’s an ‘on-off switch’ and it’s off now and they’re going to flick it on on some particular date and institutions will pile in. […] It’s a process. Obviously, risk and reward go together; a couple of years ago there was a lot of risk but there was a lot of reward, and we’ve yet to get to the point where we have an SEC-regulated custodian which is the one silver bullet everyone’s waiting for — but many institutions are buying the rumor and selling the fact.”\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s price action this weekend?

I only have a little understanding about the idea of currency and its value although i've already been at it all my life. Im new into this kind currency and right now its plumetting.\nExactly, bitcoin has value because people agree that bitcoin has value. and more people agree and try to have bitcoin, and the more people who believe in bitcoin, the higher the bitcoin value.

I mean a country cannot survive if individuals doesn't pay taxes,well with Bitcoin you don't pay any tax right?\nHow this gonna be possible? Please shed for me some light on this.\nThanks\nIf that happens, surely, government will also put tax on bitcoin. Every single transaction will also be taxed. Government will put regulations especially in digital assets you have.\nIn real life I think it is far from the truth. Assuming that bitcoin became universal it has advantage and disadvantage. Advantage in terms of time, it is hasslefree and less time of processing as long the internet connection is fast because it can really affect the transactions of different payments and also it can give extra income and profit while the disadvantage part is, the value is not totally stable, then there is possibility that many will be in unemployed list.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

Unlike many of the new startups creating their own blockchains, Hodl Hodl is doing these complex transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, countering the narrative that bitcoin is only good as a store of value.\nThe exchange platform debuted in March, and within weeks it garnered more than 5,300 registered users in over 30 countries, all transacting directly through either the bitcoin or litecoin blockchain by using what’s known as a multi-signature smart contract.\nHodl Hodl never touches bitcoin deposits or traditional fiat payments. Rather, it simply provides listings for people to connect, plus an interface to help users apply smart contracts directly to bitcoin.\nThose contracts rely on multisig wallets, where one key belongs to the exchange and the other to the seller. The seller’s keys are generated on the front end, in the browser, never stored on the company’s server or database.\nBecause of that setup, Hodl Hodl CTO Roman Snitko said: \"Even if the exchange is hacked, the hacker only gets access to one key, whereas the other belongs to the user and the funds cannot be moved.\"\nThis paved the way for a disparate real estate platform by the same team, called Househodl, which is set to launch in July with similar multisig contracts in lieu of the banks and lawyers who typically hold funds in escrow.\n“It’s better than dealing with banks and being unreasonably scrutinized time and again for every penny, even though your money is clean,” Snitko told CoinDesk.\nThis underscores the reasons why Snitko and CEO Max Keidun chose to work directly with the bitcoin blockchain rather than build a platform in parallel. They wanted a simple solution that didn’t require the startup to take on all the compliance responsibilities of a bank, the way some might argue exchanges like Coinbase have.\nHodl Hodl’s private key is useless by itself – a relief to traders spooked by the long history of multimillion-dollar thefts of user funds held at traditional crypto exchanges. Their verification process varies by jurisdiction, staying as hands-off as they can be within local regulations, to give users more responsibility and freedom. Unlike Coinbase, Hodl Hodl gives users their own private key.\n“No single party controls the funds on that address,” Snitko said. “That, in turn, means increased security, but also that we’re not exactly money transmitter from a regulatory point of view.”\nBy coupling compliance with decentralized security features, the Hodl Hodl team strives to show that bitcoin itself can also be leveraged for peer-to-peer business transactions. The team’s upcoming platform, Househodl, will take that idea even further by applying it directly to real estate purchases.\n“Because it’s safer,” Snitko said about why they chose bitcoin. “I do think it is the only secure, decentralized blockchain that stood the test of time.” Bitcoin’s security perks\nFirst and foremost, Hodl Hodl’s interest in bitcoin derives from its security.\nAccording to the founders, it’s much harder for intermediaries to misappropriate money frozen in this transparent, multi-sig escrow process, because no one has complete custody and all the parties involved can look at the blockchain to see what’s going on.\nAs such, multisig on a public ledger represents an upgrade to the centuries-old practice of depositing funds with a third party until a future condition is met.\nApplying this exchange’s smart contract to real estate first occurred to the Hodl Hodl team when a friend tried to sell her apartment to buy more bitcoin. The transaction took months because there were numerous bureaucratic intermediaries, from bankers to real estate agents.\nSnitko said: \"It's a whole mess that could be avoided if there was a platform for selling and buying real estate with bitcoin. That's when we realized there is a demand on both sides of the equation.\"\nThe team realized the a multisig process in Hodl Hodl’s flagship business could also offer a more transparent escrow system for buying property with bitcoin. Such transparency is lacking in traditional escrow processes, a situation often exploited by the intermediaries buyers trust the most.\nFor example, according to the New York Law Journal , the Lawyers’ Fund for Client Protection paid $10 million in 2017 to victims of lawyer misconduct that included the theft of escrow funds. In March of this year, another New York attorney was disbarred for hiding client funds in his personal escrow account, veiled behind the trappings of bank paperwork.\nEven if such conduct is rare today, the fact that it can happen suggest that there’s room for improvements that reduce reliance on trusted third parties. “I think real estate is the best use case for bitcoin payments right now,” Snitko added, “Because it’s relatively huge amounts of BTC that are being transferred so even if transaction fees go up, they would still make sense.” On-chain advantages\nUnlike the flagship exchange’s pure P2P model, Househodl contracts will require a third cryptographic key held by a neutral third party, such as a lawyer, plus more paperwork and identification than online currency swaps on Hodl Hodl.\nFunds only move if everyone cooperates, which would prevent the type of lawyer misconduct seen in New York. Yet, all of this still happens directly on the bitcoin blockchain, thanks to the exchange-tested workflow.\n“You will even be able to sign all the papers remotely on our [Househodl] platform, a one-stop-shop,” Keidun told CoinDesk.\nSeveral American real estate agents have already expressed interest in signing up for Househodl, Keidun said. But, due to the unclear regulatory landscape in the U.S., Househodl will probably launch in blockchain-friendly Dubai first, then steadily expand to Europe and North America.\nIn the meantime, new confidential trading options might give Keidun’s small startups a competitive advantage over other P2P platforms, both exchanges and blockchain startups in the real estate industry.\nMany P2P platforms broadcast all live offers to all participants, the same way CraigsList organizes listings by category.

Africa Needs Cryptocurrency\nFighting financial hardship in Africa is no easy feat. Money is difficult to come by and unemployment rates remain a big problem in most countries. As such, the continent is a big market when it comes to remittance transfers. Residents travel abroad to find work and send money back home. It has become a booming business for industry leaders such as MoneyGram and Western Union.\nEven so, these remittance providers still pose a problem. Consumers need to travel hours to pick up money and return home. Additionally, there are the relatively high fees associated with money transfers to and from Africa. The price to pay for convenience is quite steep. While remittance transfer fees have dropped over the years, there’s still a lot of room for improvements.\nThis is where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies make an impact. Their borderless nature and no intermediary involvement make for a cheap and convenient solution. Companies such as BitPesa are making big inroads in this regard. Even for them, however, major challenges remain in place at all times. Despite some setbacks, the company is still changing the world one user at a time. The Success of BitPesa\nAs one would expect, BitPesa uses Bitcoin as a means of settlement between the different brokers. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin can remove friction and offer a higher degree of liquidity across African markets. By embracing the decentralized nature of this technology, BitPesa is showing how useful Bitcoin can be in the long run.\nThe volatility of Bitcoin makes it a less favorable currency. Even so, some African currencies show more volatility compared to cryptocurrencies. BitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiello recently explained how Bitcoin can be bought and sold quickly in a time of need. As such, its volatility creates far less of a problem than most people would assume.\nBitPesa wants to help local companies by using Bitcoin. Solving the friction associated with doing business in Africa will not be easy by any means. Even so, small businesses, consumers, and even multinational can benefit from services rendered by relying on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe post A Startup Uses Bitcoin to Reduce Friction of Doing Business in Africa appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitpesa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "western union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moneygram", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa needs cryptocurrency fighting", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T02:46:42.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb7584fcaba7833cea4e5441ae799415e2ff36af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfY4LrqtSUM5BqtXQCT.XrjyBAt_Q5V2ha2gAgNw8o4lXZgClyf1lah.9OSYsPQRM4uDStWpWynkaHwR70WkAY0BoDBw5r0euyg--", "site_full": "www.coindesk.com", "site": "coindesk.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/CoinDesk", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "CoinDesk", "title": "How Hodl Hodl Is Building a Real Business With Bitcoin Smart Contracts", "title_full": "How Hodl Hodl Is Building a Real Business With Bitcoin Smart Contracts", "published": "2018-06-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-01-at-3.02.52-PM-e1527879875386.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10453, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 7}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb7584fcaba7833cea4e5441ae799415e2ff36af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfY4LrqtSUM5BqtXQCT.XrjyBAt_Q5V2ha2gAgNw8o4lXZgClyf1lah.9OSYsPQRM4uDStWpWynkaHwR70WkAY0BoDBw5r0euyg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Leigh Cuen", "published": "2018-06-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Hodl Hodl Is Building a Real Business With Bitcoin Smart Contracts", "text": "How Hodl Hodl Is Building a Real Business With Bitcoin Smart Contracts FEATURE Jun 3, 2018 at 12:00 UTC | Updated Jun 4, 2018 at 04:07 UTC\nBitcoin may be the original cryptocurrency, but it can still learn new tricks.\nIn an industry where bitcoin has taken a backseat to networks like ethereum , at least when it comes to enabling more complex and exotic transactions, both founders behind the peer-to-peer exchange platform Hodl Hodl believe people are underestimating bitcoin's potential. Unlike many of the new startups creating their own blockchains, Hodl Hodl is doing these complex transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, countering the narrative that bitcoin is only good as a store of value.\nThe exchange platform debuted in March, and within weeks it garnered more than 5,300 registered users in over 30 countries, all transacting directly through either the bitcoin or litecoin blockchain by using what's known as a multi-signature smart contract.\nHodl Hodl never touches bitcoin deposits or traditional fiat payments. Rather, it simply provides listings for people to connect, plus an interface to help users apply smart contracts directly to bitcoin.\nThose contracts rely on multisig wallets, where one key belongs to the exchange and the other to the seller. The seller's keys are generated on the front end, in the browser, never stored on the company's server or database.\nBecause of that setup, Hodl Hodl CTO Roman Snitko said:\n\"Even if the exchange is hacked, the hacker only gets access to one key, whereas the other belongs to the user and the funds cannot be moved.\"\nThis paved the way for a disparate real estate platform by the same team, called Househodl, which is set to launch in July with similar multisig contracts in lieu of the banks and lawyers who typically hold funds in escrow.\n\"It's better than dealing with banks and being unreasonably scrutinized time and again for every penny, even though your money is clean,\" Snitko told CoinDesk.\nThis underscores the reasons why Snitko and CEO Max Keidun chose to work directly with the bitcoin blockchain rather than build a platform in parallel. They wanted a simple solution that didn't require the startup to take on all the compliance responsibilities of a bank, the way some might argue exchanges like Coinbase have.\nHodl Hodl's private key is useless by itself – a relief to traders spooked by the long history of multimillion-dollar thefts of user funds held at traditional crypto exchanges. Their verification process varies by jurisdiction, staying as hands-off as they can be within local regulations, to give users more responsibility and freedom. Unlike Coinbase, Hodl Hodl gives users their own private key.\n\"No single party controls the funds on that address,\" Snitko said. \"That, in turn, means increased security, but also that we're not exactly a money transmitter from a regulatory point of view.\"\nBy coupling compliance with decentralized security features, the Hodl Hodl team strives to show that bitcoin itself can also be leveraged for peer-to-peer business transactions. The team's upcoming platform, Househodl, will take that idea even further by applying it directly to real estate purchases.\n\"Because it's safer,\" Snitko said about why they chose bitcoin. \"I do think it is the only secure, decentralized blockchain that stood the test of time.\" Bitcoin's security perks\nFirst and foremost, Hodl Hodl's interest in bitcoin derives from its security.\nAccording to the founders, it's much harder for intermediaries to misappropriate money frozen in this transparent, multi-sig escrow process, because no one has complete custody and all the parties involved can look at the blockchain to see what's going on.\nAs such, multisig on a public ledger represents an upgrade to the centuries-old practice of depositing funds with a third party until a future condition is met.\nApplying this exchange's smart contract to real estate first occurred to the Hodl Hodl team when a friend tried to sell her apartment to buy more bitcoin. The transaction took months because there were numerous bureaucratic intermediaries, from bankers to real estate agents.\nSnitko said:\n\"It's a whole mess that could be avoided if there was a platform for selling and buying real estate with bitcoin. That's when we realized there is a demand on both sides of the equation.\"\nThe team realized the a multisig process in Hodl Hodl's flagship business could also offer a more transparent escrow system for buying property with bitcoin. Such transparency is lacking in traditional escrow processes, a situation often exploited by the intermediaries buyers trust the most.\nFor example, according to the New York Law Journal , the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection paid $10 million in 2017 to victims of lawyer misconduct that included the theft of escrow funds. In March of this year, another New York attorney was disbarred for hiding client funds in his personal escrow account, veiled behind the trappings of bank paperwork.\nEven if such conduct is rare today, the fact that it can happen suggest that there's room for improvements that reduce reliance on trusted third parties. \"I think real estate is the best use case for bitcoin payments right now,\" Snitko added, \"Because it's relatively huge amounts of BTC that are being transferred so even if transaction fees go up, they would still make sense.\" On-chain advantages\nUnlike the flagship exchange's pure P2P model, Househodl contracts will require a third cryptographic key held by a neutral third party, such as a lawyer, plus more paperwork and identification than online currency swaps on Hodl Hodl.\nFunds only move if everyone cooperates, which would prevent the type of lawyer misconduct seen in New York. Yet, all of this still happens directly on the bitcoin blockchain, thanks to the exchange-tested workflow.\n\"You will even be able to sign all the papers remotely on our [Househodl] platform, a one-stop-shop,\" Keidun told CoinDesk.\nSeveral American real estate agents have already expressed interest in signing up for Househodl, Keidun said. But, due to the unclear regulatory landscape in the U.S., Househodl will probably launch in blockchain-friendly Dubai first, then steadily expand to Europe and North America.\nIn the meantime, new confidential trading options might give Keidun's small startups a competitive advantage over other P2P platforms, both exchanges and blockchain startups in the real estate industry.\nMany P2P platforms broadcast all live offers to all participants, the same way CraigsList organizes listings by category. So Hodl Hodl allows private offers, which are only visible if the seller sends a direct link to the buyer, or vice versa. This is one advantage Hodl Hodl has over its competitors. And the users don't even need to sacrifice transparency for privacy, since the transactions are still on-chain, it's just that they aren't broadcasting the details a stranger would need to find them.\nIn addition, neither Hodl platform requires the user to cash out, the way incumbent P2P exchange LocalBitco ins does. Yet again, that points back to the fact that the escrow takes place on the blockchain itself.\n\"That's one difference we have from LocalBitcoins, where your funds are essentially held on LocalBitcoins,\" Snitko told CoinDesk.\nCome summertime, Househodl will also offer such private listings for buying or selling real estate directly with cryptocurrency.\n\"The idea is that you don't need to cash out into a fiat currency to buy property,\" Snitko said, touching on the broader issue of balancing compliance with the bitcoin community's cypherpunk ethos by adding:\n\"The most important challenge, I think, is to guarantee that the purchase is 100 percent legal and there are no legal loopholes to exploit.\"\nKeys image ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/04/12/these-dishonest-ny-lawyers-led-to-10-6m-in-victim-payouts/", "https://biglawbusiness.com/lawyer-suspended-for-hiding-clients-funds-in-escrow-account/", "https://www.etymonline.com/word/escrow", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/locksmith-key-shop-business-many-chains-465332900"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hodl hodl", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T15:47:59.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b79c4acaaa3d63551562b3e9d8e5e90b1f50d454", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNPypGtO.ap2.cnBWRH62J9R.JIhr4SlU.TAHUfLdrKPMHuaoCak2Y7DohzJW._PhHO_ds49wM78X89RXptoTaZO623mrXSiYG.PsmWFfX.3mzAAsJvLWSi8-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin can make a positive impact on the financi", "title_full": "Bitcoin can make a positive impact on the financi", "published": "2018-06-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.589, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b79c4acaaa3d63551562b3e9d8e5e90b1f50d454", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNPypGtO.ap2.cnBWRH62J9R.JIhr4SlU.TAHUfLdrKPMHuaoCak2Y7DohzJW._PhHO_ds49wM78X89RXptoTaZO623mrXSiYG.PsmWFfX.3mzAAsJvLWSi8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JP Buntinx", "published": "2018-06-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin can make a positive impact on the financi", "text": "Bitcoin can make a positive impact on the financial industry.

World Go Round\nAvi Mizrahi\nThis week we saw that despite most countries being less open to cryptocurrency as Japan, this amazing innovation continues to fascinate the whole world . This was evident in stories from all over the globe that were covered in this week's daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App\nPoloniex Responds to Complaints On Monday we reported that Poloniex, the US-based cryptocurrency trading platform which was taken over by Circle earlier this year, has finally responded to complaints by its clients about frozen accounts. The company tried to reassure clients their funds were safe and that it has taken steps to increase the speed of the identity verification process. Additionally covered was the fact that the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone.\nMcAfee Warns of War on Crypto John McAfee (Photo by Gage Skidmore) The big news on Tuesday was that cybersecurity expert turned pump and dump guru John McAfee has issued another bullish prediction. Bitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicted. His prediction was in contrast with Russian analysts who expect that value of BTC will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold.\nMcAfee also also talked about \"the war we are all engaged in\", Claiming that the banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto. He advised crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. McAfee called on his followers to also write the SEC and ask \"to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.\"\nChina Fights Impersonators and Fraudsters A couple of stories that show cryptocurrency is still a hot topic in China were our focus on Wednesday . First, Chinese social media has erupted in anger this week after the use of a Mao Zedong impersonator at the Boao Blockchain Forum for Asia in Hainan province. Second, a Chinese procurator's office has reportedly prosecuted 98 people and recovered 1.7 billion yuan (about $270 million) in an alleged Onecoin pyramid scheme. Additionally covered were high market awareness in Germany, a London mosque that accepts bitcoin donations, a new green mining farm in Canada and an MMA champ's love for crypto.\nAsus Creates 20-GPU Mining Motherboard Asus H370 Mining Master On Thursday we reported that Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer Asus has created a new motherboard with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The company explains that: \"Mining is a numbers game; it's only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. \" We also reported about a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin.\nExpanding Horizons in Uganda, Bahrain and Georgia Countries not often mentioned in the news made headlines on Friday . First, Binance could be opening a new office in Uganda, CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference. \"I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,\" CZ stated. Second, Bahrain has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency due to an absence of limiting regulations and a shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in Riffa. Lastly, we reported that a luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins in Georgia.\nBlockchain on the Agenda in Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Hungary Governments all across Europe were our focus on Saturday . Lawmakers in Spain have issued a unanimous call for adopting regulations that favor the implementation of crypto and blockchain technologies. The government of Slovenia has adopted an action plan to underpin the implementation of blockchain technology in the country and create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In Estonia, officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. And in Hungary, \"The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,\" said Péter Benedek, the CEO of Blockchain Competence Center (BCC).\nThis Week in Bitcoin Podcast Catch the rest of this week's news in the This Week in Bitcoin podcast with host Matt Aaron.\nWhat other stories in the bitcoin world caught your attention this week?

This was evident in stories from all over the globe that were covered in this week’s daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App Poloniex Responds to Complaints\nOn Monday we reported that Poloniex, the US-based cryptocurrency trading platform which was taken over by Circle earlier this year, has finally responded to complaints by its clients about frozen accounts. The company tried to reassure clients their funds were safe and that it has taken steps to increase the speed of the identity verification process. Additionally covered was the fact that the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone. McAfee Warns of War on Crypto John McAfee (Photo by Gage Skidmore)\nThe big news on Tuesday was that cybersecurity expert turned pump and dump guru John McAfee has issued another bullish prediction. Bitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicted. His prediction was in contrast with Russian analysts who expect that value of BTC will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold.\nMcAfee also also talked about “the war we are all engaged in”, Claiming that the banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto. He advised crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. McAfee called on his followers to also write the SEC and ask “to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.” China Fights Impersonators and Fraudsters\nA couple of stories that show cryptocurrency is still a hot topic in China were our focus on Wednesday . First, Chinese social media has erupted in anger this week after the use of a Mao Zedong impersonator at the Boao Blockchain Forum for Asia in Hainan province. Second, a Chinese procurator’s office has reportedly prosecuted 98 people and recovered 1.7 billion yuan (about $270 million) in an alleged Onecoin pyramid scheme. Additionally covered were high market awareness in Germany, a London mosque that accepts bitcoin donations, a new green mining farm in Canada and an MMA champ’s love for crypto. Asus Creates 20-GPU Mining Motherboard Asus H370 Mining Master\nOn Thursday we reported that Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer Asus has created a new motherboard with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The company explains that: “Mining is a numbers game; it’s only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. ” We also reported about a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin. Expanding Horizons in Uganda, Bahrain and Georgia\nCountries not often mentioned in the news made headlines on Friday . First, Binance could be opening a new office in Uganda, CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference. “I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,” CZ stated. Second, Bahrain has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency due to an absence of limiting regulations and a shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in Riffa. Lastly, we reported that a luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins in Georgia. Blockchain on the Agenda in Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Hungary\nGovernments all across Europe were our focus on Saturday . Lawmakers in Spain have issued a unanimous call for adopting regulations that favor the implementation of crypto and blockchain technologies. The government of Slovenia has adopted an action plan to underpin the implementation of blockchain technology in the country and create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In Estonia, officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. And in Hungary, “The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,” said Péter Benedek, the CEO of Blockchain Competence Center (BCC).

Robert Sluymer, Managing Director and Technical Strategist at Fundstrat seems to be joining the company's growing group of cryptocurrency bulls.\nPromising Signs for Bitcoin? On CNBC's \"Futures Now\" segment , Sluymer stated:\n\"We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it's going to start a recovery process here.\"\nSluymer also noted that he has a three-phase technical analysis process that allows him to try to predict future price movements of cryptocurrencies. The first phase, which is the deceleration or bottoming out of momentum indicators, may be just starting.\nSluymer pointed out that the first phase seems to be in effect when he said:\n\"While it is premature to conclude the correction is over, there was a positive technical development this week suggesting the first stage of a three-stage bottoming process is developing. Short-term momentum indicators are beginning to bottom.\"\nFor the past week, Bitcoin has been hovering around the low to mid $7000s, in a low volatility state, as shown by the bottom most indicator in the chart below.\nVolatility has become a key characteristic often attributed with the price of cryptocurrencies and seeing a slowdown in volatility might leave some market players in a confused state. I personally would attribute this decrease in relative volatility to the increased institutional involvement in the industry.\nHowever, take volatility with a grain of salt in this case, as volatility levels we are currently residing at were seen just before the crypto boom of 2017.\nBut some have begun to believe that this is a promising sign, as they believe that Bitcoin is consolidating before the eventual retesting of ATHs.\n$6500 Triple Bottom. Is it Possible? However, Bitcoin is still over $1000 away from 2018's low, which amounted to around $6500 back in early April. The low in April was actually a double-bottom, with Bitcoin reaching similar price levels back in February after December's $20,000 Bitcoin. This has led some analysts who are more critical of Bitcoin's price, to think that a triple-bottom could occur in the future. However, even if Bitcoin was to revisit those prices levels, past indicators show that there is a large amount of support at $6500.\nDespite fears of a triple-bottom at $6500, the relative strength indicator (RSI) has been trending upwards (as seen by the chart above), finding a bottom of around 30 earlier this week. This RSI indicator, which is still located in the 'oversold' zone, may show that Bitcoin is prepared for upwards price action.\nOver the course of this year's price drops to $6500, RSI indicators often went as low as 30, with run-ups in price and positive indicators quickly following the aforementioned price drops. If historical values and patterns are of any merit, as they often are, this means that we could see a rapid Bitcoin run-up in the near future.\nHowever, Sluymer believes that before that Bitcoin breaking past $7800 will have to be a precursor to the run-up which many have been waiting for.\nDespite the potential for Bitcoin's short-term success, Sluymer believes that the largest cryptocurrency may lose some dominance as some players like EOS and Tron (TRX) may outperform Bitcoin in the near future. He also mentioned that other cryptocurrencies residing in the top-40, such as IOTA, 0x, and WaltonChain have shown that they may also begin to encroach on Bitcoin's 38% market share.\nBut Sluymer made it clear that he is still adamant about his belief that Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, will begin to see some upward price action very shortly.\nHe put it best when he said:\n\"If you're short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you're looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.\"\nCharts from Tradingview.com\nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post FundStrat Analyst: Bitcoin at the

Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) risen $75.82 on June 2-3\nJune 3, 2018 - By Migdalia James\nIt was good day for Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH), as it jumped by $75.82 or 7.55%, touching $1079.51. Crypto Analysts believe that Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) is looking for the $1187.46 goal. According to 9 analysts could reach $1854.91. The highest price was $1106.07 and lowest of $994.46 for June 2-3. The open was $1003.69. It last traded at Bitfinex exchange. Aproximately 68,934 BCH worth $73.22 million was traded.\nFor a month, Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) tokens went down -28.66% from $1513.29 for coin. For 100 days BCH is down -14.09% from $1256.52. It traded at $1187.03 200 days ago. Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) has 17.16M coins mined with the market cap $18.53 billion. It has 21.00M coins in circulation. It was founded on 01/08/2017. The Crypto BCH has PoW proof type and operates under SHA256 algorithm.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard forked version of the original Bitcoin. It is similar to bitcoin with regards to its protocol; Proof of Work SHA-256 hashing, 21,000,000 supply, same block times and reward system. However two main differences are the the blocksize limits, as of August 2017 Bitcoin has a 1MB blocksize limit whereas BCH proposes 8MB blocks. Also BCH will adjust the difficulty every 6 blocks as opposed to 2016 blocks as with Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Cash is a proposal from the viaBTC mining pool and the Bitmain mining group to carry out a UAHF (User Activated Hard Fork) on August 1st 12:20 pm UTC. They rejected the agreed consensus (aka BIP-91 or SegWit2x) and have decided to fork the original Bitcoin blockchain and create this new version called “Bitcoin Cash”. Bitcoin Cash can be claimed by BTC owners who have their private keys or store their Bitcoins on a service that will split BCH for the customer.\nhttps://blockchair.com/\n Migdalia James ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blockchair.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "migdalia james i", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T14:12:13.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc558a34fd62954b26d6941b9774a9359d88db46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQNJ6r7LIQtkkb.D1LRMqaU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "⚛️ [ANN] Bitcoin Atom - Fork 1:1 of Bitcoin - Atomic Swap Powered ⚛️", "title_full": "⚛️ [ANN] Bitcoin Atom - Fork 1:1 of Bitcoin - Atomic Swap Powered ⚛️", "published": "2018-06-03T14:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc558a34fd62954b26d6941b9774a9359d88db46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQNJ6r7LIQtkkb.D1LRMqaU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tiulinh", "published": "2018-06-03T14:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "⚛️ [ANN] Bitcoin Atom - Fork 1:1 of Bitcoin - Atomic Swap Powered ⚛️", "text": "How do everybody think when bca team is silent for GUI AUTOSWAP question?

The good thing about going this route is that all of the code is ready to go, and it’ll be effortless to run on just about any Linux distribution. Best of all, there’s no need to install dependencies, and everything should work. The only real downside to the generic instructions for Bitcoin Knots is the fact that updates can’t take place automatically.\nNote: if you don’t want to use a pre-compiled binary, the developer has made the Bitcoin Knots source code available on Linux. Grab it here and start building !\nTo start using the program, you’ll first need to download the latest archive .\nAfter downloading the latest version of Bitcoin Knots, open up a terminal and use the CD command to move from the home folder to the ~/Downloads directory.\nWhen you’ve moved the terminal into the Downloads folder, don’t extract it just yet. Extracting a program (especially a cryptocurrency wallet) into this folder is a good way for it to accidentally get deleted. Instead, use the mv tool to move the archive directly to your home folder. mv bitcoin-0.15.1.knots20171111-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz ~/\nNow that the file is in the correct location, it’s safe to extract it. Using the tar command, deflate the archive. tar -xvzf bitcoin-0.15.1.knots20171111-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nEverything is extracted and ready to use. However, before you do that, consider using the mv tool to rename the folder. Renaming the extracted folder isn’t required, but changing it to “Bitcoin Knots” may be helpful. mv bitcoin-0.15.1 Bitcoin\\ \\Knots Using Bitcoin Knots\nTo use Bitcoin Knots, you’ll first need to mark the binary file as executable. Open up a terminal and use the cd command to enter the “Bitcoin Knots” folder. cd Bitcoin\\ \\Knots\nInside the Bitcoin Knots folder, use the cd command again. This time, you’ll need to move into the bin sub-folder, as the executable programs are located here. cd bin\nInside bin, use the ls command to view all of the individual executable files.\nls\nAfter you’ve seen all the files, copy the file names and update the permissions for each. sudo chmod +x filename\nBitcoin Knots has a GUI app, and it’s what most people want to use when they download this software. Update the permissions like so: sudo chmod +x bitcoin-qt\nThen, launch the program with ./bitcoin-qt\nAs the Bitcoin Knots app launches, you’ll see a prompt. This prompt will warn that you must download the entire Bitcoin blockchain. Allow the app to do so. When it’s finished, it’ll be ready to use for sending and receiving Bitcoin.\nTo send a transaction, click the “send” button menu button at the top. After that, enter an address, the amount you want to send, and then click the “send” button at the bottom.\nAlternatively, request Bitcoin via Bitcoin Knox by clicking the “Receive” button. From there, enter the address,the amount, and click “send”.

The players must have their own cryptocurrency wallets to receive the cryptocurrency. First Offering Available In August\nCryptoChips’ first initiative will be in August in “Whimsical War,” a real-time territorial battle game. CryptoChips will distribute bitcoin in accordance with player rankings. In Whimsical War, the placement of characters on the battlefield is key to winning the game. Players can form tag teams and engage in tag team battles.\nCryptoChips, which will be offered through a GMO group company, will be mounted on the group’s other game applications and will eventually include competitors’game titles.\nMeanwhile, on June 6, the group will launch GMO miner B2, a mining machine equipped with mining chips using a 7 nm process technology.

The facility has a production target of 500 petahashes per second.\nIn February, GMO Group announced a two-year rental contract for its cloud mining venture for $5 million to cover power costs, maintenance, land, and security. The operation will support bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The company said it will accept up to eight contracts per month, and that it is considering a less costly alternative mining service.\nEarlier last year, GMO Click, the world’s largest forex broker, announced plans to integrate its trading services with its bitcoin wallet – GMO Wallet Co. Ltd.\nIn 2014, GMO Internet announced it would allow its 48,532 Japanese merchants to accept bitcoin .
