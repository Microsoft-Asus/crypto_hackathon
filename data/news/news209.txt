The funding would stem from a portion of the miners block reward, and attendees discussed donating between 1-5 percent of rewards to fund developers.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Warren Warned by Billboards, Coinbase Tempted by Banking A Positive Meeting Takes Place in Hong Kong Between BCH Industry Executives, Mining Pools, and Developers\nAfter an innovative event at Calvin Ayre’s Coingeek Conference in Hong Kong members of the Bitcoin Cash industry including high profile executives, and lead developers met to discuss a new proposal. Attendees of the meeting included executives from the pool BTC.top, Coingeek, Viabtc, Jihan Wu and Jiazhi Jiang from Bitmain’s Antpool, Roger Ver and other representatives from the Bitcoin.com pool, Amaury Séchet of Bitcoin ABC, Electron Cash founder Jonald Fyookball , and Jerry Chan from SBI Bits.\nThe meeting discussed how attendees envisioned where BCH development would go and how to continue funding the project in the future. Moreover, other blockchain projects that fund development through mining rewards were also discussed between the meeting participants. Alongside this, the attendees talked about how the funds would be distributed and how miners could use their signatures to vote on certain development projects. Members deliberated different concepts like an OP_Code ‘Timelock’ method — a smart contract technique that restricts the spending of coins until a certain block height or time. Bitcoin Cash Miners Discuss Voting on Proposals\n“Virtually all of the mining pool representatives agreed to support a proposal that would allow miners to vote to fund community proposed initiatives, voting on them in the same way that vote signaling works now,” a representative from Bitcoin.com who attended the meeting explained to our newsdesk.\nIf a proposal crossed a 75% threshold, it would pass — And would be funded with some predetermined amount from every block found.\nAs mentioned above, a percentage of 1-5 percent of the block reward was considered, but for now, there have been no agreed terms set at the meeting. An example of how much funding a small percentage of the block rewards would be, shows that roughly 1 percent of a month’s work of block rewards is about $650,000 USD if BCH prices are above $1,200 per coin.\nWhat do you think about miners donating block rewards to help fund BCH development?

To start, seven private lenders will test the trade finance network to increase security and transparency in the finance sector. Blockchain to Combat Banking Frauds\nThe seven Indian private lenders that have enlisted to pilot the network include Axis Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, IndusInd Bank Ltd, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd , RBL Bank Ltd and South Indian Bank Ltd. Infosys envisions several international banks to join Infosys trade finance network.\nSanat Rao, Chief Business Officer at Infosys Finacle, said : “We’re in very advanced discussions in Australia with a consortium of banks and I think you’ll see more announcements.”\nThe Indian banking industry is in deep water, due to the string of frauds that came at the hands of poor banking infrastructure and disloyal bank employees. Reportedly, banking frauds in the country have doubled in India over the last five years. The total Indian banking fraud has reached over $4 billion. However, implementing blockchain technology can enhance security and transparency throughout the trade finance process.\nTrade finance can be a messy task as it involves multiple participants to complete a transaction. Leveraging blockchain technology to trade finance can cut the entire process duration while making the task less paper-intensive. Infosys’ blockchain powered trade finance network makes transactions transparent for all participants of the trade finance process, which includes importers, exporters, regulators, financiers of both buyers and sellers, insurers and service providers. Blockchain to Transform Trade Finance Industry\nFrom the enlisted banks, Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India ( ICICI ) have a proven track record of employing blockchain technology for processing trade finance and has already formed a tailored blockchain platform to process cross-border payments. The private lender has also enlisted 250 corporate businesses to use the platform.\nICICI has bet big on blockchain technology and prides itself on being the first bank in the country to process the cross-border payment using the technology in partnership with Dubai’s biggest lender Emirates NBD.\nIn reference to ICICI’s blockchain advancement, Chanda Kochhar, CEO of ICICI Bank, stated that:\n“ICICI Bank has a rich legacy of leveraging the latest technology to bring in new paradigms in banking. We were the first in the country and among few globally to pioneer cross-border open account trade finance and remittance transactions on blockchain.”\nRecently, one of the world’s biggest lender HSBC Holdings PLC completed a trade finance transaction in association with Dutch Bank ING, using the distributed ledger technology. Employing blockchain technology can reduce certain transaction timelines to 24 hours which otherwise take about a weeks time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "uncateg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanat rao", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "axis bank ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "infosys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south indian bank ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kotak mahindra bank ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbl bank ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "infosys finacle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "infosys limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icici bank ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indusind bank ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T17:14:28.075+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d53a5dad26f4746d6e94442f2bb62cb4cfcfaf15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7b6lzgbEplhJnrMJLudfIs-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "title_full": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d53a5dad26f4746d6e94442f2bb62cb4cfcfaf15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7b6lzgbEplhJnrMJLudfIs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite new users and get 0.3 BTC!

A new peer-reviewed study by the financial economist Alex de Vries shows that the energy footprint of crypto mining farms is constantly on the rise and could go as high as 5% of the world’s total energy production in the foreseeable future. By Telegram\nBy the end of this year, the net electricity consumed by the bitcoin network could be equal to the energy usage of a country as big as Austria – let that sink in.\nAnybody familiar with the concept of crypto mining would know that mining is an energy-intensive process. But how much does it add to the net electricity consumption of the world? Advertisement\nAlex de Vries, a financial economist who also doubles as a blockchain evangelist, has been keeping a tab on the bitcoin network’s energy footprint. He even has a website dedicated to the cause. Last year in December, de Vries estimated that bitcoin miners worldwide are consuming as much energy as it would require to power all of Denmark. First peer-reviewed study on the bitcoin network’s energy footprint\nHowever, based on the latest figures at his disposal, de Vries estimates that the network’s energy footprint will substantially increase over the next few months. His peer-reviewed article on the topic was recently published in the journal Joule . This marked the first-ever time when an estimate of bitcoin’s energy demands was peer-reviewed, and it expectedly got people thinking — should we be wary of the impact of mining farms on the environment ?\nAccording to de Vries’ findings, the bitcoin network alone will account for nearly 0.5% of global electric-energy consumption by the end of 2018. To put things into perspective, that amounts to a whopping 7.7 GW — roughly the same amount of electricity that would keep Austria going. How much worse will it get?\nDe Vries relied on a number of economic reasoning to justify the upper bound of his estimate (7.7GW).\nThe rules that govern the bitcoin network reward miners with 12.5 bitcoins once they mine a block. Judging by the current fiat-equivalent of a single bitcoin token, that amounts to approximately $100,000.\nGiven that a new block is mined every 10-minutes, the net worth of newly mined bitcoin everyday hovers somewhere around $15 million.\nHowever, the network was designed such that the difficulty of the mining process will automatically increase to ensure that the average block creation rate of 10 minutes remains by and large the same. So as more mining rigs enter the game, it becomes increasingly tougher for miners to mine a block.\nTo meet the challenge, mining farms will require using more powerful machines, which in turn will lead to higher electricity consumption.\nde Vries noted:\n“You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines.”\nHe added that eventually an equilibrium point will be reached when energy and hardware costs will equal the value of newly mined bitcoins. On the flip side, if the price of bitcoin suddenly rises as it did in Q4 2017, more miners will join the game, and the network’s energy consumption will undergo a steep rise. If you remember, there were some alarmist reports towards the fall of 2017 (when bitcoin’s price was hitting one high after another) that the mining industry would require all of the world’s energy production to sustain itself by 2020.\nde Vries’ research shows that a number of factors will combine to ensure that such a scenario never happens. However, he warns that the odds are reasonably high that bitcoin mining will someday demand as much as 5% of the world’s net energy production.\nFollow us on Twitter | Telegram | Facebook Featured Image from Shutterstock.

Maybe due to the high expectations over Consensus, which did not create that much demand over bitcoin, at least not as much as it happened during previous years.\nI understand it’s your money that is at stake and the market has been quite bearish. But it’s also mine and everyone else’s who decided to change from fiat-currency to cryptocurrency. To most people you know bitcoin is an investment vehicle; maybe a bit more worrying, is the fact that the focus is not even bitcoin anymore, it’s mostly altcoins. Where else we could we get those massive gains (bruh)?\nBut greed comes at a cost.\nI love new ideas, new projects, new ways of thinking and innovation in general. I also love the concept of decentralizing trust and money and the super-power/super-responsibility that comes with it. Obviously, the debate is considerably more interesting when the total marketcap of (insert top-10 project name) is worth billions.\nAt some point we need to stop and ask ourselves, how happy are we with the actual progress of the cryptocurrency space? So many companies have surged, yet where is the real change? Is there a bubble or is the market undervalued? Is price aligned with technology development and adoption, in any way?\nMore importantly: Can you still go to the moon?\n–this article shouldn’t be taken as financial advisement as it represents my personal opinion and views. I have savings invested in cryptocurrency so take whatever I write with a grain of salt. Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose and always read as much as possible about a project before investing. Never forget: with great power, comes great responsibility. Being your own bank means you’re always responsible for your own money–\nI have absolutely no idea, plus I couldn’t care less. Don’t take me wrong, I hope the market turns bullish and we do see a massive bull-run, breaking the CME futures market trend of keeping Bitcoin below 10k. I hope all projects deliver upon their promises. I hope price, technology development and business development align themselves. My desire is that everything works out just fine and everyone who invested takes home some profit.\nThe problem is, of course, reality works a little bit differently.\nMaybe in a different universe where we make no bad choices and aren’t greedy by nature, that could happen.\nWhat I see is many projects being clearly overvalued, a definite lack of research on actual proven concepts and too much money wasted on marketing campaigns, ads, advisors, ICO trackers, paid promotional content instead of focusing on actual product development and fixing important issues. “In order to make money, you need to spend money”\nSure. Welcome to the VC western mentality world. You either think big or go home, right?\nNo. That’s not why I joined cryptocurrency.\nI do want to make money, get rich and don’t have to worry about anything else for the rest of my days, focusing only at doing what I love. But there are many ways of achieving that goal. You don’t need 1000 BTC to start a decentralizing (whatever business) platform with economic incentives. Or at least you shouldn’t. One of the things that drive my passion towards cryptocurrency is what’s about to come: when people with an actual need for the technology start participating, hordes at a time.\nSure, our gains are important. But there’s something way bigger coming which will influence the entire marketcap.\nImagine when those 33% unbanked people around the world realize they can simply download an app and get paid in a currency accepted everywhere. The true beauty of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains to be its decentralized, permission less and transparent nature.\nBut in order for that to happen, we might need to put greed aside for a second and think of ways of better-redistributing money. If you don’t see how that is important for your personal gain, let me clarify.\nThink of what happens when you include 30 billion people on the financial system.\nCan you even do it?\nI cannot conceptualize the impact on our daily lives, but from a financial standpoint, this is what I see: 30 billion more customers for every business, potentially. By financially including people who did not have a chance to participate in the world economy, you can now reach new customers everywhere; because the means of exchanging are borderless and permissionless, no one can be blocked from exchanging value and services. The digitalization of the world, via mobile smart-phones with internet access, could change how we do business forever.\nFor example, if you do business in Africa or Latin American countries you might know it’s near impossible to take money away, due to the many currency-related restrictions. You can now hop over that problem, just by transacting in cryptocurrency.\nOr maybe if you’re willing to train a whole new workforce, who needs much less cash to sustain an acceptable standard of living. It might not be easy but with the right set of tools, motivation and people we might see new specialized businesses flourishing through developing countries. How will cryptocurrency change jobs and economies worldwide?\nIn order to get to the bottom of that question, first we need to worry about adoption.\nI personally believe there are 3 reasons that could lead to potentially increasing worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency: A Better User Interface; A Better redistribution of money; Standardized multisig/escrow contracts.\nIf you think I forgot about scalability, transaction fees or block size, please rest assured I haven’t. To me those aren’t real problems; as the network grows in security (more miners), user adoption and developer community, I believe we will see those issues getting resolved. Some others will appear, of course, but that’s the nature of innovation.\nYou need to break stuff in order to build new things so it’s not the tech problems that frighten me, to be honest; the values and paths we choose to support our decision-making, that is what concerns me. But we’ll get into that in a bit.\nSo, why is User Interface at the top? Simple answer: would you be able to use the internet without DNS being active? If you do not understand the question, let me rephrase it: how easy would it be to, instead of accessing https://ccn.com , you would have to know a bunch of different IP addresses to be able to connect to the provider website? I’m sure you wouldn’t like that at all.\nKiller user-friendly apps, which make the bridge between the infrastructure and the user are the key which might unlock this puzzle.\nThe first real challenge is making cryptocurrency indistinguishable from digital fiat-currency. We need ways to safe-guard users from making bad decisions, like not keeping their private keys safe, accessing websites via ads, or keeping their entire assets in a single place. To achieve that, we have two main schools of thought to follow. Learning by doing or, Regulating the markets.\nAs regulation is usually the way to avoid, especially during the early development stages of any new technology, we should educate people and allow them to make bad decisions. It’s hard to lose your money, I have been there. I have also been scammed, tricked, made bad decisions on where to store my money, lost private keys and so on. What’s the only good thing about it? Each time I failed I learned something that helped me making better decisions in the future.\nWhat “experts” usually don’t say is that you shouldn’t be afraid to fail, especially if you’re starting in a new field.\nConsider the following: the sooner you fail the sooner you learn. This is, if I had not made all those mistakes back in the day, I would probably do them later on. And I could have lost way, way more money!\nThe hardest lesson we all learn with time is that there are no safeguards in real-life. A stupid comment on twitter can lose you your job; a click in the wrong ad can infect your laptop; just being in the wrong place at the wrong time can change your life drastically.\nWe need to accept we don’t control most things that come our way. We’re either prepared to deal with them or we’re not. One thing I’m pretty sure of: blocking people from investing because it’s in their best interest is just dumb. Why?\nFor one, how is it ok we allow some guys sitting at a table somewhere think they know better? Oh I see, they’re “protecting” us. If it isn’t morally wrong or illegal, don’t even try to tell me what to do. Let me do stupid stuff and make incredibly irrational decisions. That’s how I learn.\nI mean..\nIf it’s ok to gamble, it should be ok to buy cryptocurrency.\nIf it’s ok to share my data with the highest bidder, it should be ok to let me monetize it as I see fit.\nSecondly, everyone makes bad decisions at some point. No exceptions here. If someone tells you how certain they are about a certain event, run like the wind. Honestly, nothing is for certain, much less an unregulated market subject to the will of the whales and institutional investors. I mean, when JP Morgan comes out saying “ We’re considering entering the crypto market ” it means they’re already in, as most of you know.\nPeople are greedy by nature, right? Banks, institutions, corporations, any type of organization are just groups of people trying to get the maximum utility of each play.\nSometimes, even the greatest people make the most stupid mistakes.\nDo you follow, for example, the brilliant Andreas Antonopoulos? I’m sure if you do, you think highly of him. Did you know his co-author on “Mastering Bitcoin”, a blockchain bibble for so many crypto-enthusiasts, was the person responsible for creating Parity? Which got hacked not so long ago?\nDo you think he was an idiot for trusting such a person to be his co-author?\nThis is the harsh truth you don’t read many times. People make mistakes and bad things happen. What matters are the intentions and values on which decisions were made.\nEither a commercial airplane pilot who wasn’t able to account for time correctly or a doctor who failed to diagnose a disease, people sometimes make bad decisions that lead to destructive outcomes. Those events, however, can have a positive impact on future generations, because Human Beings have the capability to learn from theirs and others’ mistakes. Critical thinking is key for cryptocurrency, as we cannot impose too many regulations on something that is already internally regulated. That’s why Bitcoin works, as its internal consensus mechanics promote good behaviour and punish bad actors.\nIf you wonder why we might need to slow down on regulation think of what the current state of finance is doing to the world. There is a clear separation and segregation of classes as the rich can invest while the poor can only work for a pay-check.\nScrew that. Make money work for you. This is not a new idea, not even related to cryptocurrency at all, but it’s an important mmindsetto have. Maybe the story of rich-dad, poor-dad can be an inspiration to you, regarding how to look at money.\nNow, let’s get back on track at the question at hand. How can we better redistribute money?\n–I hope you don’t judge my rant too seriously; sometimes we just need to let it all out—\nBitcoin initiated a process of rewarding participants for securing the network. That’s already pretty cool and quite an achievement, but we need to aim at doing it better. Right now you need special hardware to maintain the security of the network. In time, I hope the mechanics change in order to allow for more people to be rewarded for maintaining the network’s security. Real change, in my opinion, will come from different proof-of-consensus. For example, there might be a different implementation that requires all participants to secure the network. This is, anyone who participates needs to validate transactions at some point, getting rewarded to do it.\nCurrently ,the logic dictates you need to spend energy to maintain the network’s security, which is a fair trade-off. But other logics might appear with different goals. What if instead of energy you staked your time or attention? You do not need a massive data structure change, like switching from a blockchain to a DAG or Hashgraph, to improve consensus mechanics by giving more rewards to users.\nIf everyone agrees to a change in the protocol rules you can potentially just fork bitcoin into a new proof-of-work mechanic, rewarding everyone who already participates in the current bitcoin blockchain (like bitcoin cash, private, gold etc).\nThere are of course opinions against keeping doing hardforks, as it potentially “steals” hashing power from the main network. But hey, that’s a feature of decentralization. People should be able to do whatever the hell they want. If someone believes they have a better way of reaching consensus, let them try. I understand the current feeling is many projects are just forking Bitcoin so that founders and early adopters get rich quick.\nIs that a lie? I doubt it. Again, we humans are quite greedy. That doesn’t refute the fact hardforks can have a potential good outcome!\nIf the overall goal is to improve the network, adoption and user reward why wouldn’t you do it?! I hope people try new things, as it’s the only way to achieve the best possible outcome for everybody. let’s get crazy for a second, shall we? Tokenizing the world economy\nAnother potential solution is if businesses everywhere start adopting a different mentality. What if instead of giving people equity, you can give them a direct way to make money by using your product/services? I understand it’s hard to conceptualize a token which has no real value, as it’s not connected to an organization’s equity, but try to see it from a different perspective: you can now purposely give away tokens to users, for free, as they use your product or service. Those tokens could let them vote upon governance, reward them with a fixed income or allow them to donate back tokens so you can build new features or maximize your business utility.\nThe goal here would be to directly redistribute gains, for example, among the people who support your network: users.\nThose users can be anyone, your suppliers, buyers, employees, investors, etc. Everyone who interacts with your business could potentially be rewarded for participating.\nImagine not having just a source of income, but potentially dozens at the same time, just from sharing your data, buying products, using services or interacting with a network. We could completely shift how the world works by literally giving back to your network. We now have a chance to shift from measuring wealth in profits to measuring wealth in network users. Because all users would have tokens!\nAs crypto-assets are inter-changeable, everyone can easily exchange them for digital cash. Or any other digital asset you see fit. Maybe instead of having 150 currencies, we will end up with hundreds or thousands of digital assets, all of which could potentially be exchanged amongst themselves.\nWe now come to the final point that can greatly influence overall adoption. Standardized multisig/escrow contracts\nAlthough this point would definitely work “under the blockchain hood”, its key for people to trust each other. Meaning, only with standardized and trusted contracts deployed, which use a very easy and friendly interface, we actually have a chance of people trusting the entire system. It’s pretty cocky to say “the blockchain can’t be hacked” when software and websites built over it, could.\nWe can’t forget we still live in an analogue world. People still lookup to institutions and governments for guidance and expect them to behave according to everyone’s best interest and their intrinsic values.\nThe issue is that sometimes, leaders forget those values they swore to abide to when making decisions and base them solely on personal gain. To destroy that mentality we also need a solid and stable infrastructure aligned with a set of organizations lead by people who do not care about personal gain. Hence I understand the role Vitalik, David, Dan or Charles play at their projects. How achievable is that goal?\nIt will depend, again, on all of us. If we promote and invest in projects just for gains, not caring about the purpose or goal, then I don’t see a real future. If we make an effort to bet on projects and people who put the benefit of the many ahead of their own, then I do. I think it’s up to us to let good projects and ideas live, bad ones to die and mistakes to happen.\nSomeone said if we do good deeds the world responds in kind.\nFor more than 2 centuries we had a system that only worked in some parts of the world, it wasn’t all inclusive, it was permissioned and required people to identify themselves to participate. We had a system that did not work 24/7 nor did it reward participants. Come to think about it, no one born after 2008 will ever live in a world where fiat-money is the only option. That’s somehow reassuring.\nThings have changed and we all must make an effort to turn this market into a huge success. From investors, to developers and from miners to users, it’s up to all of us as individuals to promote good agents and to punish bad actors.\nDon’t forget: the more selfish your actions are the worst the overall outcome for the most. I understand that for some of us to win, others need to lose; that’s just how balance works. Except this time the winners can be the many and the losers the few.\nI know it’s a bit of a stretch, but who knows? With a different attitude comes a different outcome. Is Bitcoin a bubble?\nNo. Our immense greed and money lust is. If you fear the market will collapse think of the Internet bubble.\nDo you remember how it ended?\nGreat. Now think of how you’re reading this article.\nNo bubble will destroy bitcoin, we’ve been there already. Now, if there is a bubble it means we weren’t able to control our greed for quick profits and allowed for enormous over-valued silly projects to emerge. Just like during the 2000s.\nThe only good thing is that with any failure comes an important lesson.\nMy only conclusion is that Bitcoin is the new digital internet money.

The ethereum network has a new batch of games to blame for rising gas fees. Over the past week, the viral success of dapps such as Ether Shrimp Farm, Ether Cartel, and Pepe Farm has congested the ethereum blockchain, questioning its readiness for enterprise adoption.\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency is Property in Russia, Justice Minister Confirms Ethereum Endures a Plague of Frogs and Shrimp\nIn the same week that Fedex announced plans to build a logistics tool on the ethereum network, fresh doubts over its readiness for enterprise use have emerged. A clutch of new games, created and nurtured in the depths of 4chan, has raised gas prices and show the fragility of the blockchain in its current state. While not as fatal as Cryptokitties, ethereum’s first viral onchain game, Ether Shrimp Farm and its spin-off Ether Cartel have still taken their toll on the network.\nThe former dapp requires users to hatch and sell shrimp in a bid to maximize production before ultimately exchanging eggs for ether. Ether Cartel, meanwhile, takes the same concept and applies it to drug running. The game “features a high tech automated market that lets you instantly buy or sell drugs with a single transaction. The more kilos you have, the more drugs they produce (each kilo produces at a rate of 1 per day). Collect more kilos with your drugs to multiply your production.” The most popular new dapps this week. Meme Games Top the Charts and Up the Gas\nAfter amassing 26,000 transactions in just 24 hours, 4Chan’s ethereum games saw gas fees more than double to $0.2. They have since settled at just over $0.1 per transaction according to Eth Gas Station but the games, including Ether Anthills and Pepe Farm , still occupy 9 out of the top 10 spots in Dapp Radar’s new dapps category. Ether Cartel and Fish Farm also occupy third and fourth in the top 10 for all dapps, just behind IDEX and Forkdelta. In the last week, Ether Shrimp Farm alone has been responsible for 43,000 transactions. Pepe Farm\nWhile many people have seen the amusing side of all this, not everyone is impressed. As one commenter pointed out, “If the 2nd largest cryptocurrency can be destroyed by cryptokitties and shrimp farms then it isn’t ready for prime time and we have a long way to go before mass adoption. These games may seem stupid, but they serve as valuable stress tests for the ecosystem as a whole, and show where the weak points lie.”\nThere are ways to design dapps so that they don’t require every single action to be performed onchain. Ethereum social network Peepeth is an example of this. The mischief-makers behind the likes of Ether Shrimp Farm, however, revel in the wreckage caused by the runaway success of their games. Like all memes, these dapps will soon die off, but will eventually be replaced by new blockchain-clogging contenders, much to the annoyance of other ethereum users.\nWhat do you make of meme blockchain games – harmless fun or a waste of time and gas?

Today, on May 20, the price of Aelf increased by another 10 percent, becoming the second best-performing cryptocurrency in the market for two straight days. Trend of Tokens\nThroughout May, tokens have demonstrated an intensified movement on both the upside and downside, following the price movement of bitcoin. As the price of declined, the value of tokens fell by substantially larger margins and as the price of bitcoin increased, the value of tokens surged significantly more than bitcoin.\nEssentially, investing in tokens in a recovery period with extreme volatility and uncertainty is similar to leverage trading and depending on the price trend of bitcoin, the value of tokens can either plunge or surge by large margins.\nOn May 17, the bitcoin price reached a two-month low at $7,925 and as the bitcoin price fell, the price of Aelf (ELF) and 0x (ZRX) also fell to their monthly lows. However, as the bitcoin price rebounded from $7,925 to $8,300, ELF rose from 0.00014 BTC to 0.000162 BTC and ZRX rose from 0.00015 to 0.000174 BTC, both recording large gains against bitcoin.\nDespite their 20 percent gains over the past 48 hours, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of both ELF and ZRX are at around 55, signifying a neutral zone for the two tokens. ELF and ZRX are still in an ideal position to record a short-term rally as the exponential and simple moving averages of both tokens demonstrate a positive price trend in the upcoming days.\nAs of current, because the price of most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) and tokens heavily rely on the short-term price trend of bitcoin, investors have to focus on the price movement of bitcoin throughout the next few days.\nIf the bitcoin price can sustain its momentum in the $8,400 region and break the $8,800 support level, it could enter the $9,000 region relatively quickly and secure a chance to surpass the $10,000 support level by the end of May. However, if the bitcoin price falls back below the $8,200 resistance level, it is possible that the bitcoin price falls back to the $7,900 region again, which is unlikely considering the stability in the price of bitcoin since May 18. Bitcoin Trend\nThe price of bitcoin has not been able to secure sufficient momentum to test the $8,800 support level which eventually could lead the bitcoin price to the $10,000 region in the short-term. The struggle of bitcoin can be attributed to the concerns of investors on major exchanges like Bitfinex that have started to demand users to forfeit their tax IDs and social security number, possibly due to increasing pressure from governments.\nAlthough Bitfinex is not the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, it is considered as one of the largest cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchange and the exchange’s new taxation policy led investors to panic and become fearful towards gains tax that could be imposed by the financial authorities in their countries.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

There is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,320 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may continue to rise in the short term, but it is likely to face sellers near $1,320-40.\nBitcoin cash price is showing positive signs above $1,150 against the US Dollar. However, upsides in BCH/USD are likely to be limited by the $1,320 resistance zone. Bitcoin Cash Price Upside Hurdle\nThis past week, there was a sharp increase in selling pressure on bitcoin cash price above $1,400 against the US Dollar. The price started a downside move and traded below the $1,350 and $1,280 support levels. There was even a break below the $1,200 pivot level, which opened the doors for more losses. It traded close to the $1,120 support level and a low was formed at $1,131.\nLater, the price started an upside correction and moved above the $1,120 resistance. It also moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,506 high to $1,131 low. However, there are many barriers on the upside near $1,300. An initial hurdle is near $1,128, which was a support earlier and it may now prevent gains . There is also a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,320 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,506 high to $1,131 low is positioned near $1,318 to act as a hurdle.\nLooking at the chart , the price may continue to rise in the near term towards $1,300. However, a break above $1,300 and $1,320 won’t be easy.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is moving back in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is heading towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,150", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "newsbtc bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T07:17:08.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c851cd3519f52e8572887dbce6bab4e158fbe6f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJUaACK3IPnkF_wuDBgBsJiNLmyVs4rhPGalWV3EXHu8QBKRR2N023LxW813zaHahoTMczB0DrhUrFSb.HNzmeUU5X8HBT4Tn7KSNvCMi6fT.3fiOif8FhNd9J276zwi00TwqDvgD42A--", "site_full": "blog.jamesbayley.com", "site": "jamesbayley.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Solves the Double Spending Problem and Creates Sound Money | Dr James Bayley", "title_full": "Bitcoin Solves the Double Spending Problem and Creates Sound Money | Dr James Bayley", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": null, "spam_score": 0.294, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c851cd3519f52e8572887dbce6bab4e158fbe6f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJUaACK3IPnkF_wuDBgBsJiNLmyVs4rhPGalWV3EXHu8QBKRR2N023LxW813zaHahoTMczB0DrhUrFSb.HNzmeUU5X8HBT4Tn7KSNvCMi6fT.3fiOif8FhNd9J276zwi00TwqDvgD42A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dr James Bayley", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Solves the Double Spending Problem and Creates Sound Money | Dr James Bayley", "text": "\nbitcoin , cryptocurrencies , proof of work\nThis post first appeared on my other blog Cryptoindex Guru.\nBitcoin is a step forwards because for the first time in the history of mankind someone has written a computer programme that solves the double spending problem in a decentralised network.

Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin is efficiently being used worldwide. Even though Bitcoin seems unreliable, it would not be surprising in the fact that currently 90% of the money exists online. Bitcoin is mined by the Bitcoin miners, and it is transacted through a P2P (peer to peer) method. Throughout the documentary, Satoshi Nakamoto explained two reasons why he or she created the Bitcoin. The first reason is due to unstable monetary value. To be specific, the imprudent inflation such as in Argentina caused significant problems and people no longer believed the government. The second reason is because the bank lost its credibility. The documentary gave an example in Ireland where people are suffering in financials. After the bank used most of their customers’ money, neither the bank nor the government did not focus on solving the problem. Thus, all the pain and agony were given to the normal citizens. On the other side, the documentary tells that in order for Bitcoin to be fully recognized, the consent from the government is necessary. In conclusion, the documentary explains the origin of Bitcoin and looks forward on how it will change the world.\n비트코인이란?\n2009년 1월 3일 나카모토 사토시가 개발한 세계 최초의 암호 / 가상 화폐.\n실제 현금과 비트코인을 바꿀 수 있다.\n일대일로 주고받는 *P2P 방식을 사용하기에 중간에 은행이나 신용카드사와 같은 금융기관이 간섭하지 않아 수수료가 거의 없거나 아예 없다.\n(*P2P란 Peer to Peer의 약자로, 인터넷에서 개인과 개인이 직접 연결되어 파일을 공유하는 것을 말한다. 기존의 공급자와 수요자 형태의 거래와는 달리 P2P는 모든 사람들이 공급자이면서 동시에 수요자가 되는 것이다. 쉽게 말해서 그냥 공평한 상태에서의 일대일 거래 라고 보면 된다.)\n(다만, 수수료는 거래할때 판매자가 직접 정할 수 있어 사실상 판매자 마음대로이다. 요즘에는 비트코인을 구하기 어려워진 탓에 조금씩 수수료를 붙이고 있다고 한다.)\n인터넷이 가능한 곳이면 태블릿 PC, 스마트폰 등 어느 기기나 지갑처럼 쓸 수 있다.\n상대방의 계좌정보와 금액을 입력한 후 전송하면 돈이 지불된다.\n최초의 실물거래는 피자 2판에 1만 비트코인을 지불한 것이 최초의 실물거래이다. 현재 1만 비트코인 2017년 12월 기준으로, 200억원 정도 된다. 2013년 초 13달러에 불과했던 비트코인은 한때 2014년에 1200달러 (약 127만원) 까지 치솟으며 세계의 관심사를 받고 있다. (현재 (2017년 12월 기준)는 약 1800만원~2400만원 사이를 왔다갔다 하고 있다.)\n나카모토 사토시는 비트코인 생산량을 2100만개 까지만 제한했다. 그러나 비트코인은 단순히 하나가 아니라 소수점 8자리, 즉 1BTC = 0. 1 까지 분할할 수 있기 때문에 적은 양의 화폐로 걱정할 필요는 없다.\n비트코인이 사용되는 예시:\n1. 일본 도쿄\n한 음식점에서 한달에 한번 정도 열리는 도쿄 비트코인 사용자 모임이 열렸다.\n비트코인으로 대금결제가 가능한 이곳은 일본 비트코인 사용자들의 아지트같은 곳이다.\nQR코드를 사용하여 돈을 지불한다.\n[로저 버 / 비트코인 투자자] 이걸 이용하면 세계 어디든, 국가와 상관없이 이 친구한테 돈을 줄 수 있어요.\n지난 4월, 일본에 있던 세계 최대 비트코인 환전소 * 마운트곡스 가 파산했지만 여전히 많은 사람들이 비트코인에 긍정적인 태도를 보이고 있다.\n2. 미국 뉴욕\n매주 월 & 목 사용자들이 모여 비트코인을 교환한다. 전광판에는 비트코인을 사겠다는 사람과 팔겠다는 사람들이 리스트에 오른다. 사려는 사람은 파는 사람에게 즉석으로 가서 현금을 주고 스마트폰으로 비트코인을 받는다. 보통 수만달러에서 수천만달러의 거래가 이루어진다.\n3. 독일 베를린\n도시 인구의 15%가 외국인인 베를린은 새로운 것에 대한 거부감이 적은 곳이다.\n한 게스트하우스의 숙박비는 40유로 (약 5만 5천원), 비트코인으로 결제가 가능하다.\n[바이스터 / 비트코인 게스트 하우스 운영자] 비트코인 매출액 비중이 처음에는 3~5%로 시작한 것 같은데 지금은 대략 10% 정도 됩니다.\n현재 베를린에는 비트코인으로 결제 가능한 가게가 50군데정도 된다. 그래서 베를린은 비트코인의 수도라고도 불린다.\n룸 77이라 불리는 한 가게는 비트코인으로 대금결제가 가능한 세계 최초의 오프라인 가게다. 은행보다 비트코인을 더 신뢰한다는 이유로 신용카드를 받지 않는다.\n4. 중국 베이징\n지난 5월 베이징에서 열린 비트코인 컨퍼런스. 이 컨퍼런스의 주도자인 리 샤오라이는 최소 10만 비트코인을 보유하고 있다. 원래 중국에서 유명한 영어 교사로 영어책 인쇄만 해도 1년에 8천만원 정도 벌었다.\n그는 트위터를 통해 비트코인에 대해 알게 되었다.\n중국에서 사는 조선인으로 국적에 혼란을 느끼던 때 비트코인은 국적이 없는 돈이라는 점에서 매료되었다.\n중국에서 비트코인을 이용한 상거래는 현재 금지되어있지만 위안화에 비트코인 구매는 비트코인 전체의 61%를 차지할 만큼 사람들은 비트코인에 관심이 많다.\n[리 샤오라이 / 비트코인 보유자] 인터넷이 세계를 변화시킨 이유는 정보를 이동시키는 비용을 ‘0’에 가깝게 만들었기 때문입니다. 정보의 유통비용이 없어졌기 때문에 모든 것이 다 정보화되었지요. 비트코인이 앞으로 어떤 큰 변화를 가져올지 아직 모르지만 우리는 꼭 변화가 있을 것이라고 믿고 있습니다.\n마운트곡스\n마운트곡스는 ‘매직: 더 개더링’ (Magic: The Gathering) 이라는 판타지 게임에서 사용하는 카드를 거래하는 시장으로 시작되어 2010년에 처음으로 가상화폐 비트코인 거래소로 사업을 넓혔다.\n경쟁자가 없어 마운트곡스는 무서운 속도로 성장해 최고의 자리까지 올라갔다. 그러나…\n마운트곡스는 평소에도 엉망진창인 운영으로 알려져있었다. 한 기업 관계자는 마운트곡스의 시스템 코드가 ‘스파게티’ 처럼 엉망이었으며 버그를 무시하기 일쑤였고 코드를 적용하기 전에 테스트도 안하고 곧바로 적용했다고 한다.\n그 후로 2011년 6월 누군가 훔쳐간 암호를 이용한 온라인 공격으로 약 875만 달러 (한화 약 92억원)에 이르는 비트코인이 도난당했다. 그 이후로도 여러가지 도난 사건으로 인해 마운트곡스는 결국 4월에 파산을 신청하게 된다.\n비트코인 채굴기\n비트코인은 인터넷상에서 파일 형태의 돈을 주고받는 시스템이다.\n채굴은 거래에 대해 네크워크 상의 인증이다.\n인증에 참여한 컴퓨터는 작은 양의 비트코인을 대가로 받는데, 이 과정을 채굴이라고 부른다.\n일대일로 사람들이 가치를 주고받음을 기록한 일종의 거래 장비이기도 하다.\n거래를 할 때마다 인증을 받기 때문에 복사도 안되고 이중지급도 할 수 없다.\n...는 너무 어려우니까 쉽게.\n일반 화폐는 중앙은행에서 찍어내는 반면, 비트코인은 그런 발행주체가 없어도 컴퓨터를 이용해 암호화 문제를 풀면 비트코인이 일정량 만들어지도록 보장되어 있다. 이를 채굴 이라고 하는데, 많은 컴퓨터가 문제를 풀수록 문제의 난이도가 높아져 전체 비트코인 시스템의 보안성이 더 강화된다.\n채굴을 하는, 이른바 ‘노드’라고 불리는 소프트웨어들은 계속하여 새로운 비트코인을 얻기 위해 암호화 문제를 찾아다닌다. 그러다 문제를 찾으면 풀고, 수천만개의 노드들이 경쟁해 가장 먼저 문제를 푸는 노드가 돈을 가져간다.\n노드가 돈을 가져가면 다른 노드들에게 신호를 보내고, 그 노드들은 또다른 문제를 찾아 나선다.\n한번 문제를 풀 때마다 문제의 난이도가 점점 어려워진다.\n비트코인이 묶음당 생성되는 양은 50 BTC를 넘지 않는다.\n[조광수 / 연세대학교 정보대학원 교수] 굉장히 기발한 아이디어였던 것 같아요. 그냥 ‘야 여기 돈 있어 같이 나눠 써’가 아니라 노력해서 캐내고 그 노력의 양이 바로 재화의 가치가 되는, 그리고 그것을 상대방들이 노력한 것을 인정하는 시스템이 만들어진 거죠. 저는 거기서 P2P 개념이 형성될 수 있었다고 봅니다.\n비트코인 채굴기를 사용하는 예시.\n1. 중 국 산시성\n이곳에는 비트코인 전문 채굴기가 2300대 이상 놓여있다.\n채굴기는 일반 컴퓨터보다 훨씬 빠른 속도의 * 그래픽카드 로 만들어진다.\n(*요즘은 그래픽카드를 쓰지 않고 비트코인 채굴만을 위해 개발된 ASIC, FPGA를 이용한 전용 채굴기를 사용한다. 이들은 성능이 일반 그래픽카드에 비해 9만 6천배 나 높다. 그러니 누가 그래픽카드를 쓰려 하겠는가? 그리고 최근에 일부 암호화 문제들은 그래픽카드로 풀 수 없다고 한다.)\n[리 수라이 / 리 샤오라이의 동생] 이 채굴기의 시중가격이 지금은 370만 원 정도 됩니다. 생산하는 효능은 한 달 전에는 비트코인이 4.7개 정도 나왔는데 그런데 지금은 한달에 1.5개 정도 채굴됩니다. (채굴) 난이도가 갑자기 올라가기 때문에 그렇게 된 겁니다.\n시간이 지날수록 전기비용이 많이 든다.\n2. 일본 도쿄\n오스트리아 출신인 빌헬름 씨는 직장 때문에 8년째 도쿄에 거주중이다.\n소프트웨어 엔지니어인 그는 비트코인 채굴자다.\n하지만 그의 채굴기는 오스트리아에 있어서, 스마트폰을 이용해 원격조종한다.\n그의 할아버지가 만든 작은 수력 발전소에서 생성하는 전기를 이용해 비트코인을 채굴한다.\n[알렉스 빌헬름 / 비트코인 채굴자] 작년 초 집에서 비트코인 채굴을 해보면 어떨까 하는 생각이 들었어요. 아버지께 말씀드리자 재미있을 것 같다고 하시더군요. 우리 발전소의 전기를 전력회사에 파는 것보다 더 많은 이익을 볼 수 있으니까요.\n만약 도쿄에서 도쿄 전기요금을 감안하여 비트코인을 채굴한다면 하루에 2~3만원 적자다.\n[알렉스 빌헬름 / 비트코인 채굴자] 비트코인당 가격이 웬만큼은 되어야 사람들이 계속해서 채굴에 참여할 겁니다. 채굴은 비트코인이 가지고 있는 보안 네트워크 구성 부분 중 하나예요. 시스템 운영을 위해 어느 정도 필요한 요소입니다. 하지만 채굴하는 데 전기요금이 많이 나온다면 수익성이 떨어지게 되고 사람들은 채굴기 작동을 중단하게 될 겁니다.\n비트코인의 장점\n1. 수수료\n미국 클리브랜드에 75년동안 운영하던 한 초콜릿 가게에서는 최근 비트코인을 받기 시작했다.\n[빌 미첼 / 초콜릿 가게 운영] 제가 아는 한 한국도 신용카드 쓰는데 수수료가 비싸겠죠. 신용카드를 받으면 비용이 늘어납니다. 그런데 비트코인은 수수료가 1% 정도밖에 안 돼요. 게다가 어떤 나라와의 화폐와도 교환할 수 있지요. 원하면 그냥 비트코인으로 보관해도 되구요.\n경제 불공황 이후로 홍보효과와 수수료 절감을 목표로 이 거리에 상인들이 비트코인을 도입하기로 했다.\n아르헨티나에 사는 산티아고 씨도 매출의 30%가 비트코인으로 이루어져있다. 송금 등 은행 서비스 이용에 수수료를 많이 내야하는 아르헨티나에서 비트코인은 매력적이었다.\n기모노 대여업자인 오치카 호리 씨도 신용카드에 비해 수수료도 매우 싸고 신속하게 돈을 받을 수 있는 비트코인을 적극 지지한다고 했다.\n한달에 100만원씩 고향에 사는 가족에게 돈을 보내는 앙헬라 꾸엔까는 그동안 수수료때문에 많은 고생을 해왔다. 수수료는 무려 10%에 이른다.\n국제 송금은 여러 나라에 거쳐 송금된다는 이유로 특히 저소득 국가일수록 은행들이 송금 수수료를 많이 받아왔다. 그러나 비트코인을 이용하면 송금 수수료를 전혀 내지 않아도 된다.\n(비트코인 → 가난한 사람들에게 더욱 도움).\n[수잔 에이시 / 스탠퍼드대학교 경영대학원 교수] 경제학자들은 거래에 비용이 드는 것을 싫어합니다. 우리는 거래가 자유롭게 이루어지고, 빨리 이루어지기를 바랍니다. 그래야 경제가 더 활발해집니다. 보다 많은 상거래가 이루어지고 경제가 성장하게 되는 거죠. 가상화폐는 직, 간접적으로 수수료 없이 상거래가 가능하다는 것을 보여줍니다. 굉장한 거죠.\n2. 화폐 가치의 보장\n나카모토 사토시가 비트코인을 만든 지 한달 후에 자신이 비트코인을 만든 이유를 올렸다.\n“우리는 중앙은행이 우리의 화폐 가치를 지켜줄 것이라고 믿지만 신용화폐의 역사는 그런 믿음에 대한 배신의 연속이었다”\n자본주의 경제에서 적절한 인플레이션은 좋다. 투자를 유발한다. 하지만 도를 넘는 인플레이션은 독과도 같다.\n예를 들어 독일 하이퍼인플레이션이 있다. 무분별한 화폐 발행으로 인해 화폐는 휴지조각이 되어버렸었다.\n0.5 마르크였던 빵 한 조각이 1923년에는 1000억 마르크까지 치솟았다.\n[알터 파터 / 베를린자유대학 명예교수] 1923년에 정점에 달했던 1919~1923년의 인플레이션에 인한 피해가 1차 세계대전의 첫 4년보다 물질적인 피해는 더 컸다고까지 말합니다. 전쟁에서는 인명피해가 엄청났던 것이 사실이지만 인플레이션으로 인해서도 자살과 기아로 인한 인명피해가 있었어요.\n최근 국가 부도 위기를 맞고 있는 아르헨티나. 많은 상점이 문을 닫고 경기는 침체되었고, 페소 가치가 급격하게 떨어져 고스란히 물가상승으로 이어졌다\n아르헨티나는 그동안 주기적으로 인플레이션을 겪어왔다. 정부는 10%라고 주장하지만 사실상 25~30%로 세계 최고치다.\n사람들은 더 이상 아르헨티나 페소화에 대한 신뢰를 잃고 자신의 재산을 지킬 수단으로 비트코인을 택했다.\n2013년 3월 키프로스 예금인출 사태. 구제금 조건으로 은행 일부의 세금을 걷어가겠다는 EU의 방침때문이었다. 사람들은 재산을 지키기 위해 비트코인에 몰려들었고, 46달러였던 1비트코인은 한달에 230달러까지 치솟았다.\n작년 11월 중국에서도 위안화에 대한 불신으로 비트코인을 대량 사기도 했다.\n3. 은행에 대한 불신\n사토시가 올린 또다른 글.\n“우리는 은행이 우리의 돈을 잘 보관해줄 것이라고 믿지만 은행은 지극히 낮은 준비금만 남기고 *신용버블을 일으킬 정도로 대출을 해왔다.”\n실제로 지폐 발행량을 결정하는 것은 중앙은행의 고유 권한이지만, 특정 시기에 경제 전체에서 쓸 수 있는 화폐인 통화량은 발행량보다 늘 많다.\n정부 통화보다 은행 예금이 6배정도 더 많다.\n지급 준비제도 때문에 은행은 예금된 돈을 일부만 남기고 대출해준다. 대출금은 누군가의 예금으로 은행에 들어오고 은행은 이를 다시 대출해준다. 이 과정에서 원래 현금의 몇배가 유통된다.\n그러나 은행에 문제가 생겨 예금자들이 몰려들면 은행은 지급불능에 빠진다.\n그 예시에 2008년 미국 금융위기. 빈번하게 이러한 일들이 일어난다. 은행 예금에 대한 근거가 위험하다고 볼 수 있다.\n(*신용버블이란 대체로 경제학에서 말하는 ‘버블’이란 무언가가 원래 가치보다 과대평가된 것을 말한다. 예를 들어 원래 5억원이었던 빌딩이 워낙 건물을 사는 사람들이 많아져 10억원까지 뛰어올랐을 때 이를 버블이라고 한다.)\n혹시 이해를 못하시는 분들을 위한 설명.\n예를 들어 은행에 돈을 맡긴다고 하자.\n대부분의 사람들은 은행이 그저 자신의 돈을 잘 가지고 있을 것이라고 믿겠지만, 은행은 그 돈을 무조건적으로 주인이 찾아갈 때까지 보관해두는게 아니라, 비상시에 쓸 돈 일부만 남기고 (이것이 지급 준비제도) 나머지는 사람들에게 대출을 해준다던가 그런곳에 투자를 한다.\n(안좋게 말하면 은행은 사람들의 신뢰를 이용한 대형 사기단체라고 볼 수 있다.)\n그러나 만약 경제위기가 오면, 은행이 망할 것을 두려워한 많은 사람들이 한꺼번에 돈을 찾으러 갈것이다. 그럼 문제가 생긴다. 은행은 이미 투자하는데 거의 모든 돈을 다 썼기 때문에 사람들에게 줄 돈이 없는 것이다.\n2010년 구제금융을 받은 아일랜드.\n사람들이 “은행은 구제금융 받고 우리는 팔려나갔다.”며 시위를 하고 있다.\n한때 고도성장을 하던 아일랜드는 국가 부도 사태에 몰려 2010년 구제금융을 신청한다.\n부동산 대출을 일삼던 시중 은행들이 2008년 * 리먼 브라더스 파산 이후로 위기에 빠졌고 이를 구하고자 시중 은행에 부채 지급보중을 섰던 아일랜드도 더 이상 버틸 수 없었기 때문이다.\n구제금융의 여파는 지금도 이어지고 있다.\n정부는 빚을 갚기 위해 복지 축소 & 증세 (세금 늘림), 특히 수도세 증가로 사람들은 연간 50만원 추가 부담을 하게 되었다.\n몇몇 사람들이 수도 계량기를 설치하려는 정부 계약 업체 자동차를 몸으로 막아섰다. 7주 째 이러한 사태가 벌어지고 있다.\n전체 세금에서 자동차세가 5%, 부가세에서 수도세가 2%가 나갔다.\n탐사 보도 저널리스트인 폴 윌리엄스는 특종 기사를 내놓았다. 2008년 앵글로 아이리시 은행 임원들의 통화내용을 공개했다.\n2008년에 은행 임원들이 70억 유로를 빌리려고 중앙 은행에 갔는데, 당시 한 은행 임원이 다른 임원에게 어떻게 갚을 것이냐고 물었다. 이 돈은 아일랜드 정부의 돈인데, 임원은 웃으며 안 갚는다고 하였다. 안 내놓으면 모두가 망한다는 식으로 말했다.\n노엘 하프만 씨는 은퇴한 노인이다. 2년 전 악성 종양을 이마 피부에 발견한 그는 종양이 목까지 퍼져 수술을 받았지만 4년전부터 정부에서 의료혜택을 받을 수 없게 되었다.\n인구가 약 400만명인 아일랜드에 빈 집은 40만개가 넘는다. 그러나 의아하게도 10만명의 사람들이 사는 집이 없다.\n사람들은 이러한 악순환이 부동산 가격을 떠받치려는 정부의 정책 탓이라고 비판한다.\n[리차드 보이드 바렛 / 아일랜드 국회의원] 정부는 국민들보다 은행을 보고 있고 우선순위에 두고 있습니다. 은행이 대부분의 자산을 보유하고 임대가격이나 부동산 가격의 상승이 은행의 이혜관계에 직결되고 있어서 정부의 정책은 집값 상승을 조장하고 있습니다. 이렇게 가격이 올라가니 국민들은 소외되고 있습니다. 유감스럽게도 아일랜드 경제 위기의 중심에는 은행이 있습니다.\n*리먼 브라더스\n한때 미국의 4대 투자은행 중 하나였던 거대 금융그룹으로, 1850년 헨리 리먼(Henry Lehman), 이매뉴얼 리먼(Emanuel Lehman), 그리고 메이어 리먼(Mayer Lehman) 형제가 목화중개 무역업을 시작하여 유통, 교역, 조사연구 등으로 사업을 확장해 가면서 명성을 쌓아갔다.\n2007년 미국 부동산 가격 하락과 함께 대규모 손실을 입었고 추가 투자가 없을 경우 위태로운 상황이었다.\n결국 2008년 9월 14일 파산하였고 기네스북에 최대 파산규모로 올라갔다.\n2등인 월드컴 파산규모와 13배 차이가 나는 한화 700조 원의 파산 이었다.\n비트코인의 단점\n한 교수는 “비트코인이 이 문제들을 사라지게 하진 않는다. 은행은 결국 지급 준비금을 비트코인으로 예금으로 하고 대출도 비트코인으로 하는 시스템으로 바뀔 것이다. 은행은 실수도 하지만, 저축과 투자의 균형을 맞추는 사회에서 매우 중요한 역할을 한다. 경제가 성장하려면 저축으로 투자를 해야 하는데 이 과정에서 은행을 빼면 신체에서 심장을 빼내는 것과 같다.” 라고 말했다.\n또한 비트코인은 물가가 불안정하다. 계속 곤두박질을 치다가도 미친듯이 올라가기 때문에, 비트코인은 그저 재테크 수단에 불과하지 않는다.\n결론\n한 호텔 카지노에 비트코인 ATM이 설치되어 있다.\n보안을 위해 사용자의 손바닥을 스캔한 후 비트코인을 바로 사거나 팔 수 있다.\n비트코인을 살 때에는 가장 실용적인 값의 거래소를 찾아 교환해준다.\n현재 비트코인 ATM은 13개국에 설치되어 있고, 12종류의 화폐를 환전할 수 있다.\n비트코인은 불법적인 일에도 악용될 수 있고, 환전소 파산으로 많은 사람들이 돈을 잃기도 했었다.\n비트코인이 좋은 목적으로 이용되려면 가장 중요한건 정부의 허락이다.\n합법적으로 쓰기 어려우면 모두 불법적인 방법에 투자할 것이고 그 방향으로 진화할 것이다.\n270여 종의 가상 화폐들이 있다.\n국가 권력이 통제할 수 없는 이 화폐를 어떻게 통제하고 관리할 지 많은 나라들이 고민중이다.\n정부의 규제가 없으면 비트코인의 미래는 밝을 것이다.\n신용카드도 문제가 있으니까. 대형마트 ‘타깃’은 개인 정보 유출로 최근 4억 달러의 손실을 봤다고 한다.\n그리고 현재의 제도에 집착할 이유가 없다.\n비트코인이 얼마나 확산되는가는 정부와 은행, 그리고 비트코인의 싸움이 될 것이다.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Photo: MichaelWuensch, Pixabay\nBitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are once again in the headlines. The current news revolves around the looming Bitcoin Cash hard fork which many people speculate might affect the market. Bitcoin had a fairly great week that saw it gain 2.49% after a fall of about 0.18%.\nBitcoin’s strong recovery was recorded over the day with the FIB retracement level and support levels painting a clear picture of the progress. Bitcoin has enjoyed a long stay at the top of the market since it was launched. The position of the crypto has however been challenged by various other alternative currencies including Bitcoin Cash. Admiral Markets has on several occasions testified of Bitcoin’s performance in the market.\nThe breakthroughs made by Bitcoin to move from $8,628 to $8,884.5 has sent a lot of positive signals in the market. Investors have gained a lot of confidence not only from the great performance but by the consolidation that definitely has chances of being sustained. The hope for many players in the industry, and especially investors, is that Bitcoin will finally break the $9,000 barrier and possibly hold for a while. This would ease a lot of pressure in the market and create the vibrancy that is needed. The barrier will quite possibly be broken during the course of the week as the current lows have sustained beyond ordinary levels. The opinion in the market will have the final say on Bitcoin’s prospects Photo: WorldSpectrum, Pixabay\nOne overriding feeling currently is that the overall opinion in the market will ultimately determine where the selling pressure will end up taking Bitcoin. The resistance levels are definitely going to be above $9,000. This is where the Bitcoin Cash hard fork will come in. The extremities of the resistance levels will be reliant on the hard fork since it will be in great focus. The possible repercussions of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork\nThe Bitcoin Cash hard fork is expected to come with some repercussions for Bitcoin. Even though BTC is way much stronger than BCH, the market for Bitcoin is still very much affected by any developments made on BCH. Since the newer crypto was launched in mid-2017, analysts and investors have progressively continued to watch the possible shock waves that could be instigated by BCH. So far, only a few things have changed. BCH has only managed to marginally affect BTC since the former crypto is still getting its foothold in the market.\nThe market is currently thus in a short limbo as the opinion remains diverse. Some are anticipating an increase in demand for BTC while others think that the demand might actually drop. Whether the demand ultimately increases or drops, there will definitely be repercussions on either of the cryptocurrencies. Most people specifically care about the effect that BCH will have on BTC since a lot of investment is apparent in the latter. A negative outcome would thus put Bitcoin in oblivion until the market reverts back to normalcy. Photo: Supplied\nThe failure of Bitcoin to cross the $9,000 barrier will definitely result in a market upheaval. The selling pressure will be apparent and it is highly likely that the drop that will ensue will take over a day to recover. A drop to the lows of around $8,000 will particularly be damaging and any price levels lower than that will be a clear sign of major turbulence. The expected market status\nEven though the BCH hard fork has major aftereffects in the market, the wait that has already been prevalent in the market has had major consequences. The clash between the two cryptos that will come after the hard fork will thus only add to a disturbance that has already started and which will persist despite the bearish trends of Bitcoin. The demand for either currency might not change significantly but the support and resistance levels will definitely move a lot.\nThe BTC/BCH clash is one that is definitely a characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. Any time there are major or even minor movements in this market, there are always bound to be some sort of upheaval. The movements in the market are however never sustained to the extent where major shifts. The Bitcoin Cash hard fork is thus probably the major event to watch in the market before other developments in the crypto market ensue.

According to local media , the state is currently considering a draft proposal concerning crypto donations for political campaigns. Colorado is Joining the Trend\nWayne Williams, the Colorado Secretary of State, submitted the proposal earlier in the week. According to the details of the draft, Bitcoin donations would comply with the same rules as cash donations. Due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the value of such donations are determined at the time of the contribution. Wayne Williams, Colorado Secretary of State\nCommenting on the move, Suzanne Staiert, the Deputy Secretary of State, said:\nThe FEC is doing it now, so we are just going along for the ride.\nWith the move under consideration, the state government welcomes comments from the general public. Interested persons can contact the office of the Colorado Secretary of State on or before May 23rd. Bitcoin in Politics\nDonations are an integral part of the American political landscape and sometimes play a profound role in shaping policy developments. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies indeed play a significant role in the political campaign fundraising arena.\nSince the Federal Election Commission approved cryptocurrency contributions to campaign financing in 2014, its use has increased considerably. The FEC’s decision categorized such contributions as “in-kind donations.” New Hampshire was the first to jump on the trend back in 2014 when Republican Andrew Hemingway became the first U.S. politician to accept Bitcoin contributions.\nRand Paul also accepted crypto donations during his 2016 presidential bid. To date, the largest reported crypto donation to a political campaign is the 0.284 BTC ($4,500) received by Austin Petersen from Missouri. Presently, Congressional hopeful Patrick Nelson from New York is accepting Bitcoin donations to his campaign via Bitpay.\nThere are those who oppose the adoption of crypto contributions in campaign fundraising. Issues arising from anonymity and the risk of “dirty money” being funneled into politics are top of the list of objections against the trend. The lack of full transparency in crypto transactions seems for some to be at odds with the philosophy of political donations in America. There is also the problem of volatility which makes cryptos an enormous accounting headache. Even Staiert agrees, saying:\nIt’s going to be an accounting problem, potentially, for campaigns who want to use it.\nDoes the anonymous nature of crypto transactions pose a problem when used for political donations? Do you think Bitcoin political donations should be legalized?

Now, the PRC is the first country to come out with official government crypto rankings. Its China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) used three filters through which coins would be judged: innovation, technology, application. Rather surprisingly to some enthusiasts, bitcoin core (BTC) didn’t even crack the top ten, while bitcoin cash (BCH) almost didn’t make the list at all.\nAlso read: Alec Baldwin’s Lambo Movie Backed by Crypto Tech China Lists Ethereum as Best in Crypto Class\nIn what is either widely being referred to as a case of communist schizophrenia or a passive nod to the inevitable financial future, the PRC’s CCID released its first set of cryptocurrency rankings. China, of course, outright banned crypto in all its various forms, and the broader market was thought to have plummeted for a time as a result. That it is now publishing coin rankings is confusing to many observers.\nCN Ledger, a popular Twitter handle, was the first to expose the rankings to the outside world. Its author, Eric Zhao, explained how “most old-school experts haven’t followed the crypto space long enough to grasp some of the traits of tech and community that can’t be found elsewhere.”\nIndeed, this year found Weiss Ratings’ inaugural list of their rankings, as these pages reported. It too was very controversial. “The eagerly-anticipated report rates 74 of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, scoring them from A to D,” we wrote. “Such was the level of interest in the report, the company’s website was knocked offline as interest peaked on Wednesday morning. Weiss Ratings include some controversial scores for currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum that are sure to spark debate.” Then, as now, BTC ranked lower than Ethereum. Weiss spent a great deal of time defending their decision.\nMr. Zhao hoped the CCID effort signals a kind of new opening. “I believe at least it’s a sign that the officials are starting to treat crypto projects more like a neutral endeavour towards better technology and innovations, rather than just challenging the power and authority of banks and government,” he stressed. BTC Listed 13 of 28\nJust a week ago, the PRC ministry surprised enthusiasts with a press release announcing its Global Public Chain Assessment Index . “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide for government, enterprise and research institute,” news.Bitcoin.com quoted the government notice as stating.\nThe Center for Information Industry Development used three main criteria in scoring cryptocurrencies, though scant information exists about methodology. Application, innovation, technology were used to place 28 total cryptos and their respective blockchains (which the rankings, at least at first glance, weigh heavily).\nOf the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum ranked first, followed by bitcoin core (BTC) at number 13, ripple in the 17th spot, and bitcoin cash (BCH) lagging well behind them all at the lowly number 25 of 28. For the CCID, however, the top five cryptos to their liking include ether, steem, lisk, neo, komodo. For those who worry about such rankings, PRC appears to, again, value blockchains over currencies – a common refrain heard in the Western corporate world. If, alternatively, one were to assess various cryptocurrencies according to their efficacy as mediums of exchange, BCH and BTC would likely rank quite high, and could be considered a most obvious threat to a regime bent on control. Whatever the case, cracks do happen inside the communist stronghold: quite a few crypto tech related patents are owned by China, its central bank has openly mused about state-backed crypto, and, of course, its burgeoning video game industry is very bullish on tokens and distributed ledgers. And just announced , “The most popular stock trading app in China, Straight Flush (同花顺), now adds support for showing the price of Crypto-Currencies.”\nDid you think China’s rankings will have any real impact?

The latest to take the leap is Marc O’Brien, ex-CEO of Visa’s U.K. and Ireland operations, who was just appointed as CEO of Crypterium — a crypto bank for the cryptoverse.\nSubscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts\nO’Brien Not a Stranger to Crypto\nO’Brien’s resume is a blend of institutional and semi-institutional experience, which should help Crypterium advance its company goals going forward.\nBefore joining Crypterium, O’Brien of course previously served as a Visa CEO in Europe for six years, and prior to that, the growth strategist advised Mastercard.\nO’Brien pictured.\nAfter leaving Visa in 2014, O’Brien advised Revolut, a digital banking alternative that recently jumped on the crypto bandwagon by offering multiple crypto-focused services.\nAs such, O’Brien’s presumably already more up to speed on the cryptocurrency ecosystem than some executives that have made similar leaps.\nSlowly Replacing Fiat with Crypto\nAt present, paying for daily consumables with cryptocurrency is sometimes not optimal due to processing times. Crypterium’s mission is to facilitate transactions that would be processed instantly.\n“What Crypterium will do is make that whole process seamless and give an opportunity for a consumer to actually use their cryptocurrency to pay for everyday items,” noted O’Brien.\nThe newly-appointed CEO’s primary task to boot will be to roll out the Crypterium App that claims to allow cryptocurrency payments with the same convenience as cash or credit cards.\nCrypterium also offers to let users link their crypto accounts to mobile payments services, allowing them to pay at NFC terminals.\nInterestingly, the company’s process of converting crypto to money is accomplished without being affected by wild fluctuations in values, per O’Brien, who claims the achievement to be the company’s “Secret Sauce.”\nHe said:\n“That card will be attached to a wallet that we’ve created and every time the consumer makes a transaction we will receive a request for that transaction in our systems, we will check the bitcoin or ether account and provided that they’ve got sufficient balance we will execute a trade and mark their bitcoin balance for a trade and approve the transaction. You can be in a store and all of that’s done in a fraction of a second.”\nUnder the new leadership, the crypto bank envisions expanding globally in a bid to become a major service provider. If successful, the project could become a ray of hope in countries suffering from high inflation rates, such as Nigeria, as individuals suffering from the volatility of national currencies that are even higher than that of bitcoin could store their wealth in digital assets and liquidate or pay for services as required, offering higher financial stability.\nCan cryptocurrency replace fiat money any time soon?

The regulator started gathering information about these platforms after receiving complaints about them.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Warning to Investors\nThe Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) published an Investor Alert on Friday, warning the public of five firms that “appear to be involved in schemes that target Ontario investors and encourage them to trade or invest in cryptocurrencies,” stating:\nBtcreal, Bitserial, Hypercube Ventures LP, Cabincoin OÜ, and Baappay Inc. are not registered in Ontario to solicit investments or provide advice on investing in, buying or selling securities.\nThe Commission started gathering information on several crypto trading platforms last month after it received a number of complaints about them, CBC reported, adding that to date no platform has been recognized by the OSC as an exchange or exempted from recognition. Any platform that offers cryptocurrencies that fit the definition of securities “must determine whether it is a marketplace. Marketplaces are required to comply with the rules governing exchanges or alternative trading systems,” the news outlet elaborated.\nLast month, the OSC issued an Investor Alert on Bitconnect, Bitconnect Coin and the BCC Exchange. “Bitconnect, the BCC Exchange and representatives of Bitconnect are not registered in Ontario to solicit investments or provide advice on investing in, buying or selling securities,” the regulator wrote. The Five Unregistered Firms\nThe first firm mentioned in Friday’s warning is Btcreal . This company “claims to provide full investment services for cryptocurrency-related investments and forex,” promising investors “high returns in short periods of time,” the OSC described. The company’s website advertises “6 high ROI [Return On Investment] plans.”\nThe next company is Bitserial which “claims to offer opportunities to invest in BTE Tokens.” The firm also “encourages investors to participate in a lending program where they can exchange bitcoin, litecoin, or ethereum for BTE Tokens that are ‘lent out’ for high returns,” the Commission detailed.\nThe third company is Hypercube Ventures LP which manages multiple websites to encourage investors to buy “emission pools” in order to generate “VNN cryptocurrency,” according to the Commission.\nThe fourth is Cabincoin OÜ which “is currently advertising an unregistered token sale for Cabincoin Tokens,” claiming that “the future value of these tokens will far exceed their initial price,” the OSC wrote.\nThe last on the list is Baappay Inc. which “is a multi-layered platform that integrates both fiat and cryptocurrency payment services for merchants, that will confirm and guarantee all payments in seconds,” its website describes. The OSC says this company “is also currently advertising an unregistered token sale.”\nWhat do you think of the OSC’s warning?

The latest is an ex-CEO of Visa UK and Ireland. ‘SEAMLESS’ PAYMENTS\nThe former CEO of Visa UK and Ireland has joined a cryptocurrency startup looking to make cards for everyday shopping.\nMarc O’Brien, CEO of Visa UK and Ireland from 2008 to 2014, was announced as CEO of cryptocurrency payments startup Crypterium on Thursday. Crypterium calls itself a “cryptobank” that lets you pay with tokens via NFC, QR codes or in online stores.\nThe startup plans to partner with Visa and Mastercard to make cryptocurrency cards that charge your virtual wallet in “a fraction of a second,” he said in an interview with Business Insider .\nO’Brien explained:\nThat card will be attached to a wallet that we’ve created and every time the consumer makes a transaction we will receive a request for that transaction in our systems, we will check the bitcoin or ether account and provided that they’ve got sufficient balance we will execute a trade and mark their bitcoin balance for a trade and approve the transaction.\nIt can sometimes take up to a week to exchange cryptocurrency into your bank account, but O’Brien said the startup will speed up the process so people can make everyday purchases.\n“What Crypterium will do is make that whole process seamless and give an opportunity for a consumer to actually use their cryptocurrency to pay for everyday items,” he said.\nO’Brien claims Crypterium’s “secret sauce” intellectual property will protect transactions from the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nThe startup also has global ambitions. O’Brien said Crypterium has a “unique opportunity” to appeal to consumers as a “safe haven” in high-inflation markets such as Turkey and Argentina.\n“The concern that many of them might have about getting access to that currency in a short space of time for immediate spending,” he said, “we’re going to be in a position to bridge that gap and make it an instant gratification,” O’Brien said.\nCrypterium currently has a team of three people in London and ten in Moscow and is considering offices in New York, Singapore, and Miami. He added that they plan to release their first products in autumn.\nBut the startup faces competition in the space. Another payments company, Bitpay, already offers a Visa card that can be used in the United States . And Singapore-based startup TenX has created a virtual card to make cryptocurrency payments easy while traveling. FROM FINANCE TO CRYPTO\nCrypterium isn’t the first crypto startup to poach former executives from traditional financial institutions. But an ex-JPMorgan trader turned cryptocurrency fund manager has gone so far to say banks “ have absolutely failed to innovate ” when it comes to cryptocurrency.\nDaniel Masters, who ran JPMorgan’s energy trading business in the 1990s, called cryptocurrency a “true revolution” and cast doubt on the willingness of conventional financial service companies to adopt it.\nFrom his interview in February with Business Insider :\nThe analogue financial services companies are not in this game at all. They don’t want to touch the core currency, which is Bitcoin or ethereum, they’re suspicious about the industry itself. A lot of people think it’s a criminal enterprise and a Ponzi scheme and a scam.\nWhat do you think of making cryptocurrency cards for everyday shopping?

Now, the PRC is the first country to come out with official government crypto rankings. Its China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) used three filters through which coins would be judged: innovation, technology, application. Rather surprisingly to some enthusiasts, bitcoin core (BTC) didn’t even crack the top ten, while bitcoin cash (BCH) almost didn’t make the list at all.\nAlso read: Alec Baldwin’s Lambo Movie Backed by Crypto Tech China Lists Ethereum as Best in Crypto Class\nIn what is either widely being referred to as a case of communist schizophrenia or a passive nod to the inevitable financial future, the PRC’s CCID released its first set of cryptocurrency rankings. China, of course, outright banned crypto in all its various forms, and the broader market was thought to have plummeted for a time as a result. That it is now publishing coin rankings is confusing to many observers.\nCN Ledger, a popular Twitter handle, was the first to expose the rankings to the outside world. Its author, Eric Zhao, explained how “most old-school experts haven’t followed the crypto space long enough to grasp some of the traits of tech and community that can’t be found elsewhere.”\nIndeed, this year found Weiss Ratings’ inaugural list of their rankings, as these pages reported. It too was very controversial. “The eagerly-anticipated report rates 74 of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, scoring them from A to D,” we wrote. “Such was the level of interest in the report, the company’s website was knocked offline as interest peaked on Wednesday morning. Weiss Ratings include some controversial scores for currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum that are sure to spark debate.” Then, as now, BTC ranked lower than Ethereum. Weiss spent a great deal of time defending their decision.\nMr. Zhao hoped the CCID effort signals a kind of new opening. “I believe at least it’s a sign that the officials are starting to treat crypto projects more like a neutral endeavour towards better technology and innovations, rather than just challenging the power and authority of banks and government,” he stressed. BTC Listed 13 of 28\nJust a week ago, the PRC ministry surprised enthusiasts with a press release announcing its Global Public Chain Assessment Index . “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide for government, enterprise and research institute,” news.Bitcoin.com quoted the government notice as stating.\nThe Center for Information Industry Development used three main criteria in scoring cryptocurrencies, though scant information exists about methodology. Application, innovation, technology were used to place 28 total cryptos and their respective blockchains (which the rankings, at least at first glance, weigh heavily).\nOf the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum ranked first, followed by bitcoin core (BTC) at number 13, ripple in the 17th spot, and bitcoin cash (BCH) lagging well behind them all at the lowly number 25 of 28. For the CCID, however, the top five cryptos to their liking include ether, steem, lisk, neo, komodo. For those who worry about such rankings, PRC appears to, again, value blockchains over currencies – a common refrain heard in the Western corporate world. If, alternatively, one were to assess various cryptocurrencies according to their efficacy as mediums of exchange, BCH and BTC would likely rank quite high, and could be considered a most obvious threat to a regime bent on control. Whatever the case, cracks do happen inside the communist stronghold: quite a few crypto tech related patents are owned by China, its central bank has openly mused about state-backed crypto, and, of course, its burgeoning video game industry is very bullish on tokens and distributed ledgers. And just announced , “The most popular stock trading app in China, Straight Flush (同花顺), now adds support for showing the price of Crypto-Currencies.”\nDid you think China’s rankings will have any real impact?

While the bank earlier this month announced plans for a bitcoin trading desk and a futures contract tied to bitcoin, its embrace of bitcoin has been undermined by Blankfein’s stated doubts. Blankfein’s Doubts\nIn late November, he called bitcoin a tool for fraud when its price reached $10,000, amidst reports the company was exploring a cryptocurrency trading desk. He denied the company had a bitcoin strategy and said the cryptocurrency’s volatility made it a bad store of value. If it stops fluctuating 20% in a day, he said he’d reconsider.\nBlankfein had said previously he was “open” to bitcoin and that he would not allow his own opinions to impact the company’s strategy.\nIn early November, he said bitcoin could prove to be the “next step” in money’s evolution. While he was uncomfortable with bitcoin, he said he felt the same skepticism with cell phones when he first encountered them.\nOver the years, he noted, he has learned a lot of things work out that he does not love. He went as far as to say that in the new world, it is possible a consensual arrangement about value could exist rather than a government fiat. If bitcoin did become mainstream, he said it would be hard money’s natural evolution.\nThen in mid-November, he said he didn’t like bitcoin and it could be a bubble.\nThe future without Blankfein remains unclear.\nA Goldman Sachs spokesperson said most people involved in the bitcoin operation are still skeptical about it. Bank Acknowledges Activity, Cites Uncertainty\nThe company disclosed in a Feb. 26 filing with the SEC that its cryptocurrency and blockchain related investments and its intention to support clients’ bitcoin futures trades could hurt the company should there be issues with blockchain protocols.\nBitcoin, however, is only one of many uncertainties the bank faces going forward.\nIts mergers and acquisitions advising is far less profitable than before the financial crisis, The New York Times reported, and consumer and investment banking aren’t large enough to make up the difference.\nThe bank has since bolstered its investment banking into mid-size cities and expanded its online lending and currencies and commodities trading for big corporations.\nFeatured image from Flickr.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blankfein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lloyd blankfein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bestowing complex bitcoin relationship goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T13:51:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d80fa6d4ec7c4088564ac5e8bff650babe08bb31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2TvhHZLPLwBdJPdYoq7O0PCYuAW4WK3HvOdjb0sOArXWkWgPK8q8HihqGKAJ2Mw9Nm.xe1gSoP_j7gZqDezHgfuiRrPg.k0s82Rqk.d6guWhDX4dtJpKbVlg--", "site_full": "feedproxy.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #366 Outside Perspectives ⋆ Tech Talk", "title_full": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #366 Outside Perspectives ⋆ Tech Talk", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://beat.10ztalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lets-talk-bitcoin-364-the-internet-of-money-five-years-later-live-uncut-1024x1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d80fa6d4ec7c4088564ac5e8bff650babe08bb31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2TvhHZLPLwBdJPdYoq7O0PCYuAW4WK3HvOdjb0sOArXWkWgPK8q8HihqGKAJ2Mw9Nm.xe1gSoP_j7gZqDezHgfuiRrPg.k0s82Rqk.d6guWhDX4dtJpKbVlg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #366 Outside Perspectives ⋆ Tech Talk", "text": "\nAdam speaks with Ari from Neural Capital about crypto hedge funds and a “fund of funds” security token.\nNew Stuff:\nTip LTB via the Lightning Network!

They're brave, optimistic and creative.\nRemind me how malleable the world really is.\nHow easy it is to bring positive change and create a more inclusive and fair society.\nGabriel Kurman and his team from RSK, motivated by cypherpunk values, created a game changing innovation on top of the Bitcoin blockchain .\nRSK enables the execution of smart contracts running on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain, the most secure and decentralized network.\nSmart contracts are self-executing protocols that execute the terms of a contract.\nRSK has a two-way peg to Bitcoin, and allows merge mining.\nThis means that from now on Bitcoin miners can profit from the smart contract revolution.\nThe original \"rootstockers\", include Sergio Demián Lerner, Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, Rubén Ariel Altman, Adrián Eidelman, Gabriel Kurman, and Adrián Garelik.\nThe organization has partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Coinsilium, AntPool, Bitmain, Digital Currency Group, Xapo, BitPay, Wings, BitGo just to name a few. ​\nOn Friday Gabriel Kurman, Co-Founder of RSK Labs and Adrian Eidelman CTO of RSK Labs from Argentina, visited the Denver based Ethereum Meetup Group, hosted by Kent Barton and Sasha Shtern, after attending the Consensus 2018 conference in New York City earlier this week.\nGabriel explained, that RSK is merge mined with Bitcoin now, but soon it will be merge mined with Litecoin, Dash, Bcash and potentially many more coins in future.\nRSK extends Bitcoin's functionality with side chains. Side chains are independent blockchains, that allow tokens to be securely used in a separate blockchain and then moved back to the parent-blockchain if needed.\nThe original parent chain is referred to as Main Chain, in this case Bitcoin.\nThe side chain is attached to the main chain by a two-way peg. Merge Mining allows a Bitcoin miner to simultaneously apply the same processing power to a secondary chain for no additional cost. The drawback to merge mining is that it requires miners to give up bandwidth in order to receive transactions from merge mined chain.\nRSK's vision by combining blockchain technology with smart contracts is to help transition society into the new era of the \"Internet of Value\" , enabling anyone to exchange any kind of value from a boat to a token using this technology.\nRSK team has been in this space for quite a long time. Diego got involved with Bitcoin in 2011 and since 2012 he completely devote himself to the creation of the Argentinean and Latin American Bitcoin communities.\nRSK has been running \"La Bit Conf\" , which is the largest and most important Latin American Bitcoin and blockchain conference in the region for the past 5 years.\nThe next La Bit Conf is in December 2018 in Chile .\nRSK also involved in several blockchain non for profit projects.\nOne of these initiatives is Blockchain 4 Humanity , a decentralized social accelerator supporting blockchain companies that are working on projects which can improve society. Some of these projects : Decentralized ID, Micro-lending, transparent government\nGabriel is incredibly passionate about social transformation through blockchain technology and the RSK team is committed to help those billions of users who are desperate to use blockchain technology.\nBillions of users, who need micro-loans and micro-finance solutions.\nI am definitively rooting for Rootstockers ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergio demián lerner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diego gutierr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel kurman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ussb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T21:49:19.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2746b40295f7dc35be544ae7d29c354b91de5721", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6noanJP0Etfm6asPpYxVHY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "title_full": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2746b40295f7dc35be544ae7d29c354b91de5721", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6noanJP0Etfm6asPpYxVHY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite new users and get 0.3 BTC!

Signs of recovery are now showing themselves as we inch away from the repeated drops of last week. At $8,500, bitcoin is at its highest point since Monday, when it briefly rose to $8,800 following the start of Coindesk’s Consensus Conference.\nIt was prior to this event that Fundstrat’s Tom Lee (no stranger to these price articles) made a bold prediction regarding the currency’s price. He stated that bitcoin would rally during the Conference, and spike harder than it had in previous weeks. Ultimately, the price didn’t rally; in fact, it incurred several drops following the event’s commencement, and didn’t begin exhibiting signs of positive change until the Conference was over. Bitcoin lost about 10 percent of its overall value while the event was taking place.\nLee later “owned up” to his incorrect prediction, writing:\n“Given conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction, and coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided cryptocurrency prices.”\nLee blames that lack of price rises during the Conference on the fact that regulation in America is still unclear. He says that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general need more clarification from organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with an increase in institutional adoption rates before prices can really fire up.\n“Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions, “he later added. “But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance comes by way of financial institutions.”\nThe fact is that bitcoin and the world of cryptocurrencies remain relatively volatile and speculative, and it’s right when we think we’ve got it down that we’re ultimately proven wrong. As we’ve seen, it’s near impossible to predict how digital currency prices will react to certain events, news, trends and other factors. Thus, making suggestions about what direction they’ll take in the future is an almost pointless task.\nLee called bitcoin’s maneuvers during the Consensus “very disappointing.” However, the analyst is sticking to his guns and insists that the currency will reach a price of $25,000 by the end of the year, beating out last year’s mega-price record by approximately $5,000. He further states that bitcoin will hit the $91,000 mark by 2020.\nIn addition to bitcoin, most major cryptocurrencies are hurling themselves deeper into green territory. At press time, Ethereum is up to $714 after a long week of wading through the $670 range. Ripple’s XRP has risen by approximately three cents and is on the verge of breaking $0.70, while Litecoin is traversing through the high $130 range.\nBitcoin Cash remains the only major cryptocurrency “still in a funk,” having recently taken a nosedive towards $1,180 after a solid week of meandering through $1,200. The currency has an upcoming hard fork scheduled that’s slated to render the original BCH coin null and void.

Billboards have appeared outside his office to convey the message of the crypto community. Also, a report suggests that the US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase may apply for a banking license. Some conflicting views on the future of the Internet and its money complete Saturday’s roundup. Also read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation “Warren: Maybe You’re Wrong About Bitcoin?” Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, known for his negative attitude towards cryptocurrencies, has been targeted in a bitcoin advocacy campaign lead by one of the largest cloud mining companies. Genesis Mining has recently posted billboards in front of Buffett’s office reminding him that he was wrong about Google and Amazon, and telling him that he may very well be wrong about bitcoin, as well. The initiative has received a lot of support from the crypto community on social media. Genesis co-founder Marco Krohn posted on Twitter photos of the message to the investment guru with a short note saying: “Some new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! :)” Earlier this month, the American business magnate issued another warning in regards to bitcoin and the like. “Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad ending,” he said during the annual Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholder meeting, but he didn’t stop there. “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it but I would never short a dime’s worth,” he said, concluding that bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.” Needless to say, Buffett’s comments provoked reactions and even inspired new business ideas. A tokenized marketplace called Ecoinmerce has announced the “Rat Poison Squared clothing line.” Т-shirts and hats are already offered online, but one can also order a mug with the winged phrase. The Money of the Internet and the Internet of Money Square CEO Jack Dorsey has recently reiterated his views about bitcoin. “The internet is going to have a native currency, so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen,” he said during a blockchain conference, adding: “I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.” Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter, wants his payment processing company to be at the forefront of the efforts to achieve adoption of cryptocurrencies as global means of payment. In an interview in March, he predicted that there will be a single world currency in the next ten years. The billionaire believes that will be bitcoin, although he admits the cryptocurrency is still slow and costly. Circle co-founder and President Sean Neville, however, has a different vision of what’s to come for the digital space and the digital currencies. “Very excited about the idea of reimagining what global finance can be,” he says that a dollar token is the future of the Internet of money. “One of the things that’s interesting for us is how we take fiat money and put in on blockchains, how do we get the benefits of a public blockchain infrastructure, which might underpin something like HTTPS of money,” he told Bloomberg . Neville thinks there is a problem with using existing crypto assets for payments and settlements – they are very volatile. “So, it makes sense to have something like the US dollar represented as a token that can transfer anywhere in the world, to any digital wallet and any exchange that can support it,” he explained. Sean Neville, whose company raised $110Mn USD in a fundraising round led by Chinese giant Bitmain , believes that “we need a replacement for SWIFT .” He also predicted that eventually everything of value will be tokenized in a “hybrid world” of centralized and decentralized services. Boston based Circle has announced plans to issue a dollar-backed cryptocurrency called USD-C. Coinbase May Apply for a Banking License By attracting some serious investments, Circle has actually joined the club of the most well-funded cryptocurrency companies. Another of its members, Coinbase , seems tempted to expand its financial business to include banking services. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal , representatives of the crypto brokerage have met with US regulators to talk about the possibility to apply for a banking license. A source quoted by the WSJ has revealed, that the company, which operates the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, has contacted officials from the US Office of the Comptroller of Currency earlier this year to discuss the matter. Beside the opportunity to broaden the types of products it offers, a banking license would allow Coinbase to operate without the need to partner with banks.

In fact, a 2009 Harris Poll revealed that 26 percent of Americans believe the stars control destiny. Now, it appears people are basing their decision to buy bitcoin on their horoscope. Planetary Movements Affect Bitcoin For the sake of this article, no attempt will be made to wade into the debate of whether astrology is a science. According to experts in the field, there is an imminent shift in planetary positions. Uranus is moving from Aries to Taurus. The planet Uranus symbolizes change and revolution leading believers to predict a coming paradigm shift. With Taurus being an earth sign, this impending changing of the guard should affect finance, agriculture, climate, etc. These days, cryptocurrency and bitcoin, in particular, is a significant topic in the financial realm. Thus, some astrologers posit that the number one crypto is about to revolutionize the financial market. With this in mind, true believers are buying bitcoin in the expectation of another bull run. To spice things a little, the symbol for Taurus is the head of a bull with horns. As far as symbolic representations go, this might appear profound. A Growing Trend The nascent nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to make predictions based on an established pattern. Thus, investors, many of whom are novices are left with confusing charts, “expert advice,” and now it seems horoscope. Proponents of astrology point to the correlation between previous planetary movements and several sweeping changes that occurred over the years. For example, the last Uranus shift which brought into Aries saw the rise of social movements all over the world. Aries represents activism and individuality, and in the previous seven years, the world has seen the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and many social justice movements, coincidence? Uranus shifts every seven years, and the next shift occurs this week. Recently, former NFL star, Ricky Williams revealed that astrology played a big part in his investment decisions. He also said that he is investing in bitcoin because Uranus is about to enter into Taurus. Williams isn’t the only one, Marcus Thomas, a bitcoin trader based in Chicago told MarketWatch that he is investing in bitcoin for the same reason. According to financial analyst, Raymond Merriman, there is a correlation between planetary cycles and human activity. Do you believe astrology has any bearing on the price of bitcoin? Will you be investing in bitcoin when Uranus enters Taurus? Let us know in the comment section below.

With all these new mining facilities popping up, cryptocurrency mining’s energy usage has also reached new heights. An energy research company based in the UK found that in the year 2017, the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin surpassed the annual energy usage of some 159 countries. Moreover, the energy spent globally on Bitcoin mining exceeded the electricity consumption of Ireland and most African nations. Issues that Bitcoin Miners are Facing There are serious problems as far as proof-of-work mining is concerned. Networks like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dash are becoming even more centralized. The power to control these networks have been placed in the hands of a few industrial scale mining operations that burn through electricity. To compete, individual miners have to rely on mining pools. Those mining pools contribute to network centralization. Mining is now becoming more of a problem than a solution. The Reasons for Mining Problems Such mining issues are occurring because Bitcoin mining is accomplished with the help of energy-hungry mining computers which run 24 hours a day. These computers include the Batman S9, which consumes up to 1400 watts of electricity. Massive factory-style operations dominate today’s mining, and Iceland is a popular location for such activity. A warning has been issued by the Icelandic government stating that the country is running out of resources required to feed the endless demand for more energy from mining operations. The Icelandic government stated that they would be unable to keep up with demand if every investor who is interested in mining operations were allowed to enter the country. Electricity Costs Remain a Key Concern for Miners In the previous year, creating cryptocurrency became more profitable as prices reached new highs. A rapid global expansion of mining activity led to the introduction of hundreds of new tokens. Bitcoin alone had a total value of more than $325 billion in December, which exceeded the market capitalization of Wal-Mart. Its price rose to nearly $20,000, from less than $800 a year earlier. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in order to retain and sustain Bitcoin, mining devices require an amount of energy that’s equivalent to 30 nuclear power reactors running at full capacity. Moreover, the industry is already using more power than all the world’s electric vehicles combined. More efficient technologies might evolve around cryptocurrencies requiring less energy. But electricity costs remain a key concern for miners because Bitcoin fell to below $8,000 this month. Even in places where electricity prices are low, older operations are under pressure from investors and regulators due to compounding risks from volatile prices. “Miners are looking for where they can have higher margins,” said ETF Securities’ executive director and head of research and investment strategy, James Butterfill. Why Energy Sources are getting more Attention This is happening because of the increasingly difficult computations which are needed to create new blocks. Even more powerful computers are required by the encrypted digital ledgers that underpin cryptocurrencies. To keep from overheating, many of the big server farms require air conditioning. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that in the past year, the industry’s electricity use jumped almost eightfold. It’s believed that total annual spending on power can eat up 30 to 60 percent of miners’ total revenues. “The price of electricity mostly drives where mining is taking place,” said the founder of Cryptoeconomics Lab, Christian Catalini. “If the price of electricity increases in one location, mining will likely just move somewhere else.” In addition to Bitcoin’s environmental sustainability, there’s also some doubt as to the financial viability of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency because of the exploding prices observed in recent months. An article in Newsweek stated that by the year 2020, Bitcoin computer operations might consume the entire world’s energy. Another website, Digiconomist, claimed that the energy consumption of Denmark was equal to that of all Bitcoin operations. That’s equivalent to 3,071,823 US households’ energy consumption. Some experts opine that it’s difficult to measure the amount of electricity that Bitcoin consumes, as it’s spread all over the world. Other experts stated to the Washington Post that the energy consumption of Bitcoin was equal to the output of one to three nuclear reactors, because Bitcoin likely uses 1 to 4 gigawatts of electricity. That amount is equivalent to less than 1 percent of America’s electricity consumption, or no more than 0.14% of global electricity generation. The Bitcoin network operates in a different way, and it becomes difficult to determine how much energy is consumed by mining operations. This digital currency is not controlled by any commercial clearinghouse or central bank. It’s controlled by a network of users who expend enormous amounts of computing power to build a blockchain comprised of Bitcoin transactions. Mike Reed, who is the director of Intel’s Blockchain Program Office, believes that Bitcoin will continue to use more energy if its price continues to rise. Conclusion All cryptocurrencies using proof-of-work mining algorithms are facing growing problems, including rising energy costs, increasing electricity usage, and centralization of mining. All these cryptocurrencies need to unite so that they can solve the current issues related to proof-of-work consensus. There’s a solution to every problem, and as time goes on, the problem involving energy and cryptocurrency mining is going to become more and more apparent. If nothing is done about this, government regulation of mining could be the next step. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T00:43:33.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a78b82623e4d07762807cbb99cf44d43e2b497ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCOS7WnpugDyno.jiQvpAlWUP_wZd0s9MMTZ.mQlNVPJi_azXmE9.XESulMlXV1kF4T2yvI4zN.JI-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "New Bitcoin Mining Study Misses a Few Key Points", "title_full": "New Bitcoin Mining Study Misses a Few Key Points", "published": "2018-05-20T02:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526749706_28153921.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a78b82623e4d07762807cbb99cf44d43e2b497ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCOS7WnpugDyno.jiQvpAlWUP_wZd0s9MMTZ.mQlNVPJi_azXmE9.XESulMlXV1kF4T2yvI4zN.JI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-20T02:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Bitcoin Mining Study Misses a Few Key Points", "text": "4 hours ago Crypto World News The Merkle 53 There have been numerous discussions on how much electricity Bitcoin mining really uses. The studies on this topic paint very different pictures, although they share a few similarities. The most recent study claims that Bitcoin mining will consume 0.5% of the world’s electricity by year’s end. That’s a somewhat worrisome statistic, albeit one that isn’t based on all the facts. Bitcoin Mining is a Power-hungry Industry No one can deny that there is vast electricity usage associated with mining Bitcoin. This is not just the case with Bitcoin, though, as it applies to virtually all cryptocurrencies these days. Anything that requires hefty computational work will need a lot of electricity. Supercomputers are no different in this regard. Even so, Bitcoin mining attracts a lot of negative attention because of its electricity requirements. A new study by a Dutch specialist claims that the Bitcoin mining industry will consume as much as 0.5% of the world’s electricity by late 2018. While that may sound rather problematic, it is not necessarily a major concern when looking at the bigger picture. This study bases its findings on the contention that the current Bitcoin mining ecosystem uses as much electricity as the country of Ireland. That particular claim has been subject to a lot of controversy and scrutiny, as it is very loosely based on facts and involves some calculations which seemingly don’t add up. Using that study as a basis for subsequent claims regarding Bitcoin mining’s electricity usage will only lead to more confusion and misinformation. There is no adequate way of predicting how much electricity will be used by the Bitcoin mining industry by late 2018. Most of the calculations made in this regard are based on partial information, speculation, and some desire to make Bitcoin mining look extremely bad. A scientific discussion regarding this topic seemingly makes a lot of sense, but since the research is often derived from incomplete findings by someone else, the issues are only compounded even further. Additionally, studies like these tend to overlook one critical aspect of Bitcoin mining. The use of renewable energy should not be overlooked by any means. Successfully mining Bitcoin for profit requires the use of the cheapest electricity source available. Right now, renewable energy fits the bill perfectly. This is part of the reason why so many mining operations are set up in regions with an abundance of renewable energy. How all of this will evolve moving forward is anybody’s guess at this stage. Global interest in mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is not slowing down, even though individual users face a tough time turning a profit. Additionally, currencies such as Ethereum will switch to proof-of-stake at some point, completely removing the mining aspect. Those factors are, once again, being overlooked by a study pertaining to Bitcoin mining’s electricity usage. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T00:43:44.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d50279efd63b5f1f8d243c2a7db288ab319512f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCNpExFsG4Kade73Lvebv3Xblx1MhySWGw3ZJRoPHmYXIQdZHJEhVlFftmEKUwA0y68DI4j5WHjeET.kRdYp5uVz6iD5iEYUQU", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Blockchain’s Big Gathering", "title_full": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Blockchain’s Big Gathering", "published": "2018-05-20T02:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526738893_5369802.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d50279efd63b5f1f8d243c2a7db288ab319512f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCNpExFsG4Kade73Lvebv3Xblx1MhySWGw3ZJRoPHmYXIQdZHJEhVlFftmEKUwA0y68DI4j5WHjeET.kRdYp5uVz6iD5iEYUQU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-20T02:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Blockchain’s Big Gathering", "text": "7 hours ago Bitcoin Technology Bitcoin Magazine 80 This week’s news was dominated by stories out of Blockchain Week and the Consensus 2018 conference held in New York City. There was free beer served from an ID-validating dispenser, Warren Buffet was criticized for his “rat poison” view of cryptocurrency, and there were plenty of business announcements, including news from eToro, Netki, Bitmain and Circle. Catch up on these stories and more in this week’s Bitcoin Magazine review. Featured stories by Amy Castor, Colin Harper and Kyle Torpey Stay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin In his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as “rat poison.” Venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018. The pair of tech investors pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes Blockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud. Civic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.” Digital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation Solution Los Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform. The company is adding investor validation to its existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) solution. The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities. Social Cryptocurrency Trading and Brokerage Firm eToro Is Expanding to U.S. eToro is a regulated global brokerage firm located in Israel that trades in cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, ETFs and more. Having recently received $100 million in funding, the company is currently in talks with U.S. financial institutions, regulators and regulatory advisors, and has already registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The company is opening an office in New Jersey and plans launch a crypto wallet later this year. Bitmain Leads Circle’s $110 Million Round; Teams Up to Create Stable Coin Bitmain continues to make news. The largest of the Bitcoin mining operations is putting its muscle behind mobile payments and cryptocurrency trading firm Circle by leading a $110 million Series E round of funding, the companies announced at Consensus this week. They are also joining forces to create a “stablecoin,” a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset. The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, managed by CENTRE, but the first will be Circle USD Coin (USDC), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.

A bankruptcy case involving a modest amount of bitcoin has sparked discussions in Russian legal circles. Some say a crypto is nothing more than “a set of characters.” Others, including the justice minister, are categorical – cryptocurrency can’t be anything else but property.\nAlso read: Cryptocurrencies to be Called “Digital Money” in Russia, Tokens – “Digital Rights” Russian Justice Ministry Takes Side in a Legal Argument\nCryptocurrency falls under the legal category of “other property,” Russia’s Justice Minister Alexander Konovalov told reporters this week. With two draft laws on the matter still pending in the State Duma, he also noted that digital coins should not be considered electronic money, at least on this stage.\nA bankruptcy case involving some bitcoin holdings has recently stirred the Russian legal community, which was challenged to provide a provisional answer to the question about the status of cryptocurrencies. In the absence of firm definitions in the current legislation, this question split Russian legal experts in two camps. On one side are those who think that cryptocurrencies have real value, on the other – their colleagues who believe they don’t, if the law doesn’t explicitly say so.\nAccording to Konovalov, his department has adopted a “consolidated opinion” on the legal nature of cryptocurrencies and it supports the view that they should be defined as property. “If digital money is not property, its theft would not be considered criminal offense because there would be no object of the crime,” he warned.\n“If cryptocurrencies are to develop, additional regulation will be necessary. The main point is to ensure that all this does not grow into financial pyramids,” Konovalov added, quoted by Prime . He is convinced that Russia should introduce rigid crypto regulations but also recognizes that the phenomenon is itself a “manifestation of the people’s desire to escape from total dependence.” The Question Will Be Answered by the Duma Soon\nMinister Konovalov’s comments added to the ongoing debate among experts and officials in Moscow on whether cryptocurrency can be considered a property in accordance with the current Russian legislation. The discussions were prompted by a bankruptcy filing from October last year. During the arbitrage proceedings, the debtor protested the trustee’s request to include his crypto funds, less than 0.2 bitcoin (BTC), in his bankruptcy estate.\nAccording to his legal representative, such move is impossible as the term “cryptocurrency” is not mentioned in Russia’s Civil Code at all. The Moscow Arbitration Court accepted this position. “A conclusion can be drawn that cryptocurrency is a certain set of symbols/characters contained in an information system. It cannot be an object of the civil rights,” it said.\nBut then, earlier in May, an arbitration court of appeals overturned this ruling recognizing cryptocurrency as a valuable property, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. On Thursday, the Ninth Arbitration Court of Appeals published its decision on the case. According to the document quoted by Interfax , cryptocurrency cannot be regarded as anything else but property. And, since the current civil law does not contain the notion “other property”, the widest possible interpretation of property is permissible, the court explained.\nThe question about the status of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation will be answered very soon. Two drafts have been filed in the Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, and the one that focuses on legalizing initial coin offerings will have its first reading on Tuesday, May 22. The second bill is expected to amend the country’s Civil Code in order to regulate crypto payments. According to comments made by the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev this week, the new legislation will refer to cryptos and tokens as “digital money” and “digital rights”, respectively. Whether this means that bitcoin will be accepted both as currency and property remains to be seen.\nDo you expect Russia to eventually accept and legalize decentralized cryptocurrencies?

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain.

This amounts to roughly 350 nodes out of a total 2200 nodes on the Bitcoin Cash network.\nBitcoin Cash itself was created by forking Bitcoin’s protocol amid much controversy in August 2017 near block 477,000. Now Bitcoin Cash is the 4th most valuable cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple with a market cap of $20 billion.\nThe most significant protocol change that Bitcoin Cash introduced was to increase the maximum block size to 8 MB, which allows more transactions per block. This reduces transaction fees and makes it easier to use Bitcoin Cash as an everyday currency versus Bitcoin where transaction fees have been high enough at times in the past to make small transactions like buying a cup of coffee unfeasible. Hence the word cash in its name.\nWhen the Bitcoin Cash fork occurred one week ago, any nodes that did not update their protocol became incompatible with nodes that did change their protocol. It can result in risky situations, leading to a loss of money. For example, if someone sends Bitcoin Cash from a wallet they didn’t update to an exchange that is updated they would lose their money. This issue is one of the most dangerous things about cryptocurrency forks.\nEssentially, the 16% of Bitcoin Cash nodes that did not update are running on their own distinct blockchain and could be considered a new cryptocurrency. It is unknown whether this 16 % of nodes simply forgot to update or if keeping the old protocol was intentional and organized. If it was indeed intentional this new cryptocurrency may soon get a name, like Bitcoin Cash Legacy for example.\nThe protocol changes introduced on the hard fork include another block size increase from 8 MB to 32 MB and smart contracts . Introducing smart contracts to Bitcoin Cash makes it competitive with Ethereum, the 2nd most popular cryptocurrency, and is a major improvement. Smart contract functionality will allow users to develop decentralized applications that integrate the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.\nThe block size increase from 8 MB to 32 MB is more controversial as the 8 MB size is already eight times more than Bitcoin’s 1 MB, and is quite enough space for the foreseeable future to keep transaction fees low. In fact, Bitcoin Cash block sizes are often less than 100 KB and almost always less than 1 MB , so changing the block size limit to 8 MB like the original protocol does actually makes no difference versus Bitcoin. Upping the block size limit to 32 MB seems senseless.\nBitcoin Cash developers have received some criticism from the Bitcoin community about leaving nearly 1/5th of their network behind.\nFollow

second-biggest stock exchange, Börse Stuttgart , is expanding its footprint into the cryptocurrency sector with the launch of a new crypto trading platform. Bison is the new platform that the exchange says will simplify the process of trading digital currencies and becomes the first crypto app, backed by a reputable stock exchange. Bison Crypto Trading App The new app will make trading of cryptocurrencies mass marketable. The fact that the same will also be done through smartphones should go a long way in making it easy for most people to participate in the endeavor. Developed by Sow Labs, supported by Börse Stuttgart Digital Ventures, the new application plans to do away with the technical difficulties that have made it impossible for some people to venture into cryptocurrency trading . While still in development stage, Bison should be available to the masses for free later in the autumn. Ahead of the much-awaited launch in September, the firm is currently conducting a competition whereby entrants stand to win as much as three bitcoins (BTC), ten ethers (ETH), 20 litecoins (LTC), and 50 ripples ( XRP ) as part of the marketing campaign. Trading Fees and News Feed Part of Bison Offering Fee-free trading is what Bison promises as it looks to get as many people as possible into trading cryptocurrencies. However, it is still unclear how it plans to achieve the same. The app will also come with a news feed where investors will access a wide array of information needed to make informed decisions about investments. Bison is to analyze more than 250,000 tweets from the cryptocurrency investment community and summarize the most important, for users to have a feel of sentiments in the market. The crypto-radar below shows that currently as per Bison’s analysis, cryptocurrencies are experiencing overall neutral sentiment. Unlike in the past where registration for user account would take up to three days, the app promises a maximum of three minutes until one can trade their favorite cryptoassets. For starters, Bison is to offer support for four digital currencies; BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP. However, there are plans to increase support for more digital assets in future. The unveiling of Bison app for trading crypto assets according to the exchange was triggered by a recent survey that showed investors want easy access to the crypto markets. “So far, investing in Bitcoin, Ether & Co. has been anything but easy. Bison consistently breaks down barriers: The app is easy to use, the user interface is available in German, later also in English,” Börse Stuttgart in a statement . Cryptoassets Attract Mainstream Interest Established and regulated stock exchange venturing into the sector provides the clearest of indications that crypto assets could soon find their way into the mainstream industry . There is already talk that tokenization could soon result in the creation of a new modern stock exchange whereby, instead of trading shares, people will be able to trade tokens. Börse Stuttgart joins a growing list of mainstream companies that have in the recent past ventured into the cryptocurrency space in the effort of meeting growing demand for such services. Media Giant Thomson Reuters has already unveiled a data feed for crypto assets , which according to many observers opens the door for the firm to support digital assets in its trading platforms in future. A number of products all designed to target institutional investors have also cropped up as firms position themselves to take advantage of the growing market. Options and futures trading of cryptocurrencies is slowly becoming a reality thanks to the evolution of crypto assets. Entry of professional and institutional investors all but affirms the push by the likes of Börse Stuttgart to pursue opportunities in the sector.

Even bitcoin the number one crypto at the moment could lose it allure over the years. The top crypto of the future has probably not arrived yet, or it is already here, just not hyped up yet. I have a hunch that the future of cryptocurrencies is here, and it’s Digibyte (DGB).\nDigibyte happens to outperform most of the popular cryptos in the market on their core features. But digibyte is not just good as a currency, it is also good for the development of smart contracts, and decentralized applications.\nThis is the one area where Ethereum, and the likes of NEO are currently dominating. However, even on this front, digibyte is way ahead of the pack.\nThat’s because it allows for the development of Dapps in one of the most secure and low cost blockchains in the world. Its speeds also make it stand miles ahead of the pack in terms of development and deployment of Dapps.\nWhat’s even more interesting is that digibyte (DGB) outperforms the privacy coins in the own domain. As a matter of fact, some of the better-known privacy coins run on digibyte security. For instance, ZCash runs on Digi shield, an aspect of digibyte security.

Crypterium calls itself a “cryptobank” that lets you pay with tokens via NFC, QR codes or in online stores.\nThe startup plans to partner with Visa and Mastercard to make cryptocurrency cards that charge your virtual wallet in “a fraction of a second,” he said in an interview with Business Insider .\nO’Brien explained:\nThat card will be attached to a wallet that we’ve created and every time the consumer makes a transaction we will receive a request for that transaction in our systems, we will check the bitcoin or ether account and provided that they’ve got sufficient balance we will execute a trade and mark their bitcoin balance for a trade and approve the transaction.\nIt can sometimes take up to a week to exchange cryptocurrency into your bank account, but O’Brien said the startup will speed up the process so people can make everyday purchases.\n“What Crypterium will do is make that whole process seamless and give an opportunity for a consumer to actually use their cryptocurrency to pay for everyday items,” he said.\nO’Brien claims Crypterium’s “secret sauce” intellectual property will protect transactions from the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nThe startup also has global ambitions. O’Brien said Crypterium has a “unique opportunity” to appeal to consumers as a “safe haven” in high-inflation markets such as Turkey and Argentina.\n“The concern that many of them might have about getting access to that currency in a short space of time for immediate spending,” he said, “we’re going to be in a position to bridge that gap and make it an instant gratification,” O’Brien said.\nCrypterium currently has a team of three people in London and ten in Moscow and is considering offices in New York, Singapore, and Miami. He added that they plan to release their first products in autumn.\nBut the startup faces competition in the space. Another payments company, Bitpay, already offers a Visa card that can be used in the United States. And Singapore-based startup TenX has created a virtual card to make cryptocurrency payments easy while traveling. FROM FINANCE TO CRYPTO\nCrypterium isn’t the first crypto startup to poach former executives from traditional financial institutions. But an ex-JPMorgan trader turned cryptocurrency fund manager has gone so far to say banks “have absolutely failed to innovate” when it comes to cryptocurrency.\nDaniel Masters, who ran JPMorgan’s energy trading business in the 1990s, called cryptocurrency a “true revolution” and cast doubt on the willingness of conventional financial service companies to adopt it.\nFrom his interview in February with Business Insider :\nThe analogue financial services companies are not in this game at all. They don’t want to touch the core currency, which is Bitcoin or ethereum, they’re suspicious about the industry itself. A lot of people think it’s a criminal enterprise and a Ponzi scheme and a scam.\nWhat do you think of making cryptocurrency cards for everyday shopping?
