But the question remains, do these billionaire heavyweights know what they’re talking about? Gates insisted that Bitcoin was a ‘greater fool’ investment, as well as “one of the crazier, speculative things” he had ever seen, and then doubling down by saying he would “short it if there was an easy way to do it.” The funny thing is that at the end of last year, shorting Bitcoin through derivatives was made possible. It’s surprising that someone like Gates doesn’t currently know what he can or cannot do in the Bitcoin investment landscape. For his part, Buffett bashed Bitcoin by stating that “when you’re buying nonproductive assets, all you’re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more because they’re even more excited about another next person coming along.” The Oracle of Omaha said the same thing about commodities several years ago. It’s true that it remains difficult to accurately predict commodity prices over time due to the challenges of maintaining consistent profit margins in a fluctuating market, but by no means is an investor not able to turn a profit with a properly timed investment, which is the case with Bitcoin or any other investment. Munger jumped in by saying Bitcoin was “worthless artificial gold,” and that it reminded him of “Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting: the pursuit of uneatable by the unspeakable.” All the Bitcoin bashing didn’t go unnoticed, causing the digital asset’s value to slip all the way down to $9,300. It’s true that these three billionaires are the best of the best and deserve to have their opinions heard, but this story has been played out over and over again. Why is it that older successful men who are already dominating their respective industries continue to trash-talk Bitcoin? To be honest, I would not expect anything less. Bitcoin is a threat to the way we currently do things. It’s disrupting both the technology and financial industries, and those who have made a fortune in these sectors have nothing to gain from the digital currency and everything to lose. Does a highly profitable centralized software company like Microsoft want a decentralized currency to come along? Of course not! The super-rich have nothing to gain from Bitcoin succeeding. There’s only so much wealth that can exist in the world, and if Bitcoin continues to advance on fiat currencies like the dollar, then those holding most of their wealth in dollars will possess less overall value. I would put people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Charlie Munger at the top of this list. And let’s not forget about other Bitcoin haters like JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon or BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who called Bitcoin a fraud. The fact is that these individuals have achieved success at the highest level, and they continue to badmouth Bitcoin because it offers no benefit to their current ventures and only threatens their wealth and business enterprises.

Whether it is performing well, or not, you can almost guarantee that someone will be talking about it for good or bad. At the moment though, the news seems to be good, and experts are even predicting that it is destined for even greater heights in the future! One reason that Bitcoin has been predicted to go far is due to the simplicity of the Bitcoin blockchain. It was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain . Because it was the first of its kind, in the years that Bitcoin has been created, there have been many other iterations of the technology, but not all have been successful. Certain updates, such as SegWit and the Lightning Network have meant that the efficiency of the blockchain can be improved even more. One thing that is for sure though, even with these improvements, the Bitcoin blockchain remains to be simple and basic, which adds to it’s a appeal, especially to those who are less technologically minded. We can also note the fintech revolution as part of the reason for their success. Bitcoin has started to dominate fintech, especially since recent reports have shown that the Square Cash app is overtaking Paypal’s Venmo in terms of growth. In the first quarter of this year alone, Square has sold $34 million worth of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth in areas such as Africa, with a lot of payment platforms beginning to offer Bitcoin products. This has made payments a lot easier. Despite cryptocurrencies in their nature being incredibly volatile when it comes to the price, Bitcoin has, overtime shown itself to be relatively resilient to market events that sends other prices up and down. Bitcoin, on the whole only suffers single digit declines, and it has been predicted that as the market matures, Bitcoin will show even less of a reaction. This is great news for the oldest cryptocurrency. Finally, as time goes on, Bitcoin will continue to be adopted into the mainstream finance world. A recent example of this is when Nasdaq recently partnered with Gemini to ensure the fidelity of the exchange platform’s Bitcoin trading infrastructure. Despite seeing some price falls at the beginning of the year, 2018 has been great for Bitcoin inclusion. Both Coinbase and Goldman Sachs have recently unveiled products that have been targeted at institutional investors, along with OTC Bitcoin trading decks that will soon allow significant Bitcoin buy and sell orders without it negatively impacting the market.

With all these new mining facilities popping up, cryptocurrency mining’s energy usage has also reached new heights. An energy research company based in the UK found that in the year 2017, the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin surpassed the annual energy usage of some 159 countries. Moreover, the energy spent globally on Bitcoin mining exceeded the electricity consumption of Ireland and most African nations. ISSUES THAT BITCOIN MINERS ARE FACING There are serious problems as far as proof-of-work mining is concerned. Networks like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dash are becoming even more centralized. The power to control these networks have been placed in the hands of a few industrial scale mining operations that burn through electricity. To compete, individual miners have to rely on mining pools. Those mining pools contribute to network centralization. Mining is now becoming more of a problem than a solution. THE REASONS FOR MINING PROBLEMS Such mining issues are occurring because Bitcoin mining is accomplished with the help of energy-hungry mining computers which run 24 hours a day. These computers include the Batman S9, which consumes up to 1400 watts of electricity. Massive factory-style operations dominate today’s mining, and Iceland is a popular location for such activity. A warning has been issued by the Icelandic government stating that the country is running out of resources required to feed the endless demand for more energy from mining operations. The Icelandic government stated that they would be unable to keep up with demand if every investor who is interested in mining operations were allowed to enter the country. ELECTRICITY COSTS REMAIN A KEY CONCERN FOR MINERS In the previous year, creating cryptocurrency became more profitable as prices reached new highs. A rapid global expansion of mining activity led to the introduction of hundreds of new tokens. Bitcoin alone had a total value of more than $325 billion in December, which exceeded the market capitalization of Wal-Mart. Its price rose to nearly $20,000, from less than $800 a year earlier. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in order to retain and sustain Bitcoin, mining devices require an amount of energy that’s equivalent to 30 nuclear power reactors running at full capacity. Moreover, the industry is already using more power than all the world’s electric vehicles combined. More efficient technologies might evolve around cryptocurrencies requiring less energy. But electricity costs remain a key concern for miners because Bitcoin fell to below $8,000 this month. Even in places where electricity prices are low, older operations are under pressure from investors and regulators due to compounding risks from volatile prices. “Miners are looking for where they can have higher margins,” said ETF Securities’ executive director and head of research and investment strategy, James Butterfill. WHY ENERGY SOURCES ARE GETTING MORE ATTENTION This is happening because of the increasingly difficult computations which are needed to create new blocks. Even more powerful computers are required by the encrypted digital ledgers that underpin cryptocurrencies. To keep from overheating, many of the big server farms require air conditioning. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that in the past year, the industry’s electricity use jumped almost eightfold. It’s believed that total annual spending on power can eat up 30 to 60 percent of miners’ total revenues. “The price of electricity mostly drives where mining is taking place,” said the founder of Cryptoeconomics Lab, Christian Catalini. “If the price of electricity increases in one location, mining will likely just move somewhere else.” In addition to Bitcoin’s environmental sustainability, there’s also some doubt as to the financial viability of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency because of the exploding prices observed in recent months. An article in Newsweek stated that by the year 2020, Bitcoin computer operations might consume the entire world’s energy. Another website, Digiconomist, claimed that the energy consumption of Denmark was equal to that of all Bitcoin operations. That’s equivalent to 3,071,823 US households’ energy consumption. Some experts opine that it’s difficult to measure the amount of electricity that Bitcoin consumes, as it’s spread all over the world. Other experts stated to the Washington Post that the energy consumption of Bitcoin was equal to the output of one to three nuclear reactors, because Bitcoin likely uses 1 to 4 gigawatts of electricity. That amount is equivalent to less than 1 percent of America’s electricity consumption, or no more than 0.14% of global electricity generation. The Bitcoin network operates in a different way, and it becomes difficult to determine how much energy is consumed by mining operations. This digital currency is not controlled by any commercial clearinghouse or central bank. It’s controlled by a network of users who expend enormous amounts of computing power to build a blockchain comprised of Bitcoin transactions. Mike Reed, who is the director of Intel’s Blockchain Program Office, believes that Bitcoin will continue to use more energy if its price continues to rise. CONCLUSION All cryptocurrencies using proof-of-work mining algorithms are facing growing problems, including rising energy costs, increasing electricity usage, and centralization of mining. All these cryptocurrencies need to unite so that they can solve the current issues related to proof-of-work consensus. There’s a solution to every problem, and as time goes on, the problem involving energy and cryptocurrency mining is going to become more and more apparent. If nothing is done about this, government regulation of mining could be the next step.

Bison is the new platform that the exchange says will simplify the process of trading digital currencies and becomes the first crypto app, backed by a reputable stock exchange.\nBison Crypto Trading App The new app will make trading of cryptocurrencies mass marketable. The fact that the same will also be done through smartphones should go a long way in making it easy for most people to participate in the endeavor.\nDeveloped by Sow Labs, supported by Börse Stuttgart Digital Ventures, the new application plans to do away with the technical difficulties that have made it impossible for some people to venture into cryptocurrency trading .\nWhile still in development stage, Bison should be available to the masses for free later in the autumn. Ahead of the much-awaited launch in September, the firm is currently conducting a competition whereby entrants stand to win as much as three bitcoins (BTC), ten ethers (ETH), 20 litecoins (LTC), and 50 ripples (XRP) as part of the marketing campaign.\nTrading Fees and News Feed Part of Bison Offering Fee-free trading is what Bison promises as it looks to get as many people as possible into trading cryptocurrencies. However, it is still unclear how it plans to achieve the same. The app will also come with a news feed where investors will access a wide array of information needed to make informed decisions about investments.\nBison is to analyze more than 250,000 tweets from the cryptocurrency investment community and summarize the most important, for users to have a feel of sentiments in the market. The crypto-radar below shows that currently as per Bison's analysis, cryptocurrencies are experiencing overall neutral sentiment.\nCrypto Radar. Source: Bison\nUnlike in the past where registration for user account would take up to three days, the app promises a maximum of three minutes until one can trade their favorite cryptoassets.\nFor starters, Bison is to offer support for four digital currencies; BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP. However, there are plans to increase support for more digital assets in future.\nThe unveiling of Bison app for trading crypto assets according to the exchange was triggered by a recent survey that showed investors want easy access to the crypto markets.\n\"So far, investing in Bitcoin, Ether & Co. has been anything but easy. Bison consistently breaks down barriers: The app is easy to use, the user interface is available in German, later also in English,\" Börse Stuttgart in a statement .\nCryptoassets Attract Mainstream Interest Established and regulated stock exchange venturing into the sector provides the clearest of indications that crypto assets could soon find their way into the mainstream industry .\nThere is already talk that tokenization could soon result in the creation of a new modern stock exchange whereby, instead of trading shares, people will be able to trade tokens. Börse Stuttgart joins a growing list of mainstream companies that have in the recent past ventured into the cryptocurrency space in the effort of meeting growing demand for such services.\nMedia Giant Thomson Reuters has already unveiled a data feed for crypto assets , which according to many observers opens the door for the firm to support digital assets in its trading platforms in future. A number of products all designed to target institutional investors have also cropped up as firms position themselves to take advantage of the growing market.\nOptions and futures trading of cryptocurrencies is slowly becoming a reality thanks to the evolution of crypto assets. Entry of professional and institutional investors all but affirms the push by the likes of Börse Stuttgart to pursue opportunities in the sector.\nThe post German Stock Exchange Unveils Bison for Free Trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "stock exchange unveils bison for free trading of bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "börse stuttgart digital ventures", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "börse stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T01:13:47.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "675f08787fa26564b244a2caa8b9a6ac2390ff0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa1Ba7jZiuK_aETvbqkv_ywGfaSYTUh1.BTSjJJDBWkBqnBzyWP_X_ruG01FnCPsFm2e8QownwMux..nmYygzPgw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Looking for bitcoin and ethereum trading strategies.", "title_full": "Looking for bitcoin and ethereum trading strategies. : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-20T01:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.476, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "675f08787fa26564b244a2caa8b9a6ac2390ff0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa1Ba7jZiuK_aETvbqkv_ywGfaSYTUh1.BTSjJJDBWkBqnBzyWP_X_ruG01FnCPsFm2e8QownwMux..nmYygzPgw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "B_Spears_InHerPrime", "published": "2018-05-20T01:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Looking for bitcoin and ethereum trading strategies.", "text": "Does it make sense to trade ethereum and bitcoin during dips and peaks to accumulate a higher count of one or the other?

The 21-year old mobile phone company headquartered in Taiwan is developing its own Android Smartphone that will be powered by blockchain technology .\nExodus not Finney According to The Next Web (TNW) , the premium smartphone called ‘Exodus’ will come with a universal cryptocurrency wallet and an inbuilt secure hardware enclave that will take care of distributed ledger technology-based apps.\nIn 2015, HTC and Valve Corporation joined forces in creating the Vive virtual reality headset, which has not ceased generating significant returns for the firm since then. Phil Chen was entirely instrumental in the success of the VR headset, as such HTC has made him the head of Exodus, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency-related matters in the company.\nHTC Blockchain Network on the Cards As per TNW , the company is putting preparations in top gear to launch its native blockchain network which all Exodus phones would be able to connect to and facilitate users’ cryptocurrency trading activities. Also, the phone would offer support for Bitcoin’s Lightning Network protocol , Dfinity, and other blockchains. Chen declared:\n“Through Exodus, we are excited to be supporting underlying protocols such as Bitcoin , Lightning Network, Ethereum , Dfinity and more. We would like to support the entire blockchain ecosystem, and in the next few months we’ll be announcing more exciting partnerships together.”\nBlockchain Technology’s Unending Ubiquity Cryptocurrencies would be an accepted payment method for the purchase of Exodus, however, the firm is yet to fix a price for the phone.\nSimilarly, Sirin Labs in collaboration with Foxconn, the world’s largest manufacturer of contract electronics have strategically combined, and they are almost done developing the world’s first blockchain, and Android-powered Smartphone, Sirin Finney .\nOn May 11, Sirin Labs released specifications for the flagship phone and in addition to having blockchain-specific features such as a highly secure cold storage wallet that supports bitcoin and a vast array of altcoins , the $1,000 smartphone also comes with Android 8.1 OS that runs decentralized apps.\nWhile blockchain technology has proven itself in quite many industries across the globe, the mobile phone ecosystem is just warming up to the revolution.\nOn May 11, 2018, BTCManager reported that China’s leading smartphone manufacturer, Huawei, had hinted that bitcoin wallet would soon be available on its AppGallery for hodlers who own the company’s latest smartphones.\nWhile some have criticized the blockchain-powered mobile phones initiative of firms like Sirin Labs, HTC, and Huawei, saying there is nothing extraordinary about blockchain-based handsets as other mobile devices can as well perform same crypto-related functions with the right software. This latest development, however, goes a long way to show that blockchain technology is gradually coming of age and it is just a matter of time before it proliferates into all ecosystems.\nThe post HTC Catches Bitcoin Fever, Set to Launch Blockchain-powered Smartphones appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\nfrom BTCMANAGER https://btcmanager.com/htc-catches-bitcoin-fever-set-to-launch-blockchain-powered-smartphones/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phil chen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "htc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "htc blockchain network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valve corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T09:35:49.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b27f4675ef8eb565d98266488506c1e8f2e0e50f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf30wV2jhU0NT4QYnxSkVG89YeqQ7IUY4at.QDVCrxOFQb.72lsorlyQUtlavLBwSTkfBCqyQjP._65wnDRYWWvHg-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Honda dealerships in northern MN now accept Bitcoin as payment. : Bitcoin", "title_full": "Honda dealerships in northern MN now accept Bitcoin as payment. : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-20T00:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 26, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b27f4675ef8eb565d98266488506c1e8f2e0e50f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf30wV2jhU0NT4QYnxSkVG89YeqQ7IUY4at.QDVCrxOFQb.72lsorlyQUtlavLBwSTkfBCqyQjP._65wnDRYWWvHg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "reddit.com", "published": "2018-05-20T00:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Honda dealerships in northern MN now accept Bitcoin as payment. : Bitcoin", "text": "[deleted]\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T22:01:46.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a37bcb9791dc0e040f1fbc06e2930577be5a108", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRb_szXfV2NIAx6cTnPeMf0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Has Bitcoin reached its goal?", "title_full": "Has Bitcoin reached its goal?", "published": "2018-05-20T00:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.06, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a37bcb9791dc0e040f1fbc06e2930577be5a108", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRb_szXfV2NIAx6cTnPeMf0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ZAYANDI", "published": "2018-05-20T00:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Has Bitcoin reached its goal?", "text": "I think bitcoin keeps trying in the market to achieve its goals Actually, Bitcoin is in the early stages of development and our line is still long.

Although the last weeks have been rough, prices spikes always occur and specialists have pointed out to me that, if one can keep costs down, it is possible to set up a stable and recurring arbitration business.\nThe restrictions faced by entrepreneurs are more due to bureaucracy and business culture than to legal regulation. Brazilian law is relatively welcoming of bitcoins and other cryptocoins.\nIn this article I will explain both the theory and the practice behind it.\nNote: I`m using Bitcons as the general term for cryptocurrencies.\n1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF BITCON ARBITRATION IN BRAZIL\nBitcoins did not receive a specific legal classification in Brazil, as of yet. So far, they are subsumed under the general class of “intangible goods”, but without any special designation such as software, services, intellectual property, etc.\nThis turns out to be very consequential. The broad definition prevents bitcoin from being taxed as a license subject to royalties, or as an off-the-shelf software code.\nIn a sense, cryptocurrencies are similar to shares or financial options. Intangible property that is worth money, but that is not subject to import tax or other customs duties.\nThis mean that they can be openly called bitcoins in legal documents, which is a plus. Several other countries require traders to conceal the nature of the operation by calling bitcoins “software”, “special services”, “special customers points in a promotion system” and all sorts of understated or generalized terms.\nKeeping this line of reasoning, a hypothetical purchase of bitcoins abroad, made by a Brazilian company, would play out like this:\nThe Brazilian company would make an international transference of funds to the seller. This purchase is not taxed in itself, however the FX transaction is taxed at 0,38 by the tax over financial operations (IOF); Bitcoins are transferred to the buyer`s wallet; Bitcoins are sold inside of Brazil. This sale will be taxed according to the company`s tax regime in Brazil and will probably be considered a “Non-operational” gain, taxed at 34%. Profits of the operation can be used to purchase more bitcoins.\nHowever simple, this operation is rarely performed, due to the problems listed next.\n2. PRACTICAL PROBLEMS\nThe first problem is that few banks are bitcoin friendly, specially among the big retail banks. The situation in Brazil is not as bad as in other countries, though, because middle banks specialized in FX transactions are more willing to engage in operations involving bitcoins.\nA second obstacle is that the local sale of bitcoins does not generate a formal invoice for tax purposes (nota fiscal). This tends to put the company in a tough spot when it is required to prove the origin of its profits to the bank compliance officers. A solution for this will be discussed in the next section.\nThe business practices of bitcoin exchanges also present a challenge. Exchanges in the US or Europe don`t generally accept deposits made directly by a foreign entity located in South America. It is not uncommon for an exchange to only accept deposits made from a bank based in the same country as the exchange.\nFinally, the processing time. Sending money abroad through banks or exchange houses is not a continuous process. From time to time the compliance procedures will eat up a couple days. Moreover, retail banks will seldom perform transactions in the same day. D+2 is likely the standard. If the operation is not correctly timed, a week can go by before the funds reach the other party.\n3. A STRUCTURE THAT WORKS\nAfter meditating on this problem and after discussions with a good number of banks and compliance officers I conceived a model that is compatible with Brazilian regulations and that is agile enough to work according to the timing of the arbitrage business.\n1. First step is to incorporate a Brazilian company, owned by a foreign company that is engaged in the purchase of bitcoins.\n You may find more details about it in this post .\n2. The owners of the Brazilian company must inject funds in the Brazilian entity through increase or pay-up of equity (loans can be used, but are not recommended in this case)\nThe funds available to the company should be enough to purchase bitcoins abroad in large scale.\nThe controlling company, based abroad, will purchase bitcoins in local exchanges.\n3. The controlling company must perform a direct sale (over the counter sale) to the Brazilian subsidiary\nThis is extremely important. Bitcoins cannot be transferred directly to the Brazilian subsidiary, without a proper purchase and sale agreement. The price described in the contract should be somewhat of an “arm’s length” price. Brazil does have transfer pricing rules and will not accept a direct transference of assets from the controlling company, unless this transference is backed by commercial reasons.\nOn the bright side, Brazilian transfer pricing regulations are not detailed when it come to financial products or intangibles. This means that the controlling company can opt to sell the bitcoins with the slightest overprice.\nThe sale contract should be precise when describing the term of payment. Terms of up to 30 days wold be considered normal and give enough time for the Brazilian entity to resell the assets in the Brazilian market, hopefully for a profit.\n4. T he Brazilian entity will receive the bitcoins in it wallet and will sell them in Brazil.\n The sale can be performed directly to individual or through an exchange. If a sale is made directly to a buyer, a full purchase and sale agreement should be executed. In case the sale is performed through an exchange, the company must be very meticulous in detailing which exchange was used and, if possible, the company should try to obtain info on who the buyer is. The more detailed the records, the easier it will be to complete the next step of the process.\n5. Remittance of the payment to the controlling company, through an exchange agreement.\n W hen performing the payment, the Brazilian company should be able to point out the origin of the funds. That is, it should demonstrate financial books and, if possible, executed agreements with buyer/ or a log of transactions performed in an exchange. Good records will allow the exchange to be processed quickly, maybe in the same day.\n4. EVOLUTION OF THIS MODEL\nThis template is very simplified. A realistic model should take into account the exchange rate variation and other details.\nThis model can be also expanded to a more financial profile. For example, t he foreign investor can make the Brazilian company overfunded, through loans or other means, so that it will be able to purchase several batches and only have to perform a FX transaction once every 60 days. This may allow the group to take advantage of variation in the USD/BRL rate.\nPlease feel free to get in touch if you need recommendations for bitcoin friendly banks, or if you would like to explore this model in more detail.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T01:34:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "074d1cea86fbb823a4a567af3673b94dc23f9f8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNt_5mP9ZuN1d8Zp8Q4_P_qrGTDZ_w7juiYsvhBBHmvDrl4r1s99NzJB3OxzhGDAdvbaeW9v8EjnO7lRGc8hacVXg--", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoincash: Bitcoin Cash Fork Leaves Users Behind, But Does It Matter?", "title_full": "Bitcoincash: Bitcoin Cash Fork Leaves Users Behind, But Does It Matter?", "published": "2018-05-20T00:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "074d1cea86fbb823a4a567af3673b94dc23f9f8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNt_5mP9ZuN1d8Zp8Q4_P_qrGTDZ_w7juiYsvhBBHmvDrl4r1s99NzJB3OxzhGDAdvbaeW9v8EjnO7lRGc8hacVXg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-20T00:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoincash: Bitcoin Cash Fork Leaves Users Behind, But Does It Matter?", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T00:42:48.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a00634a14c30a8de5b793dfe54c12d05634097d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSAJ28KN1ghSDXOq6aBL6VOmoWjXBQGeKdVV14C_1kHg3LvnMPbfYX2rks1Z2gapUo-", "site_full": "www.commonplacejournal.com", "site": "commonplacejournal.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Switched our affiliate program payments from USD to Bitcoin.

No commission will be paid for purchases made by you.\nCommissions can be earned for each new client referred through the unique affiliate link or provided coupon. We reserve the right to cancel any of your affiliate coupons at any time, even if you are currently using the coupon.\nPayments are made on 5th of every month for all commissions earned in the previous month, unless we put your payment on hold due to suspicious activity.\nFor example, commissions for the month of January are paid on 5th February, so on and so forth. 5. Minimum Payment Threshold\nWe do not believe in thresholds so any commissions you earn will be sent to you without a minimum. 6. Cookies and Custom Coupons\nAn affiliate cookie is valid for 30 days after first visit of your referral. If your affiliate decides to make a purchase within 60 days of clicking on your affiliate link, you will still earn a commission on their sale. That is, if they didn’t click on anyone else’s affiliate link after clicking on yours.\nSales generated using a custom coupon from a affiliate will be credited to the affiliate that provided the coupon – irrespective of whose affiliate link the customer clicked on. 10. Miscellaneous\nTerminated accounts cannot later apply to the Program without our express written consent. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Iowa, without reference to rules governing choice of laws. Rebilder LLC (the Commonplace Journal) reserves the right to institute a reserve fund holding commissions for a time period deemed necessary in situations where sales generated by an affiliate consistently have a high chargeback/cancellation ratio. Rebilder LLC and the Commonplace Journal will be the sole and final arbitrator for any and all disputes or claims related to the validity of sales. In order to facilitate accurate record-keeping, multiple Commonplace Journal affiliate accounts are strictly prohibited. You may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Subject to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Our failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of our right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.\n(We reserve the right to change or alter the current set of Affiliate Terms and Conditions without prior notice.)

The new machine will be installed in May and will be fully functional by the 3rd Week of May. The ATM will currently support three major currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dash.\nGeorge Neophytou, from Northwold Spar, the firm where the ATM is being installed, expressed his excitement as he leads the project:\n“It will take away much the frustration of buying and selling cryptocurrency, and hopefully help make cryptocurrencies mainstream.”\nAfrica is not new to Bitcoin ATMs as countries such as Zimbabwe and Djibouti already have Bitcoin ATMs. During his time in Europe, Neophytou was fascinated by the rate of cryptocurrency adoption. Inspiring the Northwold Spar executive to initiate the technology in his homeland.\n“It’s a different world there,” explains Neophytou. “Walking around in the streets of Germany you see signs with ‘Bitcoins accepted there’.”\nSouth African Revenue Service (SARS) currently does not regulate Cryptocurrencies in the country, but profit earned from cryptocurrency trading is liable to taxation.\nThank you for reading this article.

To quote:\nThe Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts). Economic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.\nIn other words, 1/2 of one precent of the world’s electricity is currently being devoted to creating cryptocurrency for a tiny, tiny fraction of the world’s population. It’s basically a stealth tax on everyone.\nDe Vries also points out that higher costs won’t shut everyone down for a while. Initially, it will just create incentive to steal power and cpu cycles. From LiveScience:\nDe Vries also pointed out that when bitcoin mining becomes more costly than profitable, that doesn’t mean all the bitcoin miners will stop. Some miners, he pointed out, might steal electricity or otherwise figure out ways to mine bitcoin at no personal cost. For example, he said, one researcher mined $8,000 to $10,000 worth of bitcoin on a university supercomputer , costing the university about $150,000. Other, less-nefarious miners, he wrote, might keep mining for reasons like anonymity or libertarian ideology.\nIf you have an energy-hungry website – built according to pure “design” principles and ignoring the impact the site makes on energy and people (no Ux?) you’re a mini-bitcoin. Ignoring the effects of your virtual design – just because it is noiseless and virtual – is a cop-out.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vreis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin mining energy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T00:02:56.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "221ec3ad17245155c72c87b462f787f999f3e820", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7tfzYy7IYViyblR7MDgO6ktqifLIgVhz7vPvuv3W5Lz8qSbS2yhN7MjfOepZRMpdCGbWMVyKG4WsxxezsQ6UijKlmfIacGaTB", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "South Africa Gets Its First Cryptocurrency ATM That Support Bitcoin, Etherium : CryptoCurrencies", "title_full": "South Africa Gets Its First Cryptocurrency ATM That Support Bitcoin, Etherium : CryptoCurrencies", "published": "2018-05-19T23:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "221ec3ad17245155c72c87b462f787f999f3e820", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7tfzYy7IYViyblR7MDgO6ktqifLIgVhz7vPvuv3W5Lz8qSbS2yhN7MjfOepZRMpdCGbWMVyKG4WsxxezsQ6UijKlmfIacGaTB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lachief", "published": "2018-05-19T23:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa Gets Its First Cryptocurrency ATM That Support Bitcoin, Etherium : CryptoCurrencies", "text": "submitted by /u/lachief\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/ShQOqOFgcL8"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T21:58:51.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07381efb92fa9ab2d9ba506682c10f49657e1a31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbNfQLwMLNvpTLCoLyw465s-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Predictions for 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin Predictions for 2018", "published": "2018-05-19T23:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07381efb92fa9ab2d9ba506682c10f49657e1a31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbNfQLwMLNvpTLCoLyw465s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hitesh shaveta ohri", "published": "2018-05-19T23:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Predictions for 2018", "text": "I think bitcoin has a bright future as it is the king of all the cryptocurrencies..

Bison is the new platform that the exchange says will simplify the process of trading digital currencies and becomes the first crypto app, backed by a reputable stock exchange.\nBison Crypto Trading App The new app will make trading of cryptocurrencies mass marketable. The fact that the same will also be done through smartphones should go a long way in making it easy for most people to participate in the endeavor.\nDeveloped by Sow Labs, supported by Börse Stuttgart Digital Ventures, the new application plans to do away with the technical difficulties that have made it impossible for some people to venture into cryptocurrency trading .\nWhile still in development stage, Bison should be available to the masses for free later in the autumn. Ahead of the much-awaited launch in September, the firm is currently conducting a competition whereby entrants stand to win as much as three bitcoins (BTC), ten ethers (ETH), 20 litecoins (LTC), and 50 ripples (XRP) as part of the marketing campaign.\nTrading Fees and News Feed Part of Bison Offering Fee-free trading is what Bison promises as it looks to get as many people as possible into trading cryptocurrencies. However, it is still unclear how it plans to achieve the same. The app will also come with a news feed where investors will access a wide array of information needed to make informed decisions about investments.\nBison is to analyze more than 250,000 tweets from the cryptocurrency investment community and summarize the most important, for users to have a feel of sentiments in the market. The crypto-radar below shows that currently as per Bison’s analysis, cryptocurrencies are experiencing overall neutral sentiment.\nCrypto Radar. Source: Bison\nUnlike in the past where registration for user account would take up to three days, the app promises a maximum of three minutes until one can trade their favorite cryptoassets.\nFor starters, Bison is to offer support for four digital currencies; BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP. However, there are plans to increase support for more digital assets in future.\nThe unveiling of Bison app for trading crypto assets according to the exchange was triggered by a recent survey that showed investors want easy access to the crypto markets.\n“So far, investing in Bitcoin, Ether & Co. has been anything but easy. Bison consistently breaks down barriers: The app is easy to use, the user interface is available in German, later also in English,” Börse Stuttgart in a statement .\nCryptoassets Attract Mainstream Interest Established and regulated stock exchange venturing into the sector provides the clearest of indications that crypto assets could soon find their way into the mainstream industry .\nThere is already talk that tokenization could soon result in the creation of a new modern stock exchange whereby, instead of trading shares, people will be able to trade tokens. Börse Stuttgart joins a growing list of mainstream companies that have in the recent past ventured into the cryptocurrency space in the effort of meeting growing demand for such services.\nMedia Giant Thomson Reuters has already unveiled a data feed for crypto assets , which according to many observers opens the door for the firm to support digital assets in its trading platforms in future. A number of products all designed to target institutional investors have also cropped up as firms position themselves to take advantage of the growing market.\nOptions and futures trading of cryptocurrencies is slowly becoming a reality thanks to the evolution of crypto assets. Entry of professional and institutional investors all but affirms the push by the likes of Börse Stuttgart to pursue opportunities in the sector.\nThe post German Stock Exchange Unveils Bison for Free Trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\nfrom BTCMANAGER https://btcmanager.com/german-stock-exchange-unveils-bison-for-free-trading-of-bitcoin-ethereum-litecoin-and-ripple/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "stock exchange unveils bison for free trading of bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "börse stuttgart digital ventures", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "börse stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T09:35:47.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c915f76250a0d05d2f61e035134f1ed81c67f02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfSueXFEeusghW_h0zB.Uyno7kd_VJSqmuE0.B1RGf74jVGQdB8zJ06vDsGqBH33YoMP8ls_QDAr0ELkFM6WIzTzYCROfCL0YC1b36VyJe1hlKN7Oqa.lsMamQlMvcouZA-", "site_full": "countingpips.com", "site": "countingpips.com", "site_section": "http://countingpips.com/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "countingpips", "title": "Bitcoin Speculators increased bearish net positions for 2nd week", "title_full": "Bitcoin Speculators increased bearish net positions for 2nd week", "published": "2018-05-19T23:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://countingpips.com/articles-analysis/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/XBT_CountingPips-2.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8c915f76250a0d05d2f61e035134f1ed81c67f02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfSueXFEeusghW_h0zB.Uyno7kd_VJSqmuE0.B1RGf74jVGQdB8zJ06vDsGqBH33YoMP8ls_QDAr0ELkFM6WIzTzYCROfCL0YC1b36VyJe1hlKN7Oqa.lsMamQlMvcouZA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CountingPips Forex", "published": "2018-05-19T23:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Speculators increased bearish net positions for 2nd week", "text": "By CountingPips.com – Receive our weekly COT Reports by Email\nBitcoin Non-Commercial Speculator Positions:\nLarge cryptocurrency speculators raised their bearish net positions in the Bitcoin futures markets this week, according to the latest Commitment of Traders (COT) data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.\nThe non-commercial futures contracts of Bitcoin futures, traded by large speculators and hedge funds, totaled a net position of -1,874 contracts in the data reported through Tuesday May 15th.

It is like saying that we already know the value of it so we can now sell, but to be honest selling is the greed factor in cryptocurrency itself. We intend to get the fiat out of it then show an instant regret after we saw that the price went up after just a while.\nI had invested in BTC solely right now, and I sold my other coins recently and those coins were having quite large trading volume in large trading sites.
