A series of lower highs and lower lows also indicates the bears are in control.\nThe relative strength index (RSI) is holding slightly above 30.00, signaling just enough room for another $200 drop in BTC prices.\nWeekly chart The first weekly close below the 50-week MA in nearly three years only validates the argument that the long-term bull market has ended.\nThe relative strength index (RSI) has also rolled over in favor of the bears, while the 5-week MA is set to cross the 10-week MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover.\nClearly, BTC is on the defensive, still, there is merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency created a small doji candle on Sunday (as seen in the daily chart) at the key 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $7,209, indicating bear indecision in the marketplace. Thus, a minor corrective rally could be in the offing if bitcoin posts gain today (bullish doji reversal).\nView BTC looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000. Acceptance below that level would expose the April 1 low of $6,425. An unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800â$8,000. Only a convincing move above the weekly 50-MA would abort the bearish view. Meanwhile, a break above $9,990 (May 5 high) would imply a bullish reversal.

May 28, 2018 161\nBitcoin is the first and original digital currency that started the entire craze with blockchain technology. Almost 10 years ago, an anonymous hacker known under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto launched this crypto as the first digital coin ever. A couple of years later, there came new coins which followed by having over 1500 ICOs issued and launched over the mentioned period. As we all know, all currencies have their dev teams and CEOs, however, Bitcoin doesn’t.\nSo, how come its price has spiked up to the previous record of around 20.000$ per one unit, if Bitcoin can be marked as an abandoned project with over forty different forks derived from its system as basically, anyone with the matching tools can create a fork out of Bitcoin, and that is how we got Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and even Bitcoin God and Bitcoin Pizza.\nAs much as crypto enthusiasts appreciate the first coin ever to be launched, the Department of Justice in the United State is interested in finding out who is behind the price of Bitcoin. That is why they have announced an investigation that would be conducted in the following period in order to trace the person or a team who stands behind the price of Bitcoin.\nThe US Justice Department: Is Bitcoin Going Under Pump-and-Dump?\nAlmost anyone who is following up with the crypto market knows about a notorious market scheme called pump-and-dump.\nApparently, some holders have acquired this technique in order to have their holding units pumped up to the maximum in the market with having a price that is usually off the charts of the realistic price of the given coin.\nOnce the pumping part is done and the coin has reached a flattering value, the pumpers then dump their coins, which means that they are selling the coins that have been pumped, and then selling them back to the interested traders while collecting profit.\nMoreover, the US Justice Department believes that the signs of spoofing and possibly wash trades could also be discovered in the process of the mentioned investigation.\nSpoofing is another way of pumping the market value of a certain coin. This is conducted in a way that a holder of a certain coin, in this case, BTC, goes ahead and opens an active trade.\nThe great turn out of events that makes up for spoofing lies in the fact that the active trade is never meant to be. So, a holder can open a trade, which consequently affects the price of the given coin to rise up, while the trade never actually occurs, which is considered to be a fraudulent action.\nThat is exactly why the US Justice Department is trying to come to the bottom of this story, which should allow them to discover the great mystery of who stands behind the price of Bitcoin.\nCanada and the United States Investigating Beyond Bitcoin: Operation Crypto Sweep\nThe US Justice Department along with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and The Government of Canada are joining forces with a single project called Crypto sweep.\nWhile SEC is conducting their own investigation on different ICOs that are suspected of violating securities laws, the SEC is in support of the newly announced project Crypto sweep, that way supporting the US and Canada in their investigation.\nBesides from announcing an investigation on who stands behind the price of Bitcoin, the US Department of Justice is going to partner up with Canada with the goal of battling toxic ICOs and scam coins.\nThe US Justice Department will notify the public on their future progress regarding the Bitcoin investigation as well as their progress on Crypto sweep whether they joined their forces with Canada in an attempt to stop all fraudulent actions in the crypto market.\nHow is Bitcoin doing at the Current Moment?\nBitcoin has definitely seen better days, as we can see it at a pretty low price in oppose to its value in April and at the beginning of May.\nAs BTC is now worth around 7500$ per one unit, many reporters are linking this massive fall to the most recent announcement from the US Justice Department that there will be an investigation revolving around Bitcoin, however, if you go ahead and check the stats on CoinMarketCap or Coin Gecko, you will easily notice that the price of BTC went down before the original announcement.\nFollowing the latest change in the market, BTC is up by barely over 1% at this moment, on May 26 th , which means that the first crypto ever and number one on the global coin ranking list can be traded at the price of 7560$ per one unit, as it lost over 15% of its value in the course of the last month.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Bitcoin Core Becomes a Thing When Bitcoin Cash was first hard-forked back in November 2017, it resulted in two coins: Bitcoin Cash and the short-lived ‘ Bitcoin Clashic . ’ The latter being the legacy, albeit tongue-n-cheek, chain that did manage to mine a few blocks at the time. But the chain didn’t wither away . A few developers have been quietly maintaining it and have managed to rebrand it to Bitcoin Core – yes, the exact same name as Bitcoin’s (BTC) most popular software client implementation used by over 94% of all Bitcoin users. hello world\n— Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) (@BitcoinCore_) May 28, 2018 Confused yet? Hold on, it gets even weirder. On its official website , BTCC is described as a “fork of Bitcoin” and too claims to be “Satoshi’s vision” just like Bitcoin Cash. The description reads: Bitcoin Core (BTCC) is open source, peer-to-peer electronic cash. Bitcoin Core is a fork from Bitcoin $BTC, Bitcoin Core $BTCC was nourished through a labor of love, in preparation for this mission. Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) is an upgrade of Bitcoin Clashic. The true vision of Bitcoin Core is to compliment Bitcoin, and run along side it, by acting as an express lane for core values, speed and privacy. Unlike Bitcoin Clashic, however, the Bitcoin Core currency might have legs. It is already being traded on the Crypto Bridge and Bisq exchanges at a volatile price of about $10 USD. According to the website, the coin will be listed on mcap.info and coinmarketwatch.com , and is supported by a software wallet and comes with a block explorer as well. The open-source code of Bitcoin Core can be found on GitHub. Tit-for-Tat Trolling The Bitcoin Clashic developers and the Bitcoin community responsible for the revival of Clashic appear to have fully embraced the term, often used by one of the biggest Bitcoin Cash supporters, Roger Ver, who deliberately refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as Bitcoin Core while maintaining that Bitcoin Cash is ‘Bitcoin.’ Roger and Fast Money crew loves us #BitcoinCore $BTCC Thanks for the publicity\n— Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) (@BitcoinCore_) May 28, 2018 In fact, the deliberate misnaming of Bitcoin Cash as ‘BCash’ and Bitcoin as ‘Bitcoin Core’ has been the go-to tactic of both communities ever since the acrimonious Bitcoin (BTC) hard fork that occurred on August 1st, 2017 gave birth to Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nBitcoin Cash’s Roger Ver frequently refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as ‘Bitcoin Core’ because he believes that Bitcoin Cash — which he refers to as the ‘real’ Bitcoin — follows the ‘true vision’ of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n“Roger Ver and CNBC’s Fast Money seem to be one of our best advocates,” a person who wished to remain anonymous told Bitcoinist.\nMeanwhile, the online shopping platform Purse.io released ‘bcash’ just last week emphasizing that it is not a cryptocurrency but a software implementation for Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nNow it appears that the developers behind BTCC have done the exact opposite, launching a cryptocurrency under the name of Bitcoin Core to differentiate it from Bitcoin’s Bitcoin Core software client.\nThe reasoning is likely that Bitcoin Cash proponents would no longer be able to deliberately misname their arch nemesis, i.e. Bitcoin (BTC) as Core, since BTCC is now a real thing, and a completely different cryptocurrency.\nIs the launch of BTCC merely trolling or can it become a legit cryptocurrency?

Thank you for your patience in this regard. – David McKay (editor) & team Gauteng firm probed in R1bn crypto scam threatens to sue Hawks May 28 2018 17:07 Jan Cronje and Khulekani Magubane Related Articles Cryptos are tokens, not currency, says SARB\nCape Town - A Bitcoin company fingered by the Hawks for being part of a major investment scam has threatened to sue, unless the priority crime investigating unit retracts its statement.\nLawyers representing BitCaw Trading stated on Monday that the company was not aligned to BTC Global, as the Hawks claimed in their media release on Friday.\nThe laywers said that BTC Global was a \"completely separate entity\".\nThis comes after the Hawks announced that BitCaw Trading and BTC Global were the same company , and were being jointly investigated for a scam that may have fleeced up to 28 000 investors out of R1bn.\n\"BitCaw Trading does not manage or trade with third party money or offer any kind of investment returns,\" states the letter. \"BTC Global, on the other hand, was/is a Bitcoin Investment company and has nothing to do with our client.\"\nThe lawyer's letter further states that should the Hawks not retract their contention that the two companies are one and the same, and post the retraction by close of business on Tuesday, \"our instructions are to approach the South Gauteng High Court on an urgent basis in order to enforce our clients’ rights\".\nHawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Malaudzi told Fin24 that the Hawks had received the letter of demand from BitCaw Trading, but said that because the investigations are ongoing, the Hawks would rather wait for the courts to decide if they had erred, than retract their statement prematurely.\n\"We got the letter. We knew that they would go to the media. We will take it on in line with the due process. We believe that it is good that people want this to be clarified by the courts, and we will handle it there. As far as we are concerned, our statements on the matter still stand unless we are convinced otherwise,” said Mulaudzi.\nMulaudzi told Fin24 that the Hawks had sufficient evidence to support their statements regarding the matter.\nHe said the company's rights would be protected if they have indeed been aggrieved. However, he added, the Hawks would not compromise on pursuing justice for the victims said to have been swindled by the business.\n\"This is not something we are prepared to be swayed on. You have up to 28 000 victims who have already approached the Hawks. What about them?\n\"If we don’t look after them, who are we supposed look after? I am more concerned for people like the poor lady who called me crying about why she has to pay over a thousand dollars to get sum she is entitled to,\" he said.\n* Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER WHAT TO READ NEXT", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/SneBTz", "http://bitly.com/VXpI94", "http://on.fb.me/ltKIwR", "http://uploads.news24.com/#story", "http://bitly.com/LHqsL4", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jan cronje", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david mckay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khulekani magubane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cape town", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T18:19:43.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "440ef3320b9b6dc87cf4a32574a77da337c86094", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_I6WqyKS3KtmoKfb5Gu7Nd58obgBFplqv5Xboe9_WIv5F1BlsRlOq", "site_full": "www.youtube.com", "site": "youtube.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "I'm finally done, I poured my heart and soul into this Bitcoin explainer.

company that recently launched an initial coin offering (ICO) to raise funds to help develop a smart cryptocurrency trading assistant, has recently been hacked for 2,578 ETH (about $1.5 million) as

According to a Medium blog post the company published, what truly happened isn’t yet clear, although several indicators point them towards a group of hackers that hacked another project dubbed CypheriumChain for more than 17,000 ETH (about $9.8 million). The hacker(s), according to Taylor, collected its funds from multiple sources in a single wallet, before transferring them to a larger one, in which CypheriumChain’s funds ended up. At press time, said wallet has 48,440 ETH in it, worth over $28 million. After the theft, the organization’s team managed to identify an attempt to dump its TAY tokens on decentralized cryptocurrency exchange IDEX . The post reads: “After that we noticed an attempt to dump the stolen tokens on IDEX, then we asked the IDEX team to delist TAY until we have a clear vision on the situation.” The company claims to have also contacted EtherDelta , but never got a response. In a follow-up post , Taylor revealed the hacker(s) somehow managed to access one of their devices and gain control over one of their 1Password files, in what they dubbed a “highly advanced and coordinated attack.” In order to reimburse users, the company is now set to distribute a new token, as the hackers took over 7% of TAY’s total supply. Those who had a balance at block number 5663273 will receive the new token, except for the hacker. The post reads: “The goal is to make sure the hacker does not receive the new token. We analyzed all transactions made by him, and we know exactly where the stolen tokens are.” Speaking to Brazilian news outlet Portal do Bitcoin , the company’s founder Fabio Seixas revealed Taylor is looking to hire a company to investigate the incident. He added that he’ll reveal more information in the future, stating: “Soon, we will reveal an action plan both in relation to company’s operations and what will happen to the token. For the time being, I can not clarify more details about the token, otherwise the hacker might move ahead of our actions. “ https://www.ccn.com/1-5-million-cryptocurrency-trading-platform-taylor-suffers-2500-eth-hack/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taylor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "idex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T18:08:17.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec95686c8b573273074dd9d572d402fa93ee1ce2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCnHEk39pRKafNLAmXbI62ZEx25uvXgyOUJsVjMju5G9iuIXVjfw8l75o9lUiobBOqqfYYLl5FY6XA_Wv5TCgWXaFvHBHCty.ejq_8PabtTwbgdIKYAmJKxEoBX5dqlDa61oebeCMaHtfrIIxC3Bfc8X87DeAiPW8-", "site_full": "insidebitcoins.com", "site": "insidebitcoins.com", "site_section": "https://insidebitcoins.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Inside Bitcoins – News, Price, Events", "title": "Vertex To Launch Its Meetup Competition Sponsoring 25 Bitcoin Meetups Around The World!", "title_full": "Vertex To Launch Its Meetup Competition Sponsoring 25 Bitcoin Meetups Around The World!", "published": "2018-05-28T18:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_0763-1-e1527520084887-150x150.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec95686c8b573273074dd9d572d402fa93ee1ce2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRCnHEk39pRKafNLAmXbI62ZEx25uvXgyOUJsVjMju5G9iuIXVjfw8l75o9lUiobBOqqfYYLl5FY6XA_Wv5TCgWXaFvHBHCty.ejq_8PabtTwbgdIKYAmJKxEoBX5dqlDa61oebeCMaHtfrIIxC3Bfc8X87DeAiPW8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Inside Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-28T18:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vertex To Launch Its Meetup Competition Sponsoring 25 Bitcoin Meetups Around The World!", "text": "by Inside Bitcoins | May 28, 2018 | Sponsored |\nBitcoin meetups are probably the most iconic social activity that cryptocurrency enthusiasts engage in – apart from epic Twitter and Reddit battles. These gatherings of likeminded enthusiasts bring thousands of people together around the world. Their power to attract people transcends borders so much that enthusiasts actually look for these meetups when they fly abroad. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency fans in many cases would rather check the local crypto scene out than go into a museum or go on a guided tour of the city they are travelling to. Vertex knows this, and as a project that is deeply rooted in this sense of camaraderie and community that transcends borders, it decided to launch it very own Bitcoin meetup competition: the Battle of the Meetups!\nBattle of the Meetups Sponsored by Vertex\nThe Battle of the Meetups is simple. Vertex will go through all the Bitcoin meetups registered on meetup.com and will proceed to do the following: Select 25 meetups to sponsor. Sponsor those meetups throughout a period of 5 months. Give the selected meetups a list of criteria that Vertex will use to select the top 2 meetups over this period. Proceed to give the two winners an amazing prize.\nCriteria to Participate in the Battle of the Meetups\nThe criteria that Vertex established to determine the winner in this Battle of the Meetups is also quite simple. There are 4 vectors along which meetups can score points every time they meet. At the end, a final tally will determine the 2 winners. The following is the point system: The meetup that accumulates the most Facebook likes since the start of the Battle of the Meetups until the end, will be awarded 3 points. The meetup with the second most likes will get 2 points and the meetup that comes in third will accumulate 1 point. Vertex retweets after every meetup will yield 3 points for the meetup that retweets the most, 2 points for the runner up and 1 point for third place. The meetup that brings Vertex the most Telegram introductions will get 3 points, with the second place getting 2 points and the third place getting 1 point. Attendance will allow meetups to compete on how many people they attract each time. Meetups that attract 600 participants or more, will get 3 points each time. Those that gather 400 participants at least will be rewarded with 2 points and those that bring more than 200 participants will gather 1 point.\nThe Prize!\nAfter accumulating all these points over a period of 5 months, the Meetup organizers who win will be able to join Vertex at the Vegas Blockchain Conference in October. The winners will be announced at the Berlin Blockshow. The competition starts on June 11 th and it will come to a close by the end of October 2018.\nCan my Meetup Participate in the Battle of the Meetups?\nTo see if your meetup qualifies for the Battle of the Meetups, just make sure it complies with the following: It has 500 members. At least 30 members attended the last meetup. There is at least one meetup every 2 months.\nTo register, just send an email to rayne@4kingmedia.com . Let the Battle of the Meetups begin!\nFood and Drinks are Always Welcome, but what is Vertex exactly?\nVertex is a platform that invests in ICOs. It does so at an early stage, bringing the principles of disciplined investment, funds and a proven methodology to select the strongest projects to the cryptocurrency space. The platform is headed by a team of seasoned investors that have managed multi-billion dollar companies and investments around the world. Platform users will be able to buy tokens from the most promising, vetted ICOs out there through the platform directly at a discount. To find out more about Vertex, join us on our Telegram group, follow us on Twitter and Facebook , and ask us anything you want to know.

We turned on the Roku-looking machine in our San Francisco offices and allowed it to do its job. A small fortune was soon amassed, now worth around $100,000. Then, we lost the money. Forever.\nHere’s what happened to WIRED’s 13 Bitcoins—and to the millions of others that have faced the same fate.\nStefan Antonowicz, WIRED’s then-head of engineering, set up the miner. Robert McMillan, a former senior writer for WIRED (who now works at The Wall Street Journal ), then wrote about it. “When we received that Butterfly miner, we had a new ethical question: What do you do with the proceeds of a review device that essentially prints money?” says McMillan.\nFirst, it’s probably worth explaining how WIRED accrued its six-figure Bitcoin fortune. While fiat currencies, like the dollar, rely on banks and government regulators, Bitcoin runs on a peer-to-peer network monitored by an army of volunteer miners that run specialized software. Every 10 minutes, all the miners in the network race to solve a series of complex cryptographic math problems. The computers that win are awarded a slice of 12.5 new bitcoins. (That number halves every four years; it was 25 when we got our miner.) Usually, the fastest computers in the network solve the problems first.\nOver time, the puzzles have gotten harder, leading to a kind of computing-power arms race. Back when Bitcoin first launched, it was possible to mine coins using an everyday computer. These days, you’ll need specialized hardware significantly more powerful than the Butterfly Labs miner WIRED had. Currently, there are about 17 million bitcoins in existence ; by 2020, all 21 million planned Bitcoins will have been mined. You can learn more about the process in our Guide to Bitcoin .)\nWIRED’s miner essentially won the Bitcoin math lottery a couple of times, allowing it to generate a little over 13 coins into the network. Then, the staff had to figure out what to do with them. “We had a very long conversation, over several weeks, about what to do with the money,” says Michael Calore, a senior editor at WIRED who has been at the magazine since 2006. Some staff members argued the Bitcoin should be donated, or set aside for a charitable purpose in the future. Others said it had to be destroyed permanently. What was agreed upon was that the money shouldn’t just sit there, because it could influence how the magazine reported on cryptocurrencies.\n“I said we had to dump it and donate the money to charity soonest or we wouldn’t be able to cover Bitcoin,” says Adam Rogers, a deputy editor at WIRED. “We had to disclose it in every story.” Eventually, it was decided that the private key, which unlocks the Bitcoin wallet and allows the funds to be spent, should be destroyed.\n“We talked about donating it to a journalism institution, or setting it aside as a scholarship. But we decided that if we gained any benefit from it at all, it would color our future coverage of bitcoin,” says Calore. “So we just destroyed the key, knowing full well that it could eventually be worth six or seven figures.” McMillan then posted a story announcing the key had been ripped to pieces.\nThrowing Away the Key To deal in bitcoin, you need at least two different keys, one public and one private (newer security protocols allow you to add more private keys). Together, the combination of codes lets you trade Bitcoin without an intermediary like a bank. You can look up WIRED’s public key to send us money, and then in theory, we could use our private key to access those funds—had we not destroyed it. It’s extremely unlikely we could successfully guess the code: it’s 64 digits long and no one remembers what it was.\nNo additional copies of the private key exist, at least according to the people who were there. “I didn’t make a copy of the paper, or commit the 64 characters on it to memory,” says Antonowicz, the technologist who set up the miner. The good news is that if someone did move the coins, the transaction would be public, allowing WIRED to see where they traveled to. In fact, you too can check out WIRED’s lost Bitcoins right here .\n“If you lost your private keys I think it’s game over,” he says. I also looked into a service that tries to crack cryptocurrency wallets via sheer brute force. But their services would be no help, since we don’t have access to the hard drive itself. It looks like WIRED really did lose the money forever. The good news is we’re far from alone.\nIn theory, we might be able to recover the Bitcoin wallet from the hard drive where it was stored, but even that wouldn’t be much help. “There might have been a way to forensically recover the wallet—with the encrypted key—from my hard drive, but I shredded that particular drive years ago,” says Antonowicz.\nPlus, even if the wallet was resurrected, it’s encrypted. Breaking that protection via brute force would take an unimaginable amount of time. There are three times more possible combinations than there are atoms in the observable universe, by Antonowicz’s count.\n“Originally I was going to say that the closest metaphor I have is that we dropped a car key somewhere in the Atlantic, but I think it’s closer for me to say we dropped the key somewhere between here and the Alpha Centauri,” says Antonowicz.\nRecovering our bitcoins is essentially like trying to recover a photo album on a lost computer. Except not only did you get rid of the hard drive, you also protected the album in an encrypted folder with a 64-digit passcode that you threw away.\nStill, we wanted to make sure there was absolutely no way to get the bitcoins back. WIRED’s editor-in-chief, Nicholas Thompson, suggested that if we were able to recover the funds, they might go toward hiring a full-time cryptocurrency reporter. I reached out to the founder of Butterfly Labs, who didn’t respond. I also contacted Mark Frauenfelder, a writer and the author of a WIRED article about how he recovered $30,000 worth of Bitcoin. He agrees we’re screwed.\nLost and Never Found Chainalysis, a research firm that analyzes activity across different cryptocurrency markets, estimates that between 2.78 and 3.79 million, or between 17 and 23 percent of all bitcoins have been lost. That includes wallets believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious founder of Bitcoin who hasn’t touched his estimated 1 million coins since 2011.\n“The number of lost coins over time will drop,” says Michael Gronager, the CEO and co-founder of Chainalysis. He argues that it’s because there’s more awareness of Bitcoin’s enduring value, even if the price wildly fluctuates. He also says that even if Satoshi were to reemerge, his activity wouldn’t significantly impact the market because he wouldn’t likely spend a large sum of Bitcoin at once.\nThere are several ways you can lose Bitcoin. Like WIRED, you can simply lose track of your private key or your hard drive. One of the most famous cases of this is what happened to James Howells, an IT worker in London who lost 7,500 bitcoins, or around $56 million, when his laptop was thrown away in 2013. He reportedly wants to dig through five years of trash to unearth the computer. This is the most common way to lose Bitcoin; even Elon Must tweeted that he forgot how to access a portion of a coin.\nYou can also lose bitcoins by running buggy code or making software mistakes, though these instances are more rare. Last year, for example, someone forgot to collect their mining reward and burned 12.5 coins. In another similar incident , someone may have accidentally swapped a processing fee with the value of the transaction, resulting in nearly 300 coins lost. One time, someone even sent 2,600 coins to an incorrectly configured address , burning them into nonexistence. All of these examples come from BlockSci , a tool developed at Princeton University for analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain.\nIt can be difficult to assess whether any given bitcoin is really lost for good. “It’s actually pretty difficult to say for certain. A lot of what we do is look at the big picture,” says Harry Kalodner a PhD at Princeton who helped develop BlockSci. He says part of the problem is that you can rarely determine whether someone is just holding onto their Bitcoin, or whether they’ve definitively lost access to it. Since Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any single authority, there’s no one who can simply close your account.\nSo what could WIRED have done, were we to do the whole thing again? Since 2013, Bitcoin has added a number of new, more sophisticated features. For one, we could have locked our coins away until a certain date. “One Bitcoin feature that’s been added is that it now supports time-locked coins, that makes them completely un-spendable until a set point in the future,” says Kalodner. Like, say, May 2018, when the editor-in-chief could really use some money to hire another reporter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefan antonowicz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mcmillan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmillan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butterfly labs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T19:17:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60d0f17af2cdb792fbf0a37b945a65b9b5503ef1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3fq59MhvWkPZzqjO1DdPOsrMf9U7_je2Kx.5kdEmybrBMoyaK6NQuz8NdJkKneyC8m7A1UtzPtWH3fCAuQ3FoAwuAnqB7d3y4EVKz7eP4UQ5MKG.Oaldq5YrSXqlXm2QFCr5RKb50Kw--", "site_full": "themeshreport.com", "site": "themeshreport.com", "site_section": "https://themeshreport.com", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Mesh Report", "title": "How Central Banks Will Try to Replace Bitcoin with Something Terrifying", "title_full": "How Central Banks Will Try to Replace Bitcoin with Something Terrifying", "published": "2018-05-28T18:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60d0f17af2cdb792fbf0a37b945a65b9b5503ef1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3fq59MhvWkPZzqjO1DdPOsrMf9U7_je2Kx.5kdEmybrBMoyaK6NQuz8NdJkKneyC8m7A1UtzPtWH3fCAuQ3FoAwuAnqB7d3y4EVKz7eP4UQ5MKG.Oaldq5YrSXqlXm2QFCr5RKb50Kw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Growth Stock Network", "published": "2018-05-28T18:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Central Banks Will Try to Replace Bitcoin with Something Terrifying", "text": "Mad Hedge Fund Trader How Central Banks Will Try to Replace Bitcoin with Something Terrifying Growth Stock Network May 29, 2018 Comments Off on How Central Banks Will Try to Replace Bitcoin with Something Terrifying\nTheorists of all kinds and persuasions agree: We’re almost certainly hurtling toward a cashless, digital currency-using society at some point in the not-too-distant future.\nThe question is, what is it going to look like?\nRealistically, it will be nowhere near the original vision laid out for Bitcoin, much to the chagrin of crypto-enthusiasts and real-money libertarians everywhere.\nAs I’m going to show you, the path being taken is a tale of national, international, and even supranational intrigue that you might never have imagined.\nIt’s filled with so many contradictions, it’s become laughable.\nYet the central planners behind it all have so much to gain, it’s a near certainty that soon we’ll all be using the same virtual global cryptocurrency – like it or not.\nAnd if you think your freedom and privacy are threatened now, well you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. Governments Will Crack Down on Anarchic Bitcoin\nWhen bitcoin caught fire last year and entered full-blown “tulip mania” territory, many of its supporters got one thing wrong: They assumed governments and big banks would allow the cryptocurrency to flourish.\nBut the power to issue fiat money is so valuable to those who control it that there was no way they were going to let a private, anonymous, and relatively scarce virtual currency move in on their territory.\nIt simply isn’t going to happen.\nThat said, blockchain technology is revolutionary and enormously valuable, especially to governments or institutions who might use it to control a currency and its transactions.\nSo blockchain is here to stay and improve, but currencies will remain fiat and under the thumbs of central planners. You can bet on that, since they can use blockchain to eventually tax, regulate, and track any and every transaction, period.\nConsider that without physical cash, bank runs become an impossibility. Consider, too, that a negative-interest rate regime would be a snap to initiate.\nAnd it gets more insidious than that.\nIf a central planner decides you’re not eating the “right foods” according to your health condition, that you’re drinking too much, or that you’re simply not a “good citizen,” it would be all too easy to block all kinds of transactions you might attempt until you “see the light.”\nAnd lest you think I’m just blowing a lot of hot air, consider that China’s massive, ongoing “social credit” experiment is already drifting in this terrifying, authoritarian direction.\nRead on and you’ll see how all of this may lie nearer in the future than you ever thought possible.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T18:15:19.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81896d26d2f7a6deef4dc2a2c21dec654b7d86ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWz8AHCkWPliMWNWEi2fRpyqc2HsE24mujiOalz2bMFgadLo05pQPc1OiBbOoeOT8J3nZE48vz.lnI63OAUCnbyQPC2nQI0Tqg2xIB10OUhA--", "site_full": "normanhafizi.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://normanhafizi.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Mencari Keredhaan-Mu, Ya Allah, Ya Tuhanku...", "title": "www.ccn.com : Bitcoin Price Drop From $20,000 Likely Due to Market Manipulation: Traders (bitcoin)", "title_full": "www.ccn.com : Bitcoin Price Drop From $20,000 Likely Due to Market Manipulation: Traders (bitcoin)", "published": "2018-05-28T18:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81896d26d2f7a6deef4dc2a2c21dec654b7d86ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWz8AHCkWPliMWNWEi2fRpyqc2HsE24mujiOalz2bMFgadLo05pQPc1OiBbOoeOT8J3nZE48vz.lnI63OAUCnbyQPC2nQI0Tqg2xIB10OUhA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NORMAN HAFIZI Alfan (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-28T18:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "www.ccn.com : Bitcoin Price Drop From $20,000 Likely Due to Market Manipulation: Traders (bitcoin)", "text": "Since December 17, the bitcoin price has been on a continuous decline, falling from $19,900 to $5,980 at its yearly low.

Market Manipulation Theory Recently, a group of cryptocurrency researchers and traders suggested that the bitcoin price has began to fall from its all-time high at around $20,000, on the same day the bitcoin futures market of CME and CBOE launched.

In retrospect, it is now obvious that smart/institutional money was stocking up before that date. Hindsight is 20/20. Since 12/17/17, Bitcoin has been in a bear market. The remainder of this analysis will focus on patterns observed during this market downturn, as well as signals for when it might come to an end,” the group said. It added that every time the cryptocurrency market experienced a correction, the magnitude of the drop declined, proposing that the large-scale investors had less amounts of bitcoin after driving major corrections. The group emphasized that the cryptocurrency market experienced three major corrections since December 2017 and the two subsequent corrections recorded lower sell volumes. “Not only is selling volume lower, but the drops have been less severe. Each component of each leg down is less steep than the previous leg down. RSI, a momentum indicator, also shows selling has been less extreme. The trend is ‘flattening out.’” Source: BitcoinWisdom As seen in the chart above, the initial correction of bitcoin in December led the price of BTC to fall from $19,900 to $6,000, by more than 69 percent. The second correction that occured on March 5 resulted in a drop from $11,800 to $6,500, by around 44.9 percent, and the third correction pushed the price of bitcoin to fall from $10,000 to $7,300, by 27 percent. Validity of the Theory In 2008, CNBC Mad Money host and fund manager Jim Cramer emphasized that it is relatively easy for large-scale investors to manipulate the stock market, which has significantly deeper liquidity than bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. “It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game. You could move it up and fade it, that often creates a very negative feel so let’s say you take a longer-term view into your day and I’m going to boost the futures and then when the real sellers come in, they’re going to knock it down and that’s going to create a negative view,” said Cramer. CNBC Fast Money host Melissa Lee raised a similar point on May 25 show, as she noted that banks and institutions have colluded to manipulate Libor among other assets, interest rates, and commodities. It is entirely possible that the premise established by the group of cryptocurrency traders is correct and that large-scale investors have in fact manipulated the cryptocurrency market. But, if it has been the futures market that affected the price of bitcoin over the past five months, it is completely legal to do so and it remains unclear whether similar manipulation strategies can be prevented in the long-term. https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-drop-from-20000-likely-due-to-market-manipulation-traders/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hindsight", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T18:04:06.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "83f63a12a8c98b7192fca502af1171d76cf8bf02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVNteqrBs5Bwb0tjPOZM7G0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marketplace", "title": "to get the bitcoin should issue a capital?", "title_full": "to get the bitcoin should issue a capital?", "published": "2018-05-28T18:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83f63a12a8c98b7192fca502af1171d76cf8bf02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVNteqrBs5Bwb0tjPOZM7G0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "feehannah", "published": "2018-05-28T18:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "to get the bitcoin should issue a capital?", "text": "What do you mean when you say to get a bitcoin?

blockchain-based distributed computing platform which powers the “ether” cryptocurrency.\nEthereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, crowd funded in mid-2014, and released a year later, making it one of the earlier platforms and cryptocurrencies.\nThe following is a video by the founder of Ethereum explaining the platform:\nWhile this was initially an alternative to Bitcoin which was looking to advance the technology per se, an exploited vulnerability in the DAO project (a decentralized autonomous organization meant to provide a business model for the platform) caused the Ethereum project to be forked into two separate blockchains, each with its own cryptocurrency, resulting in Ethereum Classic and Ethereum.\nEthereum is today still one of the main cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin, but its real technology advancement was that it was the first technology to implement smart contracts.\nThe real value of Ethereum, therefore, comes not from the currency but from the actual platform.\nWhile Bitcoin uses the blockchain to verify the ownership of the digital currency, the Ethereum platform allows developers to implement truly distributed applications, removing the “centralized” client-server architecture of the internet. It’s the first platform to implement the smart contract concept.\nThe Ether currency, while also being a tradable cryptocurrency, is actually used to fuel the network. Participants in the network use ether to pay for services performed by the Ethereum network.\nIn reality, the cryptocurrency is a side-effect (albeit an essential one) of the Ethereum platform.\nGiven the smart contract concept, Ethereum can be used to build truly decentralized applications .\nEthereum uses the concept of a virtual machine to be able to do work — the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) — which can run the “tasks” required to build a decentralized application.\nEthereum Strengths: A very popular platform and cryptocurrency which keeps growing and was one of the earlier technologies. Big early mover advantage. Has the possibility to perform work and implement distributed applications rather than just being a cryptocurrency platform. Implements useful technology advantages such as smart contracts.\nEhereum Weaknesses: Proof of work requires mining, which is energy intensive. This is being solved with a transition to Proof of Stake . The DAO hard-fork of Ethereum was, and still is, a contentious issue which split the Ethereum community. Other very expensive bugs have happened, but all of them were user errors. What is Cardano?\nCardano is another decentralized, fully open-source public blockchain and cryptocurrency project, which powers the ADA cryptocurrency.\nThe idea behind the project is to improve previous blockchain platforms by developing a smart contract platform which delivers advanced features through a research-first approach.\nEssentially, rather than developers working mostly on their own, the concepts are peer-reviewed, making sure the ideas implemented have been reviewed and proven to work before being implemented.\nThe following is a lengthy but interesting overview of Cardano by Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Input Output Hong Kong.\nCardano uses a different approach to “mining” than other blockchain platforms. Rather than requiring energy-intensive resources as proof of work (one of the major drawbacks of Bitcoin and other mining-based cryptocurrencies), the new algorithm eliminates this intensive mechanism, yet it still has been proven to be mathematically secure — to the level of Bitcoin (the most secure platform to date).\nThis is what’s called proof of stake . A number of blockchain platforms have tried to implement such a solution, and the pioneer of the method — still in operation today — is Peercoin . Cardano uses what’s called Ouroboros to find a “leader”, which is determined not through mining but through a multi-party implementation of a coin-flipping protocol.\nThis means that the Cardano platform brings all of the benefits of the blockchain platform, but eliminates one of the major disadvantages we’ve witnessed with blockchain, the insanely wasteful use of energy required for mining purposes.\nCardano was developed by blockchain development firm IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong) and is led by Charles Hoskinson, former co-founder of Ethereum.\nThe aim of Cardano is to be used as a platform to build financial applications powered by the Ada cryptocurrency.\nCardano provides a blockchain implementation which makes use of all of the advantages of blockchain and decentralized, distributed computing without suffering from the major drawbacks which have been dogging other platforms and major cryptocurrencies.\nCardano is still in the process of being developed.\nCardano Strengths: Not intent on speculation of cryptocurrency but more for the advancement of the blockchain technology per se. Resolves a number of issues with popular blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, by implementing a type of mining which doesn’t require much energy. Supported by both academic and technology research, such that there’s a strong, reliable community around it.\nCardano Weaknesses: At the time of writing this article, the technology is still in relatively early days and is not intended for production. Whether or not it will be able to fulfill its promises remains to be seen. What is NEO?\nNEO is another blockchain designed to build a scalable network of decentralized applications.\nThe difference and specific strength of this platform is that it supports commonly used programming languages such as .NET, C++, Go, Java and Python. This is done through the creation of a customized version of Docker, called the neoVM, which can run the code on different secure executable environments.\nThe other differentiating feature of NEO is that it’s backed by the Chinese government. While this is something which can go both ways, the backing of such a powerful institution almost guarantees the success of this platform.\nNEO uses dBFT (delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) as a proof of work mechanism, which is a methodology that’s less energy-intensive than Ethereum mining, very similar to Proof of Stake. NEO is also not susceptible to the hard-fork problem which split Ethereum, because the mechanism requires a two-thirds majority rule to operate while the minority gets discarded.\nNEO has another real-world advantage. It uses the concept of X.509 Digital Identities to be able to associate real-world identities to the blockchain, which is important to implement applications which require proof of identity, such as KYC/AML (Know Your Client / Anti-Money Laundering) requirements where regulations are involved.\nNEO Strengths: Backed by the Chinese government, giving it a strong backing and legitimacy of use. Implements secure identities, allowing the association of real identities to the blockchain. Can be used by popular programming languages in use today. Less energy intensive than traditional blockchain mining.\nNEO Weaknesses: The backing by the Chinese government might mean that technological decisions are taken with political influence rather than independently. Conclusion\nAs can be seen from the above comparisons, blockchain technology is slowly but surely evolving from a speculative currency into a real digital platform which can be used to build scalable, distributed applications.\nThe above three platforms are some of the more popular ones which can be used to develop applications today, but all of them are evolving at a rapid pace.\nIn the near future, we’ll start seeing the true maturity of the technology and the release of truly distributed blockchain-based applications.

However, Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital LLC, has declared traders are trading in the “wrong coins” rather than just betting on BTC. According to Bogart, most altcoins are overvalued whereas the granddaddy crypto is not.\nJoin the Bitsonline Telegram channel to get the latest Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and tech news updates: https://t.me/bitsonline\nBTC Is a ‘Strong Buy,’ Per Bogart\nTrading in some of the sexier medium- or small-cap cryptocurrencies? Don’t, says Blockchain Capital’s Spencer Bogart.\nIn an interview with CNBC’s Melissa Lee and Fast Money Traders, Bogart said that the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin, is still a definite buy compared to other popular altcoins in the space.\nBogart explained his position, saying that no other crypto can boast of the same mainstream and institutional penetration that bitcoin is enjoying right now. Bogart noted that dynamic was evident at the recent “Blockchain Week” in New York, where mainstream financial executives were seen actively participating in all things bitcoin.\nSpencer Bogart.\nIndeed, powerhouse financial institutions like Goldman Sachs are pivoting toward the ecosystem with bitcoin-related services .\nWith a top-down approach then, Bogart thinks it’s best to avoid lesser market powers like NEO and IOTA, with sticking to big-cap coins like ether and bitcoin cash being more preferable in his mind and with consolidating mainly in BTC being his most ideal long-term market approach.\nStill a Ways to Go, But Faith Is Firming Up\nThe mindset surrounding bitcoin has also changed significantly over the last decade.\nIn the past, when BTC value dropped by 50 or 60 percent, a cloud of fear used to develop and people seriously questioned if bitcoin was over. Such existential questioning has seemingly fallen by the wayside, even if the cyclical market fear remains. Even amid the current cryptoeconomy chop, the difference between today and crashes of the past is the exponential amount of development and adoption that we’re standing atop in the here and now.\nIn other words, the “fundamentals” are fundamentally different.\nAs such, Bogart predicts the bitcoin price will once again rise above $10,000 USD by the end of 2018.\nWill institutionalization of BTC redefine the crypto space?

At bitcoin, everything is bad in the mid-term. In the week-long picture, you can see yourself - in the negative zone of the BB, the falling ma20 and everything like that presses from above. Where do we fall? On my previous charts, there is a historical logarithmic support line in the 3-4k area, depending on how to navigate. In the area of ​​2000, we are met by a week-long ma200. I consider the support of this curve to be absolute at this stage. It just can not be pierced.\nBear the wind blows to us from Wall Street. There are very clever guys with big swaps, they are shaking the same button in all markets, including bitcoin. This is an exhaustive explanation of what is happening.\nOnce again I say bulls sleep at least until the 19 th year.\nDamn if we go to 3k-4K thats realy bad for BTC, from 20k to 3k is not good.\nI hope your wrong... if your not then iT Will be a hard time for BTC owners including my self.\nOn the contrary, I think 3k would be good for BTC. The parabolic move up from 2.5k only took 4 months, too fast, and too overbought.\nThe price has to get oversold before a strong low is established. Nothing to worry about in the long term.\nI present a very different outlook to most ppl. , and have always gravitated to the contrarian point of view.\nThe very biggest scale picture : I count 4 large price waves of adoption since 2011. The chart points are classic formations, like a single huge bull move. The previous high supports the next-but-one low (in fact there is always a significant gap : that is an indicator of the strength of the big move).\nThe series is (approx).\nHighs : $32, $200, $1200, $19000.\nLows : $50, $270, ( ) $2000 fits quite well here. It would still leave the series intact.\nIf this is correct, I would not expect the price to spend much time below $3000, blink and you might miss it. It could take a year to get there.\nThese levels also fit well with the Dimon Dip in September 2017, to $2500, which is where the real parabola started.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T13:58:51.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76a4d13a485ae3e0d3401741678efc63e939e817", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXZBdUFkMyxaqRlT6z2TxdFXfWsAJYvMpIM62lHM2Mx44LuA2wy4N81urULuutDp6LmqIh2TW8v3EoEGOBt1Pc3ajUwOhWvZtTgeUsN0DJFmH_ZhZe2obMilAoXPfGPJQo-", "site_full": "newsamed.com", "site": "newsamed.com", "site_section": "http://newsamed.com/feed", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The News Amed", "title": "Looking For New Way To Donate During Ramadan London Mosque Now Accepts Bitcoin", "title_full": "Looking For New Way To Donate During Ramadan London Mosque Now Accepts Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T17:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://newsamed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1527519321-117436.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76a4d13a485ae3e0d3401741678efc63e939e817", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXZBdUFkMyxaqRlT6z2TxdFXfWsAJYvMpIM62lHM2Mx44LuA2wy4N81urULuutDp6LmqIh2TW8v3EoEGOBt1Pc3ajUwOhWvZtTgeUsN0DJFmH_ZhZe2obMilAoXPfGPJQo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsamed", "published": "2018-05-28T17:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Looking For New Way To Donate During Ramadan London Mosque Now Accepts Bitcoin", "text": "Looking For New Way To Donate During Ramadan London Mosque Now Accepts Bitcoin May 28, 2018, 14:55 pm 0 4 0\nLONDON – Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan?

Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg , Novogratz — the founder of $250 million cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital — said that this increased oversight will help weed out bad actors from the nascent ecosystem. “Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market,” Novogratz said. “Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins.” As CCN reported , the DOJ is scrutinizing whether cryptocurrency traders and other market actors have engaged in illegal activities to manipulate the bitcoin price, as well as the value of other prominent cryptocurrencies. Novogratz’s optimistic comments on the probe are not unique among Wall Street’s cryptocurrency bulls. Cameron Winklevoss, who co-founded cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, told the publication that the company welcomes “any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors.” Gemini, incidentally, recently struck a deal with Nasdaq to use the stock exchange operator’s surveillance technology to flag unusual trading patterns in real time. Similarly, Tom Lee — founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors — said that the investigation was “really welcome news” because it will bring “adult supervision” to the cryptocurrency markets. Fundstrat has predicted that the bitcoin price will reach $25,000 before the end of the year, an outlook it has not wavered from despite the recent downturn. The bitcoin price traded sideways in the 24 hours before this article was written, despite significant intraday volatility that caused the flagship cryptocurrency to plunge from $7,738 to $7,331 in a span of just four hours. Bitcoin has since stabilized at a present value of $7,554 on Bitfinex. https://www.ccn.com/dojs-bitcoin-price-manipulation-probe-a-good-thing-mike-novogratz/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gemin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galaxy digital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T17:52:21.062+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6981e4c51d5fc1b81b00865ad3208285392f93e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp69OQ8MnLrKVC3pEN9himldPk9Hp3YN9fyub9CKPVOmlrTif8BbmcAIVxSm.AY.R0as8Wf8i0ukCeNeNMT4CYHyArRVt75h7A-", "site_full": "blocktribune.com", "site": "blocktribune.com", "site_section": "http://blocktribune.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "BlockTribune", "title": "Bitcoin Continues To Drop On US Holiday Weekend", "title_full": "Bitcoin Continues To Drop On US Holiday Weekend", "published": "2018-05-28T17:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://blocktribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bitcoin-Price.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6981e4c51d5fc1b81b00865ad3208285392f93e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp69OQ8MnLrKVC3pEN9himldPk9Hp3YN9fyub9CKPVOmlrTif8BbmcAIVxSm.AY.R0as8Wf8i0ukCeNeNMT4CYHyArRVt75h7A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bruce Haring", "published": "2018-05-28T17:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Continues To Drop On US Holiday Weekend", "text": "Hong Kong’s Huobi Group, a blockchain asset solutions provider, has appointed former OKEx CEO ...

' The latter being the legacy, albeit tongue-n-cheek, chain that did manage to mine a few blocks at the time.\nBut the chain didn't wither away . A few developers have been quietly maintaining it and have managed to rebrand it to Bitcoin Core – yes, the exact same name as Bitcoin's (BTC) most popular software client implementation used by over 94% of all Bitcoin users.\nhello world :) $BTCC #BitcoinCore\n— Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) (@BitcoinCore_) May 28, 2018\nConfused yet? Hold on, it gets even weirder.\nOn its official website , BTCC is described as a \"fork of Bitcoin\" and too claims to be \"Satoshi's vision\" just like Bitcoin Cash. The description reads:\nBitcoin Core (BTCC) is open source, peer-to-peer electronic cash. Bitcoin Core is a fork from Bitcoin $BTC, Bitcoin Core $BTCC was nourished through a labor of love, in preparation for this mission. Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) is an upgrade of Bitcoin Clashic. The true vision of Bitcoin Core is to compliment Bitcoin, and run along side it, by acting as an express lane for core values, speed and privacy.\nUnlike Bitcoin Clashic, however, the Bitcoin Core currency might have legs. It is already being traded on the Crypto Bridge and Bisq exchanges at a volatile price of about $10 USD.\nAccording to the website, the coin will be listed on mcap.info and coinmarketwatch.com , and is supported by a software wallet and comes with a block explorer as well. The open-source code of Bitcoin Core can be found on GitHub.\nTit-for-Tat Trolling The Bitcoin Clashic developers and the Bitcoin community responsible for the revival of Clashic appear to have fully embraced the term, often used by one of the biggest Bitcoin Cash supporters, Roger Ver, who deliberately refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as Bitcoin Core while maintaining that Bitcoin Cash is 'Bitcoin.'\nRoger and Fast Money crew loves us #BitcoinCore $BTCC\nThanks for the publicity pic.twitter.com/Q9ZHGY7gin\n— Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) (@BitcoinCore_) May 28, 2018\nIn fact, the deliberate misnaming of Bitcoin Cash as 'BCash' and Bitcoin as 'Bitcoin Core' has been the go-to tactic of both communities ever since the acrimonious Bitcoin (BTC) hard fork that occurred on August 1st, 2017 gave birth to Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nBitcoin Cash's Roger Ver frequently refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as 'Bitcoin Core' because he believes that Bitcoin Cash — which he refers to as the 'real' Bitcoin — follows the 'true vision' of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\"Roger Ver and CNBC's Fast Money seem to be one of our best advocates,\" a person who wished to remain anonymous told Bitcoinist.\nMeanwhile, the online shopping platform Purse.io released 'bcash' just last week emphasizing that it is not a cryptocurrency but a software implementation for Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nNow it appears that the developers behind BTCC have done the exact opposite, launching a cryptocurrency under the name of Bitcoin Core to differentiate it from Bitcoin's Bitcoin Core software client.\nThe reasoning is likely that Bitcoin Cash proponents would no longer be able to deliberately misname their arch nemesis, i.e. Bitcoin (BTC) as Core, since BTCC is now a real thing, and a completely different cryptocurrency.\nIs the launch of BTCC merely trolling or can it become a legit cryptocurrency?

Egypt's Grand Mufti, the nation's top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque's decision. \"Bitcoin is like any other currency. It's ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,\" Adeyemi told Reuters. The mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300). Muslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

Many would-be miners have no understanding of how large power purchases work. In one case this winter, miners from China landed their private jet at the local airport, drove a rental car to the visitor center at the Rocky Reach Dam, just north of Wenatchee, and, according to Chelan County PUD officials, politely asked to see the \"dam master because we want to buy some electricity.\" Bitcoin fever has created other, smaller-scale problems for the utility. Three times a week, on average, utility crews in Chelan County discover unpermitted home miners running computer servers far too large for the electrical grids of residential neighborhoods. In one instance last year, the transformer outside a bootleg miner's home overheated and touched off a grass fire, Chelan County PUD officials say. - - - Just cut these cryptocurrency mining parasites off.

Joost van der Burgt, author of the publication and fintech policy advisor at the Federal Reserve’s San Francisco branch, confirms what many have already said: that bitcoin straddles the properties of all three asset classes. However, he draws interesting points over properties that make bitcoin fit into one category better over others. Burgt also shows historical evidence that suggests bitcoin is in a bubble, without saying firmly whether it is or not. Bitcoin Price Chart Though the price volatility would be an obvious reason why bitcoin struggles as a real-world currency, Burgt looks more closely at the ways it is currently used in the market place alongside central banking structures. His conclusion comes as no surprise: bitcoin is not traded for goods much at all. In additional to increasingly unfavorable global regulations , he says that bitcoin lacks a corresponding real value, which is a key part in exchange for goods. He writes: “…the exchange rate between two currencies can be regarded as a broad measure of the prices of one country’s goods and services relative to another country. When looking at the Bitcoin ‘exchange rate,’ this category of determinants seems to be inapplicable – there is no current native Bitcoin economy with native Bitcoin prices for goods and services.” As a security, bitcoin fares better in the current framework, though not great. Securities are either purchases of debt or stakes in a company. Bitcoin doesn’t fit into either of these categories since it does not generate interest, dividends or capital gains. As a commodity and an oft-mentioned “ store of value “, however, bitcoin behaves much like entrenched commodities like gold and oil, at least according to Burgt. Though he argues that bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, he points to mining as the key form of placing value on the asset — a value, he says, that approximates to roughly $1,800 per coin. He writes: “Although Bitcoins do not possess any real intrinsic value, from a commodity valuation perspective, we can estimate a hypothetical value based on its production costs. Recent estimates regarding the energy involved in mining a single Bitcoin by professional energy-efficient mining rigs put it at about $1,800 when mined in China (where 80% of the currently mined Bitcoins originate). The hypothetical value of $1,800 is far lower than bitcoin’s current price. Burgt only strikes the bubble fear home with a look at the stages of bitcoin’s FOMO and euphoria cycles that pattern previous bubbles in the market place (such as the 2007 financial crisis). In a unique development, however, Burgt mentions John McAfee’s $1 million bitcoin price target as a counterpoint. https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-has-hypotehtical-value-of-1800-federal-reserve-report/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burgt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve report", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T17:41:40.058+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1bb7e137923a018e00f1d1ba3be3d0fb31014bcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQxvMpmV1kYL5Dlyfg8xEJ6Duq.5rb2xtn5JOVzftHj_Fd45ck36TDV3EEiDAAUZcvlP22XnO6gL0GvL_Z89ge0", "site_full": "business.mb.com.ph", "site": "mb.com.ph", "site_section": "http://business.mb.com.ph/category/columnists/", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "investing", "buying_selling_homes", "finance"], "section_title": "Columnists » Manila Bulletin Business", "title": "Are you a Bitcoin believer?", "title_full": "Are you a Bitcoin believer? » Manila Bulletin Business", "published": "2018-05-28T17:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PH", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "https://business.mb.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-38.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7588, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1bb7e137923a018e00f1d1ba3be3d0fb31014bcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQxvMpmV1kYL5Dlyfg8xEJ6Duq.5rb2xtn5JOVzftHj_Fd45ck36TDV3EEiDAAUZcvlP22XnO6gL0GvL_Z89ge0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mb.com.ph", "published": "2018-05-28T17:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Are you a Bitcoin believer?", "text": "Zoilo P. Dejaresco III\nMany people swear they have made oodles of money investing in Bitcoin, the biggest and most popular crypto-currency. After all, it was valued at US$1,000 at the start of 2017 and shot through the roof at close to US$20,000 by December.\nMost recently, however, it dropped to US$7,300 and analysts look at a bottom rate of US$6,800 before any significant buyer interest can be enthused once again.\nBelievers deal with Bitcoin for two reasons: (a) faster and cheaper way to make payments and (b) for investment since only a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins will be “mined” amid an ever-increasing awareness of people of it – necessitating an inevitable rise in its price.\nHowever, there are famous non-believers. One is Warren Buffett, one of the world’s richest whose Berkshire Hathaway had grown robust (US$ 83-billion value) on a “buy and hold” strategy on stocks and real estate aimed for the long-term yield. Buffett had always been an apostle of “Intrinsic Value” says Bitcoin is a “non-productive asset that produces nothing” unlike stocks and real estate.\nBill Gates, on the other hand, essentially says the same. Bitcoin investment is a “greater fool theory” where purchasing decision is based solely on the hope that the next dude will buy it at a higher price than what he did.\nBeing such, one should not tinker with it using grocery money and amortization money for obligations. One associate says it is foolish to anchor one’s future payment for a fixed and known obligation on a fund source with violent fluctuations in value.\nGovernments had been wary that being unregulated Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies could be used to launder money from criminal activities and for terrorist financing since most deals are under the radar.\nMelchor Plabasan, BSP Deputy Director for Core IT Specialist Group in a forum titled “Cryptocurrency Decrypted” said basically it is “caveat emptor” – or buyer beware – for Bitcoin investment because in the Philippines it is unregulated. What we regulate somewhat like Japan and Singapore are the converters or exchangers of fiat to crypto-currencies.\nIt appears only the USA and Canada have firm frameworks on Bitcoin regulation while nations like China, South Korea, Indonesia, and India ban their financial institutions from dealing with the subject.\nPlayers in the industry have cautioned people not to mistake Bitcoin with Block Chain technology – one for the other. Block Chain is taking off the ground due to its numerous sound application as a technological breakthrough.\nLuis Pineda, President, and Chairman of IBM Philippines said that the technology is also a vote for the environment. For instance, he says the cost of global trade using paper is US$1.3 trillion. Walmart and Maersk (shipping company) are substituting technology for paper transactions and so are humongous government documents for smart contracts,\nImagine further what this technology can do in getting rid of plastics used to facilitate transactions and identification methods. Without the arrest of plastic usage, it is bruited that by 2050, there will be more “plastics than fish in the oceans.”\nPlabasan mentioned there are applications of technology that are helping financial inclusion and efficiency in the delivery of financial services and trade.\nOne cited is the RCBCC E-Peso. Others like Ripple make cross-border payments in real time compared to traditional payment mechanisms like Swift (5 days) and Unionbank’s technology of linking Rural Banks not yet tied with Bancnet and such allowing payment transfers to farmers in the rural areas to pay for their supply purchases.\nFinally, a biometric-based Digital identity is in the works to make financial inclusion a reality to many who do not have any bank records, according to the BSP.\nTechnology like the Block Chain, indeed, is rising at a fast clip. But Bitcoins, to this day, though gaining popularity exponentially apparently does not hold as much promise in terms of future stability and unerring reliability.\n(Bingo Dejaresco, a former banker, is a financial consultant, media practitioner, and book author.

But BitCaw on Monday sent a strongly worded legal letter via its attorneys saying the statement is “factually flawed and incorrect in its entirety”.\n“BitCaw Trading is a company registered in South Africa in February 2016, which began operating on 1 March 2016,” the letter, sent by top lawyer Ulrich Roux, said. “Having regard to the said ‘media statement’, it is clear that you have confused our client with BTC Global, a completely separate entity.” Having regard to the said ‘media statement’, it is clear that you have confused our client with BTC Global, a completely separate entity\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest with promises of 2% interest per day, 14%/week and ultimately 50%/month,” the Hawks said.\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg, BitCaw trading founder Andrew Caw said he was “shocked” that his company’s name had been linked to the alleged scam.\n“BitCaw Trading assists people with buying and selling bitcoin as well as other bitcoin-related services. We do not manage third-party money or offer any kind of investment” and BitCaw didn’t set up BTC Global, Bloomberg reported Caw as having posted on Facebook.\nIn Roux’s letter to the Hawks, he said BitCaw Trading has assisted hundreds of people with buying and selling bitcoin, and educating them about the cryptocurrency. “BitCaw Trading does not manage or trade with third-party money or offer any kind of investment returns. BTC Global, on the other hand, was/is a bitcoin investment company and has nothing to do with our client.”\nRoux said BitCaw was not contacted by the Hawks, or anyone in the police service, regarding the investigation and is “shocked that its brand has been connected with BTC Global and the press release which surfaced on Friday”. ‘Severe financial damage’\n“It is our instructions to demand, as we hereby do, that you make another ‘media statement’ in which you confirm that you retract the incorrect reference to our clients’ business in relation to your investigation, as your incorrect ‘media statement’ has already caused severe financial damage and prejudice to our client and continues to do so,” Roux wrote.\n“Should you not post the retraction … by close of business on Tuesday, 29 May 2018, our instructions are to approach the … high court (in Johannesburg) on an urgent basis in order to enforce our clients’ rights. You will be held liable for all costs associated with said legal action.\n“It is further our instructions to launch a damages claim against you as a result of the false and misleading ‘media statement’ dated Friday, 25 May 2018.” — (c) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/home?status=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techcentral.co.za%2Fbitcoin-firm-threatens-hawks-with-damages-suit%2F81449%2F"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ulrich roux", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hawks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "twitter bitcaw", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcaw trading", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc globa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcaw trading company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T17:45:09.050+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c4d785ccd098af40e183677897a59d3d90f3317", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdlOUxsy_TNN2.e9N.l8oaAa8P8pnjrij0C2PgE9d3E78kOyyuMm1ygqLBZXBNfUG3_5eYfCCUIky0kDIGgZAmAmCphqKfG_yVECk27yDhuAiCtWOj3ku15h55cF_GXw859pnJ_qLV3fF2zxxKxgJp.2ghO6YKU0lCoXGtz7ZLMLQbQZ1QqFMlItY9qkez.ZQ-", "site_full": "bitcoingamblingreviews.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoingamblingreviews.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Looking for New Way to Donate During Ramadan?

World | Reuters | Updated: May 28, 2018 20:37 IST Share COMMENTS A mosque in Britain's capital is now accepting donations in cryptocurrencies. London: Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain's capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin.The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\"For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,\" said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\"For the donor, it's just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque's perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,\" Musial said.Egypt's Grand Mufti, the nation's top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque's decision.\"Bitcoin is like any other currency. It's ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,\" Adeyemi told Reuters.The mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lukasz musial", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "shacklewell lane mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T18:16:33.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21d4610b74834dfc4fb88f3dc0a112d57fabafa4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZAMD8Drs32rAqbCqc49w7o-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Will Bitcoin ever be 20k again?

is treating people who find themselves hooked on buying and selling cryptocurrencies within the UK’s first ever ‘crypto clinic,’ the Evening Standard reported immediately, May 28.\nCastle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, has created a course of residential therapy for these it deems to be crypto addicts.\nExperts advised the Evening Standard that crypto buying and selling can develop into a type of behavioural habit, with merchants obsessively glued to “minute-by-minute” market fluctuations. The devised therapy program is due to this fact nearer to present strategies for treating playing addictions, somewhat than to substance abuse applications.\nChris Burn, a playing therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was quoted by the Evening Standard as saying:\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nTony Marini, a former playing and cocaine addict, is main among the middle’s new remedies. Marini advised the Standard that “introducing life structure is key,” including:\n“I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they’re not alone.” Castle Craig stated that there are presently no figures for the variety of ‘crypto addicts,’ however “around 13 mln” individuals worldwide are buying and selling within the system.\nLast 12 months, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his house as collateral for a $325,000 fairness mortgage, in pursuit of creating a mid-term revenue on the cryptocurrency. Crypto group members, evidently viewing his funding mindset as equal to playing remarked that the transfer was “almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.”\nFrom one other perspective, there was some dialogue within the UK as as to whether declaring your crypto buying and selling to be playing may assist to keep away from taxes with the British tax authority HMRC, which typically deems crypto income as topic both to revenue or capital features tax legal guidelines.

London mosque now accepts bitcoin\nLONDON (Reuters) - Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

But the crowd that showed up in Wenatchee two weeks ago for a hearing about Bitcoin mining in Chelan County was so large that utility staff had to open a second room with a video feed for the overflow.\nThe turnout wasn’t surprising. Chelan County, along with neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, has been at the center of the U.S. Bitcoin boom since 2012, when the region’s ultracheap hydropower began attracting cryptocurrency “miners.”\nThese entrepreneurs earn Bitcoin by solving increasingly complicated mathematical problems established by the shadowy creators of the digital currency. The process, which the industry calls mining, involves trillions of computer calculations and sucks up huge amounts of power.\nAs a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtown, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds. By the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum.\nBut as in any boomtown, success has come at a cost. As the cryptocurrency industry morphs into larger, more energy-intensive operations, the Basin’s three public utilities districts (PUDs) are reassessing how they deal with it, and whether they can — or should even try to — keep up. The sector’s recent growth spurt poses “a very different kind of problem than anything we have addressed before,” Steve Wright, Chelan County PUD general manager, told the crowd at the May 14 hearing. Determining whether the PUD can handle the growth, Wright said, has “required a whole new way of thinking.”\nOverwhelming “gold rush”\nIn a normal year, demand for electric power in Chelan County grows by perhaps 4 megawatts — enough for around 2,250 homes — as new residents arrive and as businesses start or expand. But since January 2017, as Bitcoin enthusiasts bid up the price of the currency, eager miners have requested a staggering 210 megawatts for mines they want to build in Chelan County. That’s nearly as much as the county and its 73,000 residents were already using. And because it is a public utility, the PUD staff is obligated to consider every request.\nThe scale of some new requests is mind-boggling. Until recently, the largest mines in Chelan County used five megawatts or less. In the past six months, by contrast, miners have requested loads of 50 megawatts and, in several cases, 100 megawatts. By comparison, a fruit warehouse uses around 2.5 megawatts.\nBut it’s not simply the scale of requests that is perplexing utility staff. Many would-be miners have no understanding of how large power purchases work. In one case this winter, miners from China landed their private jet at the local airport, drove a rental car to the visitor center at the Rocky Reach Dam, just north of Wenatchee, and, according to Chelan County PUD officials, politely asked to see the “dam master because we want to buy some electricity.”\nBitcoin fever has created other, smaller-scale problems for the utility. Three times a week, on average, utility crews in Chelan County discover unpermitted home miners running computer servers far too large for the electrical grids of residential neighborhoods. In one instance last year, the transformer outside a bootleg miner’s home overheated and touched off a grass fire, Chelan County PUD officials say.\nIn other cases, utility crews responding to unusual spikes in power usage have found racks of remotely controlled servers whirring away in empty apartments. Worse, when the utility began shutting off power to these so-called “rogue operators” earlier this year, some of them became so belligerent that the utility is installing security cameras and bulletproof glass at its downtown Wenatchee headquarters.\nBy February, the Bitcoin “gold rush,” as Wright calls it, had become so overwhelming that Chelan County PUD declared a three-month moratorium on new mines to determine whether the county can absorb even a fraction of that demand. But answering that question was more complex than the utility anticipated — and at the recent hearing, the commission voted to extend the freeze another three months.\nAt the root of the dilemma is a mismatch in business models. Public utilities are typically managed with the expectation of incremental growth, decades-long investments and a community-oriented bottom line — what Wright defines as delivering “the best value, for the most people, for the longest period of time.”\nBitcoin mining, by contrast, is characterized by soaring demand, massive price volatility, and an investment time frame measured in years or even months.\nWhat Chelan County PUD must now decide is whether these two models are compatible. Wright was a public utility veteran who ran the Bonneville Power Administration before coming to Chelan County. He told the hearing that, to a utility manager, the massive surge in new mining demand “looks like lemons.” The utility’s task is to see whether there’s “a way to turn it into lemonade for us” by figuring out what the miners should pay.\nFor would-be miners and investors eager to connect their servers, each week of moratorium represents lost opportunity. But the utility also faces pressure from the community, which remains deeply divided over the presence of cryptocurrency miners.\nAt May’s hearing, perhaps half of the audience members who spoke were deeply skeptical about Bitcoin mining and concerned that the county not encourage further growth. One resident called mining “cyber-gambling.” Another likened miners to “locusts” who were simply looking for “the next field to do their damage.”\nYet others spoke of cryptocurrency mining as the best thing that has come to the Basin in years, not only as a path to personal wealth (many commenters were miners or prospective miners) but also as way to energize a region that has suffered major economic setbacks.\nHanging over May’s hearing was the fate of the Basin’s last big electrical customer: the Alcoa aluminum smelter, which employed more than 400 workers before it was idled several years ago thanks to competition from cheaper Chinese imports. Cryptocurrency mining won’t replace all those jobs — the process is heavily automated. But backers insist that a local mining sector, if allowed to grow, will attract other ancillary services, such as software development, and ultimately provide the Basin with some of the tech-fueled prosperity that Seattle has enjoyed.\n“Yes, we’re the apple capital,” Markham Heard, a safety and environmental consultant who works with the data industry, told commissioners. “But what’s our next step?”\nA regional trend\nChelan County isn’t the only place where that question is being asked. Across the Columbia River in Douglas County, the cyber-mining sector has expanded so rapidly that the PUD’s existing distribution system is tapped out. For example, a nearly new 84-megawatt substation with enough capacity to handle 30 to 50 years of normal population growth has already been fully subscribed.\nIn neighboring Grant County, meanwhile, which has more surplus power available, miners have requested about 1,700 megawatts, or roughly three times what the county’s residents, commercial users and farmers consume.\nAll told, the three PUDs in the mid-Columbia Basin are considering miners’ requests for well over 2,000 megawatts of power — equal to roughly two-thirds of the total hydropower generated by the Basin’s five hydroelectric dams. And while every request won’t become a contract, the rapid demand is forcing officials at all three public utilities to rethink how they sell power.\nThe biggest issue, of course, is power rates. Currently, residents in Chelan County pay around 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, or about a third what Seattleites pay and around one fifth of the national average. Rates in Douglas and Grants are in that same ballpark.\nThose bargain rates are possible largely because the Basin’s five dams generate around six times what the region can use locally. Much of the surplus is exported, at premium prices, to outside buyers such as Puget Sound Energy, and those outside sales subsidize local rates.\nBut if the utilities are selling more of their power to local Bitcoin miners, they’re exporting less power at those premium prices, which makes it harder to keep local rates low. Further, because much of the surplus is currently committed in long-term contracts, supplying miners with all the megawatts they want might require the utilities do something virtually unprecedented: buy power on the open market, at prices far above what locals have come to expect.\nAdd to this the many millions of dollars the utilities would need to invest in new substations, transmission lines, and other infrastructure, and suddenly, it becomes conceivable that this new industry might signal the end to decades of cheap power.\nJim Renna, a local contractor and businessman, told the commission that the big fear among locals is the utility will soon be “subsidizing [miners] by us having higher rates.”\nThese aren’t new concerns. The three PUDs have been experimenting with policies that force miners to shoulder these extra costs and risks, while insulating ratepayers and the utilities themselves. Chelan County, for example, created a special rate for miners and other so-called “high density loads,” or HDLs, back in 2015, that was effectively twice the residential rate.\nDouglas County, meanwhile, began requiring miners to pay up front for any new infrastructure. Grant County PUD is establishing special rates applied to companies “whose primary revenue stream is evolving and unproven” and whose product is “vulnerable to extreme value fluctuations.”\nThe utilities are attempting to strike a delicate balance. By creating policies that reflect the full costs and risks of cryptocurrency mining, the utilities believe they can protect regular ratepayers while weeding out prospective miners who are unable or unwilling to make a long-term commitment to the Basin — and whose power requests are swamping utilities’ normal operations.\nAs Wright put it, by the end of the moratorium, the utility expects to be able to tell miners exactly what it will cost to mine in Chelan County. If miners can accept those terms, Wright says, the PUD will move forward with investments needed to handle crypto-mining’s much larger next phase. But, says Wright, “if it’s not of interest, then we can stop and go back to doing our day jobs.”\nHow the three utilities decide to treat this new industry will have impacts that go well beyond the Mid-Columbia Basin. Prospective miners elsewhere will be tracking the decisions intently to see whether the Basin is still worth coming to, or whether they should go instead to other cheap-power places, such as Iceland or Quebec.\nAnd, in all likelihood, utility officials in those cheap power regions will be paying attention, too. Even now, Wright says, County PUD’s staff receive calls from their counterparts in communities where mining is just getting started and where there is little certainty about how to manage the boom. “So we are getting a chance here to break new ground,” says Wright.\nThat’s one way to put it. Or as Cashmere resident Jeanne Poirier aptly observed at May’s hearing, “the world is probably watching this situation in our little tiny county.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "douglas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington public", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenatchee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelan county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T17:30:33.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0a1540915f32c84f373fea945ba4c860a79c557", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGh155ri1wTXleR1Xd0CliamGDxUFb5b_frQdk33aLKcnP9L5hx_EeSAZggVuGKsdH.llcmzaBBSk", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "This is why Bitcoin Cash is perfect for crowdfuding, especially vs existing platforms using paypal!", "title_full": "This is why Bitcoin Cash is perfect for crowdfuding, especially vs existing platforms using paypal! : btc", "published": "2018-05-28T17:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.11, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0a1540915f32c84f373fea945ba4c860a79c557", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGh155ri1wTXleR1Xd0CliamGDxUFb5b_frQdk33aLKcnP9L5hx_EeSAZggVuGKsdH.llcmzaBBSk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maemon", "published": "2018-05-28T17:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "This is why Bitcoin Cash is perfect for crowdfuding, especially vs existing platforms using paypal!", "text": "submitted by /u/Maemon\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/itsmaemon/status/1001027326157598721"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T13:14:01.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "016034759a8c13a10fba4d7e56bb6c480b6234b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQGL7RF2SqigkDfC6dTEHV6tB8S8Uu.S5E5n7dCAXTGf..l_BXaNh_tTx4qPf8om9cuxBhhrwVpyJY4POMdz8Zb3_ScakKcxd2oU1wqSCpZhQ--", "site_full": "brittneywalker667.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://brittneywalker667.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "How WIRED Lost $100,000 in Bitcoin – Brittney Walker's Blog", "title": "How WIRED Lost $100,000 in Bitcoin", "title_full": "How WIRED Lost $100,000 in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T17:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "016034759a8c13a10fba4d7e56bb6c480b6234b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQGL7RF2SqigkDfC6dTEHV6tB8S8Uu.S5E5n7dCAXTGf..l_BXaNh_tTx4qPf8om9cuxBhhrwVpyJY4POMdz8Zb3_ScakKcxd2oU1wqSCpZhQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "brittneywalker667", "published": "2018-05-28T17:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "How WIRED Lost $100,000 in Bitcoin", "text": "legally buy a top quality marijuana seeds\nWe mined roughly 13 Bitcoins and then ripped up our private key.

In fact, there are an estimated three million bitcoins — totalling nearly $33 billion — lost because the retrieval codes have gone missing or the currency owners died without passing the codes onto their next of kin. Just ask James Howells — who lost a hard drive with the key to more than $79 million in bitcoin.\n“I mined more than 7500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” said the IT worker turned crypto investor, 32, who lives in Newport, Wales.\n“Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my bitcoin private keys,” “I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information.” Howells didn’t realise the value of his coins for a few weeks after he lost them.\n“I looked up the price, did the calculation … and thought, ‘S **tt. [My investment is] worth around $2 [million] or $3 million.’ A few months later it was worth $9.9 million [$A13 million]. I was annoyed, pissed off, sick. I spoke to the people at the landfill and told them that I threw away a hard drive worth $10 million. They looked at me stupidly.” If an investor remembers at least a portion of a pass code, a talented hacker could potentially use software to decrypt it. For someone like Howells, however, who has no clues to go on,\n“hacking it would take a couple billion years and require all the energy of the sun”. Instead, he’s offered the town of Newport 10 per cent of the bitcoins’ value if they’ll let him excavate the landfill. So far, they’ve denied his requests. For the time being, Howells views the dump as the ultimate safe.\n“Nobody else can get in there and take my hard drive,” he said. “It’s like having $75 million in the bank, but you cannot get into the bank account.” Turner, however, has learned his lesson and is done.\n“I have no crypto now and have little desire to get more,” he said. “Some [aspects] of it are fascinating. But it also seems like a cult.” According to Michael Yang, who runs a cryptocurrency exchange in the Bay Area,\n“One of my friends had half of a bitcoin private key in his hand and half in his [business] partner’s hand. Then the partner passed away.” Now, the living friend cannot access the funds.\n“It’s a tragedy,” Yang added. “They had at least 500 bitcoins” — worth around $5.3 million Culled: NY Post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T08:11:21.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "626b0cc3ca44249d87ff9bfca83ebc3c18fd3d86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQVqV6X.kFq58YFKFXEB714uIvMTgeXinvrIizpiTZer1Uy1YXwqLa9fdUoMeHEqNF_YOSGXSuJmRZ8SaaZRvgHbY6K4o1lpKQRx2ftpSwYQyjlc_iRXzPscZcXG10S2S_GnRcknR.ZiiVueGQJRLAcRYSILrwcIivL.p2gxhpddKV8EIyCdRH", "site_full": "www.channelnewsasia.com", "site": "channelnewsasia.com", "site_section": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/", "site_categories": ["media", "tech", "social"], "section_title": "Breaking News, Singapore News, World and Asia - Channel NewsAsia", "title": "Looking for new way to donate during Ramadan?

Bitcoin Core Becomes a Thing When Bitcoin Cash was first hard-forked back in November 2017, it resulted in two coins: Bitcoin Cash and the short-lived ‘ Bitcoin Clashic . ’ The latter being the legacy, albeit tongue-n-cheek, chain that did manage to mine a few blocks at the time. But the chain didn’t wither away . A few developers have been quietly maintaining it and have managed to rebrand it to Bitcoin Core – yes, the exact same name as Bitcoin’s (BTC) most popular software client implementation used by over 94% of all Bitcoin users.\n— Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) (@BitcoinCore_) May 28, 2018 Confused yet? Hold on, it gets even weirder. On its official website , BTCC is described as a “fork of Bitcoin” and too claims to be “Satoshi’s vision” just like Bitcoin Cash. The description reads: Bitcoin Core (BTCC) is open source, peer-to-peer electronic cash. Bitcoin Core is a fork from Bitcoin $BTC, Bitcoin Core $BTCC was nourished through a labor of love, in preparation for this mission. Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) is an upgrade of Bitcoin Clashic. The true vision of Bitcoin Core is to compliment Bitcoin, and run along side it, by acting as an express lane for core values, speed and privacy. Unlike Bitcoin Clashic, however, the Bitcoin Core currency might have legs. It is already being traded on the Crypto Bridge and Bisq exchanges at a volatile price of about $10 USD. According to the website, the coin will be listed on mcap.info and coinmarketwatch.com , and is supported by a software wallet and comes with a block explorer as well. The open-source code of Bitcoin Core can be found on GitHub. Tit-for-Tat Trolling The Bitcoin Clashic developers and the Bitcoin community responsible for the revival of Clashic appear to have fully embraced the term, often used by one of the biggest Bitcoin Cash supporters, Roger Ver, who deliberately refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as Bitcoin Core while maintaining that Bitcoin Cash is ‘Bitcoin.’ Roger and Fast Money crew loves us #BitcoinCore $BTCC Thanks for the publicity\n— Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) (@BitcoinCore_) May 28, 2018 In fact, the deliberate misnaming of Bitcoin Cash as ‘BCash’ and Bitcoin as ‘Bitcoin Core’ has been the go-to tactic of both communities ever since the acrimonious Bitcoin (BTC) hard fork that occurred on August 1st, 2017 gave birth to Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nBitcoin Cash’s Roger Ver frequently refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as ‘Bitcoin Core’ because he believes that Bitcoin Cash — which he refers to as the ‘real’ Bitcoin — follows the ‘true vision’ of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n“Roger Ver and CNBC’s Fast Money seem to be one of our best advocates,” a person who wished to remain anonymous told Bitcoinist.\nMeanwhile, the online shopping platform Purse.io released ‘bcash’ just last week emphasizing that it is not a cryptocurrency but a software implementation for Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nNow it appears that the developers behind BTCC have done the exact opposite, launching a cryptocurrency under the name of Bitcoin Core to differentiate it from Bitcoin’s Bitcoin Core software client.\nThe reasoning is likely that Bitcoin Cash proponents would no longer be able to deliberately misname their arch nemesis, i.e. Bitcoin (BTC) as Core, since BTCC is now a real thing, and a completely different cryptocurrency.\nIs the launch of BTCC merely trolling or can it become a legit cryptocurrency?

In it, Alex de Vries, a financial economist and blockchain specialist, carefully worked through a number of known data points — the number of bitcoin-mining computers made in the past year, the energy consumption of those computers and the minimum energy costs of cooling large facilities of tightly packed computers, among others — to arrive at an absolute lowest bound for the energy consumption of the bitcoin network today: 2.55 gigawatts, or a bit less than the energy consumption of Ireland.\nBy the end of 2018, de Vries calculated, based on data about ongoing bitcoin mining production, that number could rise to 7.67 gigawatts, or a bit less than the energy consumption of Austria. And that, he said in a statement , amounts to about 0.5 percent of the world's energy consumption.\nThis is a problem for several reasons, environmental concerns among them. But de Vries showed that it represents a particular problem for the bitcoin miners themselves: It could soon be so expensive to mine bitcoin that the process simply stops being profitable.\nWhy is bitcoin sucking up all this energy ? To understand that, you have to know a little about how the bitcoin network works.\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. That means there's no central agency that records who owns what. Instead, bitcoin users rely on a shared, time-stamped digital record of their transactions. And maintaining that shared record, adding a \"block\" to it every 10 minutes or so, is the work of a competitive effort by thousands of computers all over the world. Those computers collectively perform quintillions of calculations per second, each \"mining,\" trying to solve a math problem that will give it the right to form the next block on the chain. And the winner every 10 minutes is rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins. That's more than $100,000 at the coin's current exchange rates.\nGiven those incentives, bitcoin miners have filled up warehouses with computers devoted to mining.

In it, Alex de Vries, a financial economist and blockchain specialist, carefully worked through a number of known data points — the number of bitcoin-mining computers made in the past year, the energy consumption of those computers and the minimum energy costs of cooling large facilities of tightly packed computers, among others — to arrive at an absolute lowest bound for the energy consumption of the bitcoin network today: 2.55 gigawatts, or a bit less than the energy consumption of Ireland.\nBy the end of 2018, de Vries calculated, based on data about ongoing bitcoin mining production, that number could rise to 7.67 gigawatts, or a bit less than the energy consumption of Austria. And that, he said in a statement , amounts to about 0.5 percent of the world's energy consumption.\nThis is a problem for several reasons, environmental concerns among them. But de Vries showed that it represents a particular problem for the bitcoin miners themselves: It could soon be so expensive to mine bitcoin that the process simply stops being profitable.\nWhy is bitcoin sucking up all this energy ? To understand that, you have to know a little about how the bitcoin network works.\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. That means there's no central agency that records who owns what. Instead, bitcoin users rely on a shared, time-stamped digital record of their transactions. And maintaining that shared record, adding a \"block\" to it every 10 minutes or so, is the work of a competitive effort by thousands of computers all over the world. Those computers collectively perform quintillions of calculations per second, each \"mining,\" trying to solve a math problem that will give it the right to form the next block on the chain. And the winner every 10 minutes is rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins. That's more than $100,000 at the coin's current exchange rates.\nGiven those incentives, bitcoin miners have filled up warehouses with computers devoted to mining. Those computers, even the most efficient ones, need a significant amount of power to run. Certain details, like how many of these computers actually get made per year, or what tricks different mining operations use to keep them cool, are industry secrets. But de Vries worked around that secretiveness to find the data he needed for his calculation.\n\"[This calculation] marks the first time that bitcoin miner production has been estimated with the help of upstream [chip] production numbers,\" he wrote. \"Given the ongoing secrecy of bitcoin miner manufacturers, this could prove to be a valuable addition to the toolkit for substantiating trends in bitcoin's electricity consumption.\"\nDe Vries also pointed out that when bitcoin mining becomes more costly than profitable, that doesn't mean all the bitcoin miners will stop.

Say what?\nCastle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, has created the course of treatment.\nFrom the Evening Standard :\nExperts say the trading of digital currencies or assets such as Bitcoin can become a behavioural addiction, similar to online gambling with some users obsessively following minute-by-minute fluctuations in prices.\nThe West Linton facility already runs drug and alcohol addiction programmes, but said it now treats cryptocurrency addiction by using techniques found in gambling addiction programmes.\n\"The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality,\" gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, Chris Burns, told the Evening Standard. \"Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.\"\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center’s new treatments.\n\"I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don't like the world they're in,\" he said. \"The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they're not alone.\"\nBITHUMB BLOCKS TRADING IN 11 COUNTRIES\nOne of South Korea's largest exchanges has blocked trading to 11 nations and now requires stricter verification from all those outside of South Korea.\nThe self-regulation is a means of fostering the transparent cryptocurrency market and investor protection.\n“We will cooperate with the government” and follow self-regulatory measures based on the policies introduced by the Korean Blockchain Association, the exchange emphasized. The Korean Blockchain Association is spearheading self-regulation among crypto exchanges in the country. Bithumb’s revised internal regulations reflect “the government’s recommendations and the Korean Blockchain Association’s recommendations,” Korea Economic Daily elaborated.\nThe blocked countries include North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Serbia, Ethiopia, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Vanuatu, and Yemen.\nHOW LITHUANIA BECOME A HUB FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY INNOVATION\nLithuania has outperformed nations 20 times its size in the token economy, making it Europe’s fifth largest country for crowdfunding.

He has done post graduation in History as well as Economics from the reputed University of Cape Town and has worked for over two decades for the non-profit sector as the executive fund manager. Ted Bauman has traveled extensively during his career and has visited over 75 countries, which speaks volumes about his demand as the financial expert. Having worked with some of the top financial institutions across the globe, Ted Bauman has gained the experience and the exposure needed to be one of the top financial experts of recent times. Follow Ted Bauman on Twitter for more updates\nTed Bauman moved to the United States in late 2008 along with his family and settled in Atlanta, GA. He has also co-authored a book along with his father, Robert Bauman, who is also a congressman in the United States. Ted Bauman currently works as an editor of several financial newsletters, including The Bauman Letter, Alpha Stock Alert, and the Plan B Club. The financial expertise and experience that Ted Bauman has gathered over the years are what he tries to share with his readers through the articles he writes. It helps the readers gain the full understanding of how the financial markets work, and what they can do minimize risks with their investments and maximize gains. In one of the articles that Ted Bauman recently wrote, he talked about why people should be wary about investing in cryptocurrencies as there are many unresolved issues with the blockchain technology that needs to be corrected before it can flourish or progress further.\nTed Bauman discussed some of the major flaws that Bitcoin suffers from at the moment. If something is not done immediately, the demand for Bitcoin will decrease since people are not able to use it. Compared to visa transactions, the processing time for Bitcoin is quite low. While visa can complete about 24,000 transactions per second, for Bitcoin it is limited to 6.5. With more people investing in Bitcoin, the processing time has further decreased since the number of transactions has increased. There are different ways to do it. The first one is to decrease the number of data that the mining block processes. Thus, it is to be seen whether Bitcoin can overcome the challenges to sustain in the future.

The price of the Ethereum, the cryptocurrency of the blockchain network Etherium, fell by 6 percent per night, while other major digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ripple and Bitcoin cache, fell in the range of 1.5% - 6%.\nEarlier today, with a break of support at $545 within one hour, the price of the Ethereum dropped from $540 to $500. Most likely, there was a so-called short-squeeze, the activation of stop orders concentrated under long-term support in the $530-$540 area.\nThe price of global cryptocurrency Bitcoin continued to decline in today's Asian trading. However, with the start of European trading, players bought the market up and returned it to $7256. Local lows at the beginning of the American session are located at $7146. It is noteworthy that Bitcoin was able to maintain some stability compared to other major cryptocurrencies, thanks to the technical conditions and the reselling factor. We wrote earlier that right from $7100 levels down to $6500 a strategic support zone begins. Historically the market bounced several times from these levels.\nBased on the decline in the Ethereum and the high probability of further declines in Bitcoin and other major currencies, the likelihood that the total capitalization of the market will fall below $300 billion is very high. On Monday May 27, the capitalization of the entire digital market is at around $315 billion. Nevertheless, analysts are still optimistic about the potential market growth in the third quarter of 2018.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T16:41:51.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d7288736db7846ef3eb55f7e1187fa0f8094d7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5nL6D4J8J6A_9dLtLjI2XXBbyuj5w.tZSBASGxhRuAyjMZ9qy7VH_CX8ok7KJvcSHDJEZj7_IGrT04TfnB1RgU15tTiwkaJFxw--", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "PayPal CEO Daniel Schulman talks about crypto and bitcoin", "title_full": "PayPal CEO Daniel Schulman talks about crypto and bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T16:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d7288736db7846ef3eb55f7e1187fa0f8094d7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5nL6D4J8J6A_9dLtLjI2XXBbyuj5w.tZSBASGxhRuAyjMZ9qy7VH_CX8ok7KJvcSHDJEZj7_IGrT04TfnB1RgU15tTiwkaJFxw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-28T16:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "PayPal CEO Daniel Schulman talks about crypto and bitcoin", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daniel schulman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T16:51:53.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e338ea35e3d3cfee139a4dd1693a958cc1a31c09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRbI9v5sN1yK6YRzcpN2IQxZz11LFi1xOMSLP_CLO6wiR71ZHOSTS_ryRy7dpl6otrNFmxK1cGNtGFEsoSGozCCKuwEoaGmhqp4aNvnt.Bwt9FPthAvUlzSGtsEFpG.S1H_qos3sFunfQ--", "site_full": "hothardware.com", "site": "hothardware.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/HotHardware/news", "site_categories": ["computer_reviews", "tech"], "section_title": "HotHardware.com News Rss Feed", "title": "Bitcoin Miners Are Crushing Power Grids In Washington State As Electricity Demands Skyrocket", "title_full": "Bitcoin Miners Are Crushing Power Grids In Washington State As Electricity Demands Skyrocket", "published": "2018-05-28T16:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://hothardware.com/ContentImages/NewsItem/44603/content/Bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 36843, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e338ea35e3d3cfee139a4dd1693a958cc1a31c09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRbI9v5sN1yK6YRzcpN2IQxZz11LFi1xOMSLP_CLO6wiR71ZHOSTS_ryRy7dpl6otrNFmxK1cGNtGFEsoSGozCCKuwEoaGmhqp4aNvnt.Bwt9FPthAvUlzSGtsEFpG.S1H_qos3sFunfQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T16:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Miners Are Crushing Power Grids In Washington State As Electricity Demands Skyrocket", "text": "by Paul Lilly Bitcoin Miners Are Crushing Power Grids In Washington State As Electricity Demands Skyrocket One of the biggest criticisms of cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin in particular, is the highly volatile nature of digital coins. However, that's for investors and miners to worry about. A larger concern that is starting to draw increased attention is the power usage that comes from mining cryptocurrencies on a large scale. Over in Washington, where power is relatively cheap compared to other parts of the country, there's a twofold concern—that power bills will go, and that electric utilities will not be able to keep up with demand. These are not new concerns. It was reported earlier this month that Plattsburgh, New York placed an 18-month ban on new commercial cryptocurrency mining operations after the city was forced to buy additional power to keep up with the rising demand, which in turned caused electricity rates to up for the area's more than 30,000 residents. Plattsburgh had become a hot spot for mining because of relatively low utility rates of 4.5 cents per kWh. Several districts in Washington are now battling the same thing. Chelan County, along with its neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, have been popular destinations for Bitcoin mining for the past several years because the area uses cheap hydropower. This has attracted large-scale mining operations, with some miners setting up shop in large, state-of-the-art warehouses and others repurposing cargo containers. It's estimated that by the end of the year, the area could account for nearly a third of the global output of new Bitcoin, and significant chunks of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. There are three public utilities districts (PUDs) that service the area, and each one is scrambling to figure out how to deal with the growing demand. Steve Wright, Chelan County PUG general manager, said the demand imposed by mining presents \"a very different kind of problem than anything we have addressed before,\" and that handling the growing will require \"a whole new way of thinking.\" To put it all into perspective, before the mining boom, Chelan County's power needs would grow by around 4 megawatts annually, which is enough to power around 2,250 homes. Since January of 2017, however, Bitcoin miners have requested 210 megawatts for mining operations they want to set up in the area. As a public utility, the PUD has to consider the request. Mining overall has become less profitable over the last several weeks and months, hence part of the reason why graphics cards have fallen back to MSRP levels and are now easier to find in stock. However, large scaling mining operations can weather the storm, and so problems like this will remain for public utilities to figure out.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul lilly", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plattsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T17:15:20.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42c2350c5af43271e362f9e05b26320096777dc4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQp27wKCBlLuvCtzIeUpqbN6S0BuWSUQAobKrAjf_E58OLolLqc3Ue8DBYeYAwDZge2uGyYGeq_M3h2nQRtVhlDmjORktP9UPmxVKnNjg1tsDA8gk_NCLnvz7Jd3KO5iPiUchqEmmJbmKQZQr1vTIcx", "site_full": "www.findmarketresearch.org", "site": "findmarketresearch.org", "site_section": "https://www.findmarketresearch.org/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Find Market Research", "title": "Bitcoin Exchange Market is Set to Experience Revolutionary Growth by 2024", "title_full": "Bitcoin Exchange Market is Set to Experience Revolutionary Growth by 2024", "published": "2018-05-28T16:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42c2350c5af43271e362f9e05b26320096777dc4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQp27wKCBlLuvCtzIeUpqbN6S0BuWSUQAobKrAjf_E58OLolLqc3Ue8DBYeYAwDZge2uGyYGeq_M3h2nQRtVhlDmjORktP9UPmxVKnNjg1tsDA8gk_NCLnvz7Jd3KO5iPiUchqEmmJbmKQZQr1vTIcx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ankush Nikam", "published": "2018-05-28T16:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Exchange Market is Set to Experience Revolutionary Growth by 2024", "text": "\nBitcoin is a form of digital currency that is traded across the world through computing devices. Bitcoin can be converted in other currency such as dollars and euros; however, there is no control over the price of Bitcoin. The main concept behind Bitcoin is to produce and trade a currency that is totally decentralized.\nConventional currencies are based on gold or silver reserves but Bitcoin is based on mathematics calculations. It follows a software program based on purely mathematical calculations. This program is available in open source environment so that everybody around the world can look into it. Bitcoin can be exchanged through various credit cards and payment gateways including PayPal. Usages of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Wallet Creation, Wallet to Wallet Bitcoin Transfer, Payment Using Bitcoin, Bill Payment Using Bitcoin, Exchange of Bitcoin with Local Currency.\nBitcoin exchange use peer to peer technology to transfer funds with no middle man or central authority involved. All the transactions are controlled by computer network itself, making it fastest payment method available in world. Bitcoin exchange method complete financial transaction within 10 minutes as compared to other currencies which takes one or two days to complete international transactions.. The agility of payment transaction and feature of open source environment are driving the growth of the global Bitcoin exchange market. Another driving factor for this market is very low processing fees for payment transactions due to decentralized process of Bitcoin.\nAbsence of consumer protection laws is restricting the growth of the market. In the traditional currency, fraudulent transaction from bank account or credit card are subject to repayment of consumer loses. Scaling is another factor which is hampering the growth of the global Bitcoin market. The Bitcoin network methodology requires all the previous transaction to be downloaded in user computing device during transaction. The process is time consuming as it take long hours to download all the transactions.\nSegmentation of Bitcoin Exchange market on the basis of currency conversion methods: Credit Cards: Credit cards are generally issued by a bank authority which promises to pay certain amount of money on behalf of the holder of the credit card. The holder pay that money to bank on or before a duration specified by bank. Other than this feature, credit card are used to buy products on EMI. Bitcoin can be purchased and converted to other traditional currencies by credit cards. Payment Gateways: A payment gateway is online payment service provider that is used to make payment for e-commerce and online transactions. Payment made through the payment gateways is more secure than credit or debit cards. Now-a-days, there are several payment gateways which facilitate Bitcoin transactions. Some of them are PayPal, Cash in Mail, and Personal Check.\nIncreasing penetration of internet across the world is paving the way for Bitcoin exchange.. North America holds the biggest scope for the development of Bitcoin exchange with around 313,862,863 internet users, according to Internet World Stats. The U.S. and Canada hold maximum potential for Bitcoin market. Recently, in the past two years, various conferences related to Bitcoin have held in North America region in order to bring awareness among the consumers. Some of them include: The Future of Money: Cashing Out on Cash, Insight Bitcoin San Diego, Block Chain Conference San Francisco, Insight Bitcoin New York.\nAsia-Pacific region is also showing modest growth for the Bitcoin exchange with more than 200 million internet users. This is merely 17% of the total population of Asia-Pacific region. The evolution of LTE technology in the countries including China, India, and Japan will create enhanced infrastructure for internet users. With increasing awareness, the market is expected to observe potential revenue opportunity in this region in the near future.\nIn Europe, countries such as U.K, Germany, and France are holding good potential for Bitcoin exchange. Latin America and Middle East and Africa, have still not witnessed wide adoption of Bitcoin exchange; however, with increasing awareness about the features offered by Bitcoin, the market is expected to observe substantial growth during the forecast period. Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Cryptsy, and BTC-e are some of the leading Bitcoin exchange in the world.\nA sample of this report is available upon request @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/10475 Dehydrated Food Market Predicted to Witness Surge in the Near Future by 2021 → ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/10475", "https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/bitcoin-exchange-market.asp"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "local currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallet bitcoin transfer", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T17:59:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93b50d53e84677634ce101579971129fdb0b9fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdNxjEGfpQzbqLgxe8AuZts-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Or Altcoins?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Or Altcoins?", "published": "2018-05-28T16:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.04, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93b50d53e84677634ce101579971129fdb0b9fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdNxjEGfpQzbqLgxe8AuZts-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lesmana", "published": "2018-05-28T16:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Or Altcoins?", "text": "I prefer Bitcoin for my long-term investments, Bitcoin is the main coin in crypto so the quality is guaranteed, but I also use altcoin for my trades, so I support both because it is equally beneficial to me.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T02:41:08.008+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 20908, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=11300", "requestsLeft": 549}
