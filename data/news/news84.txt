Bitcoin Price Sets Sights on New Resistance", "text": "\nBitcoin (BTC) is working its way throughout the key supply zone over $7,500 and may test resistance at $7,870 at the next twenty five hours, the specialized graphs indicate. The cryptocurrency looked primed for a corrective rally yesterday, having generated a bullish outside-day candle on Tuesday. Nevertheless, the bulls had a tough time absorbing supply around 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 4-hour graph, situated yesterday at $7,550. The recurrent failure to beat the moving average hurdle finished at a downside break of the diamond pattern. The subsequent sell-off ran out of steam at $7,270, and contributed to a convincing move over the 50-candle MA, seen today at $7,441. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,535 on Bitfinex, up 0.6 percent over twenty five hours, and looks set to test the falling trendline resistance situated at $7,870. 4-hour chart\nThe retrieval from $7,270 to $7,570 has generated a high reduced (bullish pattern), which adds credence to Tuesday’s bullish outside-day candle and bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence. Therefore, BTC could test supply around $7,870 — immunity of trendline sloping downwards from the May 6 high and May 21 high. It also means the cryptocurrency will probably peep over the all-important 50-week MA, currently situated at $7,711. Nevertheless, only a weekly close (Sunday’s close as per UTC) over that level would indicate bearish invalidation. Weekly chart\nAs seen from the graph above, the last week candle had closed beneath the 50-week MA for the very first time since October 2015, theoretically indicating the end of the long-term bull run. Regardless of the bullish set up, there’s merit in being cautious as the important moving averages — 50, 100 and 200 — on the 4-hour graph will also be biased to the bears, as is the 10-day MA. View\nBitcoin will probably soon rise to $7,870 (descending trendline hurdle) from the next twenty five hours. A high-volume break above that level would make it possible for a re-test of the 50-day moving average, currently situated at $8,522. Bearish situation: The moving averages are maintaining a bearish bias, therefore a fall to $6,900 could be on the cards if the bulls fail to capitalize on the break above $7,500 and the cost drops below $7,270 at the next twenty five hours.\nArchery target image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet which strives for the greatest abides by a ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:07:43.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1147cb215254be15acc1a2fe5393acdcee954ec0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRlH6CK7pGhFaCaFWYHK2S79VbJvhfg9vU9JhzLd935bHWvY5msqUvoKBdDsch4cCSyEmPGxh293hSP2ZRALGbMMVYzHy2T4XTY3K2UfsghxkMcmtjx_JH", "site_full": "www.actionforex.com", "site": "actionforex.com", "site_section": "https://www.actionforex.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Action Forex", "title": "Bitcoin Sharp Move Higher", "title_full": "Bitcoin Sharp Move Higher", "published": "2018-05-31T14:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/featured-images/bitcoin2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 91367, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1147cb215254be15acc1a2fe5393acdcee954ec0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRlH6CK7pGhFaCaFWYHK2S79VbJvhfg9vU9JhzLd935bHWvY5msqUvoKBdDsch4cCSyEmPGxh293hSP2ZRALGbMMVYzHy2T4XTY3K2UfsghxkMcmtjx_JH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Swissquote Bank SA", "published": "2018-05-31T14:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Sharp Move Higher", "text": "http://en.swissquote.com/fx Trading foreign exchange, spot precious metals and any other product on the Forex platform involves significant risk of loss and may not be suitable for all investors.

Bitcoin is looking bullish, Ethereum is looking for a direction, while Ripple is vulnerable. BTC/USD path of least resistance is up\nThe price of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extends its gradual recovery. Can it continue higher?\nThe Technical Confluence Detector shows that the digital coin has more room to the upside than to the downside. A confluence of some technical lines awaits at $ 7,570 . This is the meting point of the Simple Moving Average 5-1h, the Pivot Point one -day R1, the SMA 5-15m, the SMA 10-15m, and the SMA 10-one day.\nThe next hurdle is at $ 7,740 which is the convergence of the Fibonacci 61.8% one-month and the Fibonacci 161.8% one-day.\nHowever, the most significant cluster of potent resistance lines awaits only around $ 8,500 . This is the meeting point of the Fibonacci 48.2% one-month, the Simple Moving Average 50 one day, the SMA 200-4h, and the SMA 100 one day, all strong lines.\nOn the downside, support awaits at $ 7,403 which is a cluster that consists of the 4h-high, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day, the SMA 5-4h, and the Bolinger Band one-hour Middle (Stdv. 2.2).\nThe most robust support line is at $ 7,270 which is the confluence of the Pivot Point one-day Support 1, the one-day high, the one-month low, and the one-week low.\nAll in all, there is more room to the upside than to the downside.\nThis is how it looks: ETH/USD is within a $36 range\nThe Confluence Detector sees clear battle lines for Ethereum (ETH/USD). The cryptocurrency faces fierce resistance around $ 583 . This is the convergence of the Fibonacci 38.2% one-month, the Bolinger Band 1h-Upper (Stdv. 2.2), the BB 15m-Upper, and the powerful Pivot Point one-day Resistance 1.\nFurther above, $ 614 is the confluence of the Fibonacci 161.8% one-day and the Fibo 38.2% one-week. This cluster is not as strong as the previous one. So, a break above $583 could unleash the upside.\nOn the downside, $ 560 is a significant line of support with the congestion of the Simple Moving Average 5-4h, the BB 1h-Middle, the SMA 5-1d, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day, the SMA 200-15m, the SMA 50-1h, and the SMA 100-15m.\nThe next level to watch is $ 547 which consists of the Bolinger Band 1h-Middle, the one-month low, and the one-week low.\nAll in all, ETH/USD is trading within the $547-$583 band. XRP/USD on unstable ground\nContrary to the other blockchain biggies, Ripple (XRP/USD) is not looking that great. The $ 0.6000 is a convergence area of relatively weak support levels: the one hour low, the Fibonacci 23.6% one-week, the Simple Moving Average 50-15m, the SMA 100-15m, the Bolinger Band 15m-Lower, the SMA 200-1h, the SMA 50-4h, and more. While the list is long, no line stands out.\nStronger support is at $ 0.5750 which is the confluence of the one-month low, the one-week low, and the Bollinger Band one-hour Lower.\nOn the upside, $ 0.6272 is a critical cap: the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 1, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-week, the one-day high, and the Bolinger Band one-hour Upper converge there.\nFurther above on the upside, the $ 0.6500 area is a cluster featuring the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 2, the Fibonacci 61.8% one-month, and the Bolinger Band one-day Middle.\nAt current levels, there is somewhat more resistance than support for Ripple.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forexcrunch.com/category/opinions/", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.forexcrunch.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:17:39.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfb9319e00564f9ed8b2fe3fa41222a5bf4de19a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9.9TXUU_siMkzkQB7HTasNbvXQgGdBSkH6lQ1LC0XY.e288b_xI3XwDnqNX7Uw50bsRIX2RPMMbBMJqq7g4hbS2T1DQPvxn0ZdGAMfN_3ALjcc0Fh9obuQWUHnupG1OU3JaUd2aYBvnK4Hnd8_Lv2ESjEBjWQu5uSQ--", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Bitcoin path of least resistance is up, Ripple is vulnerable, Ethereum looking for a direction", "title_full": "Bitcoin path of least resistance is up, Ripple is vulnerable, Ethereum looking for a direction", "published": "2018-05-31T14:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfb9319e00564f9ed8b2fe3fa41222a5bf4de19a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9.9TXUU_siMkzkQB7HTasNbvXQgGdBSkH6lQ1LC0XY.e288b_xI3XwDnqNX7Uw50bsRIX2RPMMbBMJqq7g4hbS2T1DQPvxn0ZdGAMfN_3ALjcc0Fh9obuQWUHnupG1OU3JaUd2aYBvnK4Hnd8_Lv2ESjEBjWQu5uSQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Forex Crunch", "published": "2018-05-31T14:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin path of least resistance is up, Ripple is vulnerable, Ethereum looking for a direction", "text": "Home / Forex Analysis / Bitcoin path of least resistance is up, Ripple is vulnerable, Ethereum looking for a direction Bitcoin path of least resistance is up, Ripple is vulnerable, Ethereum looking for a direction Posted by: Forex Crunch in Forex Analysis 4 mins ago\nThe Confluence Detector shows clusters of technical levels according to their importance.

He was arrested and indicted in May 2017 for violating the Protection of Children and Juveniles From Sexual Abuse Law.\nHelp us to make Finance Magnates better!\nAhn was already sentenced to 18 months imprisonment along with a fine of 696 million won ($646,000) by a lower court. However, the question remained whether the prosecutors are allowed to confiscate 191 Bitcoins worth over $1.4 million Ahn receive as payment. Landmark judgment\n“The cryptocurrency is recognized to have value so it can be confiscated,” the Supreme Court of Korea stated in its judgment.\nThis was a landmark judgment for South Korean administration as for the first time cryptocurrency is subjected to confiscation in the country.\nThe newspaper detailed that since 2013, Ahn distributed 235,000 obscene pictures online and made 1.9 billion won ($1.7 million). A lower court ruled against an appeal by the prosecutors to seize 216 Bitcoins in his possession that were earned illegally, stating Bitcoins only existed electronically and had no physical form.\nHowever, a high court, on an appealing plea, ruled in favor of the prosecutors recognizing that 191 out of 216 Bitcoins were acquired as a payment from the illegal online content.\n“The bitcoins were earned from the proceeds of crime,” the high court order noted. “If we return the bitcoins to Ahn, it will be giving him back profits that were earned illegally from running an online porn site.”\nMoreover, the Supreme Court’s order added weight to the high court’s judgment and the South Korean authorities now can confiscate any digital asset related to illegal activities.\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/young-people-s-korea-among-hardest-hit-shrinking-crypto-markets/", "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRisHN0415X-E5Ru16ORunEn_qNxIuhGgZIlFqtW8ul0HEpg/viewform?usp=sf_link", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/south-korea-clarifies-crypto-exchange-ban-isnt-sure/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ahn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "korea times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court of korea", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:28:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b10d8adc9341b987ac0ca0a90dd926bf3609d60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.GWDR2a6LAr0K5tlvE5RElBGakWPnLHVj1CaYgzvZ6HIw430jTUCRsvBBAqfDRcajbuskHmEjCZyXc1Y2j0omtMx_j6aJyQZM1Rw5z0IoLtixI0QUjNmKm", "site_full": "www.technology-in-business.net", "site": "technology-in-business.net", "site_section": "http://www.technology-in-business.net/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Technology in Business", "title": "Here’s Why a Bitcoin Bull Run will Start Soon!

Bitcoin price key resistance is at $7,600, a break above this could open the way for gains towards $7,800.\nThe cryptocurrency market is in the green on Thursday with most of the digital assets recording gains. The total market capitalization has gone up by over $11 billion from $319 billion to $330 billion according to CoinMarketCap. The global trading volume has however declined slightly from $16.3 billion traded on May 30 to $15.7 billion at the time of writing.\nBitcoin price analysis\nBitcoin price is currently trading at $7,536, while it is forming another bullish flag pattern. The price tested the resistance at $7,600 at the opening of the session today but corrected lower instead finding a short-term support at $7,530. Bitcoin price will correct lower, and test another support area $7,500 before gaining momentum to attack $7,600 again. A break past they key resistance ($7,600) will open the gate for more gains towards the next key resistance at $7,800. On the downside, $7,500 is a good entry position but the best buy zone is at the recent bottom around $7,350.\nEthereum price, on one hand, is up 2.14% on the day, while it is exchanging marginally above $570. The crypto tested $580 but lacked the momentum to breach the resistance. On the other hand, Ripple price is also correcting slightly higher above $0.60. It is up a subtle 1% while its upside has been capped at $0.62.

first bitcoin exchange has announced plans to launch an upgraded platform in June 2018, in addition to introducing trading pairs for several cryptocurrencies.\nZero Fee Trading BTCC , the Hong Kong-based digital asset exchange, announced via an official statement on May 24, 2018, about plans to launch an upgrade. \"BTCC Exchange\" platform in June 2018, which aims to provide users with faster deposits, higher exchange liquidity, and small bid-offer spreads, in addition to being made available to a worldwide audience.\nAs stated, the launch shall initially support ( BTC ), ethereum ( ETH) , bitcoin cash ( BCH ) and litecoin (LTC) trading pairs, with the exchange adding that user demands shall be addressed in the upcoming months to accommodate additional trading pairs.\nThe exchange is seemingly withholding any personal benefits in the initial period, as users shall enjoy a zero-fee trading experience for the first three months after launch, i.e., until September 2018.\nSalient Features of Upgraded Platform The announcement claims that BTCC shall include offline cold storage wallets for users, in a bid to safe-keep their digital assets and prevent a massive cryptocurrency theft – as observed in the January 2018 $550 million NEM hack which was attributed to Coincheck's usage of \"hot wallets.\"\nThe exchange added that security was one of the most serious considerations while planning the upgrade, and took pride in the fact that the platform has \"never been compromised\" in its seven-year history.\nSpeaking about its revamped technology, BTCC stated:\n\"In terms of technical developments, our exchange will utilize a multi-tier, multi-clustered system with an optimized, high-speed memory trading engine.\"\nFounded as BTC China in 2011, the exchange was the world's first to offer commercial buying, selling, and trading of bitcoins. Unfortunately, the pioneering exchange shuttered its doors in China in 2017, after the country launched a crackdown of ICOs and outright banned digital asset handling for its citizens. Due to this, BTCC shifted its offices to Hong Kong and London.\nHong Kong has welcomed several cryptocurrency businesses over the years . Source : Mazar\nThe exchange has been regarded as one of China's original \"Big Three,\" and was acquired by a Hong Kong-based digital assets fund in 2018, which has now culminated into the firm's revival.\nThe post World's Oldest Bitcoin Exchange BTCC to Launch New Platform: Introduce Suite of New Features appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btcc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:54:22.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ea3bc6ef1969b1c9cb32aa2673644e446af82e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZO5TufI3Y8auExjEhp5_DU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Is Bitcoin Hit $ 40000 in 2018...??", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin Hit $ 40000 in 2018...??", "published": "2018-05-31T13:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ea3bc6ef1969b1c9cb32aa2673644e446af82e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZO5TufI3Y8auExjEhp5_DU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gudvin1988783", "published": "2018-05-31T13:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin Hit $ 40000 in 2018...??", "text": "It's hard to reach the $ 40k mark, but it's very high", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T21:37:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e479f17dd0fc610b9834b90d044f7bc033f30bc6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXuXb67PNQOZ7BdRJyyiAyU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Altcoin survive without Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Altcoin survive without Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-31T13:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.788, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e479f17dd0fc610b9834b90d044f7bc033f30bc6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXuXb67PNQOZ7BdRJyyiAyU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mobilezz", "published": "2018-05-31T13:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Altcoin survive without Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: Vjatri on May 29, 2018, 03:44:37 PM What do you think guys can altcoin survive without Bitcoin?\nIt is difficult, if he was not so dependent on the founder, then this is probably the most pleasant and positive time for us.

Follow Torjus According to Garlinghouse, markets will eventually acknowledge the differences between cryptos (Source: Getty) Torjus Roberg\nChief executive of the crypto platform Ripple Brad Garlinghouse has said that bitcoin's dominance over cryptocurrency prices might be coming to an end.\nAccording to Garlinghouse, the current influence of bitcoin in the crypto world could change when the differences between cryptocurrencies are acknowledged by markets.\nSan Francisco-based payment network Ripple uses the digital token XRP as the transaction asset on its platform which is, unlike bitcoin, not blockchain-based.\nRead more : Twitter's Jack Dorsey wants bitcoin to become internet's 'native currency'\nHe said in an interview with CNBC: “There's a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies. It's early, over time you'll see a more rational market and behaviours that reflect that.”\nRipple is becoming increasingly popular and announced a record first quarter this year and has signed a deal with Kuwait's largest bank yesterday, keeping its place as the third biggest coin on the market.\nHowever, for the digital currencies, the first quarter was tough as market capitalisation for cryptocurrencies fell by over 50 per cent with XRP taking the worst beating, losing 70 per cent of its value.\nGarlinghouse continued: “It's still a nascent industry, the speculation in the market dominates the trading activity. I think it's a matter of time until people better understand the different use cases.”\nBitcoin's price is currently $7,537 (£5,657) which is less than half of what it was worth in December last year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://iptc.org/std/rNews/2011-10-07#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torjus roberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torjus roberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:56:29.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33f9f279636832e3f898325c5fdad87fe89e55bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRHYC08RnqbqIPU..fp8bKV_uM.pKsYRIS7Py4faHwGzrmD30LnyAyUBsI4hcYa8v0mHGMKPb_lAl9VL_aT68Ru", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Bitcoin For America: Cryptocurrencies In Campaign Finance", "title_full": "Bitcoin For America: Cryptocurrencies In Campaign Finance", "published": "2018-05-31T13:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33f9f279636832e3f898325c5fdad87fe89e55bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRHYC08RnqbqIPU..fp8bKV_uM.pKsYRIS7Py4faHwGzrmD30LnyAyUBsI4hcYa8v0mHGMKPb_lAl9VL_aT68Ru", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-31T13:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin For America: Cryptocurrencies In Campaign Finance", "text": "Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

We are gravely concerned about these incidents, and to show our anxiety, the collective leadership of eMalahleni Local Municipality re-launched the Moral Regeneration Movement to precisely deal with such issues. We have, as a collective, been travelling throughout eMalahleni raising awareness about undesirable conditions which we find ourselves. We have visited affected families and have offered our undivided support.

Whether it’s “spoofing” the system or flooding the market with fake buy and sell orders in order to lure other traders into the mix, the DoJ wants to know about it.\nThat’s because millions of people around the world who know too little about how crypto spaces work are, at least in some cases, pouring their life savings into these investments. And when they don’t pan out, these gullible individuals are ending up with nothing.\nWith the help of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the DoJ is said to be conducting its investigation with the hope of improving the integrity of crypto platforms, which increasingly face skepticism for being “Wild West” free-for-alls where the winners are simply the biggest cheaters.\nNews of the investigation sent Bitcoin’s price plummeting down three percent to below $7,500 earlier in the week – this, after reaching an all-time high of around $20,000 back in late 2017.\nFor more news on the questionable future of Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies, visit BitRaped.com . Cryptocurrency “bulls” see DoJ investigation as a good thing for cryptos\nBut this is all a good thing, according to former hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz, who believes that such a probe is long overdue – and desperately needed in order to stabilize the crypto markets and reinforce their legitimacy.

Download here .\n“Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market,” Novogratz is quoted as saying by CCN.com .\n“Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins.”\nOther cryptocurrency “bulls” and fellow exchange gurus seem to agree, including Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini. He told CCN.com that he fully welcomes with open arms “any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors.”\nTom Lee, founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, holds similar beliefs, having referred to the DoJ’s involvement as bringing necessary “adult supervision” to the world of cryptocurrency.\nWith better protections for investors in place, Lee and others remain hopeful that Bitcoin in particular will bounce back from a multi-month lull, and eventually reach $25,000 before the end of the year. Beware: Many cryptocurrency trading platforms still aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC\nAt the same time, traders still need to be smart in order to avoid being ripped off. Not only is it important to know about cryptocurrency itself before investing in it, but also about the various platforms on which it’s traded.\nSince CFTC is only in charge of watching derivatives, it doesn’t monitor the spot market for digital tokens. And according to reports, many trading platforms remain unregistered with either the CFTC or the SEC – which means there are no protections in place for everyday investors. The CFTC can, however, impose sanctions on trading platforms that show evidence of fraud.\nUnless this “buyer beware” approach to regulatory oversight changes, it’s unlikely that the crypto markets will continue to grow, as there’s just too much risk and far too many unknowns.

The Department of Justice has reportedly opened an investigation into whether traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies. And that's caused some market watchers to say that’s been clear all along. Peter Tchir, a market strategist at the investment bank Academy Securities, is one of those people. He talked with Marketplace Tech host Molly Wood about his piece for Forbes titled \" I Would Be Shocked If Bitcoin Prices Weren't Manipulated .\" The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\nPeter Tchir: To me, there [are] three types of manipulation: One is where someone, through pricing, tries to put various prices on different exchanges or artificial prices to move the market price one way or the other. The other I think would be a more classic \"pump and dump\" type scheme, which was traditional on penny stocks, where people own a lot of a stock and then they talk it up trying to get new investors to come in in order to sell it to them at artificially high prices. Aand somewhere in between are when people own large stakes of it or take actions that may be to the detriment of other shareholders in an attempt to get a short-term price reaction. So I would view all those things as various types of manipulation.\nMolly Wood: There seems to be this viewpoint, and this is what you essentially articulated in your column, which is it might not be against the law, but it's a really good bet that these prices are being manipulated.\nTchir: Yes, I have something that I've called the \"three rules of bitcoin,\" but rule No. 2 has always been there are no rules. Which may be ironic, but I think we're trying to highlight the point that this is not a regulated environment. You do not know people's positions when they talk about it. There are relatively few very large holders of these cryptocurrencies. Most of the cryptocurrencies tend to have a small number of very large holders who are clearly very incentivized to keep the price up. So they may be trading in such a way to prop the price up. I think you have to be aware of it. It doesn't mean that you can't like bitcoin, that you can't think it's going higher, but I think you have to be aware of that.\nWood: All cryptocurrency generally as a class has very passionate defenders, and I feel like I can hear them saying, \"You're an investment banker. There's every reason for you to say you don't like bitcoin because you're interested in protecting the status quo.\"\nTchir: Yes, I could see that. On the other hand, I came from the credit derivatives background. I've always been in new product development. I would be very happy to bring to my institution, if we felt it was worthwhile, cryptocurrency. I come into this looking for opportunities for investors, and it's through my digging in this that I've become uncomfortable, that I'm not yet at the point of believing that this is something that should be traded actively or that fits into a bank.\nWood: Is bitcoin a big enough part of the economy that wild price fluctuations or price manipulation could have other side effects or could have more far-reaching economic impact?\nTchir: I don't think it's big enough quite yet, but if you go back, there was a spike in credit card default rates earlier this year, and shortly after you saw a lot of the big banks stop allowing people to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on their credit cards. So yeah, I think there were actually people speculating with credit card money to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and that's, I think, very problematic for those individuals. I think it's a very, very speculative asset class. It's not a currency, despite being called that. We hear stories of students using their student loans to buy bitcoin. And it does hit stocks, if you look at stocks like Invidia, where the chips that they use have been a very big part of [cryptocurrency] miners. You've also seen energy stocks hit.

The Department of Justice has reportedly opened an investigation into whether traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies. And that's caused some market watchers to say that’s been clear all along. Peter Tchir, a market strategist at the investment bank Academy Securities, is one of those people. He talked with Marketplace Tech host Molly Wood about his piece for Forbes titled \" I Would Be Shocked If Bitcoin Prices Weren't Manipulated .\" The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\nPeter Tchir: To me, there [are] three types of manipulation: One is where someone, through pricing, tries to put various prices on different exchanges or artificial prices to move the market price one way or the other. The other I think would be a more classic \"pump and dump\" type scheme, which was traditional on penny stocks, where people own a lot of a stock and then they talk it up trying to get new investors to come in in order to sell it to them at artificially high prices. Aand somewhere in between are when people own large stakes of it or take actions that may be to the detriment of other shareholders in an attempt to get a short-term price reaction. So I would view all those things as various types of manipulation.\nMolly Wood: There seems to be this viewpoint, and this is what you essentially articulated in your column, which is it might not be against the law, but it's a really good bet that these prices are being manipulated.\nTchir: Yes, I have something that I've called the \"three rules of bitcoin,\" but rule No. 2 has always been there are no rules. Which may be ironic, but I think we're trying to highlight the point that this is not a regulated environment. You do not know people's positions when they talk about it. There are relatively few very large holders of these cryptocurrencies. Most of the cryptocurrencies tend to have a small number of very large holders who are clearly very incentivized to keep the price up. So they may be trading in such a way to prop the price up. I think you have to be aware of it. It doesn't mean that you can't like bitcoin, that you can't think it's going higher, but I think you have to be aware of that.\nWood: All cryptocurrency generally as a class has very passionate defenders, and I feel like I can hear them saying, \"You're an investment banker. There's every reason for you to say you don't like bitcoin because you're interested in protecting the status quo.\"\nTchir: Yes, I could see that. On the other hand, I came from the credit derivatives background. I've always been in new product development. I would be very happy to bring to my institution, if we felt it was worthwhile, cryptocurrency. I come into this looking for opportunities for investors, and it's through my digging in this that I've become uncomfortable, that I'm not yet at the point of believing that this is something that should be traded actively or that fits into a bank.\nWood: Is bitcoin a big enough part of the economy that wild price fluctuations or price manipulation could have other side effects or could have more far-reaching economic impact?\nTchir: I don't think it's big enough quite yet, but if you go back, there was a spike in credit card default rates earlier this year, and shortly after you saw a lot of the big banks stop allowing people to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on their credit cards. So yeah, I think there were actually people speculating with credit card money to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and that's, I think, very problematic for those individuals. I think it's a very, very speculative asset class. It's not a currency, despite being called that. We hear stories of students using their student loans to buy bitcoin.

By Molly Wood, Stephanie Hughes and Shaheen Ainpour • 1 hour ago Related Program: Listening... /\nBitcoin’s wildly fluctuating price may not be the result of free market forces. The Department of Justice has reportedly opened an investigation into whether traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies. And that's caused some market watchers to say that’s been clear all along. Peter Tchir, a market strategist at the investment bank Academy Securities, is one of those people. He talked with Marketplace Tech host Molly Wood about his piece for Forbes titled \" I Would Be Shocked If Bitcoin Prices Weren't Manipulated .\" The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\nPeter Tchir: To me, there [are] three types of manipulation: One is where someone, through pricing, tries to put various prices on different exchanges or artificial prices to move the market price one way or the other. The other I think would be a more classic \"pump and dump\" type scheme, which was traditional on penny stocks, where people own a lot of a stock and then they talk it up trying to get new investors to come in in order to sell it to them at artificially high prices. Aand somewhere in between are when people own large stakes of it or take actions that may be to the detriment of other shareholders in an attempt to get a short-term price reaction. So I would view all those things as various types of manipulation.\nMolly Wood: There seems to be this viewpoint, and this is what you essentially articulated in your column, which is it might not be against the law, but it's a really good bet that these prices are being manipulated.\nTchir: Yes, I have something that I've called the \"three rules of bitcoin,\" but rule No. 2 has always been there are no rules. Which may be ironic, but I think we're trying to highlight the point that this is not a regulated environment. You do not know people's positions when they talk about it. There are relatively few very large holders of these cryptocurrencies. Most of the cryptocurrencies tend to have a small number of very large holders who are clearly very incentivized to keep the price up. So they may be trading in such a way to prop the price up. I think you have to be aware of it. It doesn't mean that you can't like bitcoin, that you can't think it's going higher, but I think you have to be aware of that.\nWood: All cryptocurrency generally as a class has very passionate defenders, and I feel like I can hear them saying, \"You're an investment banker. There's every reason for you to say you don't like bitcoin because you're interested in protecting the status quo.\"\nTchir: Yes, I could see that. On the other hand, I came from the credit derivatives background. I've always been in new product development. I would be very happy to bring to my institution, if we felt it was worthwhile, cryptocurrency. I come into this looking for opportunities for investors, and it's through my digging in this that I've become uncomfortable, that I'm not yet at the point of believing that this is something that should be traded actively or that fits into a bank.\nWood: Is bitcoin a big enough part of the economy that wild price fluctuations or price manipulation could have other side effects or could have more far-reaching economic impact?\nTchir: I don't think it's big enough quite yet, but if you go back, there was a spike in credit card default rates earlier this year, and shortly after you saw a lot of the big banks stop allowing people to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on their credit cards. So yeah, I think there were actually people speculating with credit card money to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and that's, I think, very problematic for those individuals.

The Department of Justice has reportedly opened an investigation into whether traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies. And that's caused some market watchers to say that’s been clear all along. Peter Tchir, a market strategist at the investment bank Academy Securities, is one of those people. He talked with Marketplace Tech host Molly Wood about his piece for Forbes titled \" I Would Be Shocked If Bitcoin Prices Weren't Manipulated .\" The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\nPeter Tchir: To me, there [are] three types of manipulation: One is where someone, through pricing, tries to put various prices on different exchanges or artificial prices to move the market price one way or the other. The other I think would be a more classic \"pump and dump\" type scheme, which was traditional on penny stocks, where people own a lot of a stock and then they talk it up trying to get new investors to come in in order to sell it to them at artificially high prices. And somewhere in between are when people own large stakes of it or take actions that may be to the detriment of other shareholders in an attempt to get a short-term price reaction. So I would view all those things as various types of manipulation.\nMolly Wood: There seems to be this viewpoint, and this is what you essentially articulated in your column, which is it might not be against the law, but it's a really good bet that these prices are being manipulated.\nTchir: Yes, I have something that I've called the \" three rules of bitcoin ,\" but rule No. 2 has always been there are no rules. Which may be ironic, but I think we're trying to highlight the point that this is not a regulated environment. You do not know people's positions when they talk about it. There are relatively few very large holders of these cryptocurrencies. Most of the cryptocurrencies tend to have a small number of very large holders who are clearly very incentivized to keep the price up. So they may be trading in such a way to prop the price up. I think you have to be aware of it. It doesn't mean that you can't like bitcoin, that you can't think it's going higher, but I think you have to be aware of that.\nWood: All cryptocurrency generally as a class has very passionate defenders, and I feel like I can hear them saying, \"You're an investment banker. There's every reason for you to say you don't like bitcoin because you're interested in protecting the status quo.\"\nTchir: Yes, I could see that. On the other hand, I came from the credit derivatives background. I've always been in new product development. I would be very happy to bring to my institution, if we felt it was worthwhile, cryptocurrency. I come into this looking for opportunities for investors, and it's through my digging in this that I've become uncomfortable, that I'm not yet at the point of believing that this is something that should be traded actively or that fits into a bank.\nWood: Is bitcoin a big enough part of the economy that wild price fluctuations or price manipulation could have other side effects or could have more far-reaching economic impact?\nTchir: I don't think it's big enough quite yet, but if you go back, there was a spike in credit card default rates earlier this year, and shortly after you saw a lot of the big banks stop allowing people to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on their credit cards. So yeah, I think there were actually people speculating with credit card money to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and that's, I think, very problematic for those individuals. I think it's a very, very speculative asset class. It's not a currency, despite being called that. We hear stories of students using their student loans to buy bitcoin. And it does hit stocks, if you look at stocks like Invidia, where the chips that they use have been a very big part of [cryptocurrency] miners. You've also seen energy stocks hit. So there are real-world implications.

Last week, Secretary of State of Colorado Wayne Williams proposed a new set of rules for financing political campaigns , which now includes a section on cryptocurrencies. The original edition of the draft introduces the same caps for crypto donations as for fiat ones, while limiting anonymous contributions to $20. The move renders the overall picture of individual states’ handling political crypto contributions spottier than ever, as the last few months saw states adopting divergent approaches to the issue.\nAlthough a 2014 advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) remains a major reference point for anyone who seeks to boost their chances for election with digital money, this non-regulatory document is barely fit to serve as a definitive guide into the world of crypto campaign finance.\nThe FEC came up with a set of guidelines in May 2014, responding to an inquiry from a Super PAC named Make Your Laws. This entity, which advocates for replacing representative democracy with a more inclusive form of ‘ liquid democracy ,’ requested clarification on whether it could accept BTC donations to fund political action. At that time, Bitcoin was worth some $400, and altcoins were not even considered as a vehicle for campaign finance. The FEC ruled that Bitcoin could be received by campaigns as ‘in-kind donations’– a form of contribution that provides goods and services needed for organizations’ operations rather than the money to purchase those goods and services.\nEffectively, this means that campaigns cannot spend received Bitcoin directly, but rather have to ‘liquidate’ it and then deposit the money to their accounts. As far as donation caps are concerned, the commission was split across party lines, with Democrats advocating for a $100 limit, and Republicans standing for the standard federal $2,700 cap. Since the advisory opinion outlines recommendations rather than rules, GOP support for a larger cap had later inspired some politicians to allow themselves to go with the $2,700 limit.\nGiven somewhat inconclusive federal guidelines, many state authorities have been facing similar inquiries ever since the FEC ruling was issued. Building up to the 2018 wave of primaries and elections, these requests have intensified. Oftentimes it is state governments’ ethics bodies that are tasked with deciding whether crypto donations are appropriate and how they should be governed. So far this year, several state commissions have either ruled against cryptocurrency donations or wavered on the issue, so the Colorado initiative, if successful, might become a precedent for other undecided states to consider.\nIn October 2017, a Kansas candidate for office sought guidance on potential use of crypto contributions from the state’s Governmental Ethics Commission. Shortly after, the office had announced that Bitcoin is ‘too secretive and untraceable,’ and could be used by ‘totally unidentifiable lobbyists’ to influence local elections.\nWisconsin Libertarian Party asked the State Ethics Commission in April to clarify whether it deems the use of cryptocurrency political contributions acceptable. The commission held public hearings and concluded that the issue should be decided by the state legislature . The time frame for the state House to rule on the issue is yet to be announced.\nEmmanuel Wilder, a Republican candidate for North Carolina State House, has approached State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement with a similar request in April. In his letter, Wilder acknowledged that traceability concerns exist, but still advocated for giving voters a choice between fiat and crypto donation formats, as well as supporting the ‘new upcoming financial service.’ The request is still under review.\nIn South Carolina, the issue has been decided in a speedier manner, and not in favor of crypto enthusiasts. Britton Wolf, a 23-year-old Republican candidate for District 71 of the South Carolina House of Representatives in June primaries, asked the state House’s ethics committee whether he could use digital currency donations to support his campaign. The officials responded that he could not, since the definition of a campaign contribution, as provided by the state law, does not include cryptocurrency . Heroes of Crypto-Funded Campaigns\nInstitutional politics is a field permeated by inertia and adherence to the status quo, so there is little wonder that cryptocurrency as a vehicle of political finance is still far from mainstream adoption. Politicians who use it are still vastly outnumbered, and for the majority of those who do, crypto donations constitute a minor share of overall funds.\nHowever, certain brands of politicians, such as firebrand libertarians and technology advocates, are already naturally predisposed to be relying on digital currency donations – accepting digital currency contributions has become an integral part of manifesting their ideology. Increasing mass adoption and surging prices are also factors that nudge more establishment actors to be looking towards crypto. Here are some of the most high-profile U.S. politicians on both federal and state levels who are vocal about their embrace of crypto funding. Andrew Hemingway\nA Republican candidate for New Hampshire governor in 2014, Hemingway has been the first ever contender to the office to use cryptocurrency contributions in his campaign. Bitcoin donations amounted to about 20 percent of his overall funds. Hemingway never advanced to the general election, having lost to Walter Havenstein in the Republican primary. Jared Polis\nU.S. Representative Jared Polis, who is arguably the most outspoken supporter of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology on the Capitol Hill, claims the credit of being the first acting Congressman to accept Bitcoin from his supporters. During his successful 2014 re-election campaign, he collected a modest $2,000 worth of crypto donations . In his 2018 bid for Colorado governor, Polis will surely exceed this figure by a significant margin. Dan Elder\nThe libertarian’s 2016 bid for Missouri House of Representatives has the distinction of being the first campaign ever to be funded entirely in Bitcoin . The result of the experiment turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with Elder carrying just over 10 percent of the vote. In 2018, Elder is running for District 79 of the Missouri House of Representatives again. Rand Paul\nA feature of every list of Bitcoin-friendly politicians, Paul became the first presidential candidate to embrace cryptocurrency donations when he announced his bid for the 2016 election. Back in 2015, this caused quite a stir . Greg Abbott\nIn an apparent move to attract younger and tech-savvy voters, then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced in April 2014 that he will accept Bitcoin contributions for his gubernatorial campaign. The strategy seems to have worked, as in January 2015 Abbott was sworn in as Governor of the state. Austin Petersen\nA Republican seeking election to the U.S. Senate from Missouri this year, Petersen’s embrace of cryptocurrency is grounded in his pro-market ideology. His campaign manager called the use of bitcoin a ‘ no-brainer .’ Petersen’s campaign amassed just south of $10,000 and became renowned for having received the largest ever single cryptocurrency contribution of 0.284 Bitcoin ($4,500 at the time) in December 2017. This figure doesn’t quite add up with the FEC guidelines even for fiat contributions, but the donation page on Petersen’s website gives a hint to how this could be legitimized:\n“The maximum amount an individual may contribute is $2,700 per election. Your contribution (up to $2,700) will be designated for the primary election. The next $2,700 will be designated for the general election.” Patrick Nelson\nDemocratic candidate for Congress from New York, Nelson proclaimed that his is a ‘ 21st century campaign ,’ which readily embraces ‘technology like #bitcoin.’ He later faced crypto fundraising issues when BitPay, a service that his campaign used for processing crypto donations, ran into licensing trouble with the state of New York. Brian Forde\nForde is well situated to become a new political crypto star. A Democrat seeking election to the U.S. House to represent the 45th Congressional District of California this year, he had worked as both head of digital currency at MIT Media Lab and a tech adviser for the Obama administration. His embrace of the technology is explicit, and his electoral chances look solid. The crypto community has already acknowledged its unequivocal support of his candidacy by funneling a record-breaking $66,000 worth of crypto to his wallets in August and September of 2017 alone, while the biggest names in the industry pledged their support .\nEven though the weight of cryptocurrency contributions in campaign funds remains modest, the overall upward trend is consistent with the increasing degree of mass adoption. There is little doubt that we will soon see more campaigns funded exclusively by crypto, as well as more successful bids relying at least partly on digital currency contributions. As these processes unfold, the FEC will be compelled to chart clearer rules and grapple with the problem of crypto donations’ limited traceability. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/politics/in-accepting-bitcoin-rand-paul-raises-money-and-questions.html", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.fitsnews.com/2018/05/16/south-carolina-wont-allow-bitcoin-contributions/", "https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/COSOS/2018/05/16/file_attachments/1008159/20180516_CPF_WorkingDraftRules.pdf", "http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article209242954.html", "http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2017/oct/25/kansas-ethics-panel-says-no-bitcoin-contributions-/", "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bitcoin-popular-political-campaign-donations/story?id=52873921", "https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-reports/bitcoin-contributions/", "https://www.denverpost.com/2018/05/17/colorado-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-political-contributions/", "https://www.makeyourlaws.org/introduction", "https://www.coinbuzz.com/2014/04/21/texas-attorney-general-greg-abbott-accepting-bitcoin-donations-governor-run/", "https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/24/could-wisconsin-politicians-take-contributions-bitcoin-ethics-commission-consider/542842002/", "https://twitter.com/PatFNelson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://bitpay.com/247436/donate", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/cryptocurrency-candidates-politicians-embrace-bitcoin.html", "https://cryptovest.com/news/us-politician-invites-bitcoin-donations-for-congress-campaign/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/bitcoin-s-candidate-for-congress", "http://journaltimes.com/news/state-and-regional/ethics-commission-asks-legislature-to-decide-bitcoins/article_a34f0f3d-b17d-5738-bb1d-836b29ec2768.html", "https://www.coindesk.com/candidate-disavows-dollar-bitcoin-only-donations/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "colorado wayne williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal election commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:55:58.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9ab703ad143d7de98385cde5f9d2def119a97d95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5c2dT8Jxa4qtWZT_vbjKGEBMLiXdfBkbxVZ7ELcOR2MHvo9lD9fO_biEMfdZQnqzj1KBgn68TTGE6twk5bmenLbKBYDJnv4fiJKdUPV0HOy5fMBHMthPro", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin [BTC], Litecoin [LTC], Stellar Lumens [XLM] to get a lift with Nasdaq’s support?", "title_full": "Bitcoin [BTC], Litecoin [LTC], Stellar Lumens [XLM] to get a lift with Nasdaq’s support?", "published": "2018-05-31T13:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ab703ad143d7de98385cde5f9d2def119a97d95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5c2dT8Jxa4qtWZT_vbjKGEBMLiXdfBkbxVZ7ELcOR2MHvo9lD9fO_biEMfdZQnqzj1KBgn68TTGE6twk5bmenLbKBYDJnv4fiJKdUPV0HOy5fMBHMthPro", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-05-31T13:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin [BTC], Litecoin [LTC], Stellar Lumens [XLM] to get a lift with Nasdaq’s support?", "text": "Bitcoin [BTC], Litecoin [LTC], Stellar Lumens [XLM] to get a lift with Nasdaq’s support?

The exchange will make its debut to the digital asset market with some plans for the future to set up a crypto exchange.\nThe plans to develop the platform are underway, as the high-profile CEO, Adena Friedman stated, whereas no timelines have been released to date. This could raise the bar and change the entire crypto-sphere for a positive change.\nAccording to some news reports, Nasdaq is supposedly backing up the aforementioned currencies with a popular partner, the Gemini exchange which is the first in the country to be completely licensed exchange platform. Their partnership looks at allowing Gemini to utilize Nasdaq’s tools and technologies to monitor real-time trade activities and augment security. The exchange will back the currencies and also work on developing their own crypto exchange platform.\nStellar Lumens [XLM] has been appreciated much in the recent days for its fairly good performance in the market and for grabbing many big deals like collaborations with IBM and Kin Foundation among others. XLM is at the 8 th, displaying consistency and stability in the volatile market.\nThe other currency to be backed by the exchange is the world’s 6th largest cryptocurrency, Litecoin which is basically an offspring of the market’s original currency Bitcoin. The current trading value for Litecoin is $121 with no major loss or gains. The market cap stands at $6.91 billion and is popularly known for its low fees and for being accepted widely in various stores and websites.\nBitcoin, the largest currency in the world that has ever been created since the crypto-market came into existence is also being supported by Nasdaq.

Presentations from leading specialists and expositions of the innovative solutions from blockchain-based startups are waiting for the guests.\nBlockchain in France: Big Changes\nAccording to the French Minister of Economy, the country is planning to become the main leader in European fintech industry. The claim is supported by recent actions of government officials.\nIn March 2018, French market regulator AMF announced the project of a new law which makes ICOs a legal means of investing. One month later, Council of State suggested reducing cryptocurrency operations taxes from 45% to 19%. Capital growth from cryptocurrency has been proposed to be counted as equal to non-fixed assets.\nParliament already discusses the DLT. Large banks, including BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and RCI Bank, introduce blockchain transactions, while the Bank of France helps startups based on decentralized technology.\nRecent changes show that the government is interested in the blockchain-based business and cryptocurrency market development. This is why French crypto community welcomes blockchain events with open arms.\nWho Will Present and What Will Be Discussed?\nStefano Tempesta, Regional Director at Microsoft, will deliver a presentation “Blockchain for Enterprise.” He will discuss smart contracts and cybersecurity, and will share real-life cases of blockchain integration into business operations.\nThe Founder and CEO at Chaineum Laurent Leloup will introduce the topic “The new use cases of blockchain for industrials and governments.” The expert will talk about the current trends in blockchain use and its innovative opportunities.\nMarc Durand, a Blockchain leader at IBM Cloud France, will give a presentation “Industrial blockchain projects with Hyperledger Fabric: Feedbacks and Perspectives.”\nDemozone\nApart from the conference, guests of the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France will have a chance to visit demozone where companies working in the blockchain industry will introduce their developments.\nThe event will include the networking time as well: companies will be able to find business partners, get business ties and sign profitable contracts.\nОrganizer\nThe event will be held by the company Smile-Expo, which has organized the Blockchain World Events series in 25 countries.\nVenue\nThe conference will take place in the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile hotel in the heart of Paris next to Arch of Triumph and Champs-Élysées.

The move is designed to increase the amount of institutional capital making its way through the crypto space.\nChief executive officer of Bittrex Bill Shihara says the exchange has been working on this partnership for months. \"It's been a long path,\" he commented. \"It's not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex; it's about banks being able to trust crypto in general, and I think it's really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.\"\nDue to regulatory uncertainty surrounding virtual currencies, many established financial institutions continue to associate them with money laundering and related criminal activity, and have chosen to avoid them altogether. Last February, for example, customers who tried to purchase digital currency through Citigroup were treated to serious delays and cancelled transactions after the investment firm made the decision to bar users from buying crypto using their debit cards or checking accounts.\nThis decision was later replicated by establishments like Chase and Bank of America, both of which implemented bans preventing customers from purchasing cryptocurrencies on major exchanges. Thus, many virtual currency marketplaces still only allow customers to trade between digital assets, rather than dollar for crypto or vice versa.\nHowever, some banks are beginning to show signs of change in both attitude and business protocol, and have become more welcoming of cryptocurrencies. Popular digital currency exchange Coinbase has recently developed partnerships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the United States. The company has even garnered a Barclays PLC bank account in the United Kingdom .\nNoble Bank International in San Juan, Puerto Rico, also took over banking duties for Bitfinex in 2017 after the exchange's relationship with Wells Fargo came to a sudden end.\nDiscussing the needs of traditional banks, Shihara went on to say, \"They really do look and pour through the entire business. They want to make sure we've got robust AML/KYC processes and that we've got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts.\"\nBittrex, which boasts roughly 3 million customers around the world, allows users to trade up to 200 different digital coins. Fiat trading capabilities will also be launched May 31, 2018, for bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD. At press time, the service is only available to corporate clients in New York, California, Washington and Montana, though executives say they are working to expand this capability to retail investors once regulations are more defined.

Subscribe to updates Unsubscribe from updates\nThe creation of money has been effectively in private hands since, well, forever. Looking at the modern times – after the creation of the US federal reserve system in 1913 – one of the greatest misconceptions instilled in the masses is the belief that public institutions, such as the US Fed or the ECB, are the only expression of public interest and that money creation is the exclusive prerogative of sovereign “nation-states”. Although it is so widely purported – or simply conveniently led to believe – the truth is rather different.\nIndeed, in addition to the fractional-reserve banking – which enables commercial banks to create most of the broad money in the system – the very same well known, too big to fail, privately held commercial banks, also own substantial direct interest in the above institutions. Take the ECB for example, its governance is formally in the hands of 6 Executive Board members and the Governors of each of the 19 national central banks of member states . So you might think it is all politically endorsed by the democratically appointed governments of each member country. Well, not really.\nIn Italy for instance – although the same applies to other EU countries – the shareholders of the Banca d´Italia are mostly private banks or large insurance companies such as Unicredit, Intesa Sanpaolo and Assicurazioni Generali .\nThough the situation is much more obfuscated in the USA, the concept is the same: nationally-chartered banks own each one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks which are then part of the FED . As to which the members of the 12 FRBs are, good luck in finding them because it is quite difficult to come up with much information. It seems like a closely guarded secret.\nRegardless, exists a monopoly on money creation, which is awarded by the governments to the private banking sector – though it is concealed by the appearance of the FED and the ECB as being independent authorities – and it is safeguarded by the very same governments which legally endorse privately issued fiat moneys and make them legal tender by decree, thereby perpetuating the privileges of the banking sector.\nIn 1976, F.A. Hayek – the 1974 Economics Nobel Prize winner and one of the most prominent late members of the Austrian School of Economics – wrote a pamphlet titled “ Denationalisation of Money “, in which he foresaw the emergence of privately issued moneys which could compete among themselves and against the governments´ monopolies, which, in his words, has the defects of all monopolies as “ it prevents the discovery of better methods of satisfying a need for which a monopolist has no incentive “. Friedrich Hayek. Image credit: Flickr.\nDespite his visionary and highly interesting theories, all his assumptions regarding the benefits of a competitive regime for moneys remained essentially untested because, so far, the monopoly and the “legal tender” privileges could not be challenged by any privately issued money without it being immediately attacked by the governments.\nBut Bitcoin has been the first privately issued money which enables a radical paradigm shift and may start testing effectively Hayek’s assumptions because it is able to challenge the monopoly privilege thanks to its decentralized nature and the properties that make it resistant to coercion, censorship and geopolitical manipulation.\nWithout a central point of failure, governments cannot effectively attack Bitcoin. Related Post Beats Headphones Inventor to Hold ‘Monster’ $300 Million ICO\nMonster Products, the inventor of the Beats headphones line has informed the US Securities and…\nWhile granting to Hayek that the banking monopoly on money creation is one of the causes of the many illnesses of our financial system and of the increasing social inequality to levels not seen since 1929, the alleged advantages of competing moneys are still to be proved.\nHayek envisaged a competitive money regime which enabled currency price stability, preservation of purchasing power and store of value, as well as usability as a unit of account and medium of exchange for daily purchases.\nThe Italian professor F.M. Ametrano of the Universita´ Bicocca Milano and Politecnico di Milano, who is one of the leading voices in favour of Bitcoin, was one of the first to argue – back in 2016 – in favour of the new regime of competitive moneys foresaw by Hayek.\nProfessor Villaverde, of the University of Pennsylvania, is one of the first to have recently studied the impact of cryptocurrencies and this new regime of competitive moneys enabled by Bitcoin. In his column , he casts some doubts on the ability of a regime of competing currencies to maintain price stability . But one must also consider that the crypto sector develops and experiments at lightning speed and this makes any analysis quite soon obsolete. Take the emergence – in the meantime – of stable coins as an example. Even if I do personally share most of the concerns highlighted here on their ability to maintain price stability under stress conditions , they are a clear and important sign that there is a growing trend of creating different cryptocurrencies with different properties and functionalities, which may all have a specific market and a good reason to coexist. There is clearly a need for cryptos which preserve purchasing power and may become a store of value (such as Bitcoin), there is a need for stable coins to be used as unit of accounts and medium of exchange, there is a need for enhanced privacy issues (such as Monero), etc.\nAll those cryptos can theoretically fulfil different functions and being equally in demand among users.\nThen of course issues – such as their interoperability and how to effectively exchange each crypto with the others, as well as their ease of use – are all to be answered by new technological developments in the due time.\nBut one point made by Prof. Villaverde in his column is chiefly important: “ the threat of competition from private monies imposes market discipline on any government that issues currency. If a central bank, for example, does not provide a sufficiently ‘good’ money, then it will have difficulties in implementing allocations. This may be the best feature of cryptocurrencies. In a world in which we can switch to Bitcoin or Ethereum, central banks need to provide, paraphrasing Adam Smith, a tolerable administration of money. Currency competition may have a large upside for human welfare after all “\nIf Gresham’s Law does not fully apply and good money does not drive out bad fiat money, then hopefully it will make fiat money a lot better and vindicate Hayek’s vision after all.\nAbout the Author: Andrea Bianconi is an international business Lawyer with over two decades experience, a scholar of Austrian Economics, Monetary History and Geopolitics, a believer in the future of Blockchain based technologies and an active member of Berlin’s Blockchain Hub, a legal consultant, an investor himself and online trader with interest in commodities, precious metals, currencies, Tech stocks and Cryptos. https://www.bianconiandrea.com/ Subscribe to updates ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_money", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek", "https://hackernoon.com/the-instability-of-stablecoins-69e2c8e1729e", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School", "https://voxeu.org/article/competition-between-government-money-and-cryptocurrencies", "https://www.bianconiandrea.com/", "https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/12/18/who-owns-the-federal-reserve-bank-and-why-is-it-shrouded-in-myths-and-mysteries/", "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/govc/html/index.en.html", "https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "http://www.bancaditalia.it/chi-siamo/funzioni-governance/partecipanti-capitale/Partecipanti.pdf", "https://telegram.me/ccncom", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F47eMzu_DdA"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "friedrich hayek", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "executive board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us fed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T16:25:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d09c80090a1acab23c0de7ed76adb6448ae35a83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQHt1kcPv9iNij9pqb9yFho-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Where does bitcoin end up this year", "title_full": "Where does bitcoin end up this year", "published": "2018-05-31T13:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d09c80090a1acab23c0de7ed76adb6448ae35a83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQHt1kcPv9iNij9pqb9yFho-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nilda", "published": "2018-05-31T13:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Where does bitcoin end up this year", "text": "Im very optimistic that bitcoin wil break its previous record high of $20,000 by December.

Within the context of bitcoin , this security translates to validated and verifiably true transactions in the nodes operating in its network. But validating transactions in each node within bitcoin is a time- and resource-intensive activity. The drawback of this approach became abundantly clear last year when the number of transactions on bitcoin’s blockchain multiplied and clogged its network leading to delays in processing transactions. (See also: Will Rising Transaction Fees Bring Down Bitcoin Prices? )\nTo overcome problems of this sort, bitcoin’s network is divided into lightweight nodes and full nodes . The former are quicker in processing transactions compared to the latter. They do not download all transactions on bitcoin’s blockchain and, in instances of downloaded transactions, speed is achieved by downloading only header data pertaining to those transactions. It is the responsibility of fully validating bitcoin nodes to confirm all transactions occurring within the cryptocurrency’s network. They download all transactions on bitcoin’s blockchain and fully validate them with other nodes. (See also: What Is Bitcoin Mining? )\nThe advantages of running a mining machine come in the form of coin rewards and subsequent profits, when its value goes up. While there are no monetary rewards, running a full bitcoin node comes with its own intangible benefits. For example, it increases the security of transactions conducted by a user. This is especially important if you plan to conduct multiple bitcoin transactions in a day. It also contributes to the overall security of bitcoin’s network. By downloading all transactions, a full node will always have the latest and greatest information relating to information on bitcoin’s blockchain.\nFor bitcoin investors, a full node will serve two purposes. First it will help them monitor the health of bitcoin’s blockchain: The blockchain has a direct bearing on bitcoin’s price since it is used to process transactions—both commercial or trading-related. It will also secure the cryptocurrency’s blockchain thus ensuring the safety of their investment. Second, it will ensure valid and accurate bitcoin trading transactions. Setting Up a Full Node\nSetting up a full node is fairly easy. There are three methods by which you can set up your own full node.\nThe first method involves running a node in the cloud . You will need to set yourself up with an account on either Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. Subsequently, you will need to create a Virtual Machine (VM) instance to speed up connection and syncing to the cloud from your machine. Make sure that you configure firewall rules to ensure that your instance is not easily breached. Finally, you will need to download Bitcoin Core , the software required to run bitcoin and configure the appropriate port settings on your computer to the cloud.\nThe second method is similar to the first, except this time Bitcoin Core is run on your local machine. Running a bitcoin node requires a minimum 145 gigabytes of disk space and 2 gigabytes of RAM. Per some reports, bitcoin’s blockchain was 200 gigabytes in size as of January. You should also have an internet connection speed of, at least, 50 Kbps and a generous upload and download limit. (It is preferable to have a connection with no limits on uploads and downloads). Several websites and videos list instructions to configure the bitcoin core client. The first instance of downloading and syncing with bitcoin’s blockchain could take several days. However, subsequent instances should be quicker.\nThe third method for setting up a bitcoin full node is the “node-in-a-box” option. As the name indicates, this method consists of pre-configured bitcoin full nodes that can be hooked onto your computer. They come with an interface for you to manage the device and view data contained on it. In effect, this option outsources the grunt work of downloading and storing bitcoin’s blockchain to an external device that is mobile and consumes less power compared to your own personal system.

Ripple is up 1.32% while Bitcoin and Ethereum record gains of over 2% on Thursday. Ripple price formed a base support slightly above $0.5440 – $0.5400 before embarking on an upside roll that saw it test the resistance at $0.62. Another downside took over pushing XRP/USD down but it was supported by the ascending trendline as seen on the chart.\nRipple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse has made headlines while attending the Recode Code Conference. He referred to Bitcoin as a technology that has been overtaken by time. On the contrary, he also praised it for ushering in the digital asset revolution. He, however, said that Bitcoin could become a Napster of digital assets. While still referring to Bitcoin, Garlinghouse added:\n“People talk about using bitcoin to buy coffee, The average bitcoin transaction can take as much as 20 minutes. And the transaction cost is going to double the price of your coffee.”\nEarlier this week, on CNBC Fast Money, Brad Garlinghouse said in connection to Ripple that “While we’re on mile marker 1 of a 26-mile marathon, we’ve definitely passed the starting line.”\nTechnically, Ripple price has made several solid bullish candles and is now trading above $0.60. There is a bullish trend that could test the resistance zone at $0.62 while the buyers psychologically eye $0.65. On the downside, Ripple has a weak support at $0.60, besides the ascending trend line as well as the 200 SMA will prevent declines towards the demand and buy zone at $0.59, however, the decent buy zone is at $0.55.\nXRP/USD 15’ chart", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/xrpusd", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "napster", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:17:41.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8f8f8dad79c08d9d4ffc37333761b38f7979f3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYdCJqhIShJ79EYjm9WqUjE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Would you Invest Bitcoin <> Trading bitcoin?", "title_full": "Would you Invest Bitcoin <> Trading bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-31T12:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8f8f8dad79c08d9d4ffc37333761b38f7979f3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYdCJqhIShJ79EYjm9WqUjE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kencot", "published": "2018-05-31T12:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Would you Invest Bitcoin <> Trading bitcoin?", "text": "Both have advantages and disadvantages.

Bittrex is working with New York-based Signature Bank, which will hold the dollar-denominated funds, along with other financial firms.\n\"It's been a long path,\" Bittrex Chief Executive Officer Bill Shihara said in an interview. \"It's not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It's about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it's really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.\"\nLarger financial institutions, bound to strict government regulations on money laundering and customer verification, have mostly avoided putting their reputations at risk by getting involved with an industry that many still associate with criminal activity. As a result, some virtual-currency marketplaces are \"crypto-to-crypto\" only, meaning that they allow customers to trade using digital money, not dollars.\nSome banks are coming around. Coinbase, one of the biggest U.S. crypto trading venues, has developed relationships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the U.S., and recently secured a Barclays PLC bank account in the U.K. Noble Bank International, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, took over banking duties for Bitfinex last year after the exchange was dumped by Wells Fargo, three people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.\n\"They really do look and pore through the entire business,\" Shihara said. \"They want to make sure that we've got robust AML/KYC processes, that we've got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts.\"\nBittrex, which has more than 3 million customers globally, is launching fiat trading on Thursday for Bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD. The service will initially be available only to corporate customers in Washington, California, New York and Montana for regulatory reasons, but the firm said it plans to expand the offering to retail investors eventually. Over 35% of firms are still considering the type of models they will use for CECL implementation.

Bet types for the World Cup 2018\nWhen you are using these bitcoin sportsbooks, make sure you learn all the bet types first. Apart from the common sports bet types, there are some betting strategies that are unique to tournament structures like this grand sports event. World Cup tournament winner betting\nThis type of bitcoin betting is different. Newbies generally bet on their favorite team even before the tournament starts. It is better if you bet on that team to win individual games. This would count when winning a tournament. You should know that the tournament winner markets feature higher overground in sportsbooks. In case you are right about the team, it means you have found an edge. Therefore, betting on individual games increases your chances to take advantage of this edge and apply a staking plan to it. 2. Knockout stages\nDuring this stage, you have to make a decision. You either bet on the result obtained in the end, being the traditional “Home/Draw/Away” market, or you bet on a team you think will go through to the next round. This represents the “Team to advance” market.\nWith the 2018 FIFA World Cup rapidly approaching, it is time to rethink your bitcoin betting strategy. Check all the available bitcoin sportsbooks to see for yourself which is the greatest one and make sure you understand all the betting types that can guarantee success.

Bitcoin Price Sets Sights on New Resistance NEWS Omkar Godbole May 31, 2018 at 09:20 UTC | Updated Jun 1, 2018 at 02:50 UTC\nBitcoin (BTC) is working its way through the key supply zone above $7,500 and could test resistance at $7,870 in the next 24 hours, the technical charts indicate.\nThe cryptocurrency looked primed for a corrective rally yesterday, having created a bullish outside-day candle on Tuesday. However, the bulls had a tough time absorbing supply around 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 4-hour chart, located yesterday at $7,550.\nThe repeated failure to beat the moving average hurdle ended in a downside break of the diamond pattern. The subsequent sell-off ran out of steam at $7,270, and led to a convincing move above the 50-candle MA, seen today at $7,441.\nAs of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,535 on Bitfinex, up 0.6 percent over 24 hours, and looks set to test the falling trendline resistance located at $7,870. 4-hour chart\nThe recovery from $7,270 to $7,570 has established a higher low (bullish pattern), which adds credence to Tuesday's bullish outside-day candle and bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence.\nHence, BTC could test supply around $7,870 – resistance of trendline sloping downwards from the May 6 high and May 21 high.\nIt also means the cryptocurrency will likely peep above the all-important 50-week MA , currently located at $7,711. However, only a weekly close (Sunday's close as per UTC) above that level would signal bearish invalidation.\nWeekly chart\nAs seen in the chart above, the last weekly candle had closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since October 2015, in theory indicating the end of the long-term bull run.\nDespite the bullish set up, there is merit in being cautious as the major moving averages – 50, 100 and 200 – on the 4-hour chart are also biased to the bears, as is the 10-day MA. View Bitcoin will likely soon rise to $7,870 (descending trendline hurdle) in the next 24 hours. A high-volume break above that level would allow a re-test of the 50-day moving average, currently located at $8,522. Bearish scenario : The moving averages are maintaining a bearish bias, so a drop to $6,900 could be on the cards if the bulls fail to capitalize on the break above $7,500 and the price drops below $7,270 in the next 24 hours.\nArchery target image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CoinDeskMarkets/status/1001840340196904960", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/archery-target-ring-out-focus-archer-721406197?src=jEGlVutBel5XWZeY_sFRdg-1-67", "https://twitter.com/CoinDeskMarkets/status/1001841235244605440"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:45:06.088+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db4291c9a3caad9ac90806e90f259e96b6e2c736", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZjaU3wVQqGrbkHjlxsZWkk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin physical object?", "title_full": "Bitcoin physical object?", "published": "2018-05-31T12:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db4291c9a3caad9ac90806e90f259e96b6e2c736", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZjaU3wVQqGrbkHjlxsZWkk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PaulTrace", "published": "2018-05-31T12:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin physical object?", "text": "I don't think bitcoin should come into a physical form.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T23:34:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad2e926cc1431b65c920d5d0f9b51f2bdc8370f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVezjwHQpr52N", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Epazz-Inc-EPAZ-11753/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Epazz Inc.

There is a major bullish trend line forming with support at $7,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair looks set for more gains in the near term if it succeeds in breaking the $7,640 resistance. Bitcoin price is moving nicely above $7,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must clear the $7,600 and $7,640 resistances for an upside acceleration.\nBitcoin Price Analysis After trading above the $7,500 level, bitcoin price faced sellers near the $7,550 level against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair started a downside correction and traded below the $7,400 and $7,350 levels. It also declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,050 low to $7,550 high. However, the downside move was protected by the $7,250 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nA fresh upside wave was initiated and the price jumped back above the $7,400 level. It also cleared the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $7,565 high to $7,262 low. It seems like the price may continue to move higher and it could accelerate above the $7,600 level. It has to break the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last drop from the $7,565 high to $7,262 low at $7,640 for more gains. On the downside, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support at $7,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly in a bullish zone above $7,400. A successful break and close above the $7,640 resistance may perhaps call for a push towards the $7,800 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is moving nicely in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is heading higher into the overbought levels.\nMajor Support Level – $7,400\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,640\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Primed for Gains appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T12:09:21.037+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 23808, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=8400", "requestsLeft": 578}
