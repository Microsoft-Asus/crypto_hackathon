In fact, the most recently reported quarter marked the 10th consecutive period that the firm topped analysts’ sales projections.\n“Square’s integrated hardware, software and services solutions position the company to benefit from ongoing card acceptance penetration at smaller merchants while gaining share against existing solutions that lag from a technological or efficiency-basis,” wrote Perlin, who has the equivalent of a ‘buy’ rating on the stock.\nFortunately for Square, it’s not just cryptocurrencies that are contributing to soaring stock prices. The San Francisco-based firm’s shares have gained 25% since the company announced in April that it was buying website-creator Weebly for $365 million — the firm’s biggest acquisition ever. The deal is a key part of Square’s plans to bulk-up its online and e-commerce offerings and gives the firm another recurring revenue stream as well as a new base of customers.\nOriginally, Square was started as a payment system to serve small businesses priced out of traditional banking services. The concept was conceived when an artisan glassblower and friend of Dorsey needed a better way to process credit and debit card payments. The company has made massive gains since then, and shows no signs of slowing down.\nSquare: Moving Forward\nWhen Square’s cryptocurrency services were unveiled there were still some states where it was prohibited, like Georgia, Hawaii, Wyoming, and New York, due to local laws that regulate the movement of digital funds in attempts to prevent money laundering. This has slowly been changing. In a bid to win over future business opportunities with blockchain-based companies, Wyoming passed legislation earlier this year that exempts some cryptocurrency trading operations from its money transmitter laws.\nThe law, known as HB70, was among five crypto-friendly laws presented to the governor’s desk aimed at permitting cryptocurrency and blockchain companies to do business in the state. Square was quick to take advantage of Wyoming’s change in legislation, soon after making their Bitcoin services available to residents of the state.\nThen there’s New York. New York passed it’s Bitlicense cryptocurrency regulatory framework in 2015 under mounting pressure from banking lobbies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the New York District Attorney’s office. Since then only a handful of the licenses have been granted — and Square is looking to get in on the action next.\nA spokesperson for Square confirmed in March the firm’s bid to obtain a license via a tweet. Square made its announcement as legislators in New York are apparently in the process of making changes to the 2015 legislation which will allow more flexibility for cryptocurrency-based businesses in the state.

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBuying and Selling Bitcoin\nBitcoin can be traded on these cryptocurrency exchanges: Coinone, Poloniex, HitBTC, Korbit, Zaif, BitMEX, Huobi, Cobinhood, BtcTrade.im, Bitfinex, xBTCe, Quoine, GOPAX, Upbit, Luno, CEX.IO, Neraex, Simex, OOOBTC, BitBay, BTCC, CoinsBank, Bit-Z, Sistemkoin, CoinEx Market, Octaex, bitFlyer, CoinEgg, LakeBTC, Exmo, B2BX, Iquant, Trade By Trade, OEX, YoBit, Lbank, EXX, WEX, Ethfinex, Exrates, GDAX, itBit, Livecoin, DragonEX, Omicrex, Bittrex, Negocie Coins, Gate.io, ZB.COM, BTCBOX, Kraken, Coinrail, BitForex, fex, C2CX, Bitbank, Coinroom, Bitinka, OTCBTC, Hotbit, Coinhub, Tidex, RightBTC, Paribu, Fisco, IDAX, Kucoin, CoinTiger, Coinsuper, Binance, OKEx, Bitstamp, Bibox, TOPBTC, BCEX, Gemini, Bithumb, Fatbtc and CoinBene.

Is it worth getting a loan to deposit to bitcoin? The virtual currency has recently been used in many industries as an extremely popular and main payment system. This article is intended to answer the most frequently asked question on this subject: is it worth investing in Bitcoin or is it logical? After reading the following information, you can find an answer to this question, even though it is not exactly a bit.\nWhat Is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin (BTC) is a type of electronic currency, also known as Crypto money, developed by people and companies around the world. The thing to know about Crypto money is that it doesn't have a physical form. Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone or anything else (institution, etc.); however, except for all users who buy or sell.\nWhat Are The Advantages Of Bitcoin?\nThere may be a way to make money  you have a high chance of losing money at the same time, so you need to know how the system works.\nYou can only purchase certain products and services using Bitcoin.\nIt's all over the world.\nThe system is transparent and neutral, so it can't be changed by anyone.\nPayments can be made 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, because Bitcoin is not in any way related to banks.\nCan I lose money?\nAnswer Yes, you can lose money when investing in bitcoin. That's why you're not so sure about the chances of winning, especially if you get a loan for this purpose. You can lose money in a very short period of time, as the Bitcoin price fluctuates frequently. The system is not pyramidal and is based on your ability to analyze time-bound fluctuations. You have to understand how it works and invest at the most appropriate time. If you don't, you risk losing a lot of money. This is especially true when investors are trying to make a decision.\nIs the Bitcoin price too fluctuating?\nYeah, the price fluctuates. Investing in bitcoin is risky. The crypto market is very volatile. One year bitcoin may cost a few dollars, the next month may cost a thousand dollars, and after a while it may fall to the first amount. If you are an active investor, you can make big gains by making monthly purchases and selling Bitcoin. It should be noted that these investments can be taxed, just like all other investments, and your earnings will be taxed according to the state in which you reside. How to calculate the profit depends on the statement of income. Currently, bitcoin and other krypto currencies are not taxed in Turkey. However, according to government officials, there will be efforts to establish the legal basis in the near future.\nIn my opinion, investing in bitcoin is still feasible, bitcoin is the main crypto coin and bitcoin can also increase in value. Investing in bitcoin will give you better results.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T00:41:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f820b688a7ffe52808681fadc1335467528944bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0jmszd_d4CeC8h8iIPHxQNQYNhNRMo9h8206IwAZXROxczOYHixwl9hVC_RqCINYTGP1dLh9DdmUTlg5rO17Yy8wIMia5FZvTMOdnANnp.EcIXMs1HjuupUxxyk9u79Lskk6efopBrvEiEuC6WwrL4gwNWzp1zLvnN0lJMNELZQ--", "site_full": "cryptotradingsignals.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://cryptotradingsignals.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst – Free Automated Trading Crypto Trading Signals Crypto Discussion groups TelegramFreeCryptoSignals CryptoCurrencynews", "title": "Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst", "title_full": "Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst", "published": "2018-06-03T00:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f820b688a7ffe52808681fadc1335467528944bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0jmszd_d4CeC8h8iIPHxQNQYNhNRMo9h8206IwAZXROxczOYHixwl9hVC_RqCINYTGP1dLh9DdmUTlg5rO17Yy8wIMia5FZvTMOdnANnp.EcIXMs1HjuupUxxyk9u79Lskk6efopBrvEiEuC6WwrL4gwNWzp1zLvnN0lJMNELZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FreeAutomatedTradingbot & Crypto Signals", "published": "2018-06-03T00:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst", "text": "Source: Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T00:40:21.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "49a870c2f68d559207a674ae52854733fd019b2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va73FAqsG1F_AxQUymbPAwh7GEdVJXmbFSfe.ElpC8ii_dFAzi2jCCrvQ-", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "Unspent Bitcoin in Blockchain", "title_full": "Unspent Bitcoin in Blockchain", "published": "2018-06-03T00:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49a870c2f68d559207a674ae52854733fd019b2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va73FAqsG1F_AxQUymbPAwh7GEdVJXmbFSfe.ElpC8ii_dFAzi2jCCrvQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "user65489", "published": "2018-06-03T00:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Unspent Bitcoin in Blockchain", "text": "user65489 1 The transaction has been confirmed. How did you arrive at the conclusion that you haven't got the money yet? Which wallet software are you using? – Daniel R Nov 23 '17 at 10:06 Hi, Daniel. I sent the btc from my coins.ph wallet. It says there the transaction was successful. The bitcoin I sent was actually an investment I made on Nov. 17. I am supposed to receive the money (with interest) back to my coins.ph account. I have been reading a lot of 'Unspent' thing over the internet but I simply cannot understand what it means. – user65489 Nov 23 '17 at 10:09 Unspent means that the bitcoins have not yet been sent to another address. That is, they are currently residing at the address you sent them to. Now, your expectation to have the bitcoins returned with interest is an arrangment between you and the investee, and has nothing to do with Bitcoin functionality. – Daniel R Nov 23 '17 at 10:19 That is clear to me now. Thanks a lot. My assumption now is that the company did not use (spend) my bitcoins yet. If I see 'Spent' in Blockchain and yet I did not receive the payment in my wallet, that means the company did not pay me, right? I should have not trusted them in the first place. I relied on reviews and payout proofs, that is why I invested. I hope I am wrong. Do you think I can recover that Unspent bitcoin? – user65489 Nov 23 '17 at 10:43 1 If it is spent without you having received the funds, I would be worried. But that doesn't stop them from sending the btc later on from some other address of course. There is no such thing as \"recovering\" a confirmed transaction. Unless you are in possession of the private key, you can't spend the funds. – Daniel R Nov 23 '17 at 11:58", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

the lowest level ever with 36.1% of the total value.\nIn my opinion, it's because the interest in alternative coins is rising rapidly for one, but you also have to consider how much of the bitcoin world is criminal. Seriously, for the first 5-8 years, the digital currency was mainly used as a means for criminals to launder money and sell illegal goods on the dark market. Think of all the massive hacks in the early days also, and all those darknet markets that disappeared with huge amounts of bitcoin.\nLiterally millions and millions of the 16 million coins out there would be owned by criminals. And now with bitcoin becoming more centralized and less anonymous, they are swiftly exiting the market and looking for alternative dark coins.\nI also personally avoid using bitcoin all-together because of the extremely slow transaction speeds and high cost's associated with it.\nThe bitcoin mining business is dust, so that interest will die quickly.\nI just don't see a very bright future for the god of cryptocurrency and it will surely be surpassed by one of its rivals soon enough.\nI'm torn between predicting it to be Dash, or Ethereum, and I recon it could be about 2 years before that happens.\nWould love to know peoples thoughts on the future of bitcoin.\nWhere will bitcoin be in\n2 weeks?\n2 months?\n2 years?\nWill it be surpassed by another coin? If so, which one and when?\nWe cannot describe the future of bitcoin yet knowing that a lot of things has been happening to it right now and everyone is getting confused as day passes by since their investment on it is falling apart. We can say that maybe after it recovers, it will have a bright future ahead and will earn a spot at the world market making it the currency for all the people around the world.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T19:56:04.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe302074d84a2dec1d5673ceb1f0e42eabe1f7a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0jmszd_d4CeC8h8iIPHxQNQYNhNRMo9h8206IwAZXROxczOYHixwl9hVC_RqCINYTGP1dLh9DdmUTlg5rO17Yy8wIMia5FZvTMOdnANnp.EcIXMs1HjuupUxxyk9u79Lskk6efopBrvEiEuC6WwrLrh60kjnfwB0-", "site_full": "cryptotradingsignals.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://cryptotradingsignals.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst – Free Automated Trading Crypto Trading Signals Crypto Discussion groups TelegramFreeCryptoSignals CryptoCurrencynews", "title": "Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst", "title_full": "Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst", "published": "2018-06-03T00:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe302074d84a2dec1d5673ceb1f0e42eabe1f7a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0jmszd_d4CeC8h8iIPHxQNQYNhNRMo9h8206IwAZXROxczOYHixwl9hVC_RqCINYTGP1dLh9DdmUTlg5rO17Yy8wIMia5FZvTMOdnANnp.EcIXMs1HjuupUxxyk9u79Lskk6efopBrvEiEuC6WwrLrh60kjnfwB0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FreeAutomatedTradingbot & Crypto Signals", "published": "2018-06-03T00:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst", "text": "Source: Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out And Will Begin To Rally, Says Fund strat Analyst ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T00:29:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0bf60a1814d08197133eb1792eea74578a02ac1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfmhHPiIy8tZJB4skAnYAuA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "I will go bankrupt if it invests in bitcoins", "title_full": "I will go bankrupt if it invests in bitcoins", "published": "2018-06-03T00:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0bf60a1814d08197133eb1792eea74578a02ac1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfmhHPiIy8tZJB4skAnYAuA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aikidoka", "published": "2018-06-03T00:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "I will go bankrupt if it invests in bitcoins", "text": "You should not state it as if it is a fact.

A new lead to the movie business\nSlate intends to broadcast the documentary Beyond Bitcoin via its blockchain based online streaming platform Binge. The decentralized Binge platform provides low-cost, high-speed, high-definition media access for consumers worldwide, says the text of the press release. Sponsored Links\nDuring the Cannes festival in May 2018, Slate appeared at the center of the buzz surrounding blockchain technology and its potential to alter the entertainment industry. In Cannes, Slate announced their newly formed partnership with Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival (Sitges), where Sitges will adopt its digital ticketing platform, Slatix, powered by the cryptocurrency SLATE SLX, for the purchase of tickets and festival passes.\n“This will mark the first time in industry history that a film festival will accept cryptocurrency as well as traditional forms of payment”, says the Slate press release.\nSlatix is a blockchain-based, low-cost tokenized ticketing system that aims to provide benefits to consumers based on their loyalty. According to the press release, small and medium sized enterprises can benefit from Slatix’s low setup and operating costs, while the user-friendly app is intended to simplify DIY ticket distribution and redemption. Listings and token sale\nBased in Toronto and Los Angeles, the Slate Entertainment Group has launched several media platforms on its own blockchain, including Binge and Slatix.\nSlate has launched its presale in May 2018. The public token presale will remain open until June 9, 2018. So far, the Slate team has overpassed its soft cap goal, having raised over $20 mln. The current discount is 45 percent and bonus is 3 percent.\nAs the Slate team reported to Cointelegraph, Hong Kong based HitBTC, one of the top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, will be listing SLX on its exchange. HitBTC will host SLX with trading pairs against Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT).\n“Slate Entertainment Group is especially pleased to announce the agreement during the presale as it assures buyers that they will be able to trade SLX on the open market. The listing on a major exchange will also expand SLX’s exposure to new markets and increase distribution after the initial sale” says the press release.\nDisclaimer.

Welcome to Bitcoin.SE! That is a fairly old guide for Bitcoin Core v0.9.4, v0.10rc4 or, v0.8.6. Usually, these days compiling Bitcoin Core for Windows is done in an Ubuntu environment or similar ( build-windows.md ) but, without a link to the altcoin source repository, I cannot even check what its build documents say. Probably it uses lsecp256k1 instead of or as well as secp256k1. – Willtech Mar 13 at 11:37 @Willtech thanks for your welcome. I have created two learning coins (the last one is github.com/JustCuriously/locavore ) just to see how it work, build an explorer etc... it's of course copy of other old fork but it's to understand the process. The linux qt has been compiled but I'm not able to compile the Windows qt. If a use the new method (build-windows.md) on the old code I will have many depends errors now ? – Boody Mar 14 at 8:14 Your standard build instructions are here , do they work? – Willtech Mar 14 at 8:20 more or less since I have not been able to compile the Windows version, I have not yet updated the method. I just commit the qt version for linux (with qt5).

This is ironic, seeing how the country that issues this currency is one of the most centralized stores of value in the world.\nThe banknote in question is issued by the nation of Brunei, known as the Adobe of Peace. It is located on the north coast of the island of Borneo, and its money comes from huge oil and natural gas reserves. The banknote is the Brunei $10000, which is currently worth around USD7500.\nThe banknote breaks from the trend of the usual small currencies released in countries where the currencies hold a lot of buying power. This is seen in its neighbouring country Singapore, where the $10000 is no longer issued due to its use in illegal activities.\nThe monarch of the state is opulently rich as one of the longest reigning monarchs in the world. The state itself is ranked fifth in the world by the International Monetary Fund by GDP per capita at purchasing power. The GDP of the country comes up to around $33.376 billion, and the country has a public debt of 0%, making it one of the two countries in the world to enjoy the privilege.\nThe coincidence of the price of the banknote and the price of Bitcoin is remarkable as the coin is currently undergoing a bearish market at the moment. With an almost 2% drop in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is still showing signs of a bearish period.\nThe market is exhibiting volatile behaviour in the past year with drops from $7500 to $7400 on May 27th, and a sharp spike from around $7100 to $7400 on May 29th.

Despite the issue being reportedly resolved, the incident serves to highlight the need for decentralized, stable alternatives where possibilities of the kind are simply non-existent.\nIn an official statement on Twitter, Visa announced that their payment processing service is experiencing a “service disruption”: We are currently experiencing a service disruption which is preventing some Visa transactions in Europe from being processed. We are investigating the cause and working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation. We will keep you updated.\nReportedly , Visa users were experiencing serious issues with their card payments. They were receiving messages stating that there was a “disruption of service,” preventing providers receiving or sending money. Major Red Flag\nCredit card payments weren’t the only service impacted by the Visa outage. The issue also prevented many European customers from transacting with cash deposited in their bank accounts. The Irish Times reported that Irish tourists as far away as the US were unable to access their money.\nPersonal hassles aside, the outage could have triggered major issues for banking institutions as well. Reports began emerging of people lining up in front of ATMs to withdraw as much cash as possible for fear of a prolonged outage.\nBanks like HSBC started tweeting about the problem almost immediately: We are aware of an industry wide issue affecting Visa payments which is under investigation. ATM and MasterCard transactions are not impacted. Visa are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will continue to support our impacted customers as needed.\n— HSBC UK (@HSBC_UK) June 1, 2018 Current Problem Resolved, Underlying Issues Remain\nEarlier today, almost 20 hours after Visa first acknowledged the outage, the company posted an announcement on their website, claiming that the issue had been resolved:\nVisa Europe’s payment system is now operating at full capacity, and Visa account holders can now use Visa for any of their purchases and at ATMs, as they normally would.\nYet, a certain point needs to be stressed. Visa is one of the leading payment solutions providers, with millions of people using its services around the world. While it’s unclear how many of those customers were affected by the problem, one thing is clear – a problem with a single, centralized service provider can potentially leave millions of people unbanked. Can Crypto Provide an Answer?\nIn the official announcement, Visa explained that the outage was caused by some sort of “system failure.” The question here is – can we afford to let a “system” and its support team determine whether millions of people across the world will have access to their money?\nThe problem is much larger than Visa, of course, but this particular incident clearly outlines the need for an alternative – like Bitcoin – that is immune to such “system failures.”\nDecentralization could well solve all of these problems and, ironically, Visa is no stranger to the technology. In October 2016, Visa announced that it was working on a blockchain-based solution for cross-border, business-to-business exchange. Similarly, just this past month, MasterCard filed a patent for faster node verification system.\nCould all of this be hinting that we are closer to the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology?\nAmid all of the chaos caused by Visa’s outage, one simple truth emerged: Visa network goes down today.\nBitcoin has never gone down.\nDo you think decentralization is the solution that major payment processors and card issuers are in need of? Let us know in the comments below!\nImages courtesy of DepositPhotos ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

June 2, 2018 392 They say it takes money to make money; in order to make a profit off Bitcoin mining, you have to buy mining equipment and pay your electricity bill first. As more miners join the Bitcoin network , some individuals fear that the amount of electricity consumed by mining will have a negative impact on the environment. Others believe that the benefits of Bitcoin mining outweigh the cost it takes to produce the digital currency. Bitcoin mining and energy consumption\nNew Bitcoin are produced through a process called mining , where computers expend energy and computational resources to solve a difficult math problem that verifies a recent block of Bitcoin transactions. The miner who solves the math problem adds the block to the blockchain and receives newly minted Bitcoin. The difficulty of the math problem depends on how much computational power the network has in summation. As the Bitcoin network attracts more miners, the mining difficulty increases, and usually, the amount of energy a mining rig consumes increases too.\nThe Bitcoin network currently consumes about 2.55 gigawatts (GW) of electricity per year; to put that into perspective, the entire country of Ireland has an average electricity consumption of 3.1 GW , and Austria has an average electricity consumption of 8.2 GW per year. Over the past year, the estimated amount of TwH that the Bitcoin network consumes per year increased 413.37 percent. When compared to countries like the Czech Republic, the Bitcoin network uses 102.3 percent of the entire electricity consumed by the country per year.\nData consultant and blockchain specialist Alex De Vries believes that the amount of energy Bitcoin mining consumes is problematic. In a recent research study published in Joule, De Vries found that the average amount of electricity consumed per Bitcoin transaction is 300 kwH, and at the rate new miners are joining the network – and the mining difficulty increases – this number has the potential to reach 900 KwH by the end of 2018.\nDe Vries told Cointelegraph that even though society can not see the changes being made to the environment via Bitcoin mining, mining operations are not helping the world get closer to their climate and environmental goals: “We know that mining is done with coal-electricity, but also with renewable energy. In the latter case, we don’t know what we are displacing, plus renewable energy never has zero lifetime carbon footprint either. There’s more work to be done here, but there’s certainly an impact. The more energy Bitcoin uses, the more it will impact the environment for sure – which in turn will impact everyone. It’s not helping us reach our climate goals.”\nThere is a grey area when it comes to figuring out how Bitcoin mining is impacting the environment. Although some of the electricity used is sourced from coal , mining operations usually do not release carbon emissions themselves. Just because miners do not see the physical impact that mining has on the environment, the amount of resources consumed and the opportunity cost involved should be concerning in itself. Hash rate and energy consumption The amount of energy mining consumes seems to be increasing. As mining equipment becomes better at solving blocks, the electricity consumed by each mining rig increases. To stay ahead of their competitors, miners are always looking for mining equipment with a higher hashrate . The hashrate is the speed at which the miner is able to provide answers to the math problem. The higher the hash rate, the faster one can guess the answer to the problem.\nAt first, the problem was easy enough to be solved by a standard CPU , but as more miners joined the network and the problem became more difficult, miners found that GPU were better suited to solve the problem. Just a few years later, FPGAs and then ASICs – application specific integrated circuits – were better suited than GPUs to solve a block.\nOthers, like entrepreneur and former Google information security engineer Marc Bevand, believe that the amount of energy that mining consumes will cause further innovation in the form of renewable energies. Bevand believes that the energy consumption will eventually lead to decreased costs of renewable energy for society at large:\n“Because miners are so sensitive to electricity prices, they are often a driver pushing utilities to further develop renewables which are now the cheapest source of energy. For example in China, many miners are located in the Sichuan province because of its abundant hydroelectricity. Another example is an Australian entrepreneur who is building a 20 megawatt (MW) solar-powered mining farm. If the energy use of cryptocurrency miners continue to increase it will help decrease the costs of renewables for society at large (increased demand → increased R&D → increased capacity & higher efficiency → lower costs through economies of scale).”\nElectricity costs have already put miners in search for a cheaper source of energy. Companies have been looking to places like Canada and the Sichuan province where electricity is typically cheaper. Because miners have incentives to use cheap electricity, this leads to more R&D in the energy space. In the long run, this should make forms of electricity cheaper to all of society as innovations are made in energy. The Price of Network Security\nAlthough the amount of energy mining operations consume does not go unnoticed, some individuals believe that the benefits of mining – network security – outweigh the negative externalities like electricity consumption.\nThe Bitcoin network is secured by a consensus algorithm called proof-of-work (PoW) . Miners are paid newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees for solving a block, securing the network in the process. If a miner is not able to solve the cryptographic proof, blocks of transaction history would not be added to the blockchain and blockchain technology as a whole would be nullified; no record of transaction history would be created if blocks were not solved and added to the chain by miners. The cost that has to be paid for this network security is the large amounts of energy that a PoW consensus consumes.\nCypherpunk Jameson Lopp took to twitter to express how he feels about Bitcoin’s energy expenditure problem. Lopp believes that the electricity expense that Bitcoin mining accrues is simply a tax that must be paid for network security. Whining about the energy expenditure to secure Bitcoin against computational attacks will have no effect. The Bitcoin ecosystem pays contractors (miners) for security; if you want them to stop then you’ll have to make a better offer on the open market.\n— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) May 18, 2018\nEconomic researcher Vasily Sumanov also believes that energy inefficiency and waste is currently the price we pay to conduct blockchain experiments:\n“Higher energy consumption is associated not only with environmental pollution but also with the higher security of a distributed ledger dedicated to storage and transfer of value. I have a strong feeling that this is a temporary situation, and in the future, Bitcoin energy efficiency as a function of transaction volume and energy consumption will increase as a result of Lightning Network adoption.”\n“Just look at any other industry, for example, cars or electronic devices – their environment pollution and energy costs considerably decreased over time as these industries developed. So why do people expect high energy efficiency from the Bitcoin in the very beginning? It is only 9 years old.” Consensus algorithm\nPoW is currently the most popular form of consensus on a blockchain network. Before transactions are verified, miners must solve cryptographic proofs. However, it is also the most energy intensive form of consensus. Alternatives that consume less energy like Proof-of-Stake and the Lightning Network are being developed to make blockchain networks more efficient. But for the most part, these innovations have not officially launched. Bitcoin is still in its early stages and is not even 10 years old yet, and throughout history, it is not uncommon for technologies to be sub-optimal in their beginning stages. Improving efficiency\nAt the same time, there are people working towards solutions for these network problems. The Ethereum network is looking into proof-of-stake solutions to increase its efficiency while decreasing electricity consumption; the Bitcoin network is looking to implement the Lightning Network. But until these solutions are out of their test net phases and go live, PoW will continue to be criticized for its electricity consumption.\nOnce the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is optimized, the overall efficiency of the Bitcoin network will increase. In an academic paper titled Banking on Blockchain: Costs Savings Thanks to the Blockchain Technology , Luisanna Cocco , Andrea Pinna , and Michele Marchesi from the University of Cagliari’s electrical engineering and computer science departments, found that Bitcoin must increase its economic efficiency, operational efficiency, and service efficiency before it truly optimizes global financial infrastructures. “In a nutshell, all of our results show that the overall efficiency of the Bitcoin system can increase only after overcoming its main limitations: the low number of transactions per block and the too high computational power that it currently needs”\nBitcoin is useful for its transparent ledger, secure data storage, and user empowerment features, but is going to struggle with mass adoption until it can sort out scalability and energy consumption problems . The total amount of Bitcoin that can ever exist is 21 mln , and as mining rigs consume more energy, miners incur higher electricity bills, and the reward for mining Bitcoin diminishes. Eventually, the profit from Bitcoin mining alone will not be enough to cover the electricity expense. In the future, miners will need to supplement their electricity cost payment with money from the transaction fees they receive for signing a block. Is the energy expenditure worth it?\nAlthough some people believe that the amount of energy mining consumes is problematic, it is difficult to measure how much of society is benefiting from Bitcoin. Bevand told Cointelegraph: “Answering “is Bitcoin’s energy consumption worth it?” is very subjective, because we don’t have any hard data measuring how much Bitcoin is helping society. How many Venezuelan are using it to escape inflation? How many families are using it for international remittance and therefore avoiding the average fee of 7.13 percent of remittance providers? How many Bitcoin millionaires given back their newfound wealth to charities? We don’t have much data for any of these questions. I don’t think that the current level of energy consumption is worrisome. We are only at 0.2-0.5 percent of the worldwide electricity consumption. Like Morgan Stanley researchers said in their reports cryptocurrency miners are currently just a “blip on the radar” for utilities”\nSo far, there is no way for the world to quantitatively measure or know how many people are using Bitcoin , what they are using it for, and if it is making their lives better. But individuals like Bevand and businesses like Morgan Stanley say there’s no need to worry, because Bitcoin mining consumes such a small fraction of the world’s total electricity consumption. Innovation is imperative\nAlthough we may not be able to see the toll that Bitcoin mining is taking on our environment with the naked eye, there is no doubt that the Bitcoin network will have to reduce its energy consumption before the Bitcoin blockchain undergoes mass adoption. It would not be surprising to see a regulating body create policy and regulation for miners in attempt to control/reduce electricity consumption .\nBecause Bitcoin miners are so sensitive to the price of electricity, this should push R&D in the energy space and produce more efficient energy solutions. It is hard to get an understanding of the positive vs negatives externalities of Bitcoin, so it is hard to say if the amount of energy consumed is truly “worth it”. But if the amount of electricity consumed by mining is not kept under control or made more efficient, then it is possible that the impact to the environment will be irreversible once people become aware of the negative effects that Bitcoin mining had on it.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Luisanna-Cocco/2102980", "https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2009/12/16/whats-the-difference-between-a-cpu-and-a-gpu/", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-serenity-the-solution-to-ethereums-difficulty-bomb", "https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining#/companies", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt_hour", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/mining", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/cases-of-illegal-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-mining-chicken-farms-and-new-york", "https://cointelegraph.com/explained/lightning-network-explained", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/lightning-network", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Banking-on-Blockchain%3A-Costs-Savings-Thanks-to-the-Cocco-Pinna/f322b14e92abcb30795b9a1c21175077066ff54e", "https://twitter.com/lopp/status/997470055620382720", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-costs-more-electricity-than-houses-but-its-a-non-issue", "https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/meet-bitcoin-mining-capital-in-the-making-chinese-province-sichuan", "https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-cpu-2618150", "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FPGA", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/even-with-energy-surplus-canada-unable-to-meet-electricity-demands-of-bitcoin-miners", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/asic", "https://twitter.com/lopp/status/997470055620382720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-the-blockchain-", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/proof-of-work", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-glimpse-into-the-future-what-happens-when-there-are-no-more-bitcoin-to-mine", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-to-use-05-of-worlds-energy-by-end-of-2018-peer-reviewed-research-shows?utm_source=Telegram0&utm_medium=Social", "https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/how-to-mine-bitcoin-everything-you-need-to-know#what-is-mining", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/turning-coal-into-bitcoin-dirty-secret-of-2017-s-hottest-market", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Andrea-Pinna/35217657", "https://www.cell.com/joule/pdf/S2542-4351(18)30177-6.pdf", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-to-use-05-of-worlds-energy-by-end-of-2018-peer-reviewed-research-shows", "https://ny.matrix.ms.com/eqr/article/webapp/b974be48-effb-11e7-8cdb-6e28b48ebbd3", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-many-americans-really-own-crypto-skewed-results-of-polls-and-surveys", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/lightning-must-strike-soon-bitcoin-facing-backlogs-as-scalability-solution-awaited", "https://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2018/03/15/lnd-beta.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T03:22:16.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4776552e531fe3d99c35fa76edc435009905d90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.GNV3H1tigrDFYTfYp6iF3Puub4.px4L1h_Ig9pofNPIaw7VzGt3H.MIRZCAwO6BpTLXddzW8zvNF0BKCqvzUMf4W64RZuYbp1OOFGPJvy5aKs2BUHYYzWb4UqAO54a51O1ISPlQQGjYB9AOx8TwrvoS5QDehngSyjuWYI.ZIbFqHr8.2MVofBFAiofCog5xSVw2D_j0W4IU0xQDUWVYi3wPaECdexcj4x0ZEW8S8EFJPrc8g7Mac_", "site_full": "www.affiliateseeking.com", "site": "affiliateseeking.com", "site_section": "http://www.affiliateseeking.com/forums/forum/website-creation-design-maintenance/web-hosting/hosting-offers-deals", "site_categories": ["marketing", "advertising", "business"], "section_title": "Hosting Offers &amp;amp;

Brings Top Advisors On Board", "text": "Bitcoin – Spiking Announces Partnership with J Capital and Excavo and Brings Top Advisors On Board 2 June 2018 8537\nBitcoin Press Release: Spiking, an award winning platform that enables traders to mirror investments by market movers in equity markets , is pleased to announce that two major crypto firms — J Capital and Excavo — have joined the company’s initial token offering (ITO)\nJune 2nd, 2018. Singapore: .J Capital, a renowned cryptofund, has led a USD 1 million investment round into Spiking’s PRE-ITO. As a result of the partnership, J Capital’s Chief Investment Officer Kenneth Tan and CEO Jack Ser have been appointed to advisory roles for Spiking. Excavo’s Eugene Loza — the top cryptocurrency trader at TradingView.com. Andy Tian, Group CEO of GIFTO and Ouyang Yun, Group President of Asia Innovations Group, have also been appointed advisors.\nSpiking will allow crypto traders to find Whales (i.e. key executives of large companies behind cryptocurrency tokens, mining pools and/or large holders) and follow their cryptocurrency trades[1]. Powered by state-of-the-art tools where followers meet Whales in a completely transparent environment, Spiking will be built on a modern technology stack with fully audited security standards. It will do this by using smart contracts on the blockchain, allowing users to mirror the trading activity of any Whale and control their own segregated trading accounts directly.\nKenneth Tan of J Capital Stated:\n“Having many years of experience in both markets, I am glad that Spiking now offers a solution that allows traditional investors to participate seamlessly in the emerging crypto markets. We think that this solution will disrupt the industry in a big way and this is a key reason why we chose to participate.”\nThe Spiking Edge\nSpiking connects traders with expert whales who have access to critical information and act upon it quickly, as has already been proven in the stock markets via its popular app. Spiking will give cryptocurrency investors added confidence and peace of mind knowing that their trades will mirror those made by the best crypto investors in the world.\nClemen Chiang, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Spiking Said:\n“We are thrilled that J Capital and Excavo have joined forces with Spiking, as we continue building a game-changing platform that makes successful cryptocurrency investing easier for everyone,”\nHe Adds:\n“We look forward to working with both teams to execute our vision of transforming and simplifying cryptocurrency investing for millions of people around the globe. Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price volatility. It can be incredibly difficult—if not altogether impossible—for average traders to time the market correctly and make the right buying and selling decisions. Spiking allows traders to make better trading decisions by reducing the information asymmetry of the market.”\nEugene Loza of Excavo Stated:\n“As an experienced crypto influencer with proven trades in the market, I find Spiking the ideal platform to influence a new generation of crypto traders who can trade alongside me.”\nSpiking — which aims to put “1,000 whales in your wallet” — plans to sell tokens to the general public during the third quarter of 2018. The company is targeting to release the first commercial crypto version of its app during the second quarter of 2019.\nAndy Tian of GIFTO, said:\n“As a founder of tech and blockchain-based startups, I am confident of the market prospect and adoption of Spiking as a key solution to a problem in the market.”\nOuyang Yun of Asia Innovations Group, added:\n“For all the ventures that I have been involved in, team execution matters greatly for success. The ambitious aims of Spiking are matched by the energy and competencies of Clemen and his team.”\nFor the first time, a private sale portion of an ITO is being conducted directly on an exchange. Spiking will partner global blockchain fintech company QUOINE to launch its ITO private sale for a select group of QUOINE’S KYC-approved user base, on 6 June 2018.\nAbout Spiking\nLaunched in April 2016, Spiking is Singapore’s first financial-technology trading app dedicated to helping the average trader follow the reputable investors as they buy and sell shares on the stock market. To date, Spiking tracks over 170,000 significant shareholders across six stock exchanges in four countries: the United States (NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX), Singapore (SGX), Malaysia (BM), and Hong-Kong (HKEX).\nSpiking is supported by a strong technical team, with Dr William H. Nguyen, as Chief Blockchain Architect. William is also the Chief Crypto Architect of GIFTO, one of the fastest selling ICOs in Asia.\nThe Spiking app has support from Quest Ventures and National Research Foundation, Singapore Prime Minister’s Office, under the Interactive & Digital Media Strategic Research Programme’s i.JAM Reload initiative. In October 2016, Spiking was awarded a gold at the SiTF Awards 2016, for Best Innovative Start-up (Early Stage), by the Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation.\nThe app is available on the App Store and Google Play.

It has up to this point entered into partnerships with more than 100 banks, and counting. However, this has not reflected in the value of Ripple (XRP), mainly because it is highly correlated to bitcoin. A good percentage of ripple trading is done in bitcoin, which means that ripple has been dropping despite all the good news that have come its way in the last few months. Even Ripple CEO Brad recently made the same observation. He noted that,\n“There’s a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies.”\nHowever, this will change in the near future. That’s because more exchanges are pairing altcoins with fiat, and this will see in the correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies drop. For instance, Bittrex, one of the largest exchanges in the world, with over 3 million clients, announced that they are introducing fiat crypto trading for select client in the U.S. They intend to roll this out to all clients in the future. Binance too has announced the pairing of ripple (XRP) with Binance coin and true USD.\nThe biggest news pointing to the decoupling of ripple (XRP) from bitcoin (BTC) is the upcoming SBI virtual currency trading platform. This much awaited crypto exchange has only put ripple (XRP) on their webpage. There is no mention of any other cryptos. That’s an indicator that ripple will be the primary crypto that they will be listing, something that will give ripple (XRP) huge value outside of bitcoin.\nIt is clear that as altcoins decouple from bitcoin, ripple will be one of the biggest beneficiaries simply because it has a wider use case than any other blockchain project in the market. As Brad, the ripple CEO puts it, the market is still young and irrational. Over time, investors will pivot more towards projects that are fundamentally strong, and on this end, ripple is unrivalled. Going by the high levels of adoption that ripple has had up to this point, Brad is right! Ripple just recently announced a partnership with the largest bank in Kuwait. This follows similar deals in the UAE, and many more all across the world. These are deals that have pretty much cemented ripple as the crypto of the future.\nWith all these factors at play, it is clear that ripple (XRP) is about to blow up big time. A savvy investor would be looking to accumulate as much ripple as possible at current prices. This is a technology that is changing the finance industry as we know it. Its rate of adoption is making even people who have always hated ripple change their minds about it. Ripple is the future, and once it completely decouples from bitcoin, ripple (XRP) could easily hit a valuation of at least $10 in 2018.\nBinance by far is the easiest to sign up with, get verified, send funds to and exchange for XRP. Dont waste time, XRP is skyrocketing, sign up now.

Payment providers are known to discriminate against the industry, and cryptocurrencies offer the opportunity for indiscriminate payments. Sparks spoke about the industry and said that they have “if it ain’t totally broke, it doesn’t need fixing” attitude towards infrastructure of the industry in general. She also said:\n“….because of the taboo nature of the adult industry, many of the industry issues have a hard time getting heard by the rest of the world, so problems have been slowly piling up in the background over the years.”\nShe believes that the cryptocurrency industry is full of visionaries who will take notice of the problems and change it. She also said that no one in the adult industry will make the changes required and that she will be more vocal on the matter as time goes on.\nOn the free market ideas associated with cryptocurrencies, she said it was a modern and reliable way to exchange value. Individual power to make decisions that were previously not an option was also a point she mentioned.\nShe mentioned a few cryptocurrencies that she favoured. Her favourite cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin [BTC], SONM [SNM], Odyssey [OCN], Spankchain [SPANK], and Ark [ARK].\nShe spoke at length about her idea to release an instructional video series on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The twist is that she will be doing the tutorials naked. She also spoke up about her time as a camgirl, and how she received tips. She said:\n“I was tipped pretty often in cryptocurrency, mainly because the clients had crypto and wanted to actually use it.”\nShe further mentioned that she keeps her coins in deep cold storage as opposed to a wallet. The crypto-revolution is close at hand in the adult industry, she stated. With camgirls and production companies beginning to use the technology, the systems that exist in place today to prevent payment providers from discriminating against the industry will not exist. She said:\n“These are just common issues and aren’t even all that creative. This whole industry can be flipped around by cryptocurrency, for the betterment of it. Bottom line is, people love cash, but it’s becoming more and more inconvenient to carry it.”\nShe also mentioned that crypto takes the “best parts of cash and debit cards and removes the other junk.” She said:\n“Cryptocurrency is just the natural step forward when it comes to using money in a modern society and I am convinced that that majority of us will adapt to it.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pornstar brenna sparks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brenna sparks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sparks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T23:51:47.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd59813404f95df9bb32e4bf6266903cc790eb6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS._.DMHncE4nvaj8drqTF0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Will Bitcoin hit $1 million?", "title_full": "Will Bitcoin hit $1 million?", "published": "2018-06-02T23:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd59813404f95df9bb32e4bf6266903cc790eb6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS._.DMHncE4nvaj8drqTF0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "carriebee", "published": "2018-06-02T23:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will Bitcoin hit $1 million?", "text": "Quote: from: BUK2016 on June 01, 2018, 10:12:26 PM Well i don't think that Bitcoin market value will ever reach such height and i think with such speculation, Bitcoin is over value by who ever believe in such speculation.\nIt cannot hit $1m for bitcoin market in just 2 years, many predictions goes and existing it will true once it reach.

The Knezic Revolution\nHowever, a Swiss coder has proven all bitcoin pessimists wrong by developing a candy dispenser with BTC as its only accepted payment method. Sponsored Links\nOnce the small device gets information about incoming bitcoin transactions via blockchain.info, it will then dispense the exact number of candies for which have been paid. The Knezic candy dispenser is controlled through USB powered by Arduino Micro, which is a microcontroller developed by the Arduino open-source computer hardware and software project based in Italy. Just finished my Bitcoin-enabled candy dispenser đŹ pic.twitter.com/pU2xJdBIyx\nâ David KneziÄ (@davidknezic) May 27, 2018\nAlthough the device succeeded in fulfilling its primary objective of receiving bitcoin as payments for its candy, the fact remains that there is still more work to be done in the areas of transaction fees and transaction processing time.\nThe innovator acknowledged this fact, saying he only developed the system to demonstrate to the world how seamless it is to integrate bitcoin payments, and that he would transform his invention by developing another method that would be powered by the Bitcoin Lightning Network. A Game Changer?\nThe Lightning Network has been described by many as the savior of the Bitcoin network. The second-layer solution powered by Lightning Labs is expected to solve all challenges that are currently plaguing the pioneer cryptocurrency.\nIn March 2018, BTCManager reported that a Japan-based electricity provider, Chubu Electric Power Co., which is the countryâs third most significant power company, successfully trialed Lightning-powered payments for charging customersâ electric cars.\nâFor IoT and blockchain applications, real-time payments are needed. We showed that second layer payments can be the solution,â the senior manager at Chubu Electric Power Co., Hideshiro Ichikawa, declared.\nIn the same month, Lightning Labs announced the launch of a beta version of the Lightning Network Daemon (LND), a software that makes it easier for developers to access the second-layer protocol. âThis release is a step forward for the network itself. What I mean by that is: Before all the apps, we need to build a healthy network that has liquidity, reliability, high-uptime nodes, healthy channels, etc. We need to onboard an entire industry onto a new layer and build a healthy topology. This release kinda marks the âstartâ so to speak,â said Jack Mallers a blockchain developer creating an easy to use Lightning-powered bitcoin wallet.\nNotably, in February 2018, Laszlo Hanyecz, the man who bought two pizzas with 10,000 BTC in 2010, also used the Lightning network to pay for pizzas again in a bid to test the efficiency of the network.\nAt current, the Lightning Network is only being used by coders and tech-savvy people. However, there is no doubt that the groundbreaking solution will gain massive adoption as it becomes more user-friendly, putting a permanent end to all the bottlenecks in bitcoin transactions.

Current statistics show the BCH chain will halve its reward from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH on or around April 6, 2020, and with more than 80 percent of BCH now in circulation, when the next halving takes place the decentralized asset will be much harder to obtain.\nAlso read: Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Has Less Than Two Years Left Until the 2020 Reward Halving\nBitcoin Cash has great worth to a lot of digital asset proponents and the cryptocurrency has gained in value tremendously over the past nine months. One benefit that BCH advocates appreciate is the fact that the currency has digital scarcity. There will never be more than 21 million BCH in existence and right now there is a circulating supply of 17.1 million. More than 80 percent of BCH has been mined into existence since the end of April and the BCH hashrate has been around 3.5 to 4.5 exahash per second. At this speed alone, with just 13 mining pools, the next halving date will be on or around April 6, 2020 . After this date, BCH miners will lose half the current block reward (12.5 BCH) and receive 6.25 BCH and fees per block mined. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) protocol is set to halve its block reward on or around the year 2020 depending on hashrate speed.\nMany cryptocurrency enthusiasts appreciate the fact that BCH will grow gradually harder to obtain over time due to Satoshi Nakamoto’s built-in supply limit, which introduced a different kind of ‘digital scarcity’ — one that’s backed by the Bitcoin Cash hashrate. This day in age, with computer files like MP3s or JPEGs, we typically think about these digital items differently because they are easily duplicated. The decentralized currency BCH cannot be duplicated so easily, as it’s re-enforced by 3.5 to 4.5 exahash of power validating all the ledger transactions. The system keeps miners sincere because they are economically incentivized to stay honest, unlike traditional systems and public officials trusted today. As time goes by and the mining hashrate continues to increase, the BCH network becomes much more expensive to besiege by making a 51% or double spend attack harder every passing day. No More Quantitative Easing or Bailouts\nDigital scarcity makes Bitcoin Cash far more valuable than the fiat notes printed by governments and central banks because the code does not allow for mass fiat printing and quantitative easing. The U.S. dollar, for example, has been devalued considerably over time making it lose purchasing power year after year. Extreme USD printing began after the adoption of the Bretton Woods system, throughout the eighties and nineties and then with the bailed-out banks who received billions of printed dollars after the 2008 ‘economic crisis.’ Bitcoin Cash will always be finite and allow users to conserve or spend, because their ownership is defined by a protocol that continues to strengthen its security daily. There is no monetary system out there that allows for true transferable digital value like Satoshi Nakamoto’s clever invention. Satoshi put a cap on the supply for a reason and this can be seen in the genesis block’s famous text.\nAfter April 6, 2020, in another four years or less the reward will again halve, and continue to halve until the last coins are found on or around the year 2140. Halvings in the past have shown consistent price rises following these events, which confirms proponents appreciate the genius of Nakamoto’s digital scarcity. Sending people a nice fraction of BCH is cool, but people will also admire how scarce the decentralized asset is unlike the devalued fiat currencies in their wallet.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash halving that takes place every four years?

On May 31, 2018, the firm announced the launching of an in-game rewards system called CryptoChips.\nAbout CryptoChips GMO announced the crypto gaming rewards system via a press release on the company's website. In recent times, GMO has expanded from an Internet company, into a significant player in the domestic cryptocurrency scene in Japan.\nAccording to GMO, CryptoChips is an application that enables players to earn rewards while playing games. These rewards can be obtained by achieving specific milestones in these games and, more importantly, CryptoChips will be launched with bitcoin support. GMO also said that the bitcoin-based in-game rewards system would first be installed its own real-time territorial battle strategy game, \" Whimsical War .\"\nStarting from August 2018, players of the game will receive rewards in bitcoin based on their rankings in the game.\nWhimsical War\n( Source : GMO )\nAccording to the press release:\n\"CryptoChips can be mounted on the game application and allows players to receive cryptocurrency as remuneration within the game – like \"secret pocket money\" – depending on the players' rankings or when players have achieved missions or acquired items. The players must have their wallets (cryptocurrency accounts) to receive the remuneration (cryptocurrencies).\"\nPart of the company's goal is to improve people's familiarity and understanding of the nascent cryptocurrency market. GMO plans to use the famous gaming industry as a veritable platform for educating people on cryptocurrencies. Whimsical War is available for download on the iOS and Android .\nGMO Internet and the Bitcoin Market From large-scale mining to wallet services , GMO has been making significant inroads in the cryptosphere. In September 2017, the company announced its decision to embark on bitcoin mining with an initial investment of $3 million. By December 2017, there were reports that the company had officially initiated its bitcoin mining enterprise in Northern Europe. The choice of Northern Europe was to cut cost based on the availability of cheap electricity and the cold climatic conditions.\nGMO uses cutting-edge 7nm chips to power its mining operations. In addition to its location-based mining endeavors, GMO also announced that it planned to offer cloud mining services as well as build a series of \"next generation mining boards.\"\nIn March 2018, BTCManager reported that GMO had already raked in bitcoin mining revenues exceeding $3 million. In only three months, the company had mined 240 bitcoin (BTC) and 525 Bitcoin Cash (BCH). By May 2018, GMO had reportedly mined over 900 BTC and 537 BCH respectively.\nThe company made significant efforts to enhance its hashrate to improve its mining efficiency. As part of its efforts, the company also declared its intention to contribute resources into R&D for more sophisticated mining chips. The company also pays a percentage of its staff salaries in bitcoin.\nThe post GMO Launches \"CryptoChips,\" A Bitcoin-Based Gaming Rewards System appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "gmo internet inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T22:40:24.069+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2af4b421d211f5c3ba06b7cd4d89e882055885aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRvB.Xo7TA4LstsAiuXQnxaDHiFmUVSkCnzD5_z9sqkpknb5Ol6CwLv4CGIcLQBHFBh3WB3eoyMbWtmVft.K4.naTmxY1_i_co-", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/advfn/Xrhn", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "BB's Stock Haven", "title": "JayDamien: $BYSD BAYSIDE BITCOIN .0005!

Symmetrical Triangle A symmetrical triangle is a chart formation where the slope of the price’s highs and the slope of the price’s lows converge together to a point where it looks like a triangle. What’s happening during this formation is that the market is making lower highs and higher lows. This means that neither the buyers nor the sellers are pushing the price far enough to make a clear trend. If this were a battle between the buyers and sellers, then this would be a draw. This is also a type of consolidation As these two slopes get closer to each other, it means that a breakout is getting near.

Current statistics show the BCH chain will halve its reward from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH on or around April 6, 2020, and with more than 80 percent of BCH now in circulation, when the next halving takes place the decentralized asset will be much harder to obtain.\nAlso read: Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Has Less Than Two Years Left Until the 2020 Reward Halving\nBitcoin Cash has great worth to a lot of digital asset proponents and the cryptocurrency has gained in value tremendously over the past nine months. One benefit that BCH advocates appreciate is the fact that the currency has digital scarcity. There will never be more than 21 million BCH in existence and right now there is a circulating supply of 17.1 million. More than 80 percent of BCH has been mined into existence since the end of April and the BCH hashrate has been around 3.5 to 4.5 exahash per second. At this speed alone, with just 13 mining pools, the next halving date will be on or around April 6, 2020 . After this date, BCH miners will lose half the current block reward (12.5 BCH) and receive 6.25 BCH and fees per block mined. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) protocol is set to halve its block reward on or around the year 2020 depending on hashrate speed.\nMany cryptocurrency enthusiasts appreciate the fact that BCH will grow gradually harder to obtain over time due to Satoshi Nakamoto’s built-in supply limit, which introduced a different kind of ‘digital scarcity’ — one that’s backed by the Bitcoin Cash hashrate. This day in age, with computer files like MP3s or JPEGs, we typically think about these digital items differently because they are easily duplicated. The decentralized currency BCH cannot be duplicated so easily, as it’s re-enforced by 3.5 to 4.5 exahash of power validating all the ledger transactions. The system keeps miners sincere because they are economically incentivized to stay honest, unlike traditional systems and public officials trusted today. As time goes by and the mining hashrate continues to increase, the BCH network becomes much more expensive to besiege by making a 51% or double spend attack harder every passing day. No More Quantitative Easing or Bailouts\nDigital scarcity makes Bitcoin Cash far more valuable than the fiat notes printed by governments and central banks because the code does not allow for mass fiat printing and quantitative easing. The U.S. dollar, for example, has been devalued considerably over time making it lose purchasing power year after year. Extreme USD printing began after the adoption of the Bretton Woods system, throughout the eighties and nineties and then with the bailed-out banks who received billions of printed dollars after the 2008 ‘economic crisis.’ Bitcoin Cash will always be finite and allow users to conserve or spend, because their ownership is defined by a protocol that continues to strengthen its security daily. There is no monetary system out there that allows for true transferable digital value like Satoshi Nakamoto’s clever invention. Satoshi put a cap on the supply for a reason and this can be seen in the genesis block’s famous text.\nAfter April 6, 2020, in another four years or less the reward will again halve, and continue to halve until the last coins are found on or around the year 2140. Halvings in the past have shown consistent price rises following these events, which confirms proponents appreciate the genius of Nakamoto’s digital scarcity. Sending people a nice fraction of BCH is cool, but people will also admire how scarce the decentralized asset is unlike the devalued fiat currencies in their wallet.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash halving that takes place every four years? Let us know your thoughts on the subject of digital scarcity in the comments below.\nImages via Shutterstock, Fork.lol, and the UK Times 2009.

Maybe this happens all inside the exchange's system? – ntonnelier Dec 23 '17 at 14:15 If someone sells 1 btc to the exchange, the exchange notices: \"This bitcoin is now our bitcoin!\" and they save that information in their database. And if you buy that bitcoin, the only thing that happens then is: They edit the database-entry to \"This bitcoin is ntonnelier's bitcoin\", so that you are allowed to send it to your own adress.

Current statistics show the BCH chain will halve its reward from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH on or around April 6, 2020, and with more than 80 percent of BCH now in circulation, when the next halving takes place the decentralized asset will be much harder to obtain.\nAlso read: Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Has Less Than Two Years Left Until the 2020 Reward Halving\nBitcoin Cash has great worth to a lot of digital asset proponents and the cryptocurrency has gained in value tremendously over the past nine months. One benefit that BCH advocates appreciate is the fact that the currency has digital scarcity. There will never be more than 21 million BCH in existence and right now there is a circulating supply of 17.1 million. More than 80 percent of BCH has been mined into existence since the end of April and the BCH hashrate has been around 3.5 to 4.5 exahash per second. At this speed alone, with just 13 mining pools, the next halving date will be on or around April 6, 2020 . After this date, BCH miners will lose half the current block reward (12.5 BCH) and receive 6.25 BCH and fees per block mined. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) protocol is set to halve its block reward on or around the year 2020 depending on hashrate speed.\nMany cryptocurrency enthusiasts appreciate the fact that BCH will grow gradually harder to obtain over time due to Satoshi Nakamoto’s built-in supply limit, which introduced a different kind of ‘digital scarcity’— one that’s backed by the Bitcoin Cash hashrate. This day in age, with computer files like MP3s or JPEGs, we typically think about these digital items differently because they are easily duplicated. The decentralized currency BCH cannot be duplicated so easily, as it’s re-enforced by 3.5 to 4.5 exahash of power validating all the ledger transactions. The system keeps miners sincere because they are economically incentivized to stay honest, unlike traditional systems and public officials trusted today. As time goes by and the mining hashrate continues to increase, the BCH network becomes much more expensive to besiege by making a 51% or double spend attack harder every passing day. No More Quantitative Easing or Bailouts\nDigital scarcity makes Bitcoin Cash far more valuable than the fiat notes printed by governments and central banks because the code does not allow for mass fiat printing and quantitative easing. The U.S. dollar, for example, has been devalued considerably over time making it lose purchasing power year after year. Extreme USD printing began after the adoption of the Bretton Woods system, throughout the eighties and nineties and then with the bailed-out banks who received billions of printed dollars after the 2008 ‘economic crisis.’ Bitcoin Cash will always be finite and allow users to conserve or spend, because their ownership is defined by a protocol that continues to strengthen its security daily. There is no monetary system out there that allows for true transferable digital value like Satoshi Nakamoto’s clever invention. Satoshi put a cap on the supply for a reason and this can be seen in the genesis block’s famous text.\nAfter April 6, 2020, in another four years or less the reward will again halve, and continue to halve until the last coins are found on or around the year 2140. Halvings in the past have shown consistent price rises following these events, which confirms proponents appreciate the genius of Nakamoto’s digital scarcity. Sending people a nice fraction of BCH is cool, but people will also admire how scarce the decentralized asset is unlike the devalued fiat currencies in their wallet.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash halving that takes place every four years?

It announced that it has started a new website which is the “home of all things Bitcoin Cash”.\nThe Bitcoin Cash Fund [BCF] is a non-profit organization that uses any funds donated to promote projects which hasten the adoption of Bitcoin Cash [BCH]. Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency born from Bitcoin in a hard fork in August 2017. Website’s Interface\nWhat does the portal do?\nThe website, bitcoincashers.org, is a portal that will educate the masses on what cryptocurrencies are, how it works and how to buy, sell, and trade with these digital assets. It briefly explains what Bitcoin is and talks about Bitcoin being a peer-to-peer, decentralized electronic cash.\nThe site jumps ahead, claiming that the best way to learn about Bitcoin Cash is to use it. It informs the user how to download a wallet and tells them to play with the coins. The website assures the user that once they’ve sent a few bits back and forth, they will understand how easy the wallet is to operate and will “be hooked”.\nHow they promote the adoption of Bitcoin Cash\nThe website informs merchants of the advantage of adopting BCH, citing low transaction fees, no chargeback and a growing, thriving community of BCH users as incentives for merchants. They have written out guides for online merchants as well as brick-and-mortar merchants.\nThese guides talk about platforms like Coinbase Commerce for online businesses. They also give instructions to merchants on using wallets to accept payment from customers, when operating face-to-face.\nHere are some of the trustworthy exchanges they recommend for buying Bitcoin Cash. They also warn how your wallet’s security is solely handled by the user. Website’s recommended Exchanges\nThomasZander said on Reddit,\n” And I’ll abuse this place to comment on how this is a beautiful site. Great graphics, good colors. Top of the line! “\nSome more members of the BCH community seemed thrilled to see this site go up. They want the site to really start focusing on increasing adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nHere is a speculative post by user singularity87 on Reddit. The topics this user promises will soon be up and running, and will help people understand Bitcoin Cash better. The post says: Page that explains the difference between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash, and why there was a split. A project gallery of all current BCH projects (with the ability to tip them). Lots of guides how to get set up with various wallets and exchanges. Investing in Bitcoin Cash. Getting involved in mining Bitcoin Cash. How to get involved with Bitcoin Cash development.
