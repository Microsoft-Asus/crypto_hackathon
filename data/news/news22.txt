Witness the number of big companies that have started talking about Bitcoin, ICOs, and all things crypto. But now there seems to be a term buzzing even louder than Bitcoin: Fortnite .\nCorporate executives discussing their financial performance on their quarterly earnings calls used “ Fortnite ” a total of 54 times during the past earnings season, according to an analysis by business news site MarketWatch of transcripts collected by FactSet. That topped the 45 times executives mentioned “Bitcoin” or other cryptocurrencies in those calls.\nFortnite is a multiplayer action shooter game from Epic Games that has become wildly popular this year. The game has 14 million monthly active users around the world and, since launching on iOS in March, has often been the top-grossing game in Apple’s App Store.\nSome sports teams have grown worried their star players are growing addicted to it. Many parents are feeling the same way. But the game is not only promising to bring new gamers into the market, it’s helping to mainstream streaming-video services like Amazon’s Twitch .\nSome of the executive comments came from Epic Games’ rivals, who generally spun Fortnite’s success as an overall plus for the industry. “If you look back over the 20 or 30 years, the innovation that one game team has done has been going through the whole industry,” said Electronic Arts chief financial officer Blake Jorgenson. “It’s fantastic, and we welcome innovators like Fortnite .”\nOthers discussed the game’s impact on their families. “My son who is eight years-old loves playing that game. I played with him over the weekend,” said Snap chief strategy officer Imran Khan, assuring an analyst that Fortnite fans weren’t using Snap less. Owen Mahoney, CEO of game maker Nexof, made a similar admission : “I played Fortnite last weekend with my 14-year-old and 5 of his buddies from school.”\nCompanies in other industries are seeing a benefit from Fortnite’s popularity. Logitech said demand from new gamers is boosting demand for its gaming hardware.

The best way to fund and receive payouts is through a cryptocurrency wallet using bitcoin or another crytpocurrency, though most books allow wagering on one's credit card or through cash transfer. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so.\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL WISCONSIN WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nHome to the Packers and Badgers, Wisconsin will likely rake in the cash once it sets up a sports betting framework. That won't happen in time for the World Cup, or even the next Super Bowl for that matter.\n\"Sports gaming is prohibited by the Wisconsin Constitution, state law and is not allowed under the state-tribal compacts,\" Steven Michels, state Department of Administration spokesperson, proclaimed after the court ruling.\nIf it happens, sports betting would likely be run by the Tribes. Each of Wisconsin's 11 tribes operates at least one casino. In-fighting among the Tribes and state government is a very real possibility however.\nNeedless-to-say, Wisconsin gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steven michels", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa world cup online from wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "packers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa world cup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "badgers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:54:17.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e175863b74a0b4ce0bb565634e0d7afa459a6ab1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkL4y6E4AuwlHqLaammc3Z5_Nwd3BdftOTpoYhIOnmgnrF0uVCgs0VcczyaYsUGviUp7t5Rt6g9orXj7dazmMGDw--", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "Crypto Inches Up, as Bitcoin Rallies Past $7,500", "title_full": "Crypto Inches Up, as Bitcoin Rallies Past $7,500", "published": "2018-06-06T23:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2ffaFM1qfkx_1FX5D5ppBQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/investing_com_631/3cd453d8742592a2c51b4045f779e238", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e175863b74a0b4ce0bb565634e0d7afa459a6ab1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkL4y6E4AuwlHqLaammc3Z5_Nwd3BdftOTpoYhIOnmgnrF0uVCgs0VcczyaYsUGviUp7t5Rt6g9orXj7dazmMGDw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investing.com", "published": "2018-06-06T23:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto Inches Up, as Bitcoin Rallies Past $7,500", "text": "Bitcoin rallied on Wednesday.

The cryptocurrency was on the defensive yesterday, courtesy of a failed breakout and a rising-wedge breakdown and looked set to re-test the recent low of $7,040.\nHowever, sellers ran out of steam at $7,372, as indicated by a doji candle and prices moved back above $7,600 in the Asian session today.\nWhile the exact reason behind the bear exhaustion is unclear, it fits with a recently observed pattern that bitcoin changes direction in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month.\nThe cryptocurrency is down more than 30 percent from the recent high of $9,990, meaning the bulls are on the back foot. So bitcoin could turn higher today, as indicated by the historical pattern.\nFurthermore, the fear of getting trapped on the wrong side of the market may have forced the bears to stay on the sidelines, despite the false breakout and rising-wedge breakdown.\nThat said, the cryptocurrency is still treading waters in the bearish territory, as seen in the chart below. 4-hour chart\nThe bearish rising-wedge breakdown remains valid as long as bitcoin keeps trading below $7,780 (June 3 high). So, the downside is still in play and the sell-off could accelerate if the support at $7,372 is breached.\nHowever, the 50-candle moving average (MA) has started rising in favor of the bulls and the 100-candle MA has flatlined (shed bearish bias), so the odds of a break below $7,372 are low. View A high volume break above $7,780 would add credence to the quirky “6th of the month” pattern and signal a bullish trend reversal. In this case, prices will likely rise to the 10-week MA, currently located at $8,310. A break below $7,372 would put the focus back on the rising-wedge breakdown and allow a drop to $7,040.\nHourglass image via Shutterstock\nPricesBitcoinMarkets ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin bulls", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T23:25:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d17a258f111955947647b5f8631b874c20dd0425", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQutO.ducIV65.nJkBU4G9Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will bitcoin go under regulation", "title_full": "Will bitcoin go under regulation", "published": "2018-06-06T23:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.097, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d17a258f111955947647b5f8631b874c20dd0425", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQutO.ducIV65.nJkBU4G9Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "yusupjatigumilar", "published": "2018-06-06T23:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin go under regulation", "text": "No, I do not think the government can completely stop the use of bitcoin, because it is global and not only used by one country alone, perhaps if the governments of the whole world can cooperate and form an institution that regulates it may be possible", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:30:44.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b89ef5d957d5d9c805dd665eeb9942c6cb4ec33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEugm.fyyuPtlAIQ0cUOO8tzvjsn4vgntYFiKyrNclvTZOWDGAb07kWhNvMbQcNcSCyeHjlxjsjAJXOCxZNDYinBsxBppyrrprscDW3pBXBAfg--", "site_full": "okchances.com", "site": "okchances.com", "site_section": "http://okchances.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Okchances", "title": "VanEck, SolidX Join Forces in New Bid to Launch Bitcoin ETF", "title_full": "VanEck, SolidX Join Forces in New Bid to Launch Bitcoin ETF", "published": "2018-06-06T23:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://okchances.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2017/09/1_69442.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b89ef5d957d5d9c805dd665eeb9942c6cb4ec33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEugm.fyyuPtlAIQ0cUOO8tzvjsn4vgntYFiKyrNclvTZOWDGAb07kWhNvMbQcNcSCyeHjlxjsjAJXOCxZNDYinBsxBppyrrprscDW3pBXBAfg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T23:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "VanEck, SolidX Join Forces in New Bid to Launch Bitcoin ETF", "text": "7 hours ago English , News Leave a comment 27 Views\nInvestment firm VanEck has partnered with financial services company SolidX in their latest attempt to launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\nThe companies announced Wednesday that they would list a “physically-backed bitcoin ETF that will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin.”\nUnder the arrangement, VanEck will market the ETF, while SolidX will act as sponsor, according to a press release. The companies noted that both have previously filed individually to list bitcoin ETFs on various stock exchanges.\nVanEck chief executive Jan van Eck said bitcoin is “a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios.”\nThe CEO noted that the ETF has not yet been created, saying “We’re pleased to join with [SolidX] in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.” When asked by CoinDesk, he declined to provide details on what assets would be used to back the fund.\nNeither SolidX nor VanEck has succeeded in launching a bitcoin ETF to date. As previously reported by CoinDesk, both companies withdrew previous attempts at launching the products at the request of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nVan Eck expressed optimism about the fund’s potential, despite the regulatory obstacles they have faced, saying:\n“We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\nIf approved by regulators, the new ETF would be listed on the CBOE BZX Equities Exchange, according to the release.\nMarkets image via

exchange Binance, has hit an all-time high against bitcoin.\nBNB achieved the new milestone of 0.002287 BTC at 10:45 UTC Wednesday, and was last seen changing hands at 0.0022 BTC on Binance, up 8 percent since yesterday.\nThe sharp rally pushed BNB’s market capitalization to a five-month high above $1.9 billion, making it the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\nFurther, the rally is backed by a 155 percent rise in trading volume over the last 48 hours, so the stellar gains look sustainable.\nMeanwhile, the binance coin-U.S. dollar (BNB/USD) exchange rate hit a 5.5-month high of $17.60 on Binance and was trading at $16.74 at press time – up 15 percent in the last 24 hours.\nA detailed look at the individual markets reveals that the BNB/BTC and binance coin-tether (BNB/USDT) pairs account for more than 85 percent of the total BNB trading volume ($0.148 billion) seen in the last 24 hours.\nBalloon image via Shutterstock\nPricesMarketsbinance coin ",

The exchange-traded product, called VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Shares, will be insured against theft, fraud and loss of access to the currency, according to the filing, which is subject to a review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe companies said they intend to buy and sell bitcoin in informally organized “over-the counter” bitcoin markets to cap transaction costs, while trading large blocks of the cryptocurrency. Van Eck, which had $46 billion in assets under management, and several other fund managers had previously pushed for exchange-traded funds based on bitcoin futures instead of directly investing in the cryptocurrency.\nThis was to address concerns that bitcoin exchanges were not regulated by traditional financial market overseers, unlike the futures market. The SEC has either denied or tabled all bitcoin ETF proposals received so far, joining a long list of regulators that have taken a tough stance against products and securities related to digital currencies.\nVan Eck and SolidX hope to list the product on the Cboe exchange under the symbol “XBTC”.

Flexible Enough For Widespread Adoption Advertisement Get exclusive analysis and cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nKristo Kaarmann, co-founder and CEO of TransferWise , a global money transfer service, has stated that cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently flexible for widespread adoption.\nKaarmann shared his views on cryptocurrency with Arjun Kharpal of CNBC during the Money 2020 conference in Amsterdam, adding that it would be exciting if people eventually use cryptocurrencies to buy everyday goods.\nThe last currency TransferWise launched its service for was the Egyptian pound, Kaarmann said, adding that there are more things one can do with an Egyptian pound than some cryptocurrencies.\nWhile the financial services industry and investors have cited cryptocurrencies’ potential for global use, there have been problems with exchanges, volatility and a connection to illegal activities that have undermined cryptocurrencies’ value. TransferWise Teams With French Bank\nDuring the conference, TransferWise announced it has partnered with BPCE, a French banking group, to provide its transfer service to the banking group’s customers.\nThe transfer service will integrate with the banking group’s apps in 2019. BPCE will be the world’s biggest bank with transparent pricing, as well as France’s cheapest bank for sending funds abroad. Nearly 3 million users send 2 billion euros monthly using TransferWise. The company in 2017 reported its first full-year operating profit and expects to do the same in 2018.\nAlso read: TransferWise CEO thinks talking down on bitcoin is a good business strategy Focus On Transfer Service\nTransferWise is valued at above $1 billion, but the company has no intention to list on the stock market or seek a banking license, Kaarmann said. Kaarmann did not wish to expand on either topic, but he noted that the company will continue to work to make money “borderless.”\nTaavet Hinrikus, also a TransferWise co-founder and CEO, said in 2016 that bitcoin was dead and that no one was using it. He said that bitcoin was a gold rush – people bought it hoping to be able to sell it at a profit. Hinrikus said he thought blockchain had potential but wasn’t certain at the time what the technology could be used for.\nFeatured image from Flickr/ Web Summit .

I think one needs to buy chips with bitcoin. Just like you would buy chips with fiat - same with crypto. Or they can have a internal exchange system for buying crypto with fiat the same place as well. It can dispense chips for crypto.\nQuote: And what about our winnings? they will pay Bitcoin or they will pay cash? i visited a couple of casinos but they accept only cash i don't have experience with this kind of casinos.

A quick glance at his Twitter account also shows him to be a Bitcoin Cash evangelist.\nThat’s right, he’s all about what Bitcoin Cash supporters (and practically no one else — even Amazon’s Alexa has dunked on Bitcoin Cash ) insist is the “real bitcoin.”\nYou may have caught video of the chase on social media. It was quite a thing to behold. This is INSANE! Someone has hijacked a “Tank-like” vehicle from Fort Pickett and just drove it by our apartment! This is on Broad Street in the Fan. pic.twitter.com/EYfhFux1dk\n— Parker Slaybaugh (@ParkerSlay89) June 6, 2018\nAccording to the Associated Press , the man accused of stealing the vehicle from the National Guard base at Fort Pickett in Blackstone is none other than the 29-year-old Joshua Philip Yabut. The AP also reports that Yabut was tweeting before the incident.\n“tryna explain to my gf why i support bitcoin cash (the holiest chain)”\n“Hours before the vehicle drove off the base, an account confirmed by the Guard as Yabut’s tweeted a Wikipedia entry about the M113 armored personnel carrier, which is similar to the M577 vehicle police chased, and a screenshot of a map around the area where the vehicle eventually stopped,” notes the AP report. “He wrote a series of odd tweets Tuesday, including: ‘where is this damn water buffalo’ 'all i wanna do is get an anime wife’ and 'wow I think I just discovered a large illegal spy operation in the us government.’”\nLet’s take a look at what appears to be his Twitter account.\nAnd just so you know we’re not trying to pin these hijinks on an innocent BCH fan, here are a bunch of the tweets the AP says were confirmed by the National Guard to have come from his account. all i wanna do is get an anime wife\n— Joshua [BCH] (@movrcx) June 5, 2018 where is this damn water buffalo\n— Joshua [BCH] (@movrcx) June 5, 2018\nA quick glance through the account shows that Yabut had more on his mind than anime wives. Specifically, that aforementioned sweet sweet Bitcoin Cash. tryna explain to my gf why i support bitcoin cash (the holiest chain)\n— Joshua [BCH] (@movrcx) December 15, 2017 i will send you one bitcoin cash if you get a tattoo of craig wright on your tricep\n— Joshua [BCH] (@movrcx) December 28, 2017 Once Bitcoin Core gets rekt they’ll beg for a merge of the two chains.\n— Joshua [BCH] (@movrcx) January 18, 2018\nAnd this wasn’t just some passing fancy. While a lot of his Bitcoin Cash-specific tweets were from late 2017, he still has “BCH”— the abbreviation for Bitcoin Cash — in his Twitter name.\nThankfully, no one was reported injured in the roughly two-hour chase, and Yabut was safely taken into custody.\nHis legal fate, however, remains unclear — much like the long-term prospects for his beloved BCH. from Social Media News and Web Tips

Now richest bankers and the whole dynasties take the lead in this crypto expansion. Cryptocurrency, like most (if not all) disrupting technologies, has caused quite a lot of hype dividing the whole world into two camps: “anti-cryptos” from the one side, and its followers from the other. However, as technology evolves, people are changing parties — some lose faith in cryptos, while most come to realizing of attractiveness of this truly innovative paradigm. We, as may all cryptocurrency enthusiasts, are pleased to notice that the latter group takes abroad ever increasing number of big businesses, now welcoming most affluent and the richest ones. 1. Jamie Dimon (JP Morgan Chase CEO) He is a billionaire banker who, on multiple occasions, has been included in the list of Top-100 World’s Influential People according to Time Magazine. Since 2006, Jamie Dimon has been managing JP Morgan Chase , which is among the world’s largest banks. Being one of America’s oldest banks, today its assets amount to 2,789 trillion dollars. Jamie Dimon is known to be a longtime opponent of bitcoin. Back in 2014, he stated that bitcoin was a “terrible store of value”. In September 2017 the banker said: “Bitcoin will eventually blow up. It’s a fraud. It’s worse than tulip bulbs and will not end well.” Dimon believe that bitcoin “is not a real thing, eventually, it will be closed.” He also added that he would fire any trader selling bitcoins because “…it’s against our rules and they are stupid.” It is likely Dimon was not that familiar with the topic, since later in January 2018, he abandoned his previous statements. “I regret making that comment”, he said; “The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO’s you have to look at individually.” On April 20th, JP Morgan, together with other major banks (including Goldman Sachs) conducted a test transaction through the Quorum blockchain-platform developed within the bank. In early May information came to light that JP Morgan had applied for a patent. Interestingly enough, the patent was originally issued in October although it wasn’t until May 3rd that the statement was made public by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The application describes a system that utilizes distributed data books, such as blockchain, for tracking payments sent between various financial institutions. On May 17th, 2018 JP Morgan made it clear that it was indeed serious about cryptocurrencies. A London fintech specialist, Oliver Harris, was invited by the bank to develop their cryptocurrency strategy. Today, Oliver is responsible for design and implementation of the blockchain as well as creating new cryptocurrency projects within the bank. 2. Goldman Sachs Group One of the world’s largest investment banks, a financial conglomerate. The scope of Goldman Sachs covers investment banking, securities trading, capital management, as well as many other financial services. The bank was founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman and Samuel Sachs. At the beginning of the 20th century, Goldman Sachs was the most important player in the newly formed IPO market. Being one of the most technologically advanced Wall Street banks today, Goldman Sachs is striving to demonstrate its supremacy in the field of cryptocurrency. On February 26th, the fintech company Circle Internet Financial Ltd., (the owner of Goldman Sachs Group), announced the acquisition of the large cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex. May 2nd the bank announced that it would use its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts on behalf of customers. May 15th it became known that Circle is developing a “US dollar” stablecoin which would be regulated and backed by a real government currency. A week later Circle launched a new option in its crypto investment application Circle Invest that was meant to facilitate the emergence of “newcomers” into the market. 3. George Soros (Soros Fund Management) A world-renowned billionaire, financier, and speculator who is believed to have earned more than one billion dollars on the drop of the pound sterling in just a day (“black Wednesday”, September 16, 1992). His hedge fund Soros Fund Management was founded in 1969, and in 2011 it was converted into a family office which currently manages $26 billion. At the World Economic Forum, which was held on January 23rd — 26th in Davos, George Soros criticized Bitcoin, calling it a “typical bubble”. He then said that the cryptocurrency is used by dictators “to build a nest egg abroad”. “Bitcoin is not a currency because a currency is supposed to be a stable store of value and the currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can’t be used, for instance, to pay wages because wages drop by 25% in a day”, George Soros added. A few months later, on April 6th, it became known that Soros Fund Management intends to trade in cryptocurrencies. Adam Fisher, a macro investing specialist at New York-based Soros Fund Management, received internal approval. 4. The Rockefellers (Venrock) These are one of the world’s richest and most influential families. The amount of their wealth is yet to be publicized. In 1870, John Rockefeller, together with his brother William Rockefeller and some other partners, founded the oil company Standard Oil, which eventually became the largest US oil monopoly. As the demand for kerosene and gasoline increased rapidly, so did the Rockefeller’s wealth, making John Rockefeller history’s first dollar billionaire. Accounting for inflation levels, his current capital would have amounted to $400 billion. Laurance Rockefeller, one of John Rockefeller’s grandchildren, together with his relatives, founded Rockefeller Brothers Inc. in 1946. In 1969 it became known as Venrock. Venrock invested in enterprises based on science and technology. Focusing on “startups” in the IT field, Venrock invested in Intel and Apple in the first investment rounds. Today the Venrock Venture Company , founded by the Rockefellers, is also interested in investing in cryptocurrencies. On April 6th, 2018 it became known that Venrock entered into a partnership agreement with CoinFund to support the blockchain startups. “We wanted to partner with this team”, said David Pakman, a partner at Venrock. He added that Venrock is more interested in a long-term investment in blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency industry. 5. Rothschilds (Rothschild & Co) Rothschilds are a European banker dynasty that is even more influential than Rockefellers. The founder of the dynasty, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, sent five of his sons to the major financial European capitals: Paris, London, Vienna, Naples, Frankfurt am Main, where they were expected to build family businesses. It is believed that the wealth of the Rothschilds is evenly distributed among all members of the family. Since it has never been made public, this may explain why the Rothschilds do not officially make it onto any of the world’s richest people ratings. In early April there were rumors among large investors that the Rothschilds are developing a series of experimental cryptocurrency projects. So far, no details have been made available. However, the name of one of the projects, IMMO, has emerged in some online discussions. Coinspeaker has speculated about what IMMO really is. According to the article, the Rothschilds, who have preserved family wealth for centuries, have probably created IMMO for general accounting and transfer of inheritance of family assets. There is speculation as to whether or not the Rothschilds, acting as an issuer, have created IMMO as a reserve currency, the exchange rate of which is not subject to sharp fluctuations. An interesting reference has been made to the 1988 issue of The Economist (owned by the Rothschilds) which predicted the appearance of a world currency in 2018. However, according to Vitalik Buterin , nowadays the Rothschilds do not have enough influence: “these days they seem to just be a few hundred or thousand people born into various old-money-type high society positions.” “If old-money-type high society people want to make their own currencies, go ahead, more power to them; see you in the moderately-free market”, Buterin added. Are “the Rothschilds” actually remotely as powerful and coordinated as the conspiracy theorists seem to believe, or are they just a group of old-money socialites and all that other stuff is overhyped? Help me learn and decide! https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8m3wj1/rothschilds_in_crypto_goodbadneutral/dzl5515 … 2:09 AM — May 27, 2018 The Rothschilds’s behavior can now be well described by the words of Frederick Morton, the biographer of the Rothschilds: “Today the family grooms the inaudibility and invisibility of its presence as a result, some believe that little is left apart from a great legend.” Therefore, it is likely, we won’t be hearing much about IMMO in the near future. Nevertheless, we must be prepared for any information made available by the Rothschilds, which as it happened in April with George Soros and Venrock, similarly could serve as the beginning for a new bitcoin “bull rally”.

Two Sigma is known for its strategy of trading based on algorithms and artificial intelligence. And unlike many other hedge funds, the firm’s staff is chock full of Ph.Ds. Siegel himself holds a PhD in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nAnd the strategy has paid off for Siegel. Siegel has regularly been featured among t he top hedge fund earners on an annual basis.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies has made others wealthy. Over the last 12 months, the value of all cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, has swelled to roughly $350 billion. While that’s a far cry from its $816 billion peak in January, the value is still roughly three times its $101 billion value a year earlier.\nBut Siegel thinks this influx of investments in cryptocurrencies--which he thinks would be better defined as crypto assets--are a symptom of a larger problem: Investors storing their money, rather than putting it to work in innovative projects.\n“You already see certain kinds of assets inflating in price,” he said pointing to real estate markets and cryptocurrencies. “People are looking for new ways to store value, rather than new ways to invest and create new things. I think there’s a little bit too much interest in storing value, and not enough interest in creating new value and expanding the pie.”\nStill, while it is hard to cleanly separate cryptocurrencies from blockchain ( many blockchain projects are raising funding by offering the digital currencies), Siegel notes that it is blockchain technology itself, which effectively distributes copies of the same, constantly updating database to multiple parties, that he thinks has the most potential.\n“The math behind [blockchain] is pretty cool,” Siegel said. “There’s an awful lot of hype around the blockchain, but think the blockchain will ultimately create new business models. I think it will be particularly helpful in the developing world where registries are not as established as here in the more developed economies.”\nIn 2018 at least, some investors appear to concur with his analysis. Venture capital funding to cryptocurrency and blockchain-related startups has soared in new heights, reaching $1.4 billion as of June , according to Pitchbook, compared to $964 million raised through all of 2017.\n&", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/2017/05/16/hedge-fund-james-simons-renaissance-technologies/", "http://fortune.com/2018/06/06/two-sigma-hedge-fund-bitcoin-blockchain/", "http://fortune.com/2018/06/01/bitcoin-price-ico-2018-record-billions/", "http://fortune.com/2018/06/06/ripple-codius/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-06-05/two-sigma-s-siegel-on-tech-in-society-video", "http://fortune.com/2018/04/06/george-soros-cryptocurrency-hedge-fund-bitcoin/", "https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mdg45eikkf/4-david-siegel/#55e9f6a66cbc"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david siegel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "two sigma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg invest", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T03:39:27.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74d42715601afb80fe5f322293909357de717662", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkS7uOZEmk17Xxwghpq_mKffpq_tyvlmpcTnJqo.rxf8IXCqqCr86b1_YpPVbXPZ1DfaKBp1ZFWXE-", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/live/allmarketssummit", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto", "title": "VanEck, SolidX Join Forces in New Bid to Launch Bitcoin ETF", "title_full": "VanEck, SolidX Join Forces in New Bid to Launch Bitcoin ETF", "published": "2018-06-06T22:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.135, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZeL7BGvdnmtRH3p3JuPddg--~B/aD0xMTMzO3c9MTcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/d2010d8f6de1a043427d6da6f66e1f2d", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74d42715601afb80fe5f322293909357de717662", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkS7uOZEmk17Xxwghpq_mKffpq_tyvlmpcTnJqo.rxf8IXCqqCr86b1_YpPVbXPZ1DfaKBp1ZFWXE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Coindesk", "published": "2018-06-06T22:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "VanEck, SolidX Join Forces in New Bid to Launch Bitcoin ETF", "text": "VanEck and SolidX have teamed up to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, despite regulatory obstacles that stymied prior attempts.

They're proposing a physically backed bitcoin ETF, the Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust , and it just might be poised to break the losing streak of mainstreaming BTC on Wall Street. This time, they're aiming at institutional investors by pricing it at $200,000 per share.\nAlso read: Russian Farming Village: Local Crypto, Bitcoin Reserves, No Govt Money\nVan Eck and Solid X Team for Bitcoin ETF Priced at $200,000 Van Eck CEO Jan van Eck cheered, \"I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of 'digital gold' that may make sense for investors' portfolios. The Solid X team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We're pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.\" The Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust will also offer itself as being insured against bitcoin lost or stolen.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports, \"The firms also set a relatively high per-share price: $200,000. The price tag is designed to aim the product at institutional rather than retail investors.\" And in \"determining a marketing partner,\" Solid X CEO Daniel H. Gallancy underscored, they \"looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio. Van Eck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities.\"\nThe two have in common being New York-based and the dubious honor of having been shot down by the SEC when they attempted individually to list a bitcoin ETF. The present filing, as of 6 June 2018, will be watched closely by the ecosystem. Jan van Eck expressed optimism at their latest tactic, \"We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.\"\nChicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and its BZX Equities Exchange is believed to be where such a fund, pending approval, would ultimately be listed. The Cboe market maker was the first to list Bitcoin Futures back in December of last year. Results have been decidedly mixed after ecosystem enthusiasm almost promised BTC would moon in response. Now, some have taken to blaming exchanges such as Cboe and its crosstown rival CME for retarding the BTC spot price, for essentially being Crypto Winter's catalyst as it were.\nCould be the Right Combination at the Right Time \"It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,\" the Van Eck CEO stressed.\nIndeed, earlier this year, these pages reported how in a \" Staff Letter: Engaging on Fund Innovation and Cryptocurrency-related Holdings of 18 January, signed by newly appointed Director Dalia Blass from the Division of Investment Management, the SEC wrote to the Investment Company Institute and Asset Management Group Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) about the prospects of bitcoin ETFs.\" It was a letter filled with admonitions and warnings and potential confusions. One thing was glaringly clear: any bitcoin ETF going forward must contend with its concerns.\nTwo months ago to almost the day, however, hopeful signs appeared to emerge. Presumably in response to a Cboe open letter plea for action from President and COO Chris Concannon, the SEC seemed to be moving along further than it had previously while it considered two fund candidates from Pro Shares. Comment portion of the process has just wrapped.\nThe Journal quotes Mr. Gallancy of Solid X as reminding they \"never had any intention of giving up.\" Neither has the broader crypto investment community, showing how it is not content to just sit back and wait for permission. \"Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on its recently launched index of ten digital assets,\" News.Bitcoin.com explained. In further anticipation, \"Okex, the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users.

A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term).\nColas adds that growth in new cryptocurrency wallets have only increased by 3.7% this year, as opposed to 7.6% during the last quarter of 2017.\nBitcoin Beats 'Beyonce' and Sometimes 'Trump' When it comes down to it, mainstream media sources like to cast doubt on Bitcoin despite the natural tendency for searches to correlate with price. Though this is certainly a \"chicken or the egg\" argument.\nRegardless, Bitcoin is still the king of cryptocurrencies and is even proving to be a top contender when it comes to pop culture.\nIn the past month, searches for 'Bitcoin' have been greater than 'Beyonce', and are only a few points below 'Trump', who is arguably the most recognizable person in the world today.\nWhen we incorporate a few more popular search terms, we see that Bitcoin is more popular than Taylor Swift and even Kim Kardashian.\nMost notably, it even surpasses the World Cup for most of the year.\nSo despite all the fear, uncertainty and doubt being spread about waning interest in Bitcoin, the data clearly indicates that the world's most popular cryptocurrency does not need a new narrative, and actually has captured global attention.\nIn fact, it was the second most popular Google search term in 2017.\nAlthough the 2018 search data indicates a waning interest in Bitcoin for the time being, it also isn't the first time searches have dropped or that the crypto market isn't growing.\nOver $9b has been raised from initial coin offerings this year, which is $5b more than all of last year. Meanwhile, new Bitcoin-based financial instruments with growing interest from traditional finance and Wall Street have been in the headlines all year.\nSo despite the current downtrend in Bitcoin searches , cryptocurrencies are definitely not going away anytime soon.\nWhy do you think Bitcoin searches are down?

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nBitcoin is way more riskier than bank investment. With bitcoin there is no certainty on whether this month's going to be good for you or not. There are many things that make it very risky, but once you gain profits, all those worries and risks you took would be paid off well. On the other hand there is little to no risks in bank investment but the profits in this industry is very low.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:30:06.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57741492c01c5bb807929f8924f9ee8c0a46d89f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfWrKIc7bydk1.lrqZe3bx4m9qpC7GauI92.IB2NDBUCLrUNeYlkK4i55LdZN52lxa", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin ETF Dreams Kept Alive With New SEC Filing", "title_full": "Bitcoin ETF Dreams Kept Alive With New SEC Filing", "published": "2018-06-06T22:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57741492c01c5bb807929f8924f9ee8c0a46d89f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfWrKIc7bydk1.lrqZe3bx4m9qpC7GauI92.IB2NDBUCLrUNeYlkK4i55LdZN52lxa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T22:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin ETF Dreams Kept Alive With New SEC Filing", "text": "Bitcoin ETF Dreams Kept Alive With New SEC Filing\nBitcoin ETF Dreams Kept Alive With New SEC Filing Bloomberg VanEck tries a third time for a bitcoin ETF CNBC Investment Firm VanEck Attempts New Bitcoin ETF Filing, Aims at Institutional Players Cointelegraph Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bloomberg vaneck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "institutional players cointelegraph full", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc investment firm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T22:24:32.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b7e39f419d83212f0bdc42ec5474c7a484721a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgjzUOzkvXCVRCtWIRhxXN2JGPiWIqFOgTjBKLSHU00YINTjSwD9TmqLAyk250pXgA._h8XCV80cpuyYe6Pb1awY-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Bitcoin Market Share (BCH) Only 5.7% - Does this mean BCore and rest of 1600 alts do not understand what peer to peer cash and what crypto-currency and what blockchain is ? : btc", "title_full": "Bitcoin Market Share (BCH) Only 5.7% - Does this mean BCore and rest of 1600 alts do not understand what peer to peer cash and what crypto-currency and what blockchain is ? : btc", "published": "2018-06-06T22:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b7e39f419d83212f0bdc42ec5474c7a484721a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgjzUOzkvXCVRCtWIRhxXN2JGPiWIqFOgTjBKLSHU00YINTjSwD9TmqLAyk250pXgA._h8XCV80cpuyYe6Pb1awY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "unconfirmedbtc", "published": "2018-06-06T22:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Market Share (BCH) Only 5.7% - Does this mean BCore and rest of 1600 alts do not understand what peer to peer cash and what crypto-currency and what blockchain is ? : btc", "text": "Have you seen the BCore trolls voting down the score and hurting the karma ratings ?

Reuters/Rick Wilking\nMike Novogratz poked a little fun at CNBC while speaking with its rival Bloomberg about the crypto hype that marked the beginning of 2018. \"CNBC, not to pick on CNBC, but I think I can since I am here,\" Novogratz said. He said a segment about buying Ripple's XRP epitomized the \"peak nonsense\" of the bitcoin mania that swept financial media and markets. Mike Novogratz, the famed hedge funder turned cryptocurrency enthusiast, poked a little fun at a segment on the financial-news network CNBC when describing to its rival Bloomberg News the crypto hype that marked the start of 2018.\n\"CNBC, not to pick on CNBC, but I think I can since I am here, they literally had a show where they were one by one walking people through how to buy the Ripple, the XRP coin, literally when it was trading at $3.20 having moved from $0.20 eight weeks earlier,\" Novogratz said, speaking with Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker .\nNovogratz said that was \"peak nonsense.\"\nRipple's XRP, a bitcoin rival, was technically trading above $2.57 when CNBC broke down how to buy it on the exchange operator Poloniex on January 5 . Still, the crypto market was red-hot then, with the market racing toward an all-time-high market capitalization above $830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP ultimately fell to $0.49 on April 5.\nAdvertisement To be sure, many publications created walk-throughs for readers and viewers on how to purchase crypto assets during the run-up. Business Insider published \" Ripple's XRP is the hot new cryptocurrency — here's how you buy it \" in January when Ripple was trading at approximately $2 a token.\nThe second half of 2017 also saw the rise of so-called initial coin offerings, a quick way to raise funds using cryptocurrency. Many of these fundraisers were promoted by celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather Jr.\nNovogratz said this phenomenon may be the reason regulators started to clamp down in 2018. But it is something Novogratz, who is building out a crypto merchant bank, thinks is a positive sign for the market.\n\"So we are going to knock out some of the crap from the system,\" he said. \"It is healthy.\"\nNotably, the Securities and Exchange Commission hit multiple cryptocurrency companies with subpoenas . It also recently promoted Valerie Szczepanik to lead its new cryptocurrency enforcement unit.

They’re proposing a physically backed bitcoin ETF, the Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust , and it just might be poised to break the losing streak of mainstreaming BTC on Wall Street. This time, they’re aiming at institutional investors by pricing it at $200,000 per share.\nAlso read: Russian Farming Village: Local Crypto, Bitcoin Reserves, No Govt Money Van Eck and Solid X Team for Bitcoin ETF Priced at $200,000\nVan Eck CEO Jan van Eck cheered, “I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios. The Solid X team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.” The Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust will also offer itself as being insured against bitcoin lost or stolen.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports, “The firms also set a relatively high per-share price: $200,000. The price tag is designed to aim the product at institutional rather than retail investors.” And in “determining a marketing partner,” Solid X CEO Daniel H. Gallancy underscored, they “looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio. Van Eck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities.”\nThe two have in common being New York-based and the dubious honor of having been shot down by the SEC when they attempted individually to list a bitcoin ETF. The present filing, as of 6 June 2018, will be watched closely by the ecosystem. Jan van Eck expressed optimism at their latest tactic, “We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\nChicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and its BZX Equities Exchange is believed to be where such a fund, pending approval, would ultimately be listed. The Cboe market maker was the first to list Bitcoin Futures back in December of last year. Results have been decidedly mixed after ecosystem enthusiasm almost promised BTC would moon in response. Now, some have taken to blaming exchanges such as Cboe and its crosstown rival CME for retarding the BTC spot price, for essentially being Crypto Winter’s catalyst as it were. Could be the Right Combination at the Right Time\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” the Van Eck CEO stressed.\nIndeed, earlier this year, these pages reported how in a “ Staff Letter: Engaging on Fund Innovation and Cryptocurrency-related Holdings of 18 January, signed by newly appointed Director Dalia Blass from the Division of Investment Management, the SEC wrote to the Investment Company Institute and Asset Management Group Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) about the prospects of bitcoin ETFs.” It was a letter filled with admonitions and warnings and potential confusions. One thing was glaringly clear: any bitcoin ETF going forward must contend with its concerns.\nTwo months ago to almost the day, however, hopeful signs appeared to emerge. Presumably in response to a Cboe open letter plea for action from President and COO Chris Concannon, the SEC seemed to be moving along further than it had previously while it considered two fund candidates from Pro Shares. Comment portion of the process has just wrapped. The Journal quotes Mr. Gallancy of Solid X as reminding they “never had any intention of giving up.” Neither has the broader crypto investment community, showing how it is not content to just sit back and wait for permission. “Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on its recently launched index of ten digital assets,” News.Bitcoin.com explained. In further anticipation, “Okex, the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes,” we explained recently.\nAre Wall Street bitcoin ETFs around the corner?

Alois\nVanEck, a New York based asset manager, has announced it will partner with SolidX to list a “physically-backed bitcoin ETF” (exchange traded fund). The proposed ETF will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin.\nVanEck was first to file for a 40-Act Bitcoin ETF and SolidX was among the first for a physically-backed bitcoin ETF. Regulatory approval has been slow in coming though, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been cautious in moving forward with crypto ETFs.\nSeveral months back, a handful of firms filed to list crypto ETFs just as the trading of Bitcoin futures contracts, on both the CME and the CBOE, were queuing up. The SEC responded with a series of questions for the industry instead of approving the BTC ETFs.\nDalia Blass, Director Division of Investment Management at the SEC, stated in a public letter;\n“Recently, the growth in cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related products has attracted significant attention, and we have seen interest among sponsors in offering registered funds that would hold these new digital products. As we have in the past, the Division stands ready to engage in dialogue with sponsors regarding the potential development of these funds. We believe, however, that there are a number of significant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to retail investors.”\nThese “issues” included questions on valuation, liquidity, the potential for manipulation and more.\nIn April, the CBOE countered the SEC’s concerns in another public letter saying;\n“ … we believe that the vast majority of these concerns can be addressed within the existing framework for commodity-related funds related to valuation, liquidity, custody, arbitrage, and manipulation. As the cryptocurrency markets and infrastructure continue to grow and mature, especially in the spot markets and regulated cryptocurrency derivatives markets, the more easily they will fit within this existing framework.”\nIn brief, the CBOE told the SEC to stop pumping the brakes and to push forward with crypto innovation.\nAccording to VanEck, their ETF will have SolidX act as the sponsor of the ETF and VanEck will provide marketing services.\n“I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” said Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck. “The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market. We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process,” continued van Eck. “A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\nVanEck noted that it is important to communicate the risk to investors and they are committed in this effort.\nVia its MVIS subsidiary, VanEck has created several comprehensive digital asset indices designed to provide a measurement of both individual digital assets and various baskets of digital asset exposures.\nThe SolidX team has been involved with the bitcoin ecosystem since 2011 and was one of the first sponsors to file a registration statement for a bitcoin-based ETF. SolidX says it has been working on bringing a bitcoin ETF to market since 2015.\n“In determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio,” said Daniel H. Gallancy, CEO of SolidX. “VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities. We’re excited to work with the team at VanEck.”\nAs the crypto market is very much a global marketplace, both VanEck and SolidX must be aware of challenging products. Just this past week, Huobi 10 Index announced a subscription for a fund that was described as the “first cryptocurrency ETF.” Market participants are keenly aware of the fact that US hesitancy, and overriding concerns of investor protection, may be stifling innovative new classes of securities.

What I do want to talk about is the experience I had in purchasing my hotel room through expedia.com using Bitcoin.\nFirst let me explain the process. Expedia uses coinbase as a merchant tool. Whenever you purchase something through Expedia coinbase allocates you 15 minutes for at least one confirmation to go through before your transaction is completed. If you do not get a confirmation within this 15 minutes the item you are purchasing will be reset and a new Bitcoin address for your purchase will be issued.\nBut you've already broadcast your first transaction which will still be sent to expedia's coinbase account. So now you're looking for a refund on that first tx and the only way to get that refund is by creating a coinbase account or logging into your existing and accessing the refund from there. I repeat no refunds are sent to an external address, they are sent to a coinbase Bitcoin address.\nSo I'm on Expedia. I send my 1st tx, doesn't confirm in 15 minutes, invoice resets. Send 2nd tx, doesn't confirm, invoice resets. Send 3rd tx, doesn't confirm, invoice resets. Send 4th tx and finally confirms, invouce completed, but I've sent 3 times as much Bitcoin that I need too and I'm now owed 3 refunds.\nI contact expedia customer support to see how this is done. Customer support claims they only owe me 2 refunds and that they are not seeing that failed invoice for the 3rd tx. I receive 2 refunds into my coinbase account which I haven't used in over a year. I tell customer service they still owe me for my 3rd failed tx. I provide details about it and guy tells me he will contact customer support at coinbase to see what happened. He says give him 24-48 hours.\nBy this time I've got my room booked and 2 refunds, I'm still owed 1 refund. The 2 refunds that went to my coinbase account are locked for 3 days while coinbase verifies some crap. I receive a generic response 2 days after my purchase from Expedia customer support stating that coinbase will not issue refund for 3rd failed tx. Expedia tells me to contact customer support at coinbase. I decide to do that later.\nSo after this last call with expedia I'm sitting down eating and I receive 3 new emails. \"Expedia Inc has sent you *** bitcoin\". Okay... I check my coinbase account and now I have a total of 5 refunds. I check Expedia and my reservations are still set. I call hotel and it's all in the system.\nThe extra refunds are sitting in my coinbase account. The 3 refunds I was owed I withdrew. Should I keep it or give it back to this huge corporation that wasted about 3-4 hours of my time on phone with customer support people?\nTldr; Expedia uses a shitty merchant tool which forces people to use coinbase because that's where all refunds are sent. I was owed 3 refunds for tx not confirmed in 15 minutes. 4th tx went through I got my room. Expedia issued 2 refunds. I complained about not getting 3rd refund. Days later They send 3 additional refunds. I've got a total of 5 refunds and a booked room.\n submitted by /u/hodIing\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T19:35:55.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84ee01a19cdeeb052e1d0243220ffccd4b0ec42b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3ycEBy2MSSJbA.W5ovRG_q7bHj8ssAVyrFL5dRS31s.Ay47oXhKQJD5Bm9aDKFF1xWW3zkwexl0OenFw1oBVMVgGNqLbZN1.yA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "I love this concept!

Cash is instant, people in sub-saharan Africa send money over sms, developed nations use tap and pay credit cards. No one is buying bitcoin to get faster transactions.\nBitcoins value proposition is NOT cheap transactions. Cash is free, merchants pay credit card fees, national bank transfers are free, international wires can be done over \"transferwise\" and the like for next to nothing. No one is buying bitcoin to get cheaper transactions.\nBitcoins value proposition is NOT that its \"digital\". 90% + of fiat money is already digital. Nothing more than an entry in a data base. No one is buying bitcoin because its digital, infact trying to understand the digital nature of bitcoin turns more people away than it attracts.\nIt is fantastic that bitcoin is fast, cheap, digital, uncensorable etc etc. But bitcoin really has only one value proposition, and it is extremely important.\nBitcoin is the only asset on earth that is strictly scarce, its supply cannot be diluted. Bitcoins value proposition is its immutable unchangeable monetary policy of a set issuance rate and set total supply.\nEveryone buying bitcoin is buying for this one reason whether they realise it or not. Afterall who would buy bitcoin if new bitcoins could be created arbitrarily at whim. No one. Even bitcoins price appreciation is due entirely to the fact excess supply cannot rise as demand rises, supply issuance rate is set in stone.\nOnce people start to wake up to the fact that bitcoin is the only strictly scarce asset on earth whos supply cannot increase with more time or effort like every other resource the implications will be profound.\nEveryone is running around trying to understand why bitcoin is important or why it will work or why they even bought some in the first place. The answer is this one reason. Its supply is absolutely strictly limited. If you own 1 out of 21 million bitcoin today you will still own 1 out of 21 million bitcoin in 50 years from now. No one can dilute the supply.\nBitcoins immutability is the foundation of this whole technological movement. Any coin that can hard fork at will is not immutable. The fast cheap payments will come and one day will be used all around the world, but the value today is solely in bitcoins immutable monetary policy.\nIf anyone asks you what bitcoin is. Tell them \"Bitcoin is the worlds ONLY liquid asset whos supply cannot be increased as demand rises.

Very quietly.\nThe financial firm, Susquehanna International Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., just outside Philadelphia, is one of the largest players in trading traditional investments like stocks, options and exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s. Over the last two years, the privately owned company has also built up a trading desk of around a dozen people that buys and sells millions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin and other virtual or cryptocurrencies in private deals.\nNow the firm is opening trading to a small group of its 500 clients, with plans to expand.\nMore from the New York Times:\nFacebook gave data access to Chinese firm flagged by US intelligence\nMicrosoft buys GitHub for $7.5 billion, moving to grow in coding's new era\nApple's WWDC 2018 live: Apple still wants to be different\nThe move is the latest sign that the virtual currency markets, which were once relegated to the fringes of the financial world, are being embraced by big, mainstream investors.\nThe parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, the Intercontinental Exchange, has been in talks about opening a subsidiary for cryptocurrency trading, and Goldman Sachs is on the verge of opening its own trading operation.\nBut Susquehanna, which has around 1,800 employees around the world, has a lot more money backing its trading desk — and a lot more ability to interact with clients — than the hedge funds and trading firms that have also been early participants in the virtual currency markets.\nThe arrival of big financial institutions has raised concerns among some Bitcoin aficionados, who worry that it will harden Bitcoin's status as a speculative trading asset like gold and diminish hopes that it can be used in day-to-day transactions.\nNot so, said Bart Smith, the head of the digital asset group at Susquehanna. The firm believes that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inspired by it are likely to have a wide array of uses, but for now, he said, Bitcoin's best bet is to challenge gold as a scarce commodity that can be moved around more easily.\nThe original Bitcoin software determined that only 21 million Bitcoin would ever be created. That cap isn't expected to be hit until 2040, and the limited number of tokens currently in circulation has made the online currency appealing as a commodity.\nMr. Smith said that he could also imagine Bitcoin, or some competitor, becoming a digital payment method for the internet — as Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, recently predicted — but that he wasn't too worried if that didn't happen.\n\"We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,\" he said.\nSusquehanna first experimented with trading Bitcoin in 2014 after the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss asked the firm about being involved with a Bitcoin E.T.F. that they had applied to regulators to create.\nRegulators eventually denied that application . But Susquehanna kept its one Bitcoin trader on board, and then added a few more last year when the cryptocurrency markets took off.\nThe firm decided to step up its operation, and go out to clients, after seeing the success of Bitcoin futures contracts, which were introduced by exchanges in Chicago late last year and have been growing volume in recent months.\nSusquehanna will trade futures, which are contracts tied to the future price of Bitcoin. It will also allow customers to buy and sell actual Bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Bitcoin Cash.\nTo make these available to customers, Susquehanna recently amended the broker dealer license that it has on file with regulators. That change will allow the company to trade cryptocurrencies that are labeled by regulators as securities. Regulators in the United States have recently indicated that many newly created virtual currencies — though not Bitcoin — should likely be categorized as securities and traded only by regulated entities.\nMost of the cryptocurrency exchanges where Susquehanna trades are largely unregulated. Bloomberg recently reported that American authorities were investigating whether some traders were taking advantage of this to manipulate the price of Bitcoin by posting lots of trades that they didn't intend to complete.\nMr. Smith said he had not seen clear evidence of manipulation, but cryptocurrency markets are still very immature compared with the other markets where Susquehanna trades, especially given the lack of regulations for many of the largest exchanges holding cryptocurrencies.\nHe said the single biggest problem for sophisticated investors was the security risk in holding virtual currencies. In other markets, Susquehanna doesn't have actual custody of stocks or bonds.\nBitcoin was built so that users can hold and transfer their tokens with a password or private key that no one else knows. If the private key is compromised, a hacker can take the coins, and the owner has no way to get them back. That has led to big losses at several Bitcoin exchanges.\nSusquehanna built its own systems for storing the cryptocurrencies it is holding for more than a day.

The Ministry of Finance officially proposed to halt imports of bitcoin mining machines. — Photo cafebitcoin.vn\nAccording to the ministry’s report to the Government on cryptocurrency management, the bitcoin mining machine has not been mentioned in the list of forbidden imported goods, which has made it easy for businesses to import the machine.\nHowever, the ministry said the use of bitcoin mining machines has shown complications in management, with the potential to be used illegally as a currency or in other non-cash payment methods.\nCryptocurrency is considered an illegal non-cash payment method in Viet Nam. The use of virtual money as a means of payment is prohibited and will be handled according to the country’s legal regulations.\nMoF cited the example of a case in HCM City to prove shortcomings in virtual money management. An organisation based in the city, Modern Tech, reportedly duped 32,000 individuals in an investment of approximately VND15 trillion (US$666 million) in two fraudulent digital currency projects.\nThis forced State management agencies to have strict solutions in place on the import of bitcoin mining machines, MoF said.\nSo far, the country has imported some 15,600 bitcoin mining machines.\nThese were mainly imported into three major cities — HCM City, Ha Noi and Da Nang. Last year alone, more than 9,300 machines were imported, including 2,300 into Ha Noi, some 7,000 into HCM City and the remaining into Da Nang.\nIn the first four months of the year, the country imported more than 6,300 bitcoin mining machines, including 4,300 machines into Ha Noi and 2,009 machines into HCM City.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc asked the State Bank of Viet Nam (SVB), financial institutions and other organisations providing payment brokerage services to intensify inspections and promptly report suspicious cryptocurrency transactions.\nPhuc issued Directive No 10/CT-TTg on the matter, following repeated warnings from relevant agencies on risks associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, along with the threat that cryptocurrencies can be used to finance crimes, such as money laundering, terrorism, tax evasion and fraud.\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency trading and investment are on the rise, posing a threat to the stability of the financial market as well as social order and safety due to the high risks involved.\nPhuc instructed the Ministry of Public Security to join hands with the SBV and relevant ministries to detect and handle any case of cryptocurrency being used for illegal payment, any activity connected to money laundering and any terrorism-related activity sponsored via cryptocurrency.\nThe MoF has been asked to study the global experience to recommend solutions to counter initial coin offering. In addition to this, the ministry should work to reduce the import of bitcoin mining machines.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade must channel efforts to address illegal activities related to the use of bitcoin to make payment on e-commerce websites or applications.\nThe Ministry of Justice is responsible for completing a legal framework on the management and settlement of cryptocurrency or crypto assets. — VNS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://greetingvietnam.com/business/vn-ministry-of-finance-targets-bitcoin-machines.html#respond", "http://greetingvietnam.com/author/vivian", "http://greetingvietnam.com/category/business"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "vn ministry of finance", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ministry of finance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "viet nam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T10:12:20.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46fb1a74e769837eb3d707a821e67707155057d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfwRUtjNd8q8oRqtFwQ6Iyc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "3000 Bitcoins ATM worldwide !!!!", "title_full": "3000 Bitcoins ATM worldwide !!!!", "published": "2018-06-06T21:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46fb1a74e769837eb3d707a821e67707155057d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfwRUtjNd8q8oRqtFwQ6Iyc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vnck25", "published": "2018-06-06T21:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "3000 Bitcoins ATM worldwide !!!!", "text": "Yes this is expected.

Venezuela experienced its first cryptocurrency boom in early 2017, when a record volume of 805 bitcoins exchanged in a week was set. Venezuelan bolivar to Bitcoin exchange volume. Source: LocalBitcoins Following that, the level of interest towards crypto in Venezuela dropped, coinciding with a decline in trading volume to as low as 150 bitcoins bought per week. However, according to Criptonoticias, in early-to-mid 2018, Bitcoin investment surged once again in Venezuela, as evidenced by LocalBitcoins data . The volume of Venezuelan bolivar to Bitcoin exchange increased by 138% from March to April, and by 39% more from April to May. The first week of June was in line with this tren, Criptonoticias points out. Over the last week of May some 4.9 trillion bolivars were spent on bitcoins, while the first week of June had seen the volume grow by 40.8% to 6.9 trillion. Criptonoticias links the growing interest towards Bitcoin to hyperinflation in Venezuela. As bolivar keeps falling, in late May hyperinflation in the country surpassed 25,000%, according to Forbes . As per Similarweb , Venezuelans comprise the largest share of Localbitcoins’ audience, followed by visitors from the US and the UK.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://pro.similarweb.com/#/website/worldwide-overview/localbitcoins.com/*/999/3m?webSource=Total", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2018/05/31/venezuelas-inflation-breaches-25000", "https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/VEF/BTC", "https://www.criptonoticias.com/mercado-cambiario/venezuela-alcanza-maximo-historico-intercambio-localbitcoins-comerciando-300-bitcoins-menos/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "criptonoticias", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "localbitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T03:32:59.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7919c36141203a0e048faf0dcf846ae7de1f6a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfIrzKm4BB9BnRUJpl47yQ15UfCFNtFOxfIW35wlo.yxCBC5II5YoHO1r3yS6EiIisx2bKmwjE9U3x9nnXpbdpHQ1Le5xzCmXgdja2Hu2igHQM3UXZBmFEnYNX.9gsvCGRd_Jl8RLyl7d0tv4a.aZj", "site_full": "coinstelegram.com", "site": "coinstelegram.com", "site_section": "https://coinstelegram.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Coinstelegram – Altcoins Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Van Eck and SolidX are going to launch a bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund", "title_full": "Van Eck and SolidX are going to launch a bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund", "published": "2018-06-06T21:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://coinstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETF-Investing-sm-1024x576.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a7919c36141203a0e048faf0dcf846ae7de1f6a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfIrzKm4BB9BnRUJpl47yQ15UfCFNtFOxfIW35wlo.yxCBC5II5YoHO1r3yS6EiIisx2bKmwjE9U3x9nnXpbdpHQ1Le5xzCmXgdja2Hu2igHQM3UXZBmFEnYNX.9gsvCGRd_Jl8RLyl7d0tv4a.aZj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Helen", "published": "2018-06-06T21:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Van Eck and SolidX are going to launch a bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund", "text": "Leave a Comment on Van Eck and SolidX are going to launch a bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund\nAn asset management company Van Eck Securities Corporation and blockchain company SolidX Partners Inc. are going to launch a bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) that could be traded as easily as a stock.\nThe exchange-traded fund, called VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust, will be insured against theft, fraud and loss of access to the currency, according to the filing, which was filed to a review by the USA Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe firms said they intend to buy and sell bitcoin in informally organized «over-the counter» bitcoin markets to cap transaction costs, while trading large blocks of the cryptocurrency.\nVan Eck and SolidX hope to list the ETF on the CBOE BZX Equities Exchange.

(VRCP) Inks Deal to Roll Out Bitcoin Transactions in Billiard Clubs", "text": "Virtual Crypto Technologies signs agreement with first commercial customer Company’s NetoBit Pay allows instantaneous cryptocurrency payments Israel-based Lincoln Billiards believes that cryptocurrency payments will give it an edge in entertainment industry Virtual Crypto Technologies Inc. (OTCQB: VRCP), a company established to bring cryptocurrency transactions into the mainstream, has signed a deal that will allow Lincoln Billiards, Israel’s leading billiards club, to accept payments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ( http://nnw.fm/Ah6r3 ). This is the first commercial contract for Virtual Crypto, whose goal is to make cryptocurrencies more available to the public by combining application programming interfaces (API) and mobile applications to develop payment solutions that can be used in ATMs, PCs, tablets and other handheld devices.\nCryptocurrency transactions typically take from 10 minutes to 24 hours to confirm, which is a major drawback for consumers who want to use them in mainstream sales operations, since exchange rates will change over the course of a long transaction period. With Virtual Crypto’s proprietary NetoBit Pay technology, users can complete their cryptocurrency deals without waiting for the final confirmation from the blockchain, decreasing checkout time to seconds. NetoBit Pay clients/operators are able to immediately and securely, through user-friendly platforms, receive payments without being exposed to price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. NetoBit Pay provides the best exchange rate through simultaneous comparison of multiple crypto exchanges, enabling the best sale price at point of trade and resolving one of cryptocurrency’s main hurdles.\nIn addition, there is a distinct advantage for businesses using NetoBit Pay as a platform to receive crypto payments: Netobit Pay businesses will receive access to a client management system (back-office) that provides wide options to oversee and manage incomes and offers exportable financial reporting detailing trades, plus a notification and alert mechanism.\nVirtual Crypto’s groundbreaking new agreement will start with cryptocurrency being accepted in one of Lincoln Billiard’s six venues in Israel. Following this initial phase, Virtual Crypto will roll out its payment system into the remaining billiard locations.\nIn a news release, Alon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd., said, “This is an important milestone for the company. To date, we have been working primarily with cryptocurrency service providers and industry insiders, but this is our first foray into the commercial sector. Lincoln Billiards is a very popular venue across Israel, and this agreement gives us direct contact with a receptive, tech-savvy consumer group. We look forward to introducing them to the benefits of cryptocurrency.”\nA representative of Lincoln Billiards said that accepting transactions in cryptocurrency would give their venues the edge in a very competitive entertainment market. “While we are by far the largest billiards club operator in the country, we are competing with other entertainment options. As a result, we are always looking for ways to make it easy for our customers to enjoy their experience with us. The ability to accept cryptocurrency is something we have been toying with for some time, and Virtual Crypto’s platform allows us to do that without exposing ourselves to the exchange rate volatility and related financial risk associated with other unsecured systems. I expect this capability will be very attractive to many of our customers.”\nIndustry analysts expect the cryptocurrency ATM market to exceed $285 million in less than a decade ( http://nnw.fm/g6O7x ). Virtual Crypto’s innovations in two-way transactions represent a major advance in making cryptocurrency accessible to the mainstream market.\nFor more information, visit the company’s website at www.Virtual-Crypto.com\nMore from NetworkNewsWire\nTRxADE Group, Inc.

This time, they’re aiming at institutional investors by pricing it at $200,000 per share.\nAlso read: Russian Farming Village: Local Crypto, Bitcoin Reserves, No Govt Money Van Eck and Solid X Team for Bitcoin ETF Priced at $200,000\nVan Eck CEO Jan van Eck cheered, “I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios. The Solid X team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.” The Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust will also offer itself as being insured against bitcoin lost or stolen.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports, “The firms also set a relatively high per-share price: $200,000. The price tag is designed to aim the product at institutional rather than retail investors.” And in “determining a marketing partner,” Solid X CEO Daniel H. Gallancy underscored, they “looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio. Van Eck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities.”\nThe two have in common being New York-based and the dubious honor of having been shot down by the SEC when they attempted individually to list a bitcoin ETF. The present filing, as of 6 June 2018, will be watched closely by the ecosystem. Jan van Eck expressed optimism at their latest tactic, “We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\nChicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and its BZX Equities Exchange is believed to be where such a fund, pending approval, would ultimately be listed. The Cboe market maker was the first to list Bitcoin Futures back in December of last year. Results have been decidedly mixed after ecosystem enthusiasm almost promised BTC would moon in response. Now, some have taken to blaming exchanges such as Cboe and its crosstown rival CME for retarding the BTC spot price, for essentially being Crypto Winter’s catalyst as it were. Could be the Right Combination at the Right Time\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” the Van Eck CEO stressed.\nIndeed, earlier this year, these pages reported how in a “ Staff Letter: Engaging on Fund Innovation and Cryptocurrency-related Holdings of 18 January, signed by newly appointed Director Dalia Blass from the Division of Investment Management, the SEC wrote to the Investment Company Institute and Asset Management Group Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) about the prospects of bitcoin ETFs.” It was a letter filled with admonitions and warnings and potential confusions. One thing was glaringly clear: any bitcoin ETF going forward must contend with its concerns.\nTwo months ago to almost the day, however, hopeful signs appeared to emerge. Presumably in response to a Cboe open letter plea for action from President and COO Chris Concannon, the SEC seemed to be moving along further than it had previously while it considered two fund candidates from Pro Shares. Comment portion of the process has just wrapped. The Journal quotes Mr. Gallancy of Solid X as reminding they “never had any intention of giving up.” Neither has the broader crypto investment community, showing how it is not content to just sit back and wait for permission. “Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on its recently launched index of ten digital assets,” News.Bitcoin.com explained. In further anticipation, “Okex, the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes,” we explained recently.\nAre Wall Street bitcoin ETFs around the corner?
