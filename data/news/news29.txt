More Despite bitcoin's price decline this year, a cryptocurrency \"mining\" company is moving ahead with plans to repurpose a 1,300 acre plot once used by Alcoa for aluminum smelting.\nCoinmint said Tuesday it would invest up to $700 million in the upstate New York location, which it expects to be the biggest bitcoin mining center in the world. The project will create an estimated 150 jobs over the next 18 months.\nAfter Alcoa shuttered its aluminum smelting operation there four years ago, the company was looking for a tenant. Following some back and forth and a few months of discussions, Coinmint said it signed a 10 year lease with options to renew.\nSince they penned a deal, bitcoin prices have dropped about 30 percent and are down nearly 50 percent this year, according to data from CoinDesk.\n\"As long as bitcoin network exists we anticipate mining to be profitable,\" said Coinmint's Chief Technology Office Prieur Leary. \"We've developed a process to get an edge in the market.\"\nPart of that process was the move to Massena New York, just south of the Canadian border.\nThe town has access to clean and cheaper power alternatives like hydroelectric and wind. Leary pointed out that each computer used to \"mine\" generates 1400 watts — the same as one hairdryer. With hundreds of thousands of these hot machines operating at once, upstate New York's climate is ideal for reducing air-conditioning costs.\nCryptocurrency \"mining\" is essentially math done by high-powered computers. In order to trade bitcoin, transactions need to be verified through complex math equations, then and added to what's known as a \"distributed ledger.\" In return for solving equations \"miners\" receive bitcoin.\nOperations are already underway at the former Alcoa East Facility complex, and are projected to be at full capacity within a year. The 435 Megawatt mining center is expected to be the world's largest digital currency data processor, based on capacity, Coinmint said.\nMost of Coinmint's competitors are overseas. Bitmain is the leader in the industry, and raked in record profits as bitcoin skyrocketed to almost $20,000 last year. The Chinese company likely made as much $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, as much as chipmaker Nvidia did last year, according to Bernstein analysts estimates.\nCoinmint is looking to hire around-the-clock staff, and plans to tap the local community to hire staff from security personnel to electricians, to highly- trained IT staff.\n\"We in Massena, would like to welcome Coinmint to our town,\" Steve O'Shaughnessy, Massena Town Supervisor said in a statement Tuesday. \"The thought of 150 jobs and revitalization of the Alcoa East Facility is exciting and what we have been working for. We are ready to provide any assistance we can to move this project to its full potential.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BQu6A7h0aOe4XCAme5Y0gQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/video.cnbcuk.com/83797f8b6d1790e3f1b21ba6e4199b8f"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prieur leary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alcoa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinmint", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "upstate new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T00:19:11.074+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85bde87ca295e08028a950fa511ee3e6a32d1942", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfONpcCoYy0rKm2pHTKqO0uyeBaJcB1tmowPpkVqAI3R9rKQyGaaE.Tgadtl9mPjJKq0y.uUlMe8GTeaTgS0Eu2c4-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "\"Welcome to the HandCash Handle API!

Bitcoin mining rigs are currently easily imported into Vietnam. This proposal follows the largest crypto fraud case in the country involving over $656 million and more than 32,000 victims.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Ministry of Finance’s Proposal\nIn the recently released report containing the opinions of the ministries involved in the management of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Vietnam, the country’s Ministry of Finance proposes suspending the importation of mining equipment, according to local media. This report, referred to as Document 5964 / BTC-TCHQ, has been submitted to the country’s prime minister. Zing.vn publication elaborated:\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance, mining machines are not on the list of goods banned from importation and are not subject to the list of specialized management or unsafe goods, so enterprises are easily allowed to complete the import procedures.\nThe ministry outlined in its report that the use of mining equipment for bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country is difficult for the authority to manage. “From there, it is easy for people to use [cryptocurrencies] as a currency or another method of payment,” the City Economic News Kinhte & Dothi quoted the ministry. “This is in violation of the amended government Decree 101 on non-cash payments,” Zing.vn conveyed.\nThe publication also noted that data from the General Department of Vietnam Customs shows that “from 2017 to half of 4/2018, the country imported about 15,600 mining machines,” adding that most of them were imported into Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang. Last year, more than 9,300 rigs were imported into Vietnam and over 6,300 rigs were imported in the first four months of this year. Decision to Ban Mining Imports\nThe ministry also referred the case where Modern Tech Corp in Ho Chi Minh City was “accused [of] over VND 15 trillion [~US$656 million] of fraud by more than 32,000 people through its Ifan and Pincoin virtual currency investment models.” According to the ministry, protecting the Vietnamese people from similar scams in the future “requires state management agencies to take strict control measures with the import and use of this commodity.” The Vnexpress reiterated:\nTo prevent other possible events, in the immediate future, the Ministry of Finance proposed to apply the import suspension measures for the above types of mining equipment.\nThe Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc recently signed a directive to strengthen “the management of activities related to bitcoin and other virtual currencies,” as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nWhat do you think of the proposal to ban mining rig imports?

The growing popularity of bitcoin and the technology behind cryptocurrencies as well as blockchain has led to an increased demand and usage of these digital assets. While Hong Kong is part of China, it has not followed in its footsteps of effectively banning cryptocurrency trading. This provides a unique opportunity for Hong Kong, which is now becoming a hotbed for technology and new cryptocurrency projects and innovation.\nHong Kong authorities, The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and The Investor Education Centre (IEC), encourage the education and the use of cryptocurrency, through the launch of an educational campaign which outlines the features, information and potential risks of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and cryptocurrencies for the public.\nHowever, the era of cryptocurrencies has brought new threats from attackers. The rapid development of the cryptocurrency market is also accompanied by new ways of cyber attacks as well as the number of methods to access data illegally, exploit computer power and extort money.\nIn parallel, the surge in interest in cryptocurrency is posing a real threat as well. As this form of currency gains more popularity and credibility, organizations in every industry will need to implement security controls to mitigate risk against crypto-credentials from becoming exposed.\nDigital Wallets – the basics\nThere are two types of digital wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are used by individual users and organizations to store smaller amounts of currency, providing the need for more fluidity required for quick transfers and exchanges. There are many cryptocurrency services that manage and store the wallet’s private key and provide users with easy access. Usually, this type of managed service is password protected.\nCold wallets are used by organizations and security-savvy individuals, and typically hold much larger amounts of digital currency. This type of wallet keeps its associated private key off the internet completely and often stores it on an offline computer. However, if the network becomes compromised, then the keys will follow suit shortly.\nDon’t get digitally robbed\nCryptocurrency private keys are not exclusively used by human users. There are many automated processes that perform cryptocurrency transactions as well. Securing private keys for all users (both human and machine) is a foundational first step, quickly followed by authenticating and identifying who has access to the keys, controlling the access and monitoring its usage.\nCryptocurrency private keys should be treated as another type of privileged credential that needs to be managed and protected. In essence, it should be handled similar to how we store a password with a few slight modifications and specific requirements.\nWhether the private keys are accessed by humans or automated processes, it is critical to authenticate the access control and assure it has not been forged by a malicious insider or external attacker.\nHere are six key considerations to help secure and protect cryptographic keys:\nStore cryptographic keys in a secure digital vault – Move keys into a digital vault with multiple layers of security wrapped around it, enforce multi-factor authentication to all users who have access to the vault.\nIntroduce role segregation – Control individual access to stored keys, preventing even the most privileged administrators from getting to them unless explicit permissions have been granted.\nEnable secure application access –Restrict access to stored keys to authorized applications and verify that the applications are legitimate and untampered.\nAudit and review access key activity – Audit all activity related to key access and implement trigger events to alert the necessary individuals of any key activity.\nEnforce workflow approvals – Enforce workflow approvals for any activities considered to be highly sensitive and the same goes for accessing the keys.\nMonitor cryptocurrency administrator activities – Facilitate connections – similar to an automated secure proxy/jump host – to target systems that are used to perform cryptocurrency administrator activities (e.g. the system hosting the wallet).

That’s compared with $837 for the Antminer S9.\nAs if there was any doubt that GMO plans to knock Bitmain of its pedestal, the firm’s CEO Masatoshi Kumagai reportedly stated:\n“I respect Bitmain, but we will top them”\nAs reported by CoinDesk, the B2 was revealed on May 24, with GMP saying pre-orders will start on June 6 and shipments to follow in October.\nThe launch comes following a months-long testing period since the firm initially revealed it was researching and developing the new mining processor in September 2017.\nGMO B2 miner image via Yuji Nakamura/Twitter\nMinersGMO Internet ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T04:16:31.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31db122aee352150024e2625f65b8d0ecb000ad8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz7YpjC6Vh6NRknKUleWD_wM-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-06T04:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31db122aee352150024e2625f65b8d0ecb000ad8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz7YpjC6Vh6NRknKUleWD_wM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T04:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 6, 2018 NEWS No More Fees?

We would like to clarify a few things about ZClassic and the upcoming fork that is going to occur on September 10th 2018. By the time this is posted ANON’s white paper will have been published, and both ZClassic Community Edition and ZClassic Blue teams will have officially submitted proposals to BTCP to take over active development of ZClassic. To augment that, we have outlined key project details and resources below.\nANONYMOUS BITCOIN (ANON)\n“Anonymous Bitcoin provides protection to its users with one main goal in mind; anonymity. Transact, and enjoy your privacy”\nYou can watch ANON’s official announcement @ https://youtu.be/hYDJ-lDYFKw?t=91\nAnd todays announcement @ https://youtu.be/VoKptIKvt9A?t=2940\nTodays article: http://bitcoinist.com/anonymous-bitcoins-anon-advisor-whitepaper-summer-roadmap-unveiled/\nVISION\nAnonymous Bitcoin is an advancement of the technology of both the Bitcoin and ZClassic blockchain through a co-fork of both cryptocurrencies.\nWe are introducing differentiating factors deemed important by the community that set us apart from previous forks. Some of these factors include staking through use of masternodes, increased block size and a transparent development process.\nThe Development team will be sharing updates constantly.\nThe fork will provide a 1:1 ratio of Anonymous Bitcoin to all holders of ZClassic (“ZCL”) or Bitcoin (“BTC”).\nWe are currently working to be listed on multiple exchanges while introducing a complete package of privacy and long-term utility. Anonymous Bitcoin intends to improve upon the way the crypto community utilizes privacy as well as reinvent the way “no coiners” view crypto. As effective communication is key to mass adoption, our marketing strategy aims to reach those not already involved in the cryptosphere.\nWHY ANOTHER FORK?\nThe Bitcoin and ZClassic protocols were incredible advancements in security and privacy. This undisputed fact is why we felt the need to create a dual fork combining the best of both coins.\nBitcoin is only pseudo anonymous and lacks transparent governance. Introducing ZK- snarks and master nodes to this legacy blockchain will greatly increase the privacy and speed of transactions.\nThe ability to effectively communicate is not a skill displayed by previous forks. We strongly believe that the community deserves a transparent forking process as well as exchange support, a cohesive team and a marketing strategy to gain attention from those who have yet to buy bitcoin.\nCOMMUNITY\nThe Development team will bring the community on a transparent journey in the creation of a privacy coin. Check them out below, and follow our socials and videos as we go behind the scenes of this forking process.\nOUR TEAM\nThe Anonymous Bitcoin Team has strong connections across the blockchain, media, and legal space.\nEach team member from the founders to the development team specialize in their delineated tasks.\nKEY DETAILS\nCurrency: Anonymous Bitcoin\nTicker: ANON\nFork Date: September 10th, 2018 *\nDistribution: 1:1 of BTC and/or ZCL - eg. you have 1 BTC and 100 ZCL you get 101 ANON\nWhitepaper: Published June 1, 2018\nTestnet: Go live August 10th, 2018\nExchanges: Supporting exchanges will be announced by August 15th, 2018.\nTargets: Multiple top 5 exchanges by TTL volume are targeted for ZCL and ANON.\nConsensus: Use of zk-SNARKs + masternodes = hybrid PoW and PoS\nMasternodes: 100 ANON required to maintain a masternode\nBlock Rewards: 35% to the masternodes 65% to the miners\nPremine: There will be NO premine\nFunding: Finances will be made public soon after the whitepaper\nTrust: ANON Trust established to detail how holdings will be utilize in the months/years post fork\nTrading: ANON's team is prohibited from trading, but are allowed to hold both BTC and ZCL\nCoin Burn: Unclaimed ANON will be burned within 4 months\n( * development pacing ahead of schedule, considering moving up the timeline and fork date )\nRESOURCES:\nWebsite: http://www.anonymousbitcoin.io/\nExecutive Summary: https://www.anonymousbitcoin.io/executive_summary\nWhite Paper: http://www.anonymousbitcoin.io/whitepaper\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ANON_BTC\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/anonymous-bitcoin/\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-BMMTH8z0ow0xHjWZHRUg\n* ZClassic Community Edition: *\nProposal: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IpKtJ1nOMoXh_penbG_LFk9mT4mGEUfD/view\n* Zclassic Blue: *\nA short message from Zclassic Blue\nZclassicBlue - WHO ARE WE?\nWe are group of Zclassic hodlers and fans who believe in ZCL and want to continue actively on its development, in order to make it become one of the top coins.\nActive Development\nWe launched new nodes, gave support to Electrum wallet, and we are launching a new mining pool.

On Tuesday, Kundra reached the ED office around 11 am and was grilled for nearly 12 hours by officials in Mumbai. Confirming the development, ED Director Karnail Singh said, “He (Kundra) was questioned in Mumbai in connection with the bitcoin scam.” One of the members of Kundra’s Public Relations team said, “This is to clarify that Raj Kundra has no involvement or connection to the Bitcoin scam whatsoever. He has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate merely as a witness. Raj is cooperating with the law enforcement agency as Amit Bhardwaj is an acquaintance and protocol is being followed.” After the day-long grilling in the ED office, Kundra said, “Amit Bhardwaj was to buy a team in poker league and had entered into a contract with us; however, due to non-payment, the contract was terminated. I have come as a witness.” Kundra owns Match Poker league. Sources told the Free Press Journal that they suspect that Kundra may be among the people who had promoted Bhardwaj’s companies – GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21. Nearly 8000 investors were duped of Rs 2000 after transactions on these portals. The accused had adopted a Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) model to lure middle-class victims to invest in bitcoins for ‘guaranteed return of 10 per cent every month’. “Besides Kundra, it is suspected many Bollywood actors promoted his (Bhardwaj’s) companies,” said a source, who added that the other Bollywood bigwigs would also be grilled. “We are probing if these promoters were beneficiaries in the scam,” another officer said. The 35-year-old IT professional Bhardwaj expanded his cryptocurrency business in UAE, Russia, Ukraine, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Venezuela. It is also alleged that heavyweights in Pakistan helped Bhardwaj’s business to flourish in Dubai. Investors were in a state of shock after they noticed an overnight change in terms and conditions online in Bhardwaj companies. Investors tried to contact Bhardwaj, but he was not reachable. FIRs have been registered at Cyber Cells in Pune and Nanded. After remaining in hibernation for nearly eight months, Bhardwaj was located in Bangkok by Thai security agencies who alerted Indian officials. He was detained at the airport and brought to Delhi. Based on these FIRs, the ED registered its first Enforcement Case Investigation Report (ECIR) in India against Gainbitcoin and a few others under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in Mumbai.

The exchange that you are using in order to cash out your bitcoins into fiat money, they are paying tax. Don't you think they do? In every cash out that you do, you are already paying them tax. The only thing is that you don't realize it because the exchange rate has already been adjusted so that the tax is already included in your transaction.\nAnother thing, if everyone's using bitcoin and all are making good amount of money from their Internet jobs, I think that the economy of that country will grow even more. More money means more consumption for you. That's what humans do, we consume. We buy everything. Every time you buy something, you're already contributing to the country because you're paying tax.\nQuote: from: boorocktworule on June 05, 2018, 01:21:35 PM My guess is the governments, in order to protect themselves from tax evasion by cryptocurrency, will increase value added taxes.\nAnd the banks, which are essential for a government to control the economy, will just choose another way to compensate the money transfer commissions.\nAll except money transfer will stay in a different, yet very similar fashion.\nDefinitely agree to this. The government is well aware that they can't stop the people from using bitcoin since there will always be an Internet connection to the country. Prohibiting the use of Internet to the whole country is very absurd to do so they have to have a different solution. People earning money from their bitcoin earnings aren't paying income tax. This thread asks what if 80% of the population is using bitcoin, which is a majority of the people. That means it will be a good decision to increase the value added tax (tax you pay when buying something like groceries etc) since everyone's affected by it since everyone buys something.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T03:18:45.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e6e06d95af9ae170eb11202ce3d4fe1b3e00189", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz2wwImzR2A_KUmUuttZpD0E-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-06T03:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e6e06d95af9ae170eb11202ce3d4fe1b3e00189", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz2wwImzR2A_KUmUuttZpD0E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T03:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 6, 2018 NEWS Japan's GMO Unveils Specs and Price of 7nm Bitcoin Mining Rigs – On Sale Tomorrow Bitcoin News (press release) Japanese internet giant GMO announced the details of its bitcoin mining rigs called \"GMO miner B2\" in a press conference on Tuesday, June 5, ahead ...

The system aims combat financial fraud as well as reduce expenses for printing checks. According to Di Gang, an official at the bank’s digital currency research department, the platform comes after a year of development. Di said that checks will be tokenized and all operations will be conducted by smart contracts. Chinese officials hope that digitizing checks will make checking more transparent and less prone to fraud. Sponsored Links The system developers emphasized that the technology’s consensus algorithm meets the timeliness requirements of financial services. The digital billing system allows “short transaction times” of about 3 seconds and ensures that the transaction has been completed and cannot be tampered with. The Chinese government is known for its skeptical stance towards cryptocurrencies, having banned cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs) in late 2017. However, China’s authorities have enthusiastically adopted blockchain technology. Last year China filed more blockchain technology patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) than any other country. In May, President of China Xi Jinping spoke in support of blockchain at the 19th annual conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. Xi claimed that blockchain is one of several groundbreaking developments in a “new generation” of technology: “The new generation of information technology represented by artificial intelligence, quantum information, mobile communication, internet of things, and blockchain is accelerating breakthroughs in its range of applications.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "di gang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "chinese central bank develops blockchain system to digitize paper checks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chinese central bank develops blockchain system", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "financial news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T08:21:46.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba36291c50d52073520ebee699c148d1b1973b06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdNL1lWMOK5uuejHFGCTXBL30xqXPsiWTGhLDQL5UXwUexaahCMDQIO", "site_full": "www.moneygrows.net", "site": "moneygrows.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "", "title": "Moneygrows: Bitcoin analysis for 06/06/2018", "title_full": "Moneygrows: Bitcoin analysis for 06/06/2018", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba36291c50d52073520ebee699c148d1b1973b06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdNL1lWMOK5uuejHFGCTXBL30xqXPsiWTGhLDQL5UXwUexaahCMDQIO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Moneygrows: Bitcoin analysis for 06/06/2018", "text": "Contact Us Bitcoin analysis for 06/06/2018\nThe Municipal Court in St. Petersburg, annulled the District Court's earlier decision to block the Crypto Media website Bitcoininfo.ru, informs the local TASS newsletter. The District Court's verdict was released in July 2016 in line with the ban on cryptocurrencies - because digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, were not legal in this country.\nAs reported by TASS, a new decision was passed after the Supreme Court of Russia referred the case to the St. Petersburg Metropolitan Court, after filing a complaint from the owner of Bitcoininfo website. \"The court in St. Petersburg annulled the decision of the District Court, which recognized the information posted on the Bitcoininfo.ru website as prohibited for viewing.\"\nThe Court's press service also announced that in July 2016 the District Court in St. Petersburg prohibited the use of the website at the request of local prosecutors. The case was heard by the court without the presence of website owners. According to the Bitcoininfo representative, the application process was unilaterally initiated by prosecutors without involving website owners and without requesting removal of content deemed illegal. He also noted that the Municipal Court refused to accept the application for an appeal after the ban.\nBased on case files, local prosecutors demanded a ban on the website because it contained information about crypts that are \"out of government control\", \"facilitate the growth of the shadow economy\" and \"do not have specific consumer characteristics\".\nThe Municipal Court in St. Petersburg annulled previous court decisions prohibiting the operation of 40 websites related to Bitcoin in the Russian Federation. Initially, the ban was initiated because the websites disseminated information about the digital currency \"which is not supported by any real resource and does not provide information about its owners\". The court's decision is preceded by the upcoming regulatory framework for cryptography, which is scheduled for July 1, by the decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin. These frameworks are supported by the Legislative Work Committee of the Russian State Duma and include a bill on 'Digital financial assets', which was released in March this year.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market had tested the golden trend line from below and bounced back up from it towards the weekly pivot at the level of $7,523. Nevertheless, to reassure a valid bounce the price must break through the intraday resistance at the level of $7,752 and head towards the level of $7,890. Otherwise, the bear will make their presence visible again and will try to push the prices lower towards the technical support at the level of $7,232.

SolidX will act as the sponsor of the ETF and VanEck will provide marketing services. The two firms will work jointly with regulators. VanEck was the first to file for a bitcoin ETF registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in August 2017, while SolidX in March 2016 was among the first to file under the Securities Act of 1933 for a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that would reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin.\n“I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” said Jan van Eck, Chief Executive Officer of VanEck. “The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.”\n“We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process,” continued van Eck. “A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” added van Eck.\nVanEck has a history of supporting innovative investment products, from the first gold-focused mutual fund and gold miners ETF, to more recent strategies, including emerging markets debt as well as a series of guided allocation approaches. VanEck has also, through its MVIS subsidiary, created several comprehensive digital asset indices designed to provide a measurement of both individual digital assets and various baskets of digital asset exposures. The SolidX team has been involved with the bitcoin ecosystem since 2011 and was one of the first sponsors to file a registration statement for a bitcoin-based ETF. SolidX has been working on bringing a bitcoin ETF to market since 2015.\n“In determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio,” said Daniel H. Gallancy, Chief Executive Officer of SolidX. “VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities. We’re excited to work with the team at VanEck.”\nThe ETF is expected to list on the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange.\nAbout VanEck vaneck.com\nVanEck’s mission is to offer investors forward-looking, intelligently designed investment strategies that take advantage of targeted market opportunities.

The market cap now stands at US$58.64 billion, with exchange-traded volume of US$1.14 billion in the past 24 hours. The Ethereum network currently has 18,266 public nodes. The top 100 addresses own 35% of the available supply and the top 10 addresses owning 10% of the available supply. Metamask, a Chrome browser wallet for ETH, recently had it’s 1 millionth download . Transactions per day have essentially been flat since the end of April, with average transaction fees rising slightly in the same period. There has been, on average, 40,000 pending transactions this week. The 30-day Kalichkin network value to estimated on-chain daily transactions (NVT) ratio continues to rise , when compared to the previous twelve months, and is near a two-year high. A clear downtrend in NVT suggests a coin is undervalued for its utility and should be seen as a bullish price indicator. Hash rate and difficulty increases have stagnated since mid-March, likely because ETH mining profitability has also stagnated. ETH Proof of Work (PoW) mining will eventually become entirely unprofitable and impossible through the Casper Proof of Stake (PoS) transition. Vitalik Buterin’s Casper FFG is slated to go live as early as September of this year. This change also comes with a significant reduction in inflation, with 500,000 ETH per year or 0.22 ETH per block. The previous hard fork, Metropolis, reduced the block reward from 5 ETH to 3 ETH. According to coinschedule.com , the total amount of funds raised in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in 2018 has already far surpassed 2017, with each month this year averaging US$1.9 billion. There have been 396 ICOs in the first six months of 2018, compared to 210 ICOs in all of 2017. Telegram’s two pre-sales and Venezuela’s alleged Petro private pre-sale top the list of largest raises this year. According to dappradar.com , the top decentralized applications (dApps) by volume over the past week have all been decentralized exchanges; IDEX, Bancor, and ForkDelta. Decentralized exchanges help mitigate custodial and regulatory risk, but often lack the liquidity most traders have come to expect while using centralized exchanges. Most of the other top 10 dApps are also related to exchanges or marketplaces for peer-to-peer trading. According to a recent Consensys post , a total of 1,552 dApps have been created with more in development. ETH exchange traded volume in the past 24 hours has predominantly been led by the Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and U.S. Dollar (USD) pairs. The majority of trading occurred on OKEX, Bitfinex, and Binance. In Asia, the KRW trading pair holds a 1.7% premium, JPY volume is down dramatically from last week, and CNY volume is nearly absent. The over the counter (OTC) exchange LocalEthereum averaged less than ~130ETH per day in transaction volume over the past week, according to dappradar. In comparison, LocalBitcoins averaged 6,843 BTC in the past week, according to coin.dance . Traditional OTC desks often require a minimum order of between US$100,000 and US$250,000, whereas these peer-to-peer marketplaces have no minimum order size. Technical Analysis Much like the entire cryptocurrency market, ETH has been ranging violently over the past month. Impatient trend-based traders may find this frustrating, as any semblance of a trend gets quickly rebuked. Nonetheless, Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), chart patterns, and Ichimoku Cloud can help distinguish actionable trading signals. Further background information on the technical analysis discussed below can be found here . On the daily chart, a bullish 50/200 EMA cross is barely hanging on, with price below the 200 EMA. In general, EMA crosses can heavily lag market movements, making and entries based on the crosses alone suboptimal. Open interest on Bitfinex is currently net long with shorts rising substantially over the past month and reaching an all time high (top panel, chart below). There are no divergences and volume is unremarkable. There is also a potential inverted head and shoulders chart pattern on the daily time frame. The hallmarks of this bullish reversal pattern include a descending volume profile and a series of three extreme lows, with the second low exceeding the first and third low. The pattern has a 1.618 fib extension and measured moves of US$1,200 and US$1,300 respectively. Expect volume to increase substantially if price breaks the neckline (red). The Ichimoku Cloud uses four metrics to determine if a trend exists; the current price in relation to the Cloud, the color of the Cloud (red for bearish, green for bullish), the Tenkan (T) and Kijun (K) cross, and the Lagging Span. The best entry always occurs when most of the signals flip from bearish to bullish, or vice versa. The status of the current Cloud metrics on the daily time frame with singled settings (10/30/60/30) for quicker signals are mixed; price is in Cloud, Cloud is bullish, the TK cross is bearish, and the Lagging Span is in Cloud and below price. A traditional long entry will not trigger until price is above the Cloud. The status of the current Cloud metrics on the daily time frame, with doubled settings (20/60/120/30) for more accurate signals, is mixed and leaning bearish; price is below Cloud, Cloud is bearish, TK cross is nearly bearish, and the Lagging Span is in Cloud but below price. An optimal short entry triggers with price below Cloud when the TK cross flips bearish. A traditional long entry will not trigger until price is above the Cloud. Lastly, a Pitchfork on the daily chart with anchor points in June 2017, January 2018, and April 2018 shows the previous local high being rejected at the pitchfork median line (ML). Price will continually attempt to return to the ML throughout any given trend. A breach of the ML on volume would suggest a move to the next diagonal resistance. Conclusion Ethereum continues to show grassroots growth surrounding total users, developers, and dApps, all of which has not translated into substantial transactional growth over the past few months. Much of the smart contract architecture used by ETH remains in the experimentation phase. The PoW to PoS shift continues to be a top priority in the realm of core ETH protocol development. The events surrounding the transition should prove to be a catalyst for speculation. Changing the consensus protocol for a billion dollar asset is no small feat, but maybe what is required to enable successful scaling measures for the dApp economy and beyond. Technicals are mixed to bearish with nothing immediately actionable from a trading perspective. A multi-month drop in volume has created a price structure showing a potential reversal. Trend based indicators like EMAs and Cloud remain neutral to bearish. There will likely be a large move in price well-before the protocol upgrade, currently slated closer to Q4 this year.

Price needs to break past the neckline around $7,800 to confirm that an uptrend is about to take place. Technical indicators are still reflecting the presence of bearish momentum, so it could be uphill from here.\nBitcoin price has formed a classic reversal pattern to signal that the downtrend might be over soon.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to show that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse.\nThe 100 SMA is also holding as dynamic resistance at the moment, so bitcoin price would need to surge past a couple of upside barriers before confirming a rally. The 200 SMA dynamic inflection point might also hold as a ceiling around $8,200. Also, the gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect strengthening bearish momentum.\nRSI is on the move up but appears to be stalling as it closes in on the overbought zone. Turning back down could draw bears in and force bitcoin price to resume the slide. Stochastic has more room to climb so bitcoin price could follow suit and attempt a neckline break.\nThe chart pattern is approximately $900 tall so a breakout could lead to a rally of the same height, taking bitcoin price to $8,600 next. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nThere appear to be no clear catalysts for the latest bounce, with many simply attributing this to a pickup in overall risk appetite. This follows a resolution of the political crisis in Italy and confirmation that the meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-Un will push through next week.\nAt the same time, the dollar is taking some weight on Trump’s decision to slap higher tariffs on metal imports from its allies. Bitcoin could be poised to take advantage of risk rallies and dollar weakness from here.

The move, which authorities greenlighted in January, will see the company invest “up to $700 mln” in the project, which will repurpose the former 1300-acres-large Alcoa aluminium smelting plant by the end of 2019. Operations will continue under the newly-formed subsidiary North Country Data Center Corporation, which began work this week, a press release confirmed. “As long as bitcoin network exists we anticipate mining to be profitable,” Coinmint CEO Prieur Leary said quoted by CNBC, adding in the release that the subsidiary launch “is a key milestone towards the Massena site reaching its full capacity.” This year has seen multiple schemes to leverage former infrastructure in area with cheap electricity for the purposes of mining Bitcoin. Not all have struck a chord with local governments, with plans in nearby Quebec meeting with stiff criticism over the impact on local economies. “If you want to come settle here, plug in your servers and do Bitcoin mining, we’re not really interested,” the region’s Premier Philippe Couillard said in March. For politicians in Massena, the nearest town to the Alcoa plant, the project conversely represents a boon to the local workforce, as it promises to create an extra 150 jobs. “The thought of 150 jobs and revitalization of the Alcoa East Facility is exciting and what we have been working for,” Massena Town Supervisor Steve O’Shaughnessy said as part of the press release. “We are ready to provide any assistance we can to move this project to its full potential.” This breaking news was first reported on CoinTelegraph, June 6, 2018 1:29 pm .

The exchange-traded product, called VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Shares, will be insured against theft, fraud and loss of access to the currency, according to the filing, which is subject to a review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The companies said they intend to buy and sell bitcoin in informally organized \"over-the counter\" bitcoin markets to cap transaction costs, while trading large blocks of the cryptocurrency. Van Eck, which had $46 billion in assets under management, and several other fund managers had previously pushed for exchange-traded funds based on bitcoin futures instead of directly investing in the cryptocurrency. This was to address concerns that bitcoin exchanges were not regulated by traditional financial market overseers, unlike the futures market. The SEC has either denied or tabled all bitcoin ETF proposals received so far, joining a long list of regulators that have taken a tough stance against products and securities related to digital currencies. Van Eck and SolidX hope to list the product on the Cboe exchange under the symbol \"XBTC\".

That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out,” he concluded.\nBitcoin Just for Money Laundering and Speculation: ‘Big Short’ Investor Wall Street veteran Steve Eisman -- best known from \"The Big Short\" -- rose to fame by shorting the sub-prime mortgage market ahead of last decade’s financial crisis.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

The BCH Geek event was held on June 1-3 and firms like Bitmain Technologies, Viabtc, and BTC.top were in attendance. According to local reports and BCH-focused forums , the hackathon featured 100+ programmers who produced solid research, prototypes, and applications built using the BCH blockchain. The BCH Geek event was initiated by the blockchain video portal Chongqing TED.CC, and other members of the BCH community. BCH-Based Browser Plugins, an Authenticator, and a Quiz App\nThere were more than 11 teams who consisted of developers from firms like Viabtc, and students from Chongqing University. This week on Reddit, a BCH Geek attendee stated the hackathon resulted in a “satisfactory way,” while detailing the platforms created by a few of the top teams who participated in the event. Three teams mentioned in particular were the groups Mempool, Viabtc, and Gon. According to the report, Mempool created a URL-paying browser plug-in based on bitcoin cash which integrates with the HTTP and Status Code 402 protocol. Image credits: Cindy Daily\nViabtc developers designed a BCH-based authenticator that can store data and synchronize across multiple devices. The application does not require a server and authentication data can be restored easily. Another team called Gon designed an application called Token Dice which is a decentralized on-chain 1v1 quiz application based on BCH. The Token Dice programmers used the OP_Code , ‘ OP_DATASIGNVERIFY,’ to build the quiz platform. Another application featured was called ‘ IF Password’ a password management software (ifpass.cash) that is tethered to the BCH blockchain. Image credits: Cindy Daily New BCH Apps to Appear in the Wild Soon\nAttendees also heard from speakers such as Edward Liu, the co-founder of Bitkan, and Jiang Zhuoer, the founder of BTC.top, who talked about the innovation being built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network right now. The industry luminaries also spoke about currently built platforms like Memo , Blockpress , and Cointext that are providing the on-chain ‘killer apps’ once heralded a few years ago. The BCH Geek event ended with great success and it’s safe to say quite a few bitcoin cash-infused platforms demonstrated at the event in Hangzhou will be released into the wild shortly.\nWhat do you think about the BCH Geek event held in China this week?

BCH/USD managed to recover from the latest selloff, now forming a bullish trend line after holding support at $1,090. Bitcoin Cash Fails to Hold Support\nOn Wednesday morning, Bitcoin Cash broke below yesterday’s support of $1,125, now trading in the $1,110 territory and holding support at $1,090. However, the price decline didn’t last long to reach a Fib retracement level of $1,075. From its support level, BCH/USD started to recover from the latest selloff and formed a bullish trend line. Signs point to BCH/USD testing a resistance level of $1,120 in the short term.\nRecently, traders accused CNBC’s Fast Money program of trying to create an artificial hike in Bitcoin Cash price. Bears believe CNBC has continuously been inviting Roger Ver and Brian Kelly to express their bullish views on the future fundamentals of Bitcoin Cash.

This is also confirmed by the RSI indicator, which places Bitcoin Cash in overbought territory. Trading volume has subsided since the earlier selloff.

Number of calculation processing.\n* Because it is a rough analogy, I want you to keep it to the extent that I think this way now. Explanation of new terms Qubic and Abra\nQubic refers to the program / software written in the Qubic protocol, such as Smart Contract. Also they are written in the intermediate language ” Abra ” designed for ternary processors . Since Qubic is event driven type, it can do application of chain in a bucket relay of output with multiple Qubic. Oracle and Assembly\nWe think of Oracle as minor and Assembly as mining pool first. IOTA Full Node running Oracle is especially referred to as Q node . As a point of Assembly Public Assembly that anyone can join and Private Assembly that can only participate in authorized Oracle . There are two. Assembly can be constructed from one or more Oracles even from two or more.\nThe program (= Qubic ) executed for each Assembly is different, the result of obtaining a consensus (= Quorum ) by more than a certain number, taking a majority decision in all execution results in the Assembly obtained within the period (= Epoch ) It becomes the final output of the Assembly. In other words, Oracle and others in the same Assembly run the same Qubic at the same time and decide the final result by Epoch ‘s final majority vote. Decide where the Qubic owner should have the program executed by the Assembly. Commission / reliability etc. are judgment materials.\nEvery Assembly is doing different things, but as a whole it happens all over Tangle.\nDid you understand that Oracle is a minor, first of all, Assembly is not strictly a mining pool strictly. Epoch (cycle)\nFor each Assembly , its lifecycle can be separated by a period of Epoch (cycle) as a unit. It is a period between the start time and the end time of the following execution stage . Resource Test Phase (PoR phase) : Oracle participating in the Assembly prove the amount of resources to the Assembly owner ( PoR = Proof of Resource). The resource amount can be set by the Assembly owner, such as PoW, PoS, bandwidth. Processing Phase (stage of execution) : the stage in which Oracle passing through the PoR stage actually executes the Qubic left to the Assembly. Resource Test Phase – PoR stage\nWe measure the suitability of an unspecified number of Oracle who applied to Assembly by the method of measuring the amount of resources of your choice. The result is used to calculate the share of voting power and commission. Submitted all of the amount of resources from individual contributions (= Weighning Factor to calculate the), minute proportional to it (= Stake of) voting force and the commission is given after the Epoch end. Processing Phase – execution stage\nThe period of actually running Qubic. Individual Oracle submits outputs in two to prevent Classroom Attack ( = cheat other output of other Oracle that finished processing earlier). Transaction Commit : salt(＝乱数) , hash(result) , hash(result+salt) , 署名 to submit. Transaction Reveal : result to submit the real value of.\nIf 2/3 of Oracle issues a Commit Transaction and the same hash(result) is obtained, it requests a Reveal Transaction issue. Compensation is paid to Oracle salt whose hash with its real value hash(result+salt) matches the Commit Transaction . Finally take a snapshot and Epoch is done. After the end, take over the previous Epoch information and restart from the PoR stage. Quant and fee · reward\nQuant is the number of processes involved in executing Qubic code. As Ethereum also increases commission in proportion to the complexity of the code, Qubic also contains a large amount of calculations and processing, the higher the Quant, the higher the fee. Also, when talking about rewards from the perspective of the owner of the Oracle, the larger the Weighing Factor submitted at the PoR stage, the greater the reward distribution . Even with the same amount of work, not everyone in Assembly gets the same reward. Distribution based compensation = W * Q A report Remuneration = w * q\n※ w : Weighing Factor, q : Qubic quant.\nAs a result of reasonable action selection by economists under this condition, the following equilibrium is created. Invalidation of a powerful Oracle machine to convert to smaller multiple Oracle. Within the Assembly Oracle gathers as much resource as possible.\n(About 1. If all the rewards are the same, we get 10 rewards by running ten Oracle on that device rather than getting one reward on a device that is ten times as powerful as the others. Then, the control power = composition of the power of the device is formed. About (2). A powerful device will soon end Qubic’s processing, but you have to wait to receive the rewards until the end of Epoch, and you will lose when converting to hourly wage. In order to obtain the best, Epoch is required to finish almost at the same time as your own processing finishes, and it is required to shorten the waiting time until the end of Epoch as much as possible. In other words, it is a reasonable choice to participate in an Assembly that all participants have the same specification (amount of resources to be submitted at the PoR stage). Therefore, it is possible to prevent centralization due to concentration of computing power within the Assembly.\nSuch a design realizes a shared economy of computing power . For small devices (such as smartphones) you can run a light Qubic to earn money when you are not using it, or a big server center can run a big Qubic and earn a reasonable price. Various edge case When a problem occurs in the middle of Epoch, Qubic and Stake can be modified by issuing Adjustment Transaction . Pros and cons of issuance are resolved by voting. In the case of private assembly, we can skip the PoR phase and move on to the execution stage. The PoR stage is only necessary to realize distributed Quorum Computing with an unspecified number of Oracles . Tangle’s timestamp is mentioned in detail in the article ” Description of the problem and proposed algorithms “. Abra prohibits infinite loop. In other words, Turling incomplete in Epoch. Longer processing is designed to straddle Epoch.

It would be great if you could read the article on the premise that you will add overlapping and editing, including that meaning.\nIOTA:【入門】Qubicの要点をまとめてみた。 was originally published on qiita.com .The IOTA-News Community curates, examines, and summarizes news from external services while producing its own original material.

A break to $7,800 could confirm a short-term rally for bitcoin while a drop below the $7,500 mark could lead it back to the $7,300 region, making $6,000 a possibility, yet again. Low Volume\nThe price trend of bitcoin and predictions of analysts are conditional as of current due to the low volume of BTC. While BTC has prevented a further drop to the $6,000 region as it rebounded from $7,300 to to $7,600, the volume remains nearly identical to yesterday. Although the valuation of the cryptocurrency market has improved, the state of the market remains the same.\nA break to $7,800 would effectively exceed the descending one-month trend line extending from May 5 to June 5, signifying a potential rally for BTC in both the short to mid-term. The corrective rally of BTC from the $7,040 has ended at $7,500, but based on the daily candle chart of BTC, and given the stability of BTC over the past seven days, it is possible that BTC gains momentum in the upcoming days and re-enter the $8,000 region.\nOn March 20, BTC broke a descending trendline from March 4, with a strong spike in volume and price. Within five days, the price of BTC increased from $7,800 to $9,200. However, in a period of 15 days, the price of BTC dropped from $9,200 to $6,500, even though the corrective rally was supported with strong volume.\nIf BTC can record a gradual increase in volume and value throughout June and establish a strong foundation for a potential mid-term rally, it is possible that BTC returns to its previous levels by the end of 2018, possibly back to $20,000. But, if BTC cannot sustain its momentum and falls below the $7,000 mark once again, a drop to the lower end of $6,000 is still a possibility. Mid-Term Optimism\nThis week, Nathaniel Popper from The New York Times reported that Susquehanna International Group, one of the biggest investment firms in the world, has already started to facilitate bitcoin trades.\n“We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,” Bart Smith, the head of digital assets at Susquehanna, said.\nThe firm, which first experimented with BTC in 2014, has started to process the settlement of bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash futures, enabling institutional investors and large-scale traders to invest in the cryptocurrency market.\nThe entrance of firms like Susquehanna into the cryptocurrency sector could lead to a domino effect in Wall Street and the global financial sector. While investors are uncertain about the short-term future of the market, the majority of traders are bullish on the long-term growth of bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.

Behind the scenes though, the development of Bitcoin has continued to defy market movements with the continuous development of the Lightning Network (LN), which has led to the creation of several bitcoin LN wallets.\nThe Lightning Network ushered in the promise of easing network congestion by moving on-chain transactions to the second-layer protocol.\nHere are some of the mobile wallets currently in development. Eclair\nDeveloped by Paris-based ACINQ, Lightning-ready Bitcoin wallet Eclair currently has 3,000 wallet downloads, and it came about as a result of three years of working on Lightning. The Eclair wallet is a real Lightning node not a remote control app for a node running on a server. Users can transfer money from a checking to a savings account by closing channels, generate Lightning invoices, and pay Lightning invoices through QR codes or Lightning invoices.\nDominique Padiou, a software engineer at Eclair, told Bitcoin Magazine that payment route computation is made by the wallet itself, which creates better privacy, similar to the way a node on a server would.\nAt the moment, the wallet is outbound only. This is a deliberate move as the company believes users need a mobile Lightning wallet to make payments but not necessarily to receive payments. There are plans, however, to add a receiving feature in the future.\nFor now, funds stored in LN channels cannot be backed up through the app. Padiou said the company plans to “improve the performance of the wallet in the future, make it secure and add a backup mechanism for the LN channels.” This wallet is only available on the Google Play Store . Bitcoin Lightning Wallet\nBitcoin Lightning is an SPV BIP37-based wallet developed by Anton Kumaigorodski. It features full Lightning Network support that provides for both on-chain and off-chain network transactions and is available in both testnet and mainnet.\nProcessing is local for both on- and off-chain transactions. Users can send and receive bitcoin almost instantly through dedicated channels. One unique quality of this wallet is that it uses a system of storage tokens to store channel backups and delay refunding transactions anonymously.\nThis process is important, since “having a mnemonic phrase won’t get your lost channel balance back unless you have a backup,” Kumaigorodski stated. The potential for funds to go missing due to inconsistencies remain, but Kumaigorodski added that “the wallet offers off-chain data loss protection by automating the channel.” This wallet is available on the Google Play Store . Rawtx\nRawtx, short for “raw transactions,” is a mobile Lightning Network wallet for Bitcoin that allows users to send and receive testnet bitcoins on the blockchain and Lightning Network. The lead developer, known by the alias “raw tx,” told Bitcoin Magazine that they created the wallet for users who wanted to test out and get familiar with Lightning technology.\nHe went further to explain what makes the wallet unique. “It is the easiest to start with. One of the first things we show the user is a way of opening a channel with Lightning faucet.” The Rawtx wallet is built on lnd which is one of the most stable Lightning implementations out there.\nThe app currently supports mainnet transactions but enabling it is not entirely straightforward. The developer told us that the current app available for download is only on testnet, but mainnet testing has begun and it looks promising.\nThe iOS version of the Rawtx wallet is scheduled to be released later this month while the Android version can be found here .\nOther bitcoin Lightning wallets that have been released include LND Thin Wallet developed by Union 7 Labs, Swift Lightning Project and Shango Lightning Wallet . They offer similar features with very little difference in structure and how they process off-chain transactions. Usability Issues\nWhile Lightning has grown since it was first proposed back in 2015, there is still a long way to go in making these apps easy to use for everyday payments for the average person.\nAt the time of publishing, there are currently 2,135 open nodes and 5,566 channels . While there is lots of excitement and optimism about what the Lightning Network represents, users are expected to be cautious as the technology is still in development and surprises are possible.\nThere are also usability issues which could affect the speed of its adoption unless they are fixed. This is most evident in the channel creation process. A user has to go through a series of confirmations before a new channel is accepted, which means the user has to monitor the channel carefully.\nYou can read more about the Lightning Network here .\nBitcoin Magazine currently does not endorse any of these wallets. While we have no concrete reason to believe they are insecure, all Lightning software is still in very early stages, and we cannot guarantee they will work as advertised.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T04:29:03.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c5b7bb713c772385c59a813a5f9ed6650647ce8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKdTCfr5pZfAWiPV7d0gS0mI4puktHNGX7BkVK59UEfAJWauXLyxXeHN112CKgLqb3BuYB5Km7JqKNa0LZTYFLzCwt.GtcK_q5", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "New Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF Proposal Filed with SEC | NewsBTC", "title_full": "New Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF Proposal Filed with SEC | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/06/06164402/Bitcoin-ETF.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c5b7bb713c772385c59a813a5f9ed6650647ce8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKdTCfr5pZfAWiPV7d0gS0mI4puktHNGX7BkVK59UEfAJWauXLyxXeHN112CKgLqb3BuYB5Km7JqKNa0LZTYFLzCwt.GtcK_q5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rick D.", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF Proposal Filed with SEC | NewsBTC", "text": "New Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF Proposal Filed with SEC Rick D. | June 6, 2018 | 7:00 pm New Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF Proposal Filed with SEC Rick D. | June 6, 2018 | 7:00 pm\nVan Eck Associates Corp. and SolidX Partners Inc. are hoping to have learned from past efforts at getting SEC approval for a Bitcoin exchange traded fund.\nThe proposed fund which they filed earlier today will apparently be physically-backed by actual Bitcoin. It will also be insured against the kinds of security comprises that have affected some crypto exchanges in the past. Could the Latest Filing Finally Create the First Bitcoin ETF?\nThe latest request for a Bitcoin ETF was filed earlier today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It was filed by VanEck and SolidX – two firms that are well-suited to create such a financial product. They’re hoping to apply what they have taken from a previous failed filing and become the first Bitcoin ETF sanctioned by the SEC.\nLast year, there was a lot of hype surrounding a potential Bitcoin ETF that the Winklevoss twins had put forward for SEC approval. However, this was knocked back by the financial regulators.\nExcitement once again grew at the end of the year following the successful launch of both the CME Group and CBOE Bitcoin futures contracts . However, earlier this year, the SEC denied around a dozen similar applications for ETFs. The financial regulators cited high volatility, lack of liquidity, and lack of regulation as reasons behind the rejections this January.\nVanEck and SolidX were amongst those to have a proposal rejected in January. However, according to today’s filing, the two firms have returned to the drawing board in an effort to directly address the concerns of the financial regulators. The CEO of SolidX, Daniel Gallancy, told Bloomberg via a telephone interview:\n“Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors… We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.”\nThe CEO went on to tell the publication that the proposed ETF would base their prices off regulated trading firms. It will also be physically-backed by Bitcoin and will be insured by a group of insurers that are still to be named. SolidX will reportedly handle the keeping of the Bitcoin itself. This would involve a cold storage solution so that private keys are at considerably less risk of compromise.\nFor those that don’t know, VanEck are a New York-based money management firm. They are in charge of over $45 billion in assets and have dealt with many exchange-traded products since their formation in 1955. Meanwhile, SolidX are also working out of New York city. They specialise in fintech and have developed cryptographic software as well as capital markets products. Clearly, this combination of firms makes them well suited to creating the first Bitcoin ETF. Also, both firms reportedly own Bitcoin themselves. Featured image from Shutterstock. New Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF Proposal Filed with SEC was last modified: June 6th, 2018 by Rick D.

An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,\" Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement.\nA businessman with interest in sports, this is not Kundra's first brush with law.\nIn the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team.\nSome members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal.\nIn his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: \"I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.\"\n\"The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,\" said Kundra.\nHe added that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same.\n\"However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection.

PermaBull Tom Lee Appears on CNBC Fast Money\nOn Monday, Tom Lee, long known as a cryptocurrency bull in the space, went on CNBC to dispel bearish sentiment against Bitcoin’s viability and more importantly, its price. ‘Fast Money’ host, Melissa Lee, pointed out that bears held three things against Bitcoin.\nFirstly, that the Google search trends for Bitcoin are down, dropping to almost 25% of the levels seen at the start of the year. Many Bitcoin bears believe that this indicator shows that direct investment interest in this cryptocurrency. Although this may be somewhat true, this indicator tells far from the whole story. As well, Tom was quick to point out that the Google Trends indicator was not fully indicative of the price and popularity of Bitcoin :\n“Google searches aren’t the leading indicator for Bitcoin, but instead, acts as a ‘coincident indicator,’ and therefore shouldn’t be looked to as some sort of BTC price predictor .”\nIn this case, this “coincident indicator” means that it moves in correlation with Bitcoin’s price, instead of preemptively signaling the price movement of the popular cryptocurrency. Lee also assured viewers that he believes that traditional institutions are still interested in investing in the space, despite the short-term bear market which the cryptocurrency market has experienced.\nAnother point which Bitcoin bears made was that trading volumes have plummeted since last year’s bull run. According to CoinMarketCap , trading volume is down by over 75% since the late December highs seen in the industry.\nTo help combat this supposed bearish indicator, Lee called the run-up last year a “parabolic blow off.” This essentially means that he thought that the volume seen during late last year was an abnormal figure, and should not be as relevant now. He also compared the daily figures to other volume figures from earlier in 2017;\n“Compared to a year ago, (over) the same time (the first 6 months of 2017), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent .”\nThis fact affirming that he believes that the volume present in the cryptocurrency trading space is still “healthy.” Tom Lee Affirms That Bitcoin Will Move In An Upward Direction\nFinally, Lee addressed the bearish sentiment that Bitcoin has been struggling to break over the mental and technical barriers in the $10,000 range. To help assist his bullish views on the market, he utilized some research done by his market analysis firm, FundStrat. The Bitcoin bull said specifically:\n“Bitcoin makes all of its performance in 10 days, in any year. So I don’t think that the fact that it is at the current levels is going to prevent it from actually rising before the end of the year.”\nAccording to his prior appearances on CNBC segments, Bitcoin’s price movements can be mainly attributed to 10 days throughout a whole year. If you took out those 10 days in any year, Bitcoin would be down an average of 25% in that year. With this data, he made it apparent that he believes that a Bitcoin price surge will occur within the time span of a few days.\nIf Bitcoin somehow manages to continue its downward trend, Tom Lee made it clear that he believes that Bitcoin will hold price levels at the cost of mining a single Bitcoin. According to research from his firm, the current cost of mining a Bitcoin sits at an average of $6,000 and if history is any indication, that means Bitcoin should hold at $6,000 if worst comes to worst.\nImage from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin bull tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "permabull tom lee appears", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:44:30.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5add3734643c42176323f1010fd7e96efb3beba5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcnFHWP_RSbLMio.osU._4IP7N1GuuNhD7kAZYmcZwTUP1Jdk6PM_yUEOAVkRXYHwb6mXC.0HU9KVDfhgu1IF0Gd4nyHOLREU.lsc2DORKiiQ-", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - Two Thirds of US, EU Crypto Exchanges Fail to Verify Customer Identities - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - Two Thirds of US, EU Crypto Exchanges Fail to Verify Customer Identities - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/KYC.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5add3734643c42176323f1010fd7e96efb3beba5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcnFHWP_RSbLMio.osU._4IP7N1GuuNhD7kAZYmcZwTUP1Jdk6PM_yUEOAVkRXYHwb6mXC.0HU9KVDfhgu1IF0Gd4nyHOLREU.lsc2DORKiiQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - Two Thirds of US, EU Crypto Exchanges Fail to Verify Customer Identities - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New – Two Thirds of US, EU Crypto Exchanges Fail to Verify Customer Identities Best New – Two Thirds of US, EU Crypto Exchanges Fail to Verify Customer Identities Best New Cryptocurrency By root / June 6, 2018 Analyst P.A.ID Strategies has revealed the results of research into the on-boarding practices of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges across the U.S. and Europe, research that focused on which of these crypto service providers are using Know Your Customer (KYC) checks when on-boarding customers. These companies might have to change their protocols when the EU’s anti money laundering regulations come into effect next year. Exchanges and Wallets Under Scrutiny Out of the 25 services included in the study — picked based on the volume of transactions — the identification protocols of 14 exchanges, including Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, and Poloniex, and 11 wallets, including Luno, Bonpay, and Mercatox, were examined. The research , commissioned by Mitek, a digital identity verification firm, shows that of the 25 wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges examined, 68% are allowing users to trade crypto and fiat currency with no official identification or KYC checks — with most requiring just an email address and a telephone number. These lax requirements might be set to change. When the The EU’s fifth anti money laundering directive, AMLD5, comes into effect in 2019, it will seek to bring these currently non-compliant platforms in line with other financial service providers like traditional banks, making it law that checks are carried out on new customers to confirm their identities. John Devlin, principal analyst at P.A.ID, said of the issue: “ Cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges want to enjoy the same trust as the wider traditional financial services, but for this to happen they need to rise above the sometimes-dubious reputation of cryptocurrencies’ past and be seen as ‘model citizens’ of the economy.” Currently, in order to sign up to exchanges and wallets that do not perform KYC, customers only need a verified email address and mobile number. Both of these are attainable without ID — and in many countries an easily purchased pay-as-you-go mobile phone is sufficient. With these simple tools, users of the exchanges that presently fail to meet the upcoming AMLD5 regulation can buy and sell cryptocurrencies and exchange them for fiat currencies with no questions asked. “Wallets and exchanges want to change perceptions of lawlessness and it’s a relatively straightforward fix. Identity verification processes can be—if implemented correctly—simple for the customer and no barrier to signing up,” said Kalle Marsal, COO at Mitek. “ By incorporating systems that are just as future-looking as cryptocurrency itself, exchanges and wallets can be both competitive and compliant with regulatory demands.” If a cryptocurrency platform is found to be involved (implicitly or not) with money laundering after failing to meet the demands of the upcoming regulation, it’s likely to cause irreparable damage to the company’s brand. As we know, this is a delicate subject. The key is to find the right balance between protecting our rights to chose what information we share (or don’t) about ourselves, while at the same time helping take the right steps to further legitimatize the crypto industry. “Meeting the regulatory demands ahead of AMLD5 coming into force could go a long way to changing this sector’s reputation as being something of a ‘wild west’,” Devlin said.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bonpay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercatox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu crypto exchanges fail to verify customer identities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu crypto exchanges fail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu crypto exchanges fail to verify customer identities best", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T09:33:12.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60360518fced388a54965e5d43836328ed23afb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54FMhe4doYC2SKKEBwUk9uOhxDRi8RNdJ76dYWjFychwtx12cOoZeWIoh_huqYAjCmR0oNFVViD6xCKUeWTZTzfQ-", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Vietnam Finance Minister Wants to Ban Bitcoin Mining Rigs - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "Vietnam Finance Minister Wants to Ban Bitcoin Mining Rigs - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_759433969.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60360518fced388a54965e5d43836328ed23afb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54FMhe4doYC2SKKEBwUk9uOhxDRi8RNdJ76dYWjFychwtx12cOoZeWIoh_huqYAjCmR0oNFVViD6xCKUeWTZTzfQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Osato Avan-Nomayo", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vietnam Finance Minister Wants to Ban Bitcoin Mining Rigs - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "Vietnam Finance Minister Wants to Ban Bitcoin Mining Rigs June 6, 2018 4 Views Osato Avan-Nomayo · June 6, 2018 · 2:00 am\nNews has emerged of yet another cryptocurrency-related ban — this time in Vietnam. The country’s Finance Ministry is proposing a ban on the importation of cryptocurrency mining rigs. According to the ministry, these mining rigs are used to launch unregulated digital payment methods. Vietnam Struggles to Get a Handle on Cryptocurrency\nThe entire spectrum of Vietnam’s digital currency regulations is thus; “cryptocurrencies are illegal in the country.” However, this stipulation hasn’t stopped the occurrence of fraudulent activities in the country.\nIn April 2018, news emerged of a $658 million ICO scam that defrauded more than 30,000 people. The affected people invested in a company which promised significant returns on the mining of iFan and Pincoin cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to the ministry, mining rigs imported into the country are and were used to create new cryptocurrencies and unregulated payment systems. It is the belief that many of these mining activities are set up to defraud unsuspecting investors. Thus, the ministry is calling for a ban on all mining rig imports to combat the activities of fraudsters.\nThis proposed ban follows Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc’s directive for stricter regulation of the market. Based on the directive, credit institutions in the country may not facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. Financial regulators and the Justice Ministry are also responsible for ensuring virtual currency stakeholders abide by the country’s anti-money laundering regulations.\nVietnam’s need for a robust cryptocurrency regulatory framework came to the fore in September 2017. The country’s tax authorities were unable to secure an indictment against a Bitcoin trader who had made quite a fortune, thanks to a lack of legal provisions under which the tax body could charge the trader with tax evasion — highlighting the country’s need for a clear regulatory framework. Cryptocurrency Mining in Vietnam\nEven though cryptocurrencies are illegal in the country, Vietnam imports thousands of mining rigs annually.\nAccording to the General Department of Vietnam Customs, more than 6,300 mining rigs were imported into the country between January and April 2018. Last year, Vietnam imported almost 10,000 mining rigs.\nSaigon, Hanoi, and Da Nang are the principal cryptocurrency mining areas in the country.\nWill the ban on cryptocurrency mining rigs help the government prevent cryptocurrency-related fraud?

The fund will be physically-backed, which means it will hold actual Bitcoin, and will be insured against loss or theft of the cryptocurrency, according to the firms.\nThe SEC asked companies to pull about a dozen applications for cryptocurrency-linked products in January, and last year rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF . SolidX and VanEck were among the companies who had filed to list funds. They hope to have addressed regulators’ concerns with changes they made in the new, joint request by increasing the share price and basing prices off regulated trading firms, according to SolidX Chief Executive Officer Daniel H. Gallancy.\n“Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,” Gallancy said in a telephone interview. “We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.” #lazy-img-328365653:beforepadding-top:56.25%;\nHopes for a Bitcoin ETF were running high last year after the CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc. listed Bitcoin futures, as investors speculated the SEC might approve funds linked to financial instruments trading on major exchanges. But those expectations soured as regulators said they were concerned about the high volatility and lack of depth in the market, and about pricing and trading that would be based on lightly regulated platforms.\nSolidX and VanEck want to address these concerns by basing prices for the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust on an index that tracks over-the-counter trading by U.S.-based institutions, which are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MVIS, a subsidiary of New York-based VanEck, will compile the index and publish price updates throughout the day.\nVanEck oversees more than $45 billion in assets and manages more than 70 exchange-traded products. SolidX is a New York-based financial technology company, developing cryptography software and capital markets products.\nIf approved, the fund will have a share price of approximately $200,000, compared with most ETFs which launch with double-digit share price, to target institutional investors, Gallancy said. This would be a change from the focus in the ETF industry, which has traditionally been on individual investors.\nSolidX would handle custody of Bitcoin using a so-called cold storage solution, which means so-called private keys that serve as ownership codes are kept off line. Funds will be insured one-to-one by a syndicate of insurers, which the firms didn’t disclose.\nVanEck had previously filed a Bitcoin future-based ETF. A physically-backed Bitcoin ETF will be attractive as it tracks Bitcoin spot prices more closely, said the firm’s head, Jan van Eck. Both van Eck and SolidX’s Gallancy say they own Bitcoin.
