I did a little research about it and will share my thoughts with you guys.\nAs stated here ( https://www.turtletrader.com/modern-portfolio-theory/ )\nQuote: from: https://www.turtletrader.com/modern-portfolio-theory/ Modern portfolio theory is standard practice in the smart investors portfolio. MPT places a non-correlated investment , a predefined percentage managed futures component, into a typical bond and equity portfolio. Risk is diversified away from the bond and equity positions into non-correlated managed futures positions. Higher portfolio returns with a reduction in risk is the end result.\nAs you can see in this chart, from the same website, 100% bonds is riskier than 80% bonds and 20% stocks.\nA greate challenge to investors is to find non-correlated assets.\nThis is where bitcoin comes in.\nBitcoin is a new asset class with high returns, non-correlated to any other assets.\nPension funds, hedge funds, and many other funds are probably willing to buy bitcoin, as it is non-correlated to any other assets. But they can't for legal reasons.\nBut they can buy a Bitcoin ETF, or maybe a Bitcoin Future. Soon money will come, when those legal instruments are available for them.\nRemember, to lower the risk of your portfolio bitcoin should be something like 3% of your overall portfolio, maybe even less.\nThis articles covers a little about the subject too.\nhttps://medium.com/@dustin_byington/why-owning-bitcoin-reduces-risk-8163309ec2f1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://medium.com/@dustin_byington/why-owning-bitcoin-reduces-risk-8163309ec2f1", "https://www.turtletrader.com/modern-portfolio-theory/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T09:27:32.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5236301b4ae33ec1b48b9f3fb289fb5c31a79340", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTwRqZzmR8VmC96QoEQoP37X1dOUFpEabeDh1lfxZ9m95ZjKciBSyI51jrsAO3M80Uc_Qf6ONnEt5GfO4La5ET.", "site_full": "midasletter.com", "site": "midasletter.com", "site_section": "http://www.midasletter.com?feed=rss2", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Midas Letter", "title": "VIDEO: Fortress Blockchain CEO Aydin Kilic Discusses Bitcoin Mining", "title_full": "VIDEO: Fortress Blockchain CEO Aydin Kilic Discusses Bitcoin Mining", "published": "2018-05-23T22:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/midaslettervideo/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/23152411/fortress.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5236301b4ae33ec1b48b9f3fb289fb5c31a79340", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTwRqZzmR8VmC96QoEQoP37X1dOUFpEabeDh1lfxZ9m95ZjKciBSyI51jrsAO3M80Uc_Qf6ONnEt5GfO4La5ET.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MidasLetter Live", "published": "2018-05-23T22:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "VIDEO: Fortress Blockchain CEO Aydin Kilic Discusses Bitcoin Mining", "text": "MidasLetter Live | 17 hours ago\nFortress Blockchain CEO Aydin Kilic on their crypto-mining enterprise at a cheap hydro-electric cost.

Our mandate is to operate low-cost regions; currently, all of our power is hydroelectric, and $0.026 cents a kilowatt hour, it’s amongst the cheapest in North America.\nJames West: Wow. So you’re paying $0.026 cents in the state of Washington?\nAydin Kilic: That’s correct.\nJames West: So is that $0.026 USD?\nAydin Kilic: USD, yes.\nJames West: Okay, that’s still way better than even what we’re paying Canadian in Quebec, which in Canada, Quebec is sort of where all the cheapest power is. So, what scale of mining do you do?\nAydin Kilic: So currently our facility is operating at 2 megawatts. We have the ability to scale to 5 megawatts within that current facility, and there’s another facility in the State of Washington under construction right now in the same county, actually, that will be an additional 9 megawatts when complete.\nJames West: Okay. Is it a risk to the company and its business model that the increasing demand for hydroelectric power actually causes the price of its hydroelectric costs to go up over time, and does it risk destabilizing the integrity of the business model?\nAydin Kilic: So in our case, we operate in a county where our pricing is based on a rate group. The rate group is county-wide. Our facility has been a customer of the county for four-plus years, and as such, any changes to the price of the power are applied county-wide, regardless of the use; we’re in a light industrial rate group.\nThe price increase this past year, which was after the sort of frenzy in the media, if you will, was approved to be 1 percent in the county, so it’s a very negligible amount, even in light of the demand.\nNow, the county did put a moratorium on new applicants while they try to figure out handling new clients, but again, our 9-megawatt facility, the construction started last year, and in the county infrastructure has been developed and recently completed. So it sort of progressed even despite the moratorium in the county.\nJames West: Very interesting. So, what’s the sort of – sorry, do you focus strictly on blockchain, or do you also do Ethereum and other cryptos?\nAydin Kilic: So we mine bitcoin because bitcoin is a stored value; we want to mine what’s valuable. Some people call it the new gold – it is a digital asset class. It is the most robust blockchain, and frankly, it’s the most profitable cryptocurrency to mine. Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, they are on different blockchains, and the hardware we operate hashes the SHA256 cryptographic hash algorithm. So bitcoin cash and bitcoin are on the SHA256 algorithm.\nThere are some other, smaller, lesser-known coins, but bitcoin is far and wide the most widely adopted as a store of value, and so we want to invest our resources verifying transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.\nJames West: So the total number of bitcoins that can be created is 21 million?\nAydin Kilic: That is correct, yes.\nJames West: And the level of hash power required incrementally grows, increasing the level of difficulty and thereby increasing the cost per rewarded coin, correct?\nAydin Kilic: Correct. So there’s a mathematical equation that defines it; essentially, the number of hashes per block is equal to the difficulty, which is an integer number, which you can go onto blockchain.info and download at any given time; in fact, you can view historical charts. That number, multiplied by two to the power of 32, is the number of hashes per block.\nNow, the network self-adjusts every two weeks or, more specifically, every 2,016 blocks, such that the goal is a block is solved every 10 minutes. Now, if 2,016 blocks are solved in quicker than 14 days, i.e. two weeks, the difficulty increases, right, because the network realizes hold on: the blockchain is being hashed through quicker than what we want it to do.\nConversely, if it takes longer than 14 days to mine 2,016 blocks, the network will decrease the difficulty.\nNow frankly, we have not seen a decrease in the difficulty recently, but historically, it has gone up and down. Recently, it’s gone up quite a bit.\nThe other point to make is, the profit you would realize in mining bitcoin can also be determined as a portion of the total block reward, and your contribution towards that. So we can perhaps discuss it further, but we do have an interactive mining simulator tool that users can visit our website, fortressblockchain.io, and it’s an interactive tool, and they can see what the mining profitability would have looked like over the past two and a half years.\nJames West: Mm-hmm. I’m curious: what does a bitcoin mining company plan to do once the 21 million coins have been reached? What do you become?\nAydin Kilic: I suppose if there’s some kind of great advances in medical technology and I’ll live past the year 2140, I’ll consider that then, but –\nJames West: Is that when the 21 million will be reached.\nAydin Kilic: Yeah.\nAydin Kilic: Yeah.\nJames West: Oh.\nAydin Kilic: So how it works is, every four years, there’s a halving event, and currently the block reward on the bitcoin blockchain is 12.5 bitcoins per block; a block, again, is solved approximately every 10 minutes. However, the next halving event in 2020 is going to reduce the reward to 3.25 bitcoin per block, and subsequently, half of that every four years. So it’s sort of a long term decreasing reward amount, and that inherent scarcity, coupled with the difficulty is why fundamentally, outside of any market speculation, there is a price appreciation to bitcoin, because it does get more expensive to produce. But at the same time, the immutability of the blockchain increases, because the amount of computing power required to do a 51 percent attack on the network, which is essentially a fancy way of saying how could one conceivably corrupt the bitcoin blockchain – you’d have to have enough computing power that was greater than 51 percent of the worldwide contribution. That’s why they call it a 51 percent attack.\nSo it’s basically a way that it gives people more security in the strength of the blockchain. I’m trying to sort of put it in not too technical words.\nJames West: Yeah, okay, so that’s interesting. So, 2140. I mean, it’s not really relevant in the way we think in terms of these days, but the question that still persists in my curiosity – what will miners do in 2140?\nAydin Kilic: Oh, sure, yeah, right. So there’s two components to mining rewards. Fundamentally, there’s the block reward, which most people are familiar with and which is what I’ve just described. However, there are also transaction fees, right? So miners are rewarded with transaction fees. They’ve ranged, over the past few years, from as little as a few percent of the total reward to 25 percent of the total reward. The transaction fees were getting quite high last year, and so that’s sort of corrected a little bit, but once all the bitcoins are mined, miners will be incentivized to verify transactions on the blockchain through transaction fees.\nJames West: I guess it’s possible, as a non-miner, to offer FIAT currency to producers of coins through mining and offer them in such a way incrementally so that you could accumulate essentially a proof of stake, so to speak, without actually showing any proof of work, correct?\nAydin Kilic: I suppose if you’re suggesting, one could retain an ownership stake in produced coins by investing in a mining company, that’s one way to look at it. Is that what you’re asking?\nJames West: No, but that’s another sort of tangent equal to the premise I’m trying to put forth, which is essentially, you know, as a currency, 21 million bitcoins is going to be the ultimate; the level of difficulty is increasing, therefore the scarcity is increasing, therefore the value is going up. Let’s say at some point that all of the bitcoin advocates are taken completely seriously and none of the bitcoin naysayers are regarded, and suddenly, everybody with a huge FIAT fortune goes ‘oh my gosh, I need to buy as much of this as I can’. Obviously, the price of bitcoin is going to go soaring at that point, as everybody tries to convert FIAT into crypto.\nAydin Kilic: Yes. Yes.\nJames West: And where does that leave the guy who can’t afford to buy, doesn’t know how to mine, and is stuck with FIAT? I mean, it sounds like if the evolution of the transformation into a crypto society actually were to occur, that a lot of the people who were less sophisticated technically, less able to access financial resources physically, they would be, in fact, the ones to suffer the most. And is that not in conflict with the entire value proposition of the concept of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies?\nAydin Kilic: I think that as we migrate towards a broader adoption, that binary between FIAT currency and cryptocurrencies will exist much like, you know, the binary between the US dollar and gold has always existed, right? So does everybody get rid of their FIAT currency and buy gold? I mean, historically, that’s where value was ascribed.\nI think that going forward, by the way with a nod to the recent past, what you just described occurred in December, right? So the price of bitcoin really eclipsed the intrinsic relationship between the price and difficulty. And a quick aside on that: if you look at the coin mining calculator we have online, you’ll see that historically, outside of sort of circumstantial events, notably in December/January, there was always sort of a baseline daily profit that has subsisted, and when the price sort of eclipses the difficulty, the difficulty is intended to self-adjust. So you know, that’s when you see this huge spike in price.\nAnyways, the point is that, even if the price of bitcoin were to go to $100,000, or $1,000,000, it’s divisible, right? So you can buy one bitcoin, 0.1 bitcoin, 0.0001 bitcoins if you want. And so frankly, there’s a term called a satoshi, which is 1 millionth of a bitcoin. So you know, people may, in 10 or 20 years, talk about trading satoshis, and a bitcoin, much like a stock of Berkshire Hathaway, you know, it might seem very expensive to buy one, but –\nJames West: Sure. I had a 45-minute conversation with Andreas Antonopoulos in Panama last weekend, and I asked him this question, and I wasn’t quite happy with his answer, because I didn’t felt like I got the answer. So I’m going to pose the same question to you, because it’s intriguing to me as a sort of hobby monetarist and economist that what the value proposition of the blockchain is very similar to the value proposition, or at least the compelling logic, inherent in the argument of the gold bugs of the last 50 years; in that, you know, immutability arguably exists in that all of the mined gold to date more or less exists in some form or other, except that which sloughs off in the industrial processes. And I’ve heard that the entire Bay of Tokyo would probably assay out at about a gram per tonne gold due to electronics ablation from the recycling process.\nBut you know, so, there’s – and he had arrived at the event with a security detail, and I said, “Why would you come to Panama of all places, which has a heavy military protection implied by the fact that the Panama Canal is there, and, you know, like what is it that you need protection from?” And he explained to me that his phone was his bank, and his bank contained, you know, a sum of bitcoin that was probably very attractive to bad actors, as they like to be called in the crypto world.\nAnd I said, “Well, what’s to stop somebody from, you know, neutralizing your security detail and then compromising you physically and then torturing you, or torturing a loved one until you reveal all of your details so that I could transfer your bitcoin to me?” And you know, because that’s the value proposition, is that the security is unparalleled, and the ability to protect your wealth by storing things in this electronic format, due to the fact that the record of ownership is distributed to multiple master nodes throughout the blockchain and therefore, beyond any tampering; whereas, you know, and in some respects I’ve just answered my own argument, I’ve realized. Whereas with gold, you can actually, you know, the point being that with gold, if I want to take $5 billion of gold off an individuals, I have quite a logistics planning exercise, whereas if I wanted to take $5 billion in blockchain, I could compel somebody through coercion, physical or otherwise, to execute a transaction giving me ownership of their bitcoin and then execute them.\nAnd I mean, this is obviously the most worst-case, dire circumstances that could ever befall any individual, but that’s where I’m curious as to what’s so much better than gold about bitcoin, if they’ve both got these limitations, which sort of may seem to be similar – both the limitations and the value propositions.\nAydin Kilic: Yeah, so I think the idea is that if you had all your wealth stored in physical gold, and somebody wanted to steal it, they’d have to displace the physical gold and that would be physically arduous. Similarly, if you had your wealth stored in bitcoin or cryptocurrency and you had cold storage, and you secured your cold storage physically, which is what we do at our company, namely what you could do is, popular brands, Trezor for example, you take your Trezor device and put it in a bank vault and, you know, you could put a gun to my head – please don’t, but I wouldn’t be able to tell you – like, you wouldn’t be able to send or receive bitcoin without that Trezor. And if it was secured in a bank vault and you kind of led me at gunpoint to the bank vault, I’d probably say “hey, guys, you know, something fishy’s going on here.”\nJames West: Right.\nAydin Kilic: So the point is, I wouldn’t recommend having an appreciable amount of cryptocurrency available on a hot wallet, something that could be sent and received from your phone, because then this sort of catastrophic scenario you’ve proscribed could be a reality. So I think it’s management of your assets is important, and there are other insured custodial services, for example, GoldMoney; my chairman, Roy Sebag, his firm has a product called BlockVaults where they offer insured crypto currency storage.\nSo there are many options for safe and secure storage of cryptocurrency to alleviate the aforementioned scenario.\nJames West: Sure. Well, I’ve got to say that I do believe we’ve exhausted the attention span of the average and even the un-average viewer of our stuff, Aydin, so I’m going to leave it there for now. I’m going to invite you back anytime you’re in the city – I’d love to have this conversation again.\nAydin Kilic: Sure.\nJames West: I’m learning so much about this space. Clearly you’re somebody who’s immersed in it, and now that I’ve seen your bitcoin calculator online, I’m going to use that to further enhance my understanding. So, thank you very much for your time.\nAydin Kilic: Yeah, thanks for having me, and the website, of course, is fortressblockchain.io and there will be a link that’ll bring you to the calculator, and you can input the electrical costs based on national averages, or our cost, which is $0.026, and then we have different hardwares that you can select in case people aren’t familiar with what a hash is and how many hash a certain type of miner has. And I would very much look forward to our next meeting. Thank you so much for having me.\nJames West: Sounds great. Thank you.\nAydin Kilic: Thanks. Midas Letter LIVE!

Undertaken by the Ministry’s CCID Research Institute, the ratings evaluated 28 currencies, judging them on criteria that examined fundamental technology, applicability, and innovation.\nComing in at the top of the grade, Ethereum earned a total index score of 129.4. It’s followed by Steem(115.9), Lisk (104.8), NEO (103), and Komodo (101.5). Meanwhile, Bitcoin (88.1) comes in at 13th, wedged between BitShares (90.8) and Verge (88.1). Bitcoin’s low mark comes despite it earning the highest score for innovation, a grade it garnered for being the industry’s pioneering currency. 4/ Detailed scores of the first crypto ratings by CCID Research, China’s Ministry of Industry & Information Technology pic.twitter.com/7LiJIWokge\n— cnLedger [Not giving away ETH] (@cnLedger) 17 May 2018\nThese ratings come four months after the Weiss Ratings Agency unveiled the world’s first index of cryptocurrency grades. Measured with alphabetical ratings, many of Weiss’ original top picks align with the Chinese government’s own, including Ethereum, Steem, and NEO, all of which received B or B- grades. Weiss also gave Bitcoin one of the lower ratings on their initial report with a C+, a move that elicited skepticism from the community at large. As China’s index follows Weiss’ precedent, Bitcoin’s rating is likely to disgruntle Bitcoin maximalists and other blockchain die-hards, while the placement of other currencies–or lack thereof–will no doubt be met with scrutiny by their fan bases, as well.\nUnlike Weiss’ ratings, however, where full access is only available through subscription, the Chinese government’s ratings are publicly accessible, the first ever for the industry. According to domestic reports, the Chinese government believes this transparency will be healthy for future innovation and for properly evaluating each coin’s development.\n“It is reported that the index released this time is the world’s first technology-focused public chain assessment index, which will be issued periodically on a monthly basis. The issuance of this index will help to fully grasp the status quo of global public-chain technology development, timely track the direction of public-chain technology innovation, and help promote the innovation and application of blockchain technology,” Chinese outlet CEN writes.\nEditor’s Note: This article is originally published at Coincentral.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "https://twitter.com/cnLedger/status/996950431459823616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://coincentral.com/chinese-govt-releases-crypto-ratings-ethereum-comes-in-first-while-bitcoin-lags-behind/", "https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://t.co/7LiJIWokge"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avinash saxena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steem", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccid research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of industry & information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccid research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T22:31:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fa9dca6adb704ad838309737fcf2d5a41ef86d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0jmszd_d4CeC8h8iIPHxQNQYNhNRMo9h8206IwAZXROxczOYHixwlVMELBe1ifP6FOr8xxSqPypPNUM0lwI5Vv1k5Yw.UCvfTlC_DrMaCO0velQfpKs0TiVe3rTVxTbInKVOpOT72IEAFXnQd1V9Dk4owr02D1K4-", "site_full": "cryptotradingsignals.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://cryptotradingsignals.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "OMG goes live on India Top Crypto Exchange Platform – Bitcoin Forum – Free Automated Trading Crypto Trading Signals Crypto Discussion groups TelegramFreeCryptoSignals CryptoCurrencynews", "title": "OMG goes live on India Top Crypto Exchange Platform – Bitcoin Forum", "title_full": "OMG goes live on India Top Crypto Exchange Platform – Bitcoin Forum", "published": "2018-05-23T22:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fa9dca6adb704ad838309737fcf2d5a41ef86d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0jmszd_d4CeC8h8iIPHxQNQYNhNRMo9h8206IwAZXROxczOYHixwlVMELBe1ifP6FOr8xxSqPypPNUM0lwI5Vv1k5Yw.UCvfTlC_DrMaCO0velQfpKs0TiVe3rTVxTbInKVOpOT72IEAFXnQd1V9Dk4owr02D1K4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FreeAutomatedTradingbot & Crypto Signals", "published": "2018-05-23T22:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "OMG goes live on India Top Crypto Exchange Platform – Bitcoin Forum", "text": "Source: OMG goes live on India Top Crypto Exchange Platform – Bitcoin Forum ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T22:26:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe2ba656937bcff5fc321d1214e0d46e3aa8c7b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSa88_wXt1DNlqEvsjeMAzFyaMiEcLJWCgNQNl6regvuT76yPmW8YflTvQWWBx4iwvg--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Fmr.

Hanyecz sent his hoarded cryptocurrency to a fellow “bitcoiner,” who then placed the order.\nThe price of bitcoin has spiked just a tad since then.

At the press time, top nine digital currencies are in the red, with the market capitalization down to less than $330 billion, compared to $390 billion just a couple of days back. Source image: Coinmarketcap Consolidations are usually volatile and can lead to unexplained rallies and declines. There seems to be no specific reason that has led to this fall; and overall, the fundamental news is positive and encouraging. Argentinian Banco Masventas (BMV), has tied up with Bitex to facilitate the use of Bitcoin for international payments . It is expected to reduce transfer time by a day. A similar pilot project by Ripple using xRapid platform had announced payment time of just 2 minutes and transaction savings of 40-70 percent. Various sectors are exploring ways to implement the blockchain technology to improve productivity and accountability. Similarly, the governments are also looking at ways to implement blockchain, whereas, many central banks are toying with the idea of their own cryptocurrency. With so much happening, the dips should be seen as a buying opportunity, but the traders should wait for the decline to end before taking long positions. BTC/USD We had recommended buying Bitcoin closer to the support of $7,941.68 if it held, but today it slumped below $7,700, which shows strong selling pressure. There are two possibilities at this level. One is that the bulls will pull back above $7,900 level after a quick break, catching the bears off-guard. Another possibility is that prices breakdown of $7,900 and slide to $7,000. It is difficult to predict which one of the two scenarios will play out. So, how to trade it? The best approach is to wait and watch for a couple of days. If the BTC/USD pair breaks down of the support and sustains below $7,900, you shouldn’t buy. If prices slide below $7,900 momentarily but recover and sustain above $8,000 levels, traders can buy about 50 percent of their usual position size and keep a close stop loss, preferably below the recent lows. Remaining 50 percent position can be added once the digital currency scales above both the moving averages. The target objective is a move back to $10,000 levels. This is a risky trade but can be taken due to the attractive risk to reward ratio. ETH/USD Ethereum broke below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern on May 22. Today, it has extended the decline, breaking below the 50-day SMA and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the latest rally. There is minor support at $544.45, at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels, below which a plunge to $418 is likely. The ETH/USD pair will become positive only above the $745 levels. We suggest waiting for the decline to end before attempting a buy. It is not advisable to catch a falling knife. XRP/USD Ripple is fast approaching the bottom of the large range. Though this support of $0.56270 had broken down in end-March of this year, it did not find sellers at lower levels, and prices again climbed back into the range on April 12. We believe that the bulls will again attempt to defend the $0.56 levels. If the lows hold, traders can expect the XRP/USD pair to rally to $0.93 and then to $1.22 levels in the medium term. We suggest waiting for a few days to confirm that the decline has ended before buying because a fall below $0.56 can extend the decline to $0.45, below which the digital currency can plunge to $0.24. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash broke below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern on May 16, and the retest of the breakdown levels held on May 20 and May 21. The BCH/USD pair subsequently broke below the 50-day SMA on May 22. It should now collapse to $650 levels with minor support at $750. The $558.3870 level has not been broken since November of last year. Hence, traders can buy once the digital currency stabilizes near the key support levels. EOS/USD EOS failed to break out of the descending channel on May 21 and turned down from there. It broke below the 50-day SMA on May 22 and has followed it up with a break of the May 16 lows of $11.8210 today. There is minor support at $10 and below that at the 78.6 percent retracement levels of $9.6136. If both these levels break, the EOS/USD pair can decline to the bottom trendline of the channel at $8. With prices breaking down of both the moving averages and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the latest rally, the virtual currency has become negative. We shall change our view once price breaks out of the descending channel and sustains above it. LTC/USD Litecoin has broken below the immediate support of $127.108. The next support on the downside is $115 and below that $107.102, which is the intraday low of February 02 of this year. We anticipate strong support in the zone between $107-$115 because if the low of $107 breaks, it will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern that will be very negative for the LTC/USD pair. If the support zone holds, we should see another attempt to break out of the downtrend line of the triangle. We suggest waiting until the digital currency takes support at levels mentioned above before initiating any long positions. ADA/USD Cardano has broken below the $0.23 levels, which had been acting as strong support for the past few days. It can now sink to the lows of $0.13 with minor support at $0.19. Repeated attempts to break below the $0.13 level in March and April of this year failed. Hence, we consider this to act as strong support again this time. However, we suggest waiting for a few days before establishing long positions because if the ADA/USD pair breaks down of $0.13, it can sink to $0.08, a level last seen in December 2017. XLM/USD Stellar has broken below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern, which is a bearish sign. Though the pattern targets are much lower, it should now decline to the strong support level of $0.184. This level had held for about a month from mid-March to mid-April of this year, hence, we can again expect some buying to emerge at $0.184. If the bulls succeed in defending the support, the XLM/USD pair will also confirm the formation of a range, which can be traded by buying on a rebound from the lows and selling close to the overhead resistance of the range. Traders can wait for the prices to stabilize and turn up before buying. TRX/USD TRX has been falling for the past two days and has broken below the 20-day EMA. It is currently trying to taking support at the trendline. If this breaks, it can fall to the 50-day SMA. The TRX/USD pair has not broken below the $0.059 levels since April 25. Hence, a fall to $0.06 levels should attract buying. Traders should wait for a day or two to confirm that the levels are holding and then buy on a rebound from $0.059. If the digital currency sinks below $0.056, long positions should be avoided because it opens the door for a further fall to $0.04 levels. The digital currency is the strongest among the top ones we cover because it is the only one still trading close to its 20-day EMA and well above its 50-day SMA. So, we shall look to buy it as soon as we find a bullish pattern on it. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Talk about a bull in beast mode Likes Received: 3 Bitcoin has had a great start in 2017 with its value rising to more than $1000 to three year highs. Forget the performance of oil, Bitcoin saw the steepest climb of 129% in 2016. Several factors have and will contribute to the rising value and acceptance of this cryptocurrency: 1) In 2017,where higher inflation will be the norm - be it due to currency devaluations,continued QE by Govts. etc. - bitcoin with its restricted supply, will increasingly be used as an inflation hedge. For eg. in 2016, Bitcoin usage in Venezuela increased seven fold as investors turned to alternative methods of preserving their wealth in a hyper inflationary environment 2) A rising dollar driving currency devaluations, cash shortages from demonetisation, govt. imposed capital controls, geopolitical concerns led to increasing use of Bitcoins in China, India and Europe in 2016 as it gained importance as an independent currency due to low correlation with other currencies and assets and one that is free from central bank or govt. controls. This trend is expected to continue in 2017 3) Credibility and acceptance for Bitcoin have been increasing as a number of countries are in favor of legalizing the use of Bitcoins and there is widespread merchant adoption. For eg. Russia legalized use of Bitcoin recently, Nigeria and Vietnam are considering making it legal. 4) 2017 could see the approval of Bitcoin ETF by the SEC which would make it easier for investors to invest in Bitcoins, thereby driving demand and price.

The NYSE and Nasdaq, the latter of which is apparently open to the idea of one day opening a cryptocurrency exchange, meanwhile are the first and second largest respectively.\nLike other executives who have, or are considering offering crypto-related products for their companies, Tessler says Deutsche Boerse is trying to understand the space first, and see where it stands in the eyes of European regulators.\nThose comments come after reports in December that the German exchange was considering offering Bitcoin futures contracts, but also weighing the potential problems with offering them . That includes higher volatility, and a lack of regulation.\nThe price of Bitcoin meanwhile, is far off its near-$20,000 high in December. That run up was partly fueled by news that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Options Exchange were planning to offer Bitcoin futures.\nNow, the price of Bitcoin is around $7,500.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-23/deutsche-boerse-s-tessler-says-deep-at-work-on-bitcoin", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/technology/bitcoin-new-york-stock-exchange.html", "http://fortune.com/2018/05/23/bitcoin-german-nyse-nasdaq-futures-stock-exchange/", "https://www.wiwo.de/finanzen/boerse/deutsche-boerse-eurex-denkt-ueber-bitcoin-future-nach/20707496.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tessler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey tessler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association for financial markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:43:40.064+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9634b62be537f6f8183529f3256135ea9affd4d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmftunMuLhHrD50T0mN1y0PU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "can you imagine bitcoin as your prime currency.", "title_full": "can you imagine bitcoin as your prime currency.", "published": "2018-05-23T22:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9634b62be537f6f8183529f3256135ea9affd4d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmftunMuLhHrD50T0mN1y0PU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ghost424", "published": "2018-05-23T22:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "can you imagine bitcoin as your prime currency.", "text": "That would be a hard adjustment because you will be always needing internet which is scarce in some places.

While the new cryptocurrency includes the history of the original bitcoin’s transactions up until the split, since the fork, the two currencies are unrelated except for their shared history and name.\nVocal bitcoin cash supporter Roger Ver, who owns bitcoin.com via an LLC registered at a Marriott resort on St. Kitts, and refers to the original bitcoin as “bitcoin core,” has appeared on numerous internet talk shows, including the conspiracy-theory site InfoWars, to promote the coin.\n“For over a year Bitcoin cash has been fighting the battle to become the ‘default’ bitcoin, a battle which traditionalists are not keen to lose,” Gandham said. “This lack of clarity, has repeatedly called into question the authenticity of Bitcoin cash, and until that is resolved the direction of price movement will always carry an air of uncertainty.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/bcc-usd", "http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-cash-price-surging-as-other-cryptocurrencies-fall-2018-2-1016021889?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral", "http://bitcoin.com/", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asp"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "iqbal gandham", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "business insider", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T22:48:13.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "619898798e5608b7bf0d3a7032014afb87e17c75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUhfXfrjL5MsUB3v0sv3VnM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why do thousands of investors hold bitcoin on troubled days?", "title_full": "Why do thousands of investors hold bitcoin on troubled days?", "published": "2018-05-23T22:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.079, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "619898798e5608b7bf0d3a7032014afb87e17c75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUhfXfrjL5MsUB3v0sv3VnM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Papapat22", "published": "2018-05-23T22:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why do thousands of investors hold bitcoin on troubled days?", "text": "I consider those investors as a wise one.

Speaking at an industry event, the company’s head of clients, products and core markets Jeffrey Tessler told audience members that the company was busy “understanding” the technology behind Bitcoin before “moving forward” with it. The progress is a step forward from previous remarks in March, when Tessler implied Bitcoin’s volatility prevented DB from entering any related markets at the time. “Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do. We are deep at work with it,” he said in this week’s update. While not stating interest or plans relating to offering specific Bitcoin products, Tessler acknowledged that DB was “not at the same stage” as its US rivals CBOE and CME, both of which launched Bitcoin futures last December. An eventual debut would hence likely focus on a similar launch. “…[W]e want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line,” he added.\nDB is already involved in blockchain experiments, in March partnering with liquidity management firm HQLAx to develop a blockchain-based platform for securities lending using R3 ’s Corda platform.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/r3", "https://de.cointelegraph.com/news/deutsche-boerse-will-not-enter-the-business-with-bitcoin-products", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/german-securities-exchange-deutsche-borse-group-partners-with-hqlax-for-blockchain-platform", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-23/deutsche-boerse-s-tessler-says-deep-at-work-on-bitcoin?srnd=cryptocurriences", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/germany", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/cme-bitcoin-futures-launch-possible-economic-outcomes", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tessler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey tessler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T23:56:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b42fc2d745fa385adb32057b75dc2ad2b94abb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWrx9MW8yaHKHAfgvjLDqt0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin made millionare ?", "title_full": "Bitcoin made millionare ?", "published": "2018-05-23T22:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b42fc2d745fa385adb32057b75dc2ad2b94abb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWrx9MW8yaHKHAfgvjLDqt0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "brawdias", "published": "2018-05-23T22:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin made millionare ?", "text": "Any idea on how many people have become bitcoin-made millionaires ?

Alternative view on facts Выбор редакции May has not been a good month for Emerging Markets in general, but perhaps none (other than Turkey now) were hit harder than Argentina which raised rates to an astonishing 40% in an effort to defend massive capital flight and the crash in its currency as IMF bailout hope is all that remains - aside from Franklin Templeton's global bond fund.\nBut as the BCRA and Argentine government desperately shore up confidence in their collapsing currency, NewsBTC.com's Tim Copeland reports that Argentine bank, Banco Masventas (BMV), has revealed a partnership with Bitex to allow customers to make cross-border payments in Bitcoin .\nThey aim to utilise Bitcoin as a low-fee cryptocurrency which can be transferred across borders and easily exchanged for fiat currencies.\nimage courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nBank Moves from SWIFT to Bitcoin BMV said in a statement :\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries. The logistics solution allows for a reduction in the time it takes to send or receive transfers up to a maximum of 24 hours. Bitex has a wide network of partners that enables international transfers to more than 50 countries.”\nBitcoin enables transfers to be made without using third parties and does not rely on any trusted parties. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that validate transactions and uses incentives to ensure that the network operates accurately. It also uses cryptography, such as hash functions, to ensure that only the person who holds their Bitcoin can spend it as well as providing a public ledger to ensure accountability.\nBitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider for both individuals and institutions. They help to create logistics solutions which allow for payments to be made between multiple countries. Bitex are self-regulated, but follow compliance and KYC rules. They have also hired Deloitte services to fulfil audits on the company’s operations and holding of funds.\nU.K. bank Santander has continued their move into the blockchain ecosystem by announcing their new app One Pay FX which uses Ripple technology in April. The app was launched in Spain, the U.K., Brazil, and Poland and is designed to make cross-border payments in a matter of minutes. It runs on xCurrent, a payment solution provided by Ripple Net but does not exclusively use XRP which is associated with Ripple. XRP is used by xRapid, another solution, and has been successfully trialled by Mercury FX.\nIn Q1, along with other xRapid pilots customers, we have proved that #xRapid can lower liquidity costs & increase payment speed and transparency using #XRP . We are looking forward to continued successful testing and going into production. https://t.co/hlYDcFyG7o\n— Mercury-fx Ltd (@mercury_fx_ltd) April 26, 2018 Ripple have targeted banks and, specifically, cross-border payment providers and argue that XRP can save costs and deliver faster transactions than using SWIFT or Bitcoin. This move by BMV shows a preference for the number one ranked cryptocurrency by market cap instead of XRP which is aimed at being used by banks.\nShould Bitcoin Be Used by Banks? Many token holders will welcome real-world integration as an increase in use of a coin usually leads to an increase in price. However, Bitcoin was initially set up in a libertarian environment which was hostile to banks. In fact, the Bitcoin’s genesis block contains an extract from the Times which references the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin is also pseudonymous which makes it harder for governments to keep track of payments and users.\nIn this partnership, we have an example of a low-fee cryptocurrency being used by a bank which is then charging 3% plus VAT for the service. This means that the bank is profiting from the low fees that Bitcoin offers. On the other hand, BMV did suggest it has passed some of the savings on to the customer. Instead of going through a bank, users could set up their own wallets and send transactions without using a bank, but novices may find this risky as mistakes can happen.\n* * *\nThe question is - will this enable BMV customers to get around any future capital controls enforced by the government should this currency collapse turn even more crisis-er?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mercury_fx_ltd/status/989427097809629184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~4/S4cayELEXKM", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/xRapid?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://ripple.com/", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/09/coinone-transfer-joins-ripplenet-revolutionize-cross-border-payments/", "https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-genesis-block-bitcoin-terms/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/500-million-mistakenly-sent-ethereums-genesis-address/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/13/ripple-partners-santander-new-foreign-exchange-app/", "https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/solutions/services.html", "https://bitex.la/", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://t.co/hlYDcFyG7o", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/argentinian-bank-now-using-bitcoin-for-cross-border-transactions", "https://www.bancomasventas.com.ar/bitex-principal"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T02:12:46.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c74265caa1c14c805a33fd772d20ec867d1d0f66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcEvDUF5tsnW5DkthNxBtR4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin as the main economy", "title_full": "Bitcoin as the main economy", "published": "2018-05-23T21:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.02, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c74265caa1c14c805a33fd772d20ec867d1d0f66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcEvDUF5tsnW5DkthNxBtR4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "treatWy", "published": "2018-05-23T21:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin as the main economy", "text": "In my opinion there will have a little by little improvement of the world economy.

"Does it make sense to invest in bitcoin?", "text": "You may have already tried many options: Capital Markets, Investment Funds, government investments, etc. What about investing in Bitcoin through digital media? Is it worth getting a loan to deposit to bitcoin? The virtual currency has recently been used in many industries as an extremely popular and main payment system. This article is intended to answer the most frequently asked question on this subject: is it worth investing in Bitcoin or is it logical? After reading the following information, you can find an answer to this question, even though it is not exactly a bit.\nWhat Is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin (BTC) is a type of electronic currency, also known as Crypto money, developed by people and companies around the world. The thing to know about Crypto money is that it doesn't have a physical form. Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone or anything else (institution, etc.); however, except for all users who buy or sell.\nWhat Are The Advantages Of Bitcoin?\nThere may be a way to make money  you have a high chance of losing money at the same time, so you need to know how the system works.\nYou can only purchase certain products and services using Bitcoin.\nIt's all over the world.\nThe system is transparent and neutral, so it can't be changed by anyone.\nPayments can be made 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, because Bitcoin is not in any way related to banks.\nCan I lose money?\nAnswer Yes, you can lose money when investing in bitcoin. That's why you're not so sure about the chances of winning, especially if you get a loan for this purpose. You can lose money in a very short period of time, as the Bitcoin price fluctuates frequently. The system is not pyramidal and is based on your ability to analyze time-bound fluctuations. You have to understand how it works and invest at the most appropriate time. If you don't, you risk losing a lot of money. This is especially true when investors are trying to make a decision.\nIs the Bitcoin price too fluctuating?\nYeah, the price fluctuates. Investing in bitcoin is risky. The crypto market is very volatile. One year bitcoin may cost a few dollars, the next month may cost a thousand dollars, and after a while it may fall to the first amount. If you are an active investor, you can make big gains by making monthly purchases and selling Bitcoin. It should be noted that these investments can be taxed, just like all other investments, and your earnings will be taxed according to the state in which you reside. How to calculate the profit depends on the statement of income. Currently, bitcoin and other krypto currencies are not taxed in Turkey. However, according to government officials, there will be efforts to establish the legal basis in the near future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T21:55:45.085+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96624b7afebf0d0e0a60bacf08b0e75fde3863af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeWZRmxH1VpJ3tX60.j4PGM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "what is making bitcoin grow faster than other cryptoccurencies ??", "title_full": "what is making bitcoin grow faster than other cryptoccurencies ??", "published": "2018-05-23T21:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.048, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96624b7afebf0d0e0a60bacf08b0e75fde3863af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeWZRmxH1VpJ3tX60.j4PGM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nguyenhoven", "published": "2018-05-23T21:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "what is making bitcoin grow faster than other cryptoccurencies ??", "text": "Quote: from: give on May 15, 2018, 02:44:32 PM what is making BTC growing faster than other cryptoccurency??\nWhy are you saying bitcoin is growing faster than other cryptocurrencies?

The cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system was the first decentralized digital currency, as it changes “hands” without a central bank. It was born in 2009 of skepticism, if not downright disdain, for traditional ways of conducting business.\nYet this week, in New York Hilton Midtown, thousands of the bitcoin savvy and curious filled a ballroom for Consensus 2018 , a conference “where people pitched ideas, mingled and reveled in the possibility of disrupting health care or real estate or how government works,” reported The New York Times . For the ins and outs of bitcoin, read here .\nThe newspaper’s account noted that some in attendance looked the part of disrupter. For instance, Seth Kaye, a “miner” of Litecoin, another cryptocurrency, from Washington state, who sported hot pink hair and wore Pokemon stuffed animals on his shoulder.\nYet the gathering also had all the “typical trappings of a modern American business conference: hotel-catered lunch wraps, networking mixers and schwag.” Exhibitors included Deloitte, Microsoft, KPMG and IBM.\n“Nibbles, chafing dishes and lanyards were in abundance at the conference, which was put on by CoinDesk, a news and data site,” The Times said.\nSpeakers at the conference covered topics ranging from government regulations to advances in privacy and what kind of lawyer you need if you work with bitcoin or another currency using blockchain technology.

Daniel Oberhaus May 23 2018, 6:29pm\nIf you haven’t been on the receiving end of an unsolicited explanation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies yet, consider yourself lucky. The explanations are often obscure, overly pedantic and at the end of it all, you’re still not entirely sure what a distributed ledger is anyway. But what if I told you there was a way to learn nothing about Bitcoin without losing an hour of your life to some crypto jabroni?\nOn Tuesday, Botnik Studios —a group of writers and artists that put machine learning to creative uses—released a short Bitcoin explainer generated by feeding a predictive keyboard dozens of actual Bitcoin explainers. These explainers served as a training set for the keyboard, which then predicts the next word in a sentence written by Botnik creators based on pattern analysis from the training set.\nIf you have a newish smart phone, it probably has a predictive keyboard that learns to predict which words you’re going to type based on what you’ve typed before. While this is a good and helpful idea in theory, predictive keyboards often make bizarre suggestions that can lead to hilarious misunderstandings . The Bitcoin explainer produced by Botnik Studios is no different.\n“As with everything we write using the predictive keyboard, editing is the whole point,” Jamie Brew, a co-founder and CEO of Botnik, told me in an email. “The writers are continually choosing from the word options the keyboard supplies. Our piano does not play itself!”\nThis isn’t Botnik’s first trip around the block. The group has also produced l e wd versions of Harry Potter and a script for the final season of Game of Thrones , all of which are created using the Botnik predictive keyboard app. You can try it for yourself on Botnik’s website using source material ranging from the Communist Manifesto to Beyonce.\nAccording Brew, the writers for the Bitcoin explainer—which included comedian Zack Bornstein and former Colbert Show writer Rob Dubbin—tried several different versions of the predictive keyboard based on positive articles about Bitcoin, negative articles about Bitcoin, and Bitcoin ads. The final result is an amalgam of these different sources, and it shows in the explainer video.

This is known as hashing the code to get some of that Bitcoin.”\nIt only gets weirder from there, but in fairness the AI-generated video still isn’t the most convoluted explanation of cryptocurrencies I’ve ever seen.

News\nOver the past twelve months or so, almost everyone has heard about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies in general, and the blockchain. Simply stated, cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are an alternative form of payment different from paper currency. The Blockchain is a decentralized open ledger that publicly records transactions between two parties, eliminating the need for an intermediary, such as banks, and allows for end users and servicers to connect directly. What does this all mean? More and more products and services will be conducted through technology with less human interaction. And, the “currency” to transact business will be through the use of cryptocurrencies, the most known as Bitcoin.\nWhy less human interaction and more technology? Blockchain is premised on users’ mutual distrust of third party institutions, such as banks and government. Through the use of technology arguably there would be more of a seamless transaction and less risk of fraud since third parties are eliminated.\nMany naysayers have not embraced this “new” technology, and believe that it will not change fundamentally how we all interact and do business. Yet, we are starting to see numerous indications to the contrary. The laws regulating cryptocurrency are still evolving.\nThe Times They are a Changin’\nThe times are definitely changing. Goldman Sachs has said that it is going to begin a trading desk for Bitcoin and probably other cryptocurrencies, and The Wall Street Journal has reported that the New York Stock Exchange is going to do something very similar. If the NYSE and Goldman Sachs are going to start trading in these currencies, it would suggest that it is becoming a commodity no different from gold or silver.\nSeveral states, including Georgia, Illinois, and Arizona have proposed legislation aimed at allowing payment of state taxes using cryptocurrencies. That’s right, paying taxes with Bitcoin might very well be possible as soon as the 2019 tax season. Most recently, Florida’s Seminole County has announced that it will be the first United States government agency (and the first Florida county) to accept Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and presumably other cryptocurrencies in the future, as a way to pay for real property taxes. Paying taxes with cryptocurrency may seem alien to us now, but may well become the new normal in just a few short years. Seminole County will use the payment processor BitPay to process cryptocurrency payments. The project goes into effect in June, and it applies not only to property taxes but also to fees relating to tags, driver’s licenses, titles, and Identification Cards.\nThe shift towards Bitcoin in Seminole County is a huge game changer because it signifies that a governmental municipality has actually validated that form of currency. The federal government’s shift towards acceptance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is also evident in the tax reporting requirements that it has instituted.\nThus, the crypto-world is converging on how we do business and how business will continue to evolve over time. Our law firm announced last fall that we accept cryptocurrencies as payment for legal services . Was this bold? We just accept that our world keeps on changing, and we all must adapt to technology or fall behind.\nRoy Oppenheim", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Hanyecz sent over the bitcoins, the pizza was delivered, and a small, but important piece of history was made.\nPrior to&a;nbsp;&l;span&g;Hanyecz&s;s purchase,&a;nbsp;&l;/span&g;bitcoin was basically worthless, or by some accounts worth about $0.008 cents. But no one had ever actually spent a bitcoin before, so the prices were largely based on theoretical value. What Hanyecz did was help jumpstart the pricing of bitcoin, which is now selling for $8,229 each, making those pizzas worth more than $80 million at today&a;rsquo;s rate.\nNow, the 36-year-old Hanyecz has reemerged as a leader of sorts, exercising his own personal brand of activism in a number of ways, including convincing his employer, online apparel and gear startup GoRuck, to start accepting bitcoin effective immediately.\n&a;ldquo;We are about to start the bitcoin pizza party at GoRuck,&a;rdquo; Hanyecz told &l;em&g;Forbes&l;/em&g;. &a;nbsp;&a;ldquo;To celebrate we are accepting Bitcoin as a payment method starting today.&a;rdquo;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;Bitcoin transactions for the Jackson, Florida-based startup are being &l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;priced in U.S. dollars but will be&a;nbsp;paid in Bitcoin based on the current Coinbase/GDAX exchange rate. Importantly, the transactions are being conducted &a;ldquo;on-chain,&a;rdquo; which means they join other bitcoin transactions that are waiting to be processed at a relatively slow rate of about seven transactions per second, compared to Visa which can handle 24,000 transactions per second.&a;nbsp;&l;/span&g;\nThese, and other obstacles have prevented bitcoin from catching on as a form of payment. If fact, since the early days of promise that bitcoin would be used to actually buy things, a number influential early supporters including Valve, Stripe and Reddit have all ceased accepting the cryptocurrency.\n&l;!–nextpage–&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;But Hanyecz hasn&s;t given up on his vision of bitcoin being used to buy things. In addition to &l;a href=&q;http://news.goruck.com/from-hq/laszlo-and-bitcoin-pizza-day/&q; target=&q;_blank&q; rel=&q;noopener noreferrer&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;launching &l;/a&g;a podcast today explaining why he thinks bitcoin can still be used as a form of payment, he&a;rsquo;s continued making purchases of his own. Earlier this year, he&a;nbsp;&l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;used a promising new bitcoin technology called Lightning to purchase two more pizzas for himself and his children. In February he &l;a href=&q;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/001044.html&q; target=&q;_blank&q; rel=&q;noopener noreferrer&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;published &l;/a&g;a detailed breakdown of that experiment, which was designed to prove that Lightning could speed up transactions by moving them &a;ldquo;off-chain&a;rdquo; and dramatically increasing the potential transaction volume.&l;/span&g;\nHanyecz tells &l;em&g;Forbes&l;/em&g; he believes Lightning has the potential to replace credit cards for payments by opening up special payment channels that connect counterparties without having to log every transaction on the actual blockchain. Detractors of Lightning, however, are concerned the technology could amount to a centralization of transactions in pools of off-chain currency.\nRegardless of whether or not the technology is ever adopted by bitcoin on a larger scale, Hanyecz says he&a;rsquo;s content with the current on-chain solutions and his own small place in history.\nSince that first Bitcoin Pizza Day his name has been documented alongside such legendary names as bitcoin&a;rsquo;s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto and programmer Hal Finney, who is credited with receiving the first bitcoin transaction.\n&a;ldquo;Bitcoin has just been a hobby on the side,&a;rdquo; said Hanyecz. &a;ldquo;It&a;rsquo;s a great achievement for me to be able to bring my bitcoin knowledge to work and accept it as payment on our production website.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g; This entry was posted in Best Stocks on by admin .

What Hanyecz did was help jumpstart the pricing of bitcoin, which is now selling for $8,229 each, making those pizzas worth more than $80 million at today&a;rsquo;s rate.\nNow, the 36-year-old Hanyecz has reemerged as a leader of sorts, exercising his own personal brand of activism in a number of ways, including convincing his employer, online apparel and gear startup GoRuck, to start accepting bitcoin effective immediately.\n&a;ldquo;We are about to start the bitcoin pizza party at GoRuck,&a;rdquo; Hanyecz told &l;em&g;Forbes&l;/em&g;. &a;nbsp;&a;ldquo;To celebrate we are accepting Bitcoin as a payment method starting today.&a;rdquo;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;Bitcoin transactions for the Jackson, Florida-based startup are being &l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;priced in U.S. dollars but will be&a;nbsp;paid in Bitcoin based on the current Coinbase/GDAX exchange rate. Importantly, the transactions are being conducted &a;ldquo;on-chain,&a;rdquo; which means they join other bitcoin transactions that are waiting to be processed at a relatively slow rate of about seven transactions per second, compared to Visa which can handle 24,000 transactions per second.&a;nbsp;&l;/span&g;\nThese, and other obstacles have prevented bitcoin from catching on as a form of payment. If fact, since the early days of promise that bitcoin would be used to actually buy things, a number influential early supporters including Valve, Stripe and Reddit have all ceased accepting the cryptocurrency.\n&l;!–nextpage–&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;But Hanyecz hasn&s;t given up on his vision of bitcoin being used to buy things. In addition to &l;a href=&q;http://news.goruck.com/from-hq/laszlo-and-bitcoin-pizza-day/&q; target=&q;_blank&q; rel=&q;noopener noreferrer&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;launching &l;/a&g;a podcast today explaining why he thinks bitcoin can still be used as a form of payment, he&a;rsquo;s continued making purchases of his own. Earlier this year, he&a;nbsp;&l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;used a promising new bitcoin technology called Lightning to purchase two more pizzas for himself and his children. In February he &l;a href=&q;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/001044.html&q; target=&q;_blank&q; rel=&q;noopener noreferrer&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;published &l;/a&g;a detailed breakdown of that experiment, which was designed to prove that Lightning could speed up transactions by moving them &a;ldquo;off-chain&a;rdquo; and dramatically increasing the potential transaction volume.&l;/span&g;\nHanyecz tells &l;em&g;Forbes&l;/em&g; he believes Lightning has the potential to replace credit cards for payments by opening up special payment channels that connect counterparties without having to log every transaction on the actual blockchain. Detractors of Lightning, however, are concerned the technology could amount to a centralization of transactions in pools of off-chain currency.\nRegardless of whether or not the technology is ever adopted by bitcoin on a larger scale, Hanyecz says he&a;rsquo;s content with the current on-chain solutions and his own small place in history.\nSince that first Bitcoin Pizza Day his name has been documented alongside such legendary names as bitcoin&a;rsquo;s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto and programmer Hal Finney, who is credited with receiving the first bitcoin transaction.\n&a;ldquo;Bitcoin has just been a hobby on the side,&a;rdquo; said Hanyecz. &a;ldquo;It&a;rsquo;s a great achievement for me to be able to bring my bitcoin knowledge to work and accept it as payment on our production website.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g; This entry was posted in Bank Stocks on by admin .

The digital currency is down about 7.4% 8.1% now at $7449. The low extended to $7505 $7433 at the lows. Technically, on the daily chart, the pair has dipped below a swing high from April 3rd at $7520. Below that a swing low from March 18th comes in at $7310. A lower trend line cuts across at $7019. The move lower is running away from the 100 day MA (blue line in the chart above) and now from the 50 day MA (white line at $8412.55). Looking at the hourly chart, the price fell below a lower trend lines at 0.7644. That is now the risk for shorts/sellers (or the level the longs will need to see breached for the bias to turn a little more bullish).

Rosenfeld began:\nThe reason 'Blockchain' is so susceptible to cargo cult mentality is that the fundamental features that make it what it is are, in a sense, invisible, and inseparable from how the technology works.\n1/10 The reason \"Blockchain\" is so susceptible to cargo cult mentality is that the fundamental features that make it what it is are, in a sense, invisible, and inseparable from how the technology works.\n— Meni Rosenfeld (@MeniRosenfeld) May 21, 2018\nCriticism of products and services claiming to use blockchain has returned to the cryptocurrency industry after Consensus gained criticism from some of Bitcoin's best-known names.\nStemming from a heated panel featuring a JPMorgan executive and Bitcoin educator Jimmy Song, Song led straight-talking appraisals of the executive's newly-unveiled blockchain tool, telling the audience he had heard \"nothing but buzzwords.\"\nOn social media thereafter, as Bitcoinist reported , Bitcoin core developer Johnathan Corgan called time on blockchain becoming a fresh example of \"cargo cult engineering\" – the belief innovation will generate prosperity by definition. Corgan warned:\nUnrestrained incantation of buzzwords and feel good hype does not a successful business plan make.\nConsumers Will Suffer Only When It's Too Late Meni's comments appear to incorporate not only dubious business proposals incorporating blockchain technology without use cases, but also spin-offs of Bitcoin itself, using its blockchain to create a new product, the downsides of which can only be understood with proper knowledge of \"how, why, and when blockchains work.\"\nWhile not naming specific examples, the allusion appears to be to the controversial Bitcoin Cash hard fork . Meni Rosenfeld continued:\nEven without using any of Bitcoin's innovation, I can create a system that, to the end user, will appear indistinguishable from Bitcoin – greatly outperform it, in fact.\nIt will allow receiving tokens and sending to anyone, easily and quickly, with little to no fees. Of course, it will be completely centralized, and with it will come the associated risks – The system might one day shut down, or start charging high fees or apply censorship.\nBut these are things that might happen in *the future*. They're not things you can observe now.\nLike Song, Rosenfeld also highlighted that a lack of consumer knowledge was driving the financial success of such projects.\nWhat do you think about Meni Rosenfeld's take on Blockchain?

An AI compilation published on Youtube Tuesday that used pre-existing Bitcoin (BTC) explainers to come up with its own “basic stage training” on Bitcoin has resulted in almost complete nonsense, Mashable reports May 22. Created by Botnik Studios , which describes itself on Twitter as a “human-machine creative force,” the Youtube video is a voice over of the texts generated by an AI that used “predictive keyboard trained on dozens of Bitcoin explainers.” In order to introduce the viewer to the coin, the video first explains that “Bitcoin is the most valuable form of electricity.” The AI explainer then teaches the viewer exactly how Bitcoin transactions work according to its generated text: “Randomly pick a number between one and 30,000. Now spend that amount of money on Ethereum . This is known as hashing the code to get some of that Bitcoin.” The video also touches on the topic of blockchain , which a user can gain access to by installing “exploit.bin, and it will remind you every day of your biggest nightmares.” Having Bitcoin - whose most popular form is the “Wild Richard” which can be used to pay for “counterfeit coffee” - is described as having advantages despite its risks: “One benefit of Bitcoin is that you can upload a version of your future self on the darknet, but it will kill your retirement account, because it is over 1,000 years old.” The video ends with two warnings to all viewers, the first being that the “safest way to protect your Bitcoin wallet is simply to lose it,” and the second touching on a more personal subject: “Caution: the last time I mined a fresh Bitcoin, billionaire killer Mark February tried to patent my life.”\nCointelegraph has its own series of explainers that were not created with AI, including ones on Bitcoin , Bitcoin mining , blockchain , and crypto wallets . ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://twitter.com/botnikstudios", "https://mashable.com/2018/05/23/bitcoin-explained-by-ai/", "https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-wallets-explained", "https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-mining", "https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/how-blockchain-technology-works-guide-for-beginners", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBRWJzAjkjk"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "botnik studios", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T12:40:48.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a95f2e9fa394fcc8ce26e4adf3b6b8944be714c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMrEgmVJCkmvpj1Vy10yfuRSngNJs6IYbb0-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6837", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "CNBC.com News", "title": "Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000", "title_full": "Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000", "published": "2018-05-23T20:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a95f2e9fa394fcc8ce26e4adf3b6b8944be714c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMrEgmVJCkmvpj1Vy10yfuRSngNJs6IYbb0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T20:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000", "text": "May 23, 2018 at 13:43 PM EDT Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000 Bitcoin extended a two-week sell off Wednesday, falling below $8,000 to its lowest level since mid April.

There are many great alts out there whose success should not depend on the success of BTC.

If people don't like those pairs then new stable coins can be used and discounts can be offered to traders.\n submitted by /u/dee-thinke\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:33:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f04c94a40b16789c76ea884f8e72bc948de90dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMqiKHOOSLsWB.KEA8kf1H1gNqBE8LELcYU-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6681", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Top News and Analysis (pro)", "title": "Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000", "title_full": "Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000", "published": "2018-05-23T20:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f04c94a40b16789c76ea884f8e72bc948de90dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMqiKHOOSLsWB.KEA8kf1H1gNqBE8LELcYU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T20:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000", "text": "May 23, 2018 at 13:43 PM EDT Bitcoin drops 9%, now back below $8,000 Bitcoin extended a two-week sell off Wednesday, falling below $8,000 to its lowest level since mid April.

To see our extensive list of cryptocurrency sectors, read this post at https://www.tradingheroes.com/cryptocurrency-sectors-cheatsheet/. How do You Buy Cryptocurrencies? First have to go to an exchange or service that will allow you to purchase cryptocurrencies. Some of the bigger exchanges are: Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase. Poloniex at https://poloniex.com/. CEX at https://www.tradingheroes.com/cexio. Bittrex at https://bittrex.com/. Bitfinex at https://www.bitfinex.com/.\nBinance at https://www.tradingheroes.com/binance. LocalBitcoins at https://localbitcoins.com/. Many of them will allow you to use a credit card or link a bank account. As much as possible, do not store your cryptocurrency at the exchanges because they can be hacked. See the cold storage section in this post for details on how to store you coins safely. It’s easy to get Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. But if you want the smaller altcoins, you will have to do an exchange. How to Buy Altcoins. First buy Bitcoin or Ethereum because those are the coins that are most easily transacted against the smaller altcoins. When in doubt, buy Bitcoin. If you want $ 10 of Bitcoin for free, use this link at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase (while supplies last). Then find out where the altcoin that you want is traded. Go to Coinmarketcap at https://coinmarketcap.com/ and click on the coin you want to buy. Next, click on the Markets tab for that coin. For example, here’s where you can get NEM. The Source column will show you the exchanges where this coin is being traded. Notice how most of them are traded against Bitcoin or Ether. Open an account at the most reputable exchange on the list. Once you are in your account, find the “deposit” wallet address for the altcoin you want to buy. Here’s an example from Poloniex. Copy this wallet address.\nNext, login to the account where you bought your Bitcoin or Ether. If you bought it from Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase, then you can go to: Accounts then Send and paste the deposit address into that field. Enter the amount you want to send, then click the send button. It may take some time for the transaction to go through, so be patient. Then you see the balance in your destination exchange account, you are now ready to buy altcoins. Here’s what it would look like when you have a Litecoin balance at Poloniex. This can be found in Balances > Deposits and Withdrawals in Poloniex. Now go to the Exchange area of the website. In Poloniex, it would look like this. Then click on the BTC tab. These are the currencies that you can exchange for Bitcoin. Click on the altcoin that you want to trade. Here’s and example from Civic (CVC). Next, scroll down and look for the buy/sell box. Enter the amount of altcoin that you want to buy. If you want to trade all of your Bitcoin, click on the link at the top with your total balance. Click the Buy button and you are all set. The trade might not happen right away, so check your Orders then My Open Orders page to see the status. The exact process will be different at different exchanges, but the basic idea is the same for all exchange.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-3/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn\n a Video Press Release to MyPR.\n–", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.dash.org/.", "https://storj.io/.", "https://bittrex.com/.", "https://bitcoin.org/en/.", "http://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-4/", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase,", "https://gamecredits.com/.", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase.", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/cryptocurrency-sectors-cheatsheet/.", "https://www.ethereum.org/.", "https://www.stellar.org/.", "https://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-3/", "https://poloniex.com/.", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/binance.", "https://maidsafe.net/.", "https://localbitcoins.com/.", "https://getmonero.org/home.", "https://www.bitfinex.com/.", "http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn", "https://litecoin.org/.", "https://www.reddcoin.com/.", "http://sia.tech/.", "https://coinmarketcap.com/", "https://z.cash/.", "https://ripple.com/.", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase", "https://tether.to/.", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/cexio."], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T21:32:21.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa660f91b1077cfb6095a43f561e0065ef5fd232", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTZ__PEa.fvaX4FXTMLrCmM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin or Silver. where to invest ?", "title_full": "Bitcoin or Silver. where to invest ?", "published": "2018-05-23T20:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa660f91b1077cfb6095a43f561e0065ef5fd232", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTZ__PEa.fvaX4FXTMLrCmM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rupesh2", "published": "2018-05-23T20:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin or Silver. where to invest ?", "text": "Quote: So Bitcoin or Silver which will be a better investment ??

Over the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price dropped by around 4 percent from $8,300 to $7,850.\nBitcoin Price Trend As CCN previously reported , the recent correction of the cryptocurrency market can be attributed to three major factors: Mt. Gox sell-off in early May, Bitfinex taxation policy, and scandal involving South Korea’s two largest cryptocurrency exchanges UPbit and Bithumb.\nThese three factors led investors to lose confidence and trust in the cryptocurrency market in the short-term. By targeting a small portion of their user base to forfeit tax IDs and personal identification, Bitfinex led large-scale investors to become fearful of a potential government intervention and withdrew big sums of funds from the exchange.\nIn South Korea, due to the controversy surrounding UPbit and Bithumb, local investors have become bewildered, not knowing whether the local cryptocurrency market can be trusted or not.\nDespite the drastic improvement in the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency industry and the entrance of major financial institutions, the overly strong downtrend of BTC and other major cryptocurrencies have disallowed the market to rebound and initiate a corrective rally.\nIt is likely that in the short-term, the BTC price drops to the lower end of $7,000, as cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo suggested on May 22.\n“Pretty sure $8,000 support on BTCUSD is gonna fail. Next support, low $7,000s (though that could fail too). Then I’m expecting another dead kitten taking us into July – September period when BTC unwinds completely from mania phase and is ready for an accumulation phase,” said Woo.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of bitcoin has already started to show oversold conditions, which would normally result in a strong rebound for BTC. But, due to the strong downtrend of the bitcoin price, the low RSI of bitcoin will likely be dismissed and bears will continue to push the price to the lower end of $7,000.\nBitcoin has successfully minimized its downtrend at the $7,700 mark, recording a slight bounce back to $7,850. However, if the bitcoin price declines below $7,700, it is likely that the bitcoin price stabilizes in the $7,300 region in the short-term.\nTokens In the cryptocurrency market, trading tokens is similar to leverage trading, because tokens often increase or decline in value by larger margins in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies.\nOntology, Aelf, ICON, 0x, Decentraland, Ziliqa, and AirSwap, all of which have recorded over 20 percent gains against bitcoin over the past week, have recorded losses in the range of 4 to 12 percent against bitcoin and 8 to 16 percent against the US dollar.\nIf the BTC price fails to rebound to the $8,000 region and remains in the lower end of $7,000 throughout this week, it is highly likely that tokens will continue to drop against both bitcoin and US dollar.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Rewinds to $7,800 as Cryptocurrency Market Drops $27 Billion Overnight appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-ethereum-prices-drop-3-in-sluggish-crypto-market-factors-and-trends/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c_N.QqllSMMHTda7u5TMZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjgxO2g9NTc2/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/3638fd6b7a66261edca1944dee303f16);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DAlMAiHuMHluyDFGq36xGA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/06d284841731bcb6beea190457701bd3", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-rewinds-to-7800-as-cryptocurrency-market-drops-27-billion-overnight/", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-rewinds-to-7800-as-cryptocurrency-market-drops-27-billion-overnight/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c_N.QqllSMMHTda7u5TMZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjgxO2g9NTc2/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/3638fd6b7a66261edca1944dee303f16", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-ethereum-prices-drop-3-in-sluggish-crypto-market-factors-and-trends/&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bithumb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:44:48.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6d57703c37916ce338fc3ab412d5ba8d9f4d229", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7IHjMzvsbJyWfJ93Vx6MGC2EXSaKnBC8QDzs1iA4PLpA1_tX26oxRROVXJS7hiQ7BY25CkzqdLjA-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "Is This Why Bitcoin Became So Huge?", "title_full": "Is This Why Bitcoin Became So Huge?

The price seems to have found support around the $7,800 mark that coincides with the support line of the triangle, but the volume is fading and buyers are nowhere to be seen. However, this does not mean that the bears are in full control. Bitcoin (BTC) closed the previous day above the support line after a long tug of war. This did scare most bears which resulting in most closing their Bitcoin Shorts (BTCUSDShorts) to lock in profits. This development was expected considering Bitcoin (BTC) had to go lower to retest the support line. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading closely in a triangle and has almost reached a decision point where it must face life or death. It should be noted here that Bitcoin (BTC) may break below the $7,800 mark but shorting at this point is extremely risky. The correction slope is getting flatter with each cycle of lower highs and lower lows. If Bitcoin ( BTC ) succeeds in forming a higher low around $7,800 or $7,400, we can expect to see a rally to $10,000 from that higher low, most likely before the end of this month. Bitcoin (BTC) has yet to breach a strong support line that appears to be forming a higher low. In most cases, Bitcoin (BTC) has usually fallen below the triangle in which it traded. However, this time around the situation appears to be different. The bearish sentiment is getting weaker by the day as the correction slope flattens signaling a reversal close by. However, serious bullish impetus is yet to be seen. While the bulls may not seem to be around, there is no denying that a lot of investors are waiting to get their hands on Bitcoin (BTC). Many new investors or those who lost money trading cryptocurrencies do not seem to believe in dollar cost averaging. They like to buy in one go. So, most of them are waiting for the price to reach a ‘perfect bottom’ so they can buy in, being oblivious to the fact that a lot of other buyers are thinking the same thing. Anyway, institutional money has to see ample signs of not just the bear trend being over but also the bull trend to begin before they get involved. However, one thing is clear that a lot of buyers are waiting to get in. The bulls did give the bears some hard time at the previous day’s close which scared most bears into closing their shorts resulting in BTCUSDSHORTS breaking and closing below an important support line. The next candle also remained below for a long time until it turned back green and rose above the support line again. In times like these, Bitcoin (BTC) bulls seem to be around but they are not stepping up. It would be unwise for Bitcoin (BTC) bears to underestimate that for a lack of buying interest and go short. As we recently saw, the market makers allowed bears to take control so they could open shorts on exchanges like Bitmex. As soon as BTCUSDSHORTS peaked, a massive Bitcoin (BTC) pump followed which put most bears out of their positions. It is extremely risky to short Bitcoin (BTC) unless you are a market maker, because long term even most bears know that the price is going to go up. We should also bear in mind that exchanges have a lot of influence to manipulate the price and most of the time they play margin traders like a fiddle. They might appear to do nothing to lure the bears in to think they are in control but soon as they put their money on shorts, the price shoots up. Some exchanges also work closely with market makers if they don’t want to get their own hands dirty. However, the fact remains that we are in an unregulated market and most exchanges do this because their livelihood depends on it. If Bitcoin (BTC) were to fall to $4,000 and continue trading in a close range for the next 2 years, chances are most people will forget about Bitcoin (BTC) and that would put them out of business.\nCryptodaily ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:32:00.043+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9900d0a8500cca8432c7626229f5d0d294fc5e49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzIfYX2ipbA3Toz51gTBV5Uw4SIlaif2UgZfkxfkZ1ImAHWYual41CP6h.5XJKRVTaqgtWY90sRc6R2KBBxThbMnTSlOloKW0Pckex1eUv6tQRj_g8E0OUM", "site_full": "fox17online.com", "site": "fox17online.com", "site_section": "http://fox17online.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Bitcoin used to buy 2 pizzas in 2010 now worth $82 million – Fox17", "title": "Bitcoin used to buy 2 pizzas in 2010 now worth $82 million", "title_full": "Bitcoin used to buy 2 pizzas in 2010 now worth $82 million", "published": "2018-05-23T20:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9900d0a8500cca8432c7626229f5d0d294fc5e49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzIfYX2ipbA3Toz51gTBV5Uw4SIlaif2UgZfkxfkZ1ImAHWYual41CP6h.5XJKRVTaqgtWY90sRc6R2KBBxThbMnTSlOloKW0Pckex1eUv6tQRj_g8E0OUM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bob Brenzing", "published": "2018-05-23T20:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin used to buy 2 pizzas in 2010 now worth $82 million", "text": "Hallmark may need to update its official list of holidays .\nTuesday was Bitcoin Pizza Day, or what Business Insider calls “the most celebrated day in crypto,” marking the eighth anniversary of when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made what’s thought to be the very first purchase with bitcoin.\nThat purchase, per Quartz : two large pizzas from Papa John’s for 10,000 bitcoins, an amount worth about $30 back then.

I think that the market shows that it is not ready to go higher quite yet, and that it’s likely to reach towards the $8000 level next. That’s an area that has been massive support recently, so I think that we will continue to see a bit of buying pressure there. If we were to break down below the $8000 level, at that point I anticipate that the $7500 level would be targeted. In the short term, I believe that it is going to be difficult to break above the $9000 level. That level being broken to the upside would be very bullish, but I doubt we are going to see that in the short term. I think that the market certainly has a lot of negativity attached to it, but I’m not looking for a major move in either direction anytime soon. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nBitcoin fell against the Japanese yen during the day, but unlike the US dollar, we did get a bit of a bounce to form a hammer. The hammer is of course a bullish sign, so I think we may get a bit of a divergence between these pairs today. If we can break above the top of the hammer for the session on Monday, then I think that the market could go higher, perhaps to the ¥950,000 level. Otherwise, if we break down below the bottom of the hammer, then the market will probably unwind a bit to reach down towards the ¥925,000 level initially, perhaps even down to the ¥900,000 level over the longer-term. I anticipate that this market will continue to be very noisy, and perhaps without any sense of clarity. \\n\\n\n\\n\nOriginal Source DailyForex provides daily fundamental and technical analysis and signals for those looking to trade based on trends in the currency markets.

Obtaining this much hashpower is incredibly expensive — even on a smaller network like bitcoin gold — but it can be monetized by using it in tandem with a double spend attack.\nAfter gaining control of the network, the attacker began depositing BTG at cryptocurrency exchanges while also attempting to send those same coins to a wallet under their control. Ordinarily, the blockchain would resolve this by including only the first transaction in the block, but the attacker was able to reverse transactions since they had majority control of the network.\nConsequently, they were able to deposit funds on exchanges and quickly withdraw them again, after which they reversed the initial transaction so that they could send the coins they had originally deposited to another wallet.\nSource: BTG Explorer A bitcoin gold address implicated in the attack has received more than 388,200 BTG since May 16 (mostly from transactions it sent to itself). Assuming all of those transactions were associated with the double spend exploit, the attacker could have stolen as much as $18.6 million worth of funds from exchanges.\nThe last transaction was sent on May 18, but the attacker could theoretically attempt to resume it if they still have access to enough hashpower to gain control of the blockchain.\nBitcoin gold’s developers advised exchanges to address the attack by increasing the number of confirmations required before they credit deposits to customer accounts. Blockchain data indicates that the attacker successfully reversed transactions as far back as 22 blocks, leading developers to advise raising confirmation requirements to 50 blocks.\nAt present, bitcoin gold ranks as the 26th-largest cryptocurrency, with a circulating market cap of $827 million.\nBitcoin gold is at least the third cryptocurrency network hit with a major attack in the past week alone.\nAs CCN reported, a miner manipulated two of privacy coin verge’s five hashing algorithms to maliciously mine more than 35 million XVG — worth ~$1.75 million — in just a few hours. Previously, Japanese cryptocurrency monacoin was hit by an apparent block withholding attack after a miner gained as much as 57 percent of the network’s hashrate.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edward iskra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold network", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T03:00:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4b7820b0711557ae11f0a36c7faa0f86f0019bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZRfozyAvBxPifT2iFOWauIMtVmy4SsVqXkG.VtA270Tggk40iYYjCMcB2xIW9vexgQ-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Op-ed: China Ranked [51% Attack] Verge and Bitcoin at #13 in Blockchain List", "title_full": "Op-ed: China Ranked [51% Attack] Verge and Bitcoin at #13 in Blockchain List", "published": "2018-05-23T20:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4b7820b0711557ae11f0a36c7faa0f86f0019bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZRfozyAvBxPifT2iFOWauIMtVmy4SsVqXkG.VtA270Tggk40iYYjCMcB2xIW9vexgQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T20:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Op-ed: China Ranked [51% Attack] Verge and Bitcoin at #13 in Blockchain List", "text": "Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nOn May 22, CCN reported that Verge (XVG), a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, fell victim to yet another 51 percent attack. Altcoin mining pool operator Suprnova revealed that an individual or an organization has invalidated legitimate blocks.\nVerge Attack “Verge is once again under attack, someone is 51%’ing the chain and invalidating all legit blocks. All pools and miners suffer from this, the attacker is getting all blocks currently,” said Suprnova.\nAccording to ocminer, the attacked gained two mining algorithms known as scrypt and lyra2re with almost no difficulty and utilized fake timestamps to trick the network. Consequently, the attacker has been able to invalidate many legitimate blocks and take over the network. Within a few hour span, the attacker gained more than $1.75 million, approximately 35 million XVG.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether the attack can be described as a 51% attack given that the attacker did not have to gain 51 percent of the Verge network’s computing power to steal millions of dollars worth of XVG.\nSome members of the Verge community claimed that it was a time warp modified vector attack, which is a vulnerability that needs to be addressed by the Verge development team in the near future to prevent similar attacks. Describing the case as a time warp vector attack would make more sense, as the attack was able to gain control over the network with virtually no difficulty.\nImpossible With Bitcoin Recently, the Chinese government released its public blockchain rankings and ranked Verge and Bitcoin at number 13. The ranking of bitcoin, the most robust blockchain network with the longest track record at 13 with Verge outraged the bitcoin community.\nBitcoin is highly unlikely to suffer the same fate. The core difference between bitcoin and other altcoins and smaller blockchain networks as explained by security expert and bitcoin researcher Andreas Antonopoulos is that bitcoin’s computing power eliminates the possibility of 51 percent attacks. While state-sponsored attacks could be possible with billions of dollars in resources, it is highly unlikely and can be dealt with ease.\nAntonopoulos explained:\n“I don’t worry about that [51% attack on bitcoin] at all. This cannot be done with bitcoin anymore. This is something that could only be done with nascent altcoins. Bitcoin has achieved a level of computing that no single nation-state can overthrow it with computation alone. The effort to do so would require a massive covert operation of chip fabrication then the coordinated assault that would give them dominance over the next block for 10 minutes until we kick those bastards off the network, rework the protocol around them, they would be revealed, they would have lost a billion dollars doing this and all they got to do is one double spend.”\nThe Verge blockchain network attack, which was caused by a vulnerability, has shown that blockchain networks with long records like bitcoin and Ethereum are significantly more secure because they have dealt with vulnerabilities in the past, building resilience and strength.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "suprnova", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T03:00:05.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d07ae3806ec461e9c377a3d633a314c756a0d629", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQf.MAq8o.cpXieRJvxRk7I-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why is it so hard to understand bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why is it so hard to understand bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-23T20:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.036, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d07ae3806ec461e9c377a3d633a314c756a0d629", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQf.MAq8o.cpXieRJvxRk7I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Analea1", "published": "2018-05-23T20:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why is it so hard to understand bitcoin?", "text": "What do you think ? , is bitcoin really hard to understand?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:27:59.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "161b8f8a47b5f7b05a49e05c2438b46b2d1e733f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd0W4nuwiXj4n37RYsJkQKA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin subject in the school?", "title_full": "Bitcoin subject in the school?", "published": "2018-05-23T20:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.054, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "161b8f8a47b5f7b05a49e05c2438b46b2d1e733f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd0W4nuwiXj4n37RYsJkQKA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Onanana", "published": "2018-05-23T20:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin subject in the school?", "text": "This is a revolutionary steppingstone to the present and future generations in education curriculum.
