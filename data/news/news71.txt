This thought came to my mind as well that the speed these computers will be possessing, can boost almost n times the mining speed as well as confirmation speeds to such levels where even these ASICs would fail. If bitcoin is so vulnerable to quantum computing (and as many of us think that this vulnerability has been stocked in intentionally), what could be the best option to stop such attacks which will have the power end up an era started to promote anonymity? Can official institutions commit such (baseless crimes) just to eat everything from everyone? But then, there comes a question of trust. Who will trade any of these things?

But even though I do not seem willing to use bitcoin as payment, it is better to use as an investment.\nBitcoin price is volatile and I oppose to use it for payment because when you can invest because t and gain profit which can help you to earn more.

The communication gap between the West and China makes it hard to disentangle,” said Wilcox. Cake Dusted Miners\nOne group of miners claimed on QQ, one of China’s most widely utilized social media platforms, that the recently distributed B3 Miner of Bitmain have “seriously inadequate” computing power that are unable to mine cryptocurrencies at a similar rate as previous batches.\nThe group also released a photograph of a B3 Miner filled with dust as shown below, suggesting that the mining equipment were used before, prior to distributing them to clients.\nIn response, the Bitmain team explained that it has verified with its internal department on several occasions and found that 100 ASIC miners had minor issues. Bitmain emphasized that the issue was minor given that it ships 10,000 units per batch and only 1 percent of the distributed mining equipment were impacted.\n“Among the right defenders, some are refunded and after an investigation, it was revealed that some are still underpowered and some are repaired. Some media outlets claimed that a few hundred people have received mining equipment that are poorly functioning. This is not the case,” said Bitmain in a statement loosely translated from Chinese.\nThe Bitmain team added that it is not possible to manufacture every ASIC miner perfectly and some minor errors could emerge along the way. The company emphasized that miners who receive imperfect equipment will always be compensated and it has already compensated miners who received underperforming B3 Miners recently.\n“Any product can be imperfect, and there will be shortcomings in the process of enterprise development. We have also compensated the miners who have received mining equipment with inadequate computing power and the mining equipment are now being run properly. We are not offering empty cheques. There must be a process. For miners with insufficient power, there are relevant compensation policies. We have been negotiating this compensation policy,” the company said. Miner Compensation From Bitmain\nBitmain is a multi-billion dollar conglomerate with a valuation estimated at around $5 to $10 billion. It also has established a large-scale investment firm targeting tokens, blockchain projects, ICOs, and cryptocurrency businesses.\nMost recently, Bitmain led a $110 million round to back Circle , a US-based cryptocurrency and blockchain company, to assist the firm in launching its own stablecoin.\nBitmain founder Jihan Wu said in an interview that the company envisions a future with private central banks, without the dominance of government-backed institutions.\n“It’s a very important enabler for a private central bank. Currencies can do good or bad things, so we need a certain framework to limit money laundering risks. If we have an open platform we can limit the potential negative things,” Wu said.\nBitmain has evolved into a major cryptocurrency conglomerate with branches and subsidiaries within it, so the company will likely not risk its reputation to save tens of thousands of dollars and refrain from compensating miners.\nThe firm has clarified that it intends to fully compensate miners if additional problems emerge in the future and it will work with its internal departments to improve its compensation policy.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zooko wilcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilcox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zerocoin electric coin company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T06:04:56.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "79e49ad33dc7e932a1429f4847e6275a988a07b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbJsHRL_rqT1GjPifq_9P0k-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "China plans closing Bitcoin mining.", "title_full": "China plans closing Bitcoin mining.", "published": "2018-06-01T22:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "79e49ad33dc7e932a1429f4847e6275a988a07b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbJsHRL_rqT1GjPifq_9P0k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gathel", "published": "2018-06-01T22:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "China plans closing Bitcoin mining.", "text": "China plans to close its bitcoin-producing mine by making electricity consumption more wasteful and includes risky investments.

However, investors should be wary of making any investments too hastily. Cryptocurrencies are more complicated than just making a traditional stock market investment.\nWhile there is certainly money to be made in the world of cryptocurrency, it’s still important to weigh all of the pros and cons before making any sizeable Bitcoin investment . We’ll go over these, and then a short summary over the state of cryptocurrency, and some potential problems you may face if you choose to make an investment.\nBitcoin investment Pros and Cons\nPros Investors have actual ownership of their investments Volatility can lead to big profits for smart investors Low supply helps to avoid inflation, offering a store of value It can never be confiscated from you if it’s privately stored The most popular base currency which nearly all alt coins trade against\nCons Prices can go down just as quickly as they went up Cryptocurrencies don’t come with insurance policies Small mistakes can lead to lost funds Future regulations may impact the price\nBitcoin is still extremely volatile\nThis is both a selling point and also a harsh reality of trading cryptocurrencies. Without the violent price swings, nobody would be able to make any money, and when that swing is in an upward direction, everyone celebrates. However, that same volatility is also responsible for the downward spirals that will knock the wind right out of you. The loss is painful, and it’s a lot harder than it looks to keep holding when your portfolio is slowly melting.\nNew investors who are looking to become cryptocurrency investors should know that you’ll need a very strong stomach for it. If you’re the type of person who will obsess over every little dip and constantly check your portfolio every five minutes, then crypto markets will likely drive you insane. There are many ups and downs, and for many people, it can be sickening to watch.\nA Bitcoin investment requires your protection\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is not like putting your money into the stock market or a bank. These are free market assets, and that means that you are responsible for securing them. There is no insurance policy to return your funds to you if you make a mistake.\nIf you’re new to cryptocurrency, then you may not be aware that something as simple as sending your coins to an incorrect wallet address can result in a total loss of your funds. For this reason, when you’re sending your funds to your wallet, it’s important to be extra careful when doing so.\nWhat’s worse is that there are many other dangers here to look out for. Scammers are out to steal your investment at every turn, and investors must be diligent to avoid phishing sites or malware which could result in their wallets being compromised.\nYou must also make sure to store your assets in a reputable wallet, and you’ll need to create a backup of said wallet in a safe place. If you do not and your host machine stops working then you’ll have no way to regain access to your investment, and your funds will be lost.\nRegulations surrounding these assets are not set in stone\nAnother looming issue with digital currencies is that regulations have not been completely established for them. That means that world governments could change their stance on them, making it harder on investors to participate in the market. Since cryptocurrency trading moves heavily on various news items, this could potentially be disastrous for the price of any cryptocurrency asset.\nThe exchanges may end up being shut down or heavily restricted, or some short-sighted lawmakers may try to impose legislation against these alternative currencies that is very damaging.\nWhen investing in new technology, you are taking a definite risk. In the case of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, we still don’t know what the future has in store, and how desperate that governments will become in an effort to control them. On the flip side of this coin, some see these regulations as the only way for Bitcoin to truly gain a mainstream audience and gain worldwide usage.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T07:55:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45071041b8f92ed912474c85ede7ade7eb6bac9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_qWoPCOq9ULr9b.p3ndH0t1IvF6yb56O7zYvHVYIBeAOjgFCtgZ04_IzrZc8OIUDIHW_nC_xty1j0fFuzkl_NSLhnF0Y0nTF97ICI41TU1hBR2ZooIulesBEn4w7XxNSeryohE.hccjQ--", "site_full": "www.prepaidphonenews.com", "site": "prepaidphonenews.com", "site_section": "http://www.prepaidphonenews.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Prepaid Phone News", "title": "If only I could mine bitcoin with them...", "title_full": "If only I could mine bitcoin with them...", "published": "2018-06-01T22:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 87417, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45071041b8f92ed912474c85ede7ade7eb6bac9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_qWoPCOq9ULr9b.p3ndH0t1IvF6yb56O7zYvHVYIBeAOjgFCtgZ04_IzrZc8OIUDIHW_nC_xty1j0fFuzkl_NSLhnF0Y0nTF97ICI41TU1hBR2ZooIulesBEn4w7XxNSeryohE.hccjQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-01T22:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "If only I could mine bitcoin with them...", "text": "If only I could mine bitcoin with them...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T22:41:30.057+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59e782c72c08f16e2935c778ecb610f1ce61afe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqx69noRD73Z7WYxCLdBnggStS0IeIyXddBwW_5RItNNovteGY.0Y6H4IPVKKoH5Ek1wY7FyNnrnOMcgT2Jrpm2vKEl7Tj55YX4x8UQT2j376F.3fTJ3zzX_xiQ2X6yB1w9WAIfGp5cOtKxJLpl1G1U", "site_full": "buzzfixtoday.online", "site": "buzzfixtoday.online", "site_section": "http://buzzfixtoday.online/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BuzzFix Today (News All Day, Updated, Without Spin)", "title": "Bitcoin price: Expert says bitcoin, ethereum and Ripple could soon SURGE for THIS reason", "title_full": "Bitcoin price: Expert says bitcoin, ethereum and Ripple could soon SURGE for THIS reason", "published": "2018-06-01T22:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59e782c72c08f16e2935c778ecb610f1ce61afe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqx69noRD73Z7WYxCLdBnggStS0IeIyXddBwW_5RItNNovteGY.0Y6H4IPVKKoH5Ek1wY7FyNnrnOMcgT2Jrpm2vKEl7Tj55YX4x8UQT2j376F.3fTJ3zzX_xiQ2X6yB1w9WAIfGp5cOtKxJLpl1G1U", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-06-01T22:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price: Expert says bitcoin, ethereum and Ripple could soon SURGE for THIS reason", "text": "Business | By admin Bitcoin price: Expert says bitcoin, ethereum and Ripple could soon SURGE for THIS reason\nThe finance expert studied bitcoin , ethereum and Ripple and found that a bullish mid-term event could be in store as the cryptocurrencies continue to attract buyers.\nWriting for FXStreet , Mr Salles said: “Investors might be a bit out of place with the shy rises being registered during this week, after being used to big ranges in the Crypto sphere.\n“There is no reason to be concerned. This is an opportunity to see less explosive developments, but much more sustainable.\n“With the Cryptos in consolidation mode, a less volatile behaviour might be a very important factor for a more solid bull market.”\nBitcoin price stood at £7,419.56 at 19:15 (BST) on Friday, according to CoinDesk. It saw its highest value before Christmas when it reached the monumental price of just under $20,000.\nMr Salles said there is a “bullish lateral action with buyers increasing their positions is the most likely scenario” for bitcoin.\nFocussing on a BTC/USD price chart, he added: “The Directional Movement Index is matching the exact bullish pattern.\n“Buyers are still moving above the ADX while sellers diminish their strength and are trading below the trend strength indicator. There is room for bullish developments.”\nFor ethereum , Mr Salles said the profile is “weaker” than in bitcoin’s case but the Directional Movement Index is similar between the two cryptocurrencies, despite ethereum showing “less advanced” development.\nThe finance expert also said Ripple is trading “very close” to a clean scenario that might allow a “gradually bullish development”.\nCryptocurrencies have faced criticism by banks and finance experts, with billionaire Bill Gates telling CNBC he would bet against the bitcoin and short it if he could.\nThe Microsoft co-founder said: “As an asset class, you’re not producing anything and so you shouldn’t expect it to go up.

The Top Cryptocurrency News for June 1 The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether a number of large investors have been able to manipulate the price of Bitcoin.

He argues that cryptocurrencies could reduce demand for fiat reserve currencies, which could impact a country's economy in the future.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe market capitalization of the crypto world has increased by about $25 billion since May 29. The Italian political crisis and the probable escalation of a trade war have attracted investors back into cryptocurrencies. Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital Management believes that Bitcoin has made a bottom for the year. He proposes to buy now when the prices are still low, to benefit from the ensuing rally in the next few months. We have been voicing a similar opinion for the past few days but we believe that the purchases should be staggered to take advantage of the volatility. Bitcoin continues to be the undeniable leader. It sets the direction that is followed by most altcoins. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple believes that once the crypto markets mature, they will start differentiating between the digital currencies and the correlation with Bitcoin will reduce. He, however, warned that 99 percent of the virtual currencies in circulation will vanish in about a decade. Only the ones that solve a real problem will remain. There have been a few complains that we don’t mention the fundamentals in our analysis. In technical analysis, we believe that the charts discount all the fundamental news. Hence, we only read the patterns on the chart and try to forecast the probable direction. In the past few months, these patterns have kept us on the right side of the trade and have helped us avoid large losses. We try to avoid trading during major events, due to the uncertainty. Let’s see, what direction are the charts pointing to today. BTC/USD We believe that Bitcoin is trading in a large range of $6,075.04 to $12,172.43. The strategy to trade such a large range is to buy near the bottom and sell close to the top. So, we have been waiting to buy on a sharp dip below $7,000, as close to the bottom of the range as possible, so that our risk is less. If the $6,075.04 level breaks, the digital currency can fall to $5,450 levels. The BTC/USD pair is presently facing resistance at the downtrend line. Even if this level is crossed, it will again face resistance close to the 20-day EMA. Once this level is crossed, a move to the 50-day SMA is possible. We retain our preference to buy on a sharp dip but only after the fall is arrested. Therefore, we suggest waiting for a couple of days to get better clarity. ETH/USD Ethereum has been gradually rising, moving towards the 20-day EMA where it will face a stiff resistance. Just above the 20-day EMA is the resistance line of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA, which will also act as a major hurdle. On the downside, the intraday low of May 28 at $492.5 will act as a strong support. If this level holds, we shall consider long positions but if the level breaks, a fall to $464.65 is probable. We don’t find any buy setups at the current levels, hence, we are not proposing any trade on the ETH/USD pair. XRP/USD Ripple formed a doji candlestick pattern on May 30 and followed it up with an insider day candlestick pattern on May 31. Today also, the digital currency is on track to form a doji. This shows uncertainty among the traders. The XRP/USD pair fell below the 20-day EMA on May 08 and has sustained below it ever since. If the next dip holds above $0.54, it will indicate buying at lower levels. We suggest waiting for this retest to hold before buying on a rebound above the 20-day EMA. If the bears break below $0.54, the decline can extend to $0.45. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has not been able to find buyers after rising above the downtrend line. It formed a doji on May 30, followed it up with an inside day on May 31 and is likely to make another doji today. The BCH/USD pair has a tendency to trade in a tight range for a few days before making a decisive move. On the upside, the 20-day EMA will act as a resistance, above which a rally to the 50-day SMA is possible. On the downside, $878 and $750 are the supports to watch out for. We suggest waiting for the price to sustain above the 20-day EMA for initiating any long positions. EOS/USD EOS has a major event coming up on June 02 with its Mainnet launch. It is difficult to predict the price action after such an important event. Due to the uncertainty, we shall not suggest any trade on it. However, we shall mention the important levels to watch out for, both on the upside and the downside. Since May 23, the EOS/USD pair is stuck in a range between $10.3384-$12.9870. A breakout and close above $13 gives it a minimum target objective of $15.6356, which can extend to $18.67 because there is no major resistance once $15.15 is crossed. On a breakdown from the range, the digital currency can slide to $7.6898. LTC/USD Litecoin is struggling to find buyers even at the current levels. It has failed to break out of the downtrend line for the past two days. The LTC/USD pair has strong resistances between the downtrend line and $127. We shall turn positive only if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $127. Above this level, the digital currency should quickly move up to $140 and above it to the downtrend line of the descending triangle at $158 levels. If the digital currency fails to rally above $127, it will remain range bound between $107-$127 for the next few days. We shall wait for a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $127 before recommending a long position. ADA/USD The 20-day EMA and the horizontal line at $0.23 are acting as a strong resistance. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of this level, Cardano should pick up momentum and rally to the 50-day SMA and above it to $0.35. The traders can enter long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.23 and the stops can be kept below the May 28 intraday lows. If the ADA/USD pair returns from the current levels, it will find a strong buying support at $0.17. If the level fails to hold, it can slide to the bottom of the range at $0.13. We suggest buying only 50 percent of the desired allocation above $0.23 because volatility will remain high inside the range. XLM/USD Stellar has sustained above the downtrend line for the past three days, which is a positive indication. It is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA but has not given up much ground, which shows that the bulls are not keen to book profits at this level. On a close above the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair should rally to the 50-day SMA, followed by a move to $0.385. The traders can initiate long positions once the price closes (UTC time frame) above the 20-day EMA. The stop loss can be kept below the recent lows. On the downside, a break below the May 29 intraday low of $0.24288 can sink the digital currency to $0.184. IOTA/USD Contrary to our expectation , IOTA easily broke out of $1.63 and the 20-day EMA on May 31. It is currently at the 50-day SMA but considering the strong momentum, it looks like the rally will extend to $2.2117. We anticipate a strong resistance at $2.2117 levels. Any correction from $2.2117 will have a strong support at $1.63. If the bulls force a break out of $2.2117, likelihood of the start of a new uptrend increase, which has a minimum target objective of $3.5084. There is a minor resistance at $2.6977 but we believe that it will be crossed this time. Therefore, we shall wait for a break out of $2.2117 levels or wait for a dip to $1.63 levels to enter long positions. We don’t find any trade setup at the current levels; hence, we are not suggesting a trade on the IOTA/USD pair.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The new website Bitcoincashers.org plans to bring “everything Bitcoin Cash under one roof” showcasing the cryptocurrency as a fast and reliable payment method.\nAlso read: Brisbane International is Now the World’s First Crypto-Friendly Airport The Bitcoin Cash Fund (BCF) wants to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and its new website Bitcoincashers.org plans to solidify this philosophy. The BCF organization explains that the new web portal aims to educate businesses and individuals worldwide, not only on how the cryptocurrency works, but the site will explain how people can use the decentralized asset every day.\nMoreover, BCF details that the website will also be a general resource for things like exchanges, meetups, and bounties. Bitcoincashers.org will feature a ‘For Merchants’ page that will focus on a resource for businesses, and the site will detail the very basics of using bitcoin like buying, earning, trading, and spending.\n“We’re excited that Bitcoincashers.org will assist consumers and businesses to use Bitcoin Cash anytime, anywhere,” says Paul Wasensteiner, board member of Bitcoin Cash Fund. Bitcoin Cash is digital money that offers better features than traditional fiat cash.\nVendors in places like Venezuela and other high-inflation environments are starting to use BCH to make payments without having to go through a third party such as a bank, government or payment service. Bitcoincashers.org will feature a vast resource section of Bitcoin Cash wallets alongside available Point-of-Sale (PoS) systems. BCF says the organization recognizes the need for an all-in-one swiss army knife website dedicated to Bitcoin Cash, and they believe BitcoinCashers.org will be an excellent vehicle towards on-ramping mass Bitcoin Cash adoption.

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nOf course bitcoin is more risky , but bitcoin is more profitable.

But Here’s Why ICOs and VC Funding to Crypto Is Breaking Records", "text": "The value of cryptocurrency poster child Bitcoin may be flagging heading into the second half of 2018, but excitement in the space only appears to be increasing—at least, when considering venture capital funding and initial coin offerings (ICOs) during the first half of 2018.\nIndeed—if 2017 was a windfall for Bitcoin owners, 2018 has so far been a nightmare. The cryptocurrency has shed roughly 50% in value since the new year and is now at about $7,400, far from its all-time high of $20,000 in December. Similarly, jobs listings related to Bitcoin and blockchain appear to have followed the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency’s price .\nAmid the dark days for crypto enthusiasts, however, are signs that investors still believe that cryptocurrency trading will continue to grow, and are also betting on the future of its underlying technology—blockchain.\nTake venture capital funding that goes to early-stage, often highly risky, startups, as an example. Globally, venture investors poured in $964 million into blockchain or cryptocurrency-related startups in 2017. Now, not even half way through 2018, investors have already exceeded the prior year’s funding by plowing $1.4 billion into such startups.\nThough cryptocurrency values have fallen 46% to $329 billion according to CoinMarketCap , venture capitalists such as David Pakman, a partner at Venrock, still think trading of such assets will rise in the long run.\n“There is so much institutional money waiting” for a properly regulated cryptocurrency exchange, said Pakman, whose firm struck a partnership recently with New York-based firm CoinFund, which helps entrepreneurs build startups using blockchain . “We’re not watching the price of the cryptocurrencies as a barometer of the health of the industry. We are wondering which projects will gain large market share, and what new problems they may solve.”\nMuch of those gains in venture capital funding have also been driven by investors who see promise in blockchain, a database held by multiple parties that updates in real time, says Nizar Tarhuni, associate director of research and analysis at PitchBook. Developers have looked into using blockchain to solve a host of problems, from tracking pork and diamonds to solving the refugee crisis .\nWith increasing regulatory scrutiny on ICOs, which became popular in 2017 as a way for startups to raise funds more cheaply and quickly, some investors may also be looking instead to get into crypto by funding companies through more traditional means such as venture capital, says Andy Tang, managing director at Draper Dragon Fund.\n“We see more investors investing in equity rather than tokens themselves. Because tokens are still a grey area in the U.S. Equities are not,” he said.\nThat continued bullishness in the crypto space has led to the four largest venture capital deals in the industry yet, including a $133 million fundraise for Basis, a firm creating a coin with a set value , and $122 million to R3, an enterprise blockchain startup, according to PitchBook data.\nBut here lies the paradox. Despite this increased regulatory scrutiny in nations such as the U.S . and China , fundraising from ICOs has only risen since last year.\nThe hot new thing of 2017, initial coin offerings were billed as a way to raise startup funding quickly, and cheaply—cutting out advisors and middlemen. But government officials have questioned issuers’ claims that some ICOs don’t involve equity stakes, and therefore are not subject to more onerous securities regulations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has recently cracked down on the space, while the Chinese government has sought to ban ICOs outright .\nStill, investors and ICO issuers have continued seemingly without concern in 2018. Investors have poured $9.2 billion year-to-date into ICOs, according to Coinschedule, into a total of 343 offerings so far. Notably, Coinschedule also includes pre-sales, such as that of secure messaging platform Telegram’s massive $1.7 billion raise.\nThat dollar amount this year dwarfs what ICOs raised a year earlier: about $3.9 billion spread across 210 deals.\nSo who is investing in ICOs? Mostly investors outside of the U.S. and China, says Coinschedule CEO Alex Buelau, in countries with more ICO-friendly regulations.\n“Most ICOs now have a clause that you can’t be an American or a Chinese investor to be a part of this ICO,” he said. “So now ICOs are based out of Singapore, Estonia, Malta, or Gibraltar.”\nIn some cases, governments, such as Venezuela, have even embraced cryptocurrency, with the country’s $735 million pre-sale of Petro coin, a digital currency pegged to the price of oil, now considered the second largest ICO of the year.\nLess regulatory oversight though, may not always be a positive sign. Included in Coinschedule’s ICO figures may be fundraises by startups with shoddy track records, buoyed by investors who similarly, may not have the best experience to make such investment decisions. Meanwhile, the infrastructure to deal with hackers and scammers seeking to get a piece of ICO funds is still weak. During the anticipated $4 billion EOS ICO, which is set to conclude 7 p.m. Friday, some investors said they had fallen prey to phishing scams .\nAnd there lies the flip side to the increasing funds moving into crypto. The bottom line for venture capitalists: Early stage companies are risky, and much of the dollars going in may never come out.\n“There’s high amounts of early stage speculation in cryptocurrency startups that could be really risky,” said Pakman. “And a bunch of those projects could never ship, or ship and end in failure.“\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/", "https://textio.ai/dont-think-hiring-language-changes-watch-the-effect-of-the-bitcoin-craze-in-this-chart-c235d69d4be3", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wan chai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucinda shen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miguel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T23:14:08.049+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e5685617403548a33e913bac7977dde6afb1602", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRxByhJ2we55ddXcEVyBPgHx_e655nnLWkd440MTayjLFMJbwDFDsWwz9MdUf4_.ppnaoaz0r5SWAzNyWo_.m4u0LFEUca_iutLUAejnDPU_g--", "site_full": "autobloglobal.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://autobloglobal.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Auto Blog Global", "title": "Bitcoin price: Expert says bitcoin, ethereum and Ripple could soon SURGE for THIS reason", "title_full": "Bitcoin price: Expert says bitcoin, ethereum and Ripple could soon SURGE for THIS reason", "published": "2018-06-01T21:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e5685617403548a33e913bac7977dde6afb1602", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRxByhJ2we55ddXcEVyBPgHx_e655nnLWkd440MTayjLFMJbwDFDsWwz9MdUf4_.ppnaoaz0r5SWAzNyWo_.m4u0LFEUca_iutLUAejnDPU_g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lobo Dz.

Or think of satellite access. Talking to a Bitcoin exchange to obtain coins doesn't require much bandwidth. Paying such an exchange could be an issue if, e.g. the banking system closely monitors all parties involved in credit card transactions. But there may be other ways of paying an outside exchange.\nWhat means could be used to ban access to outside exchanges, and how effective can they be?\nRunning an exchange inside the country\nObviously such an exchange could only trade coins that are already inside the country if points (1) and (3) cannot be overcome, as far as one can talk about locality of coins in a meaningful sense. Is there anything that could prevent anyone running an exchange by means of splitting the coins already in possession for accepting cash, at an ad hoc spot that frequently changes?\nBanning the Bitcoin network itself\nPorts can be closed by ISPs etc., but that can be circumvented by simply using ports that must be open (HTTP(S), FTP, IMAP)). As with point (1), there can be simple makeshift ways of obtaining the blockchain from the outside, and transferring blocks with transactions from inside the country back into the blockchain.\nAs with point (1), what means could be used here, and how effective can they be? Also, how can mining be effectively banned?\nBringing coins into the country\nAssuming there are no travel restrictions, so they can go overseas, obtain coins there and bring them into the country, either electronically disguised or encrypted on their devices, or as paper wallets that can easily be hidden.\nWhat systems must be in place to prevent physical import of coins? How useful or practical are physical coins (I know they are not very secure, but that's not the point here), provided they can be inserted into electronic wallets again?\nPayment\nObviously, officially registered businesses could not accept Bitcoin (at least not officially), but coins could easily be transferred from person to person once (1) is solved, provided they have the means to setup nodes and inject transactions into the blockchain.\nHow could a ban private to private even work? Is it even practical to impose such a ban?\nIt would be great if anyone could answer these questions also in the context of nations that are contentious or outright hostile towards Bitcoin, such as Mainland China, India, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Ecuador, Bolivia, Algeria etc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T00:37:13.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e5ed8c8405aede09e97c0cb77d73da7304f7247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TcMIB0mg1.BvvUYPAKFyinqr87sUQYElEe8FUpGue9rL1ZZ2.XrF59bxrSI.sJsI-", "site_full": "www.gamekyo.com", "site": "gamekyo.com", "site_section": "http://www.gamekyo.com/boards_games.html", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Gamekyo : magazine social des jeux vidéo", "title": "free bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining", "title_full": "Gamekyo : free bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining", "published": "2018-06-01T21:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53617, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e5ed8c8405aede09e97c0cb77d73da7304f7247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TcMIB0mg1.BvvUYPAKFyinqr87sUQYElEe8FUpGue9rL1ZZ2.XrF59bxrSI.sJsI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jjake669712", "published": "2018-06-01T21:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "free bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining", "text": "free bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining\nfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining\nfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining\nfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining\nfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin miningfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin miningfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin miningfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin miningfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin miningfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining\nfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining\nfree bitcoin cloud mining-Btcminespool.com-free bitcoin mining\nFree Bitcoin - free 0. 200 BTC every hour!

Ethereum assets into cash loans with Kambo Jun 2, 2018\nKambo Allows Investors to Use Blockchain Assets to Secure Cash Loans\nLONDON, UK, May 30, 2018 — London-based GK-Group has launched Kambo , a new lending platform for crypto-investors worldwide to turn blockchain assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies into cash loans.\nWith Kambo , cryptocurrency holders have a fast, easy way to turn crypto assets into borrowed cash. Kambo’s loans are secured with Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, with other cryptocurrency options available as collateral opportunities later in 2018.\nKambo makes borrowing cash easy for cryptocurrency investors, who may need cash for anything from buying a car to paying down credit card debt. With Kambo’s loan services, investors have a unique ability to unlock the true potential of their crypto-holdings.\nA Simplified Lending Process\nWhen investors sign up at Kambo , they’ll immediately gain access to a fast, easy loan application, with instant approval and no credit checks. No tokens are required to get a Kambo loan. Kambo offers competitive interest rates with no hidden fees — no origination or early repayment fee.\nKambo is the only crypto-secured loan provider with native apps. For investors on the move, the Kambo app is available from the Apple App Store, and an Android app is planned for release in Summer 2018. Using Kambo’s sleek, intuitive desktop dashboard or the Kambo app, investors can track their loans, along with the value of their crypto-assets. Security measures like a mandatory one-time pin and Google authentication give investors peace of mind for asset protection as well. Mobile App Dashboard\nCrypto Holdings = Cash in Hand\nBy signing up for Kambo , investors can receive immediate funding today for their otherwise idle cryptocurrency assets. By unlocking the value of these digital assets, investors can leverage their portfolios or satisfy other liquidity needs with a Kambo loan.\nKambo lends up to 50% of the collateral value of the investor’s portfolio. The assets are held in an escrow account during the term of the loan, and once the loan is repaid, the assets are released back to the customer.\nUnlike competitors, the Kambo platform does not have a waitlist; Cash loans are available immediately for any cryptocurrency investor. And, unlike other cryptocurrency service companies, Kambo accepts Ethereum as collateral. More collateral options such as ERC-20 tokens, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, and others will be added to Kambo’s roster in Q3 2018.\nKambo doesn’t require tokens or memberships, nor does it offer complex structured products. Plus, Kambo is already part of an established financial firm, so investors don’t need to worry about the company needing additional funds via an ICO. Web app dashboard\nProven Experience\nKambo is an established lender that comes from a family of exceptional financial services companies. Kambo is part of the established, regulated parent firm GK-Group, owner of MyKredit (FCA regulated) and GKFX (FCA Regulated). GKFX is also a sponsor of soccer team AC Milan. Since 2015, Kambo’s sister company MyKredit (under the GK-Group banner) has given out nearly 30,000 loans in the UK and Spain.\nAbout G-K Group\nGlobal Kapital Group is a global financial technology company, with offices currently across 18 countries and more than 1,000 employees. Founded in 2010, GK-Group has grown in eight years to become a successful financial technology company, with a broad focus across financial sectors, including Foreign Exchange, Commodities, Precious Metals, Options, Equities, Credit, and Payment Services. Its relentlessly innovative employees constantly seek new developments in financial technology to help benefit its customers.\nFor crypto rich investors looking for liquidity, Kambo is the ultimate solution.

He also famously said, “Bitcoin: we tried this with our eCommerce store years back. Didn’t see much. Would love to see a digital currency thrive,” in a tweet last year.\nAnd according to Bloomberg , Square’s shares have also surged 25 percent since the company announced it was buying website builder Weebly, which provides tools to easily build a professional website or online store.\nSquare will pay with a combination of cash and stock of approximately $365 million, which includes restricted stock units for Weebly’s founders and employees that will vest over four years after closing. This is Square’s biggest acquisition to date.\n“Square and Weebly share a passion for empowering and celebrating entrepreneurs,” said Dorsey. “Square began its journey with in-person solutions, while Weebly began its journey online. Since then, we’ve both been building services to bridge these channels, and we can go even further and faster together.”\nThe deal builds Square’s online and eCommerce offerings for small and medium-size businesses, while also giving it a recurring revenue stream and new customers.\nSquare’s stock closed on Thursday (May 31) at $58.25, a new record high, shortly before the company raised its annual revenue forecast to reflect the impact of it latest acquisition.\nSquare’s gross payment volume could reach $409 billion in 2026, or 4.1 percent of total U.S. payment volume, RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin predicted in a recent note to clients.\n“Square’s integrated hardware, software and services solutions position the company to benefit from ongoing card acceptance penetration at smaller merchants, while gaining share against existing solutions that lag from a technological or efficiency basis,” wrote Perlin.

That’s what technical analysis suggests, according to Robert Sluymer, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.\nSluymer, whose colleague and boss is cryptocurrency bull Tom Lee , offered a glimmer of hope for the flailing market, which has been decimated recently.\nBTC prices have plunged 60 percent since approaching a high of almost $20,000 in December 2017. As of this writing, it is trading at roughly $7,400. Momentum Is Building\nAfter weeks of sputtering, positive momentum is quietly building for the top cryptocurrency by market cap, Sluymer said.\n“When we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen,” he told CNBC . “We think bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000, and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here.”\nSluymer pointed out that bitcoin has dropped several times recently to a key support level at around $7,000 before eventually recovering. “That’s certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold,” he explained.\nTechnical analysis shows that BTC’s relative strength index (RSI) is hovering at around 40. An RSI of 30 indicates an asset is oversold.\nThis technical marker also suggests that bitcoin has bottomed-out and is positioned to climb again.\n“That RSI indicator in the bottom of the chart is very oversold and starting to bottom, so that’s really part of that bottoming phase taking hold,” Sluymer said. Next Hurdle Is $7,800\nIf bitcoin rallies through the next level of support at around $7,800, it will start shooting up in the near term, Sluymer projects.\n“The next thing that has to happen is to see bitcoin actually rally through the downtrend,” he said. “We use the 15-day moving average. It’s very simplistic, but it’s a pretty good proxy across most markets. [$7,800] will be the next hurdle for it to get through.”\nBTC prices last hit $7,800 a week ago, and has not topped that level since May 23. But Sluymer said the stars are lining up for another rally.\n“We think the setup is very attractive here,” he said. “If you’re short, we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long, this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.”\nRobert Sluymer’s bullish near-term outlook differs from that of prominent cryptocurrency investor Ari Paul, the CIO of BlockTower Capital. As CCN has reported, Paul does not foresee a short-term rally anytime soon.\n“I’ve had chats with some very savvy fund managers in the last few days, all of whom said, ‘I don’t see where the new money comes from any time soon,'” Paul tweeted. I've had chats with some very savvy fund managers in the last few days, all of whom said, \"I don't see where the new money comes from any time soon.\" Here are some medium-term thoughts (horizon ~6 months.)\n— Ari Paul (@AriDavidPaul) June 1, 2018\nHowever, Paul — who has taken a long position on cryptocurrencies, including BTC — expects prices to soar over the long haul. He also predicts there will be greater mainstream investing in digital currencies over the next year. 8/ I'm optimistic that over the next year we'll see a more than 3x in the total number of holders of cryptocurrency largely driven by marketing, UI, and simple but viral dApps like whatever the next Cryptokitties will be.\n— Ari Paul (@AriDavidPaul) June 1, 2018\nBitcoin has been nosediving since December 2017 in part due to the heightened regulatory scrutiny in recent months.\nWhile the market’s erratic price fluctuations and high-profile regulatory crackdowns have caused some hand-wringing in the crypto community, it bears noting that at this time last year, BTC hovered at about $2,500, and the total market cap of the entire cryptocurrency industry was $85 billion.\nToday, the total market cap tops $329 billion and bitcoin is trading at roughly $7,400. Sometimes, the measure of “success” is a matter of perspective.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1002382700894932992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/bitcoin-finds-a-bottom-after-plunging-from-highs-technician.html", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1002380599284428802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T23:01:30.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "243fe22f9dae0b3140cb27014f748fd19bf1c5ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUAqqzzWnN0fpZcaf9GDrWA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "what is the effect of increasing its bitcoin user?", "title_full": "what is the effect of increasing its bitcoin user?", "published": "2018-06-01T21:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "243fe22f9dae0b3140cb27014f748fd19bf1c5ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUAqqzzWnN0fpZcaf9GDrWA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PayneCharity", "published": "2018-06-01T21:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "what is the effect of increasing its bitcoin user?", "text": "Quote: from: Aryadwipanggah on February 24, 2018, 03:10:59 AM from year to year bitcoin users continue to grow, if viewed from the economic laws make bitcoin something positive, because more users with limited amount of bitcoin will make bitcoin prices rise, but on the one hand increased the bitcoin users who are identified by new users will arise feelings of panic when there is fundamental or bad news about bitcoin that leads to the decision to immediately sell its bitcoin, then there is a large sell so the price of bitcoin down, how do you respond to this phenomenon ??\nThe more people who invest in bitcoin, the more likely 100% of the bitcoin price will increase.

It saw its highest value before Christmas when it reached the monumental price of just under $20,000.\nMr Salles said there is a “bullish lateral action with buyers increasing their positions is the most likely scenario” for bitcoin.\nFocussing on a BTC/USD price chart, he added: “The Directional Movement Index is matching the exact bullish pattern.\n“Buyers are still moving above the ADX while sellers diminish their strength and are trading below the trend strength indicator. There is room for bullish developments.”\nFor ethereum , Mr Salles said the profile is “weaker” than in bitcoin’s case but the Directional Movement Index is similar between the two cryptocurrencies, despite ethereum showing “less advanced” development.\nThe finance expert also said Ripple is trading “very close” to a clean scenario that might allow a “gradually bullish development”.\nCryptocurrencies have faced criticism by banks and finance experts, with billionaire Bill Gates telling CNBC he would bet against the bitcoin and short it if he could.\nThe Microsoft co-founder said: “As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up.

The valuation of the cryptocurrency market has slightly increased from $330 billion to $333 billion, by around 1 percent.\nBitcoin's Struggle\nExactly one week ago, on May 25, the price of bitcoin was $7,530. Today, as of June 1, the price of bitcoin is $7,580. Over the past seven days, BTC remained in the $7,300 to $7,500 range, struggling to record any major or minor movement on both the downside and upside.\nBased on the short-term price trend of BTC over the past week, it remains unlikely that BTC returns to previous support levels at $10,000 and $12,000, given that the 5-month and 10-month MA bear cross have been confirmed for the first time since 2014. More to that, BTC failed to swiftly rebound to the $8,000 mark over the past few days, eliminating the possibility of a potential corrective rally to $10,000 in the short-term.\nIf BTC can surpass the $8,500 mark in the next few days with a strong spike in volume, it is possible that BTC breaks its descending trendline since May 5, eyeing a mid-term recovery and a bounce back to the $10,000 region. However, without a strong recovery, it remains unlikely for bitcoin to initiate a bull run in the short-term.\nAri Paul, a prominent cryptocurrency investor and researcher, who co-founded the digital asset investment firm BlockTower, said:\n\"I've had chats with some very savvy fund managers in the last few days, all of whom said, 'I don't see where the new money comes from any time soon,'\" emphasizing that most investors agree in a medium to long-term adoption curve of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1002380599284428802"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T06:36:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99d00c6614da8c95b605454bacae29437e567aa6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQLS7I2.b_lYMhW2nBmwHW0rqY07zjd6gLoVh_PDETgj1xwufYPBm1zN1rxjETtrdz2x0OjT2JiLwQ3OxuN5qg7w--", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Cryptocurrency- Bitcoin mining gains popularity in Russia", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency- Bitcoin mining gains popularity in Russia", "published": "2018-06-01T21:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hqdefault-36.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "99d00c6614da8c95b605454bacae29437e567aa6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQLS7I2.b_lYMhW2nBmwHW0rqY07zjd6gLoVh_PDETgj1xwufYPBm1zN1rxjETtrdz2x0OjT2JiLwQ3OxuN5qg7w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Canadian Stock Trader", "published": "2018-06-01T21:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency- Bitcoin mining gains popularity in Russia", "text": "If you’re late, your crypto will be sent back.

A new lead to the movie business\nSlate intends to broadcast the documentary Beyond Bitcoin via its blockchain based online streaming platform Binge. The decentralized Binge platform provides low-cost, high-speed, high-definition media access for consumers worldwide, says the text of the press release.\nDuring the Cannes festival in May 2018, Slate appeared at the center of the buzz surrounding blockchain technology and its potential to alter the entertainment industry. In Cannes, Slate announced their newly formed partnership with Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival (Sitges), where Sitges will adopt its digital ticketing platform, Slatix , powered by the cryptocurrency SLATE SLX, for the purchase of tickets and festival passes.\n“This will mark the first time in industry history that a film festival will accept cryptocurrency as well as traditional forms of payment”, says the Slate press release.\nSlatix is a blockchain-based, low-cost tokenized ticketing system that aims to provide benefits to consumers based on their loyalty. According to the press release, small and medium sized enterprises can benefit from Slatix’s low setup and operating costs, while the user-friendly app is intended to simplify DIY ticket distribution and redemption. Listings and token sale\nBased in Toronto and Los Angeles, the Slate Entertainment Group has launched several media platforms on its own blockchain, including Binge and Slatix.\nSlate has launched its presale in May 2018. The public token presale will remain open until June 9, 2018. So far, the Slate team has overpassed its soft cap goal, having raised over $20 mln. The current discount is 45 percent and bonus is 3 percent.\nAs the Slate team reported to Cointelegraph, Hong Kong based HitBTC, one of the top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, will be listing SLX on its exchange. HitBTC will host SLX with trading pairs against Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT).\n“Slate Entertainment Group is especially pleased to announce the agreement during the presale as it assures buyers that they will be able to trade SLX on the open market. The listing on a major exchange will also expand SLX’s exposure to new markets and increase distribution after the initial sale” says the press release.\nDisclaimer.

To: Required Needs to be a valid email From: Required Needs to be a valid email Subject: John McAfee Says This Event Could Shoot Bitcoin into the Stratosphere Message: Website 8 − 7 =\nTech pioneer John McAfee isn't shy about making bold Bitcoin price predictions, stating in November 2017 that Bitcoin would trade for $1 million by 2020. From today's (June 1) price of $7,433.14, that's a gain of 13,353%.\nAnd right now, he believes there's a spark that will shoot Bitcoin into the stratosphere…\nOn May 30, McAfee tweeted a story about how a crisis in Italy could lead to a global stock market sell-off.\nAnd that could lead to a race for everyone on earth to own a Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, as there will only be 21 million ever mined… How the New European Financial Crisis Could Send Bitcoin Soaring\nItaly is already $2 trillion in debt, and investors are worried a sweeping wave of populism could cause the country to leave the European Union (EU) and abandon the euro or create the next European financial crisis.\nItaly's party heads in the Five Star Movement and the League are trying to form a coalition, but things are not going smoothly.\nThat could lead to another election in July.\nMembers of Italy's new populist government have previously threatened to pull Italy – a founding EU member and its third-largest economy – out of the bloc, just like the United Kingdom did in 2016.\nBut they are also threatening a new financial crisis as they plan to boost spending and slash revenue despite Italy's massive debt. That could devalue the euro or lead to another European bailout fight.\nIf Italy's debt woes continue, they will create serious uncertainty about the euro and government bonds, and that sort of uncertainty makes investors pessimistic, which could tank markets.\nItalian five-year bond prices are already plummeting. Yields have surged to 2.3% on May 30, from just 0.6% previously, according to Business Insider . Lower yields are a sign investors are confident they'll be repaid, so rapidly rising yields mean investor confidence in Italy's solvency is plummeting.\nPlus, the euro also dropped to its lowest level against the dollar in 10 months, $1.15, on May 30.\nThe panic then spread across the globe…\nOn May 30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 245 points, and the stock exchanges in South Korea, Shanghai, Singapore, and Hong Kong all slid at least 1%.\nOn top of all this, there will be continued market volatility thanks to Brexit, potential tariff wars between the United States, China, Canada, and Mexico, an economic crisis in Venezuela, and tensions between the United States and North Korea.\nIt's not surprising that some investors are turning to Bitcoin as a safe-haven investment. After all, its value can't be torpedoed by political disagreements or overzealous governments.\nMcAfee could be right that the troubles in Italy could help Bitcoin prices start to climb.\nBut the real windfalls will come, as he's said before, when everyone realizes the true power decentralization and blockchain technology will bring to the world.\nStunning: New Innovation Will Be Like \"Adding Twin Turbos to the Bitcoin Engine\" – and Could Send Its Price to $100,000. Learn More…\nAnd when you see how high Bitcoin prices could climb when the world understands the power of crypto, you can't afford to be on the wrong side of history… The Crypto Revolution Is Just Starting", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://pro.moneymappress.com/m/947561/", "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&fs=1&to&su=&body=https://mney.co/2LfvSwr", "http://compose.mail.yahoo.com/?body=https://mney.co/2LfvSwr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mcafee", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T20:41:31.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b03814444a0bffb792fc3bbb837c8dd6c5911523", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSEZGErHt7jhhHcmlJ_HxlqeJHLb1sTiaCFIr8QG39DjFqGhkuTkvCt2lsgQFwPWO5Y_fdvgMoq9mC9asTyAmfwgMkDMw8_l1.VZkKLiku2oFahYlQqldlm7Mcjwt3HB.0dntI5KXjzGxOpPD5E0UBl", "site_full": "thedailycoin.org", "site": "thedailycoin.org", "site_section": "https://thedailycoin.org/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Daily Coin", "title": "Caitlin Long: Bitcoin Can Restore Sound Money & Fix The Financial System?

By 186 Each of the two most famous cryptocurrencies has benefits and flaws.\nBitcoin and Ethereum are at the forefront of the cryptocurrency world. Both are robust and valuable currencies. Each doing things differently from the other, and both with some great advantages as well as disadvantages. In this article, we explore the pros and cons of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which will allow you to make up your mind about which one is best for you to buy. Bitcoin\nThe seasoned veteran, Bitcoin is the original crypto token. Since its introduction, it has garnered much interest and risen in the BTC to USD value significantly. Bitcoin operates using blockchain technology, which is a virtual ledger that is used to record transactions. Each transaction forms a block on the chain, over time the chain grows as more transactions are processed and more blocks are added. Pros of Bitcoin\nHere are the advantages of Bitcoin:\nFame\nBitcoin is by far the most famous crypto; in fact, it is even well known outside of the crypto sphere. With plenty of media coverage and lots of attention paid to the Bitcoin success stories, Bitcoin enjoys a level of fame that other cryptos can only dream of. This fame is crucial now to Bitcoin’s further success. As investor confidence sometimes drops, the fame of Bitcoin is attracting new investors to the crypto world, and for every seasoned investor that switches to an altcoin there are a number of amateur investors looking to fill in the gap.\nBlockchain\nBlockchain that Bitcoin operates on is a great bit of tech. It has lots of transferable real-world applications and has been used in medical and accounting fields to store and protect data. Because there is value in the currency’s core technology, it will ensure that Bitcoin has value for years to come.\nSecurity\nBitcoin tokens can’t be counterfeited and transactions are secure, without the option for the payment to be reversed. This gives Bitcoin users a tremendous security advantage over other forms of digital money and many real-world currencies. Cons of Bitcoin\nThere are lots of advantages to buying Bitcoin, but, there are also a few drawbacks. Here they are:\nTransaction Times\nSomething that has plagued Bitcoin since its inception is its dismal transaction times. With blocks sometimes taking up to 10 minutes to process , it can be incredibly time-consuming to complete a purchase. Many altcoins have taken advantage of this and created faster transaction models for their currencies to run on.\nMining\nIt is now nearly impossible to mine Bitcoin unless you have incredibly sophisticated computer equipment. This means that new users have to invest in rather than mine the coin, like was commonplace in the old days. As Bitcoin nears its supply limit, it is going to become increasingly difficult for even the most powerful computers to mine. Ethereum\nEthereum is the second largest crypto by market value and is a fantastic alternative to Bitcoin. It addresses the transaction speed issues and has a large following of investors, traders and users. Like Bitcoin, it uses blockchain technology and has experienced tremendous surges in value. In 2017 alone, the currency rose by around 13,000% . It uses smart contracts to process information. Ethereum is the platform while Ether is the token that is used on that platform. Pros of Ether\nHere are the great things to consider before deciding to purchase Ether:\nSmart Contracts\nSmart contracts are designed to streamline the transaction process. When parameters have been met, the smart contract is automatically triggered to process the transaction in an expedient manner. This creates a flowing and easy to use transaction system that Bitcoin currently lacks.\nEthereum Blockchain\nEthereum has a dedicated and innovative team working on creating business-friendly platforms on which to operate. With Ethereum’s blockchain being largely accessible, companies can easily bolt onto the existing blockchain and use it for their own purposes. This usability means that Ether gains momentum and value as more businesses begin to use the Ethereum blockchain.\nGrowth\nAs with Bitcoin, there is real potential for Ether to grow in value over time. Whether or not this is immediate or further down the line remains to be seen, but historically, Ether has always weathered any downturns and faired well in a very competitive marketplace. This should provide reassurance to any potential Ether buyers. Cons of Ether\nThere are a few bad aspects that should be mentioned about Ethereum, here they are:\nCentralized Currency\nEthereum has a base of operations and the currency doesn’t enjoy the freedoms of other crypto that is decentralized . If the Ethereum blockchain goes down at any time, then the users of the platform lose the ability to use Ethereum and any smart contracts a customer holds may be lost in the process. This is a fundamental flaw in an otherwise great platform.\nGas Fees\nTo complete transactions on the Ethereum platform you will need to use something called gas. These fees are often minimal, but if you’re a company using the Ethereum platform to transact, these can add up to quite substantial amounts of money. Especially if you have many clients making payments through the Ethereum platform.\nEthereum is More Exposed to Competition\nWhilst Bitcoin has the rivalry of every altcoin on the market, it benefits from not needing to worry too much about competitive activity because it draws in new users regularly. Ethereum, on the other hand, has very heavy competition and has no real way of drawing in new users in the same way as Bitcoin. This means that if an altcoin gains traction on Ether, then the value of Ether could drop considerably. While the Ethereum development team are always working away to ensure this does not happen, there is no guarantee that it won’t.\nHopefully, this article has given you a lot of useful information about Bitcoin and Ethereum (Ether) and will allow you to make an informed decision about which currency is best for you to purchase.

In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL MISSISSIPPI WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nMississippi is a very gambling-friendly state and is widely expected to be among the first to offer legalized sports betting, just not before this year's World Cup.\nThe state does hope to offer sports betting in time for College Football. Mississippi has one of the most rabid College Football fan bases in the entire country.\nThe state is already looking at adapting laws and regulations.\nNo matter what happens, online gamblers will still need to set up accounts at offshore internationally-licensed betting sites as Mississippi will not be permitting mobile betting with their casinos anywhere outside the establishment.\nHere’s the breakdown on mobile:\n(b) A book shall accept wagers only on its licensed premises, and only at betting stations or kiosks/terminals approved by the Executive Director or through an on-site computerized Wagering system that has been approved by the Executive Director.\nHowever, players will be permitted to wager on their mobile devices within the confines of the casino:\n(c) For the purposes of this provision, the approved facility shall include any area located within the property boundaries of the casino hotel facility that the Executive Director determines is legal for gaming. This shall not include parking garages or parking areas of a casino hotel facility.\n(d) The Executive Director shall ascertain and ensure, pursuant to rules and regulations issued by the commission to implement mobile gaming pursuant to this provision, that mobile gaming shall not extend outside of the property boundaries of the casino hotel facility authorized for gaming.\nThat differs from the mobile setup in Nevada. In the Silver State, players go to a sportsbook, set up an account in-person, and then can bet anywhere within the state. In Mississippi, in-person setup still would be required, but without the benefit of off-site wagering.\n1. The player shall establish a wagering account through the property where mobile gaming will be conducted, and funds may only be deposited into the wagering account while the player is at the property where gaming is being conducted;\n2. Wagers shall only be placed within a facility approved by the Executive Director for mobile gaming; and\n3. The Executive Director authorizes the device application for mobile gaming; provided that the Executive Director may establish any additional or more stringent licensing and other regulatory requirements necessary for the proper implementation and conduct of mobile gaming as authorized herein.\nNeedless-to-say, Mississippi gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa world cup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "college football", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T22:04:54.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a4637e837c5a4b472444dc1ca5e54d91cdb282e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSEwivSHkQB0lMktj60.Jso-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Is NOW the best time to buy or enter in bitcoin?", "title_full": "Is NOW the best time to buy or enter in bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-01T20:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.047, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a4637e837c5a4b472444dc1ca5e54d91cdb282e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSEwivSHkQB0lMktj60.Jso-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "josephpogi", "published": "2018-06-01T20:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is NOW the best time to buy or enter in bitcoin?", "text": "The best time to buy bitcoin if it is the price will go down because if the time comes that value will go high then you will get a huge profits on it.

The launch of the mainnet on May 31 was a decision to exit Ethereum’s “archaic gas burn mechanism and high gas fees” in addition to in-fighting about community governance, according to an announcement from the Tron Foundation.\nJustin Sun, founder of Tron, also announced a bug bounty program with a $10 million top reward for the mainnet. Despite this backing, however, the price has marched down. TRX Price Chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\nThe Tron price was $0.073 on the close May 26. Currently, the price is $0.056. This represents an over 23% decrease for the time period.\nThe mainnet protocol was highly anticipated for the project, and represented a feat for the development team. As it would detach the project from the Ethereum blockchain, Tron would gain new independence in its development roadmap and governance.\nAs Tron Labs stated:\n“We must be independent. We must achieve an equal, democratic system, with democratic elections as an integral part of community governance. This is the only way to uphold the popular sovereignty and the natural rights of the token, a cornerstone of our value system around decentralization.”\nComically, Twitter users are commenting that the only obvious bug so far with the mainnet is the declining price. Source: Twitter\nAs a possible competition to investor interest, other projects have been launching their own mainnets now or very soon. As CCN reported, EOS is expected to launch their mainnet on within the next few days.\nTron has also been criticized for allegedly over-hyping, such as the partnership with Baofeng, and plagiarizing other projects’ white papers.\nThe mainnet launch is the foundation for improved infrastructure for DApps and attracting new developers to build applications on the blockchain, according to “A Letter to the Community” posted in a blog update. It sets the path for third-party applications to run independent of the Ethereum chain. Clearly, it is way too early to use the price to gauge the success of the mainnet launch.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1002543756078223361"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin sun", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mainnet launch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mainnet launch bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tron foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T06:05:01.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 25108, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=7100", "requestsLeft": 591}
