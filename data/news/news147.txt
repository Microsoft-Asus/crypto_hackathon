Astron will use the funding at its Auckland plant, including to install a pre-shredder and extruder, to filter out contamination from organics and other waste. This technology will add to one of the plant’s existing recycling lines, allowing it to run at optimum levels and increase the range of hard-to-recycle plastics, numbered 2 and 4, that can be processed. The expanded capability will mean agricultural plastics, such as silage wrap and milk powder bags, will be able to be recycled. “The Government is committed to reducing the amount of waste going to landfill or being shipped offshore,” Associate Environment Minister Eugenie Sage said.

Tougher credit rules, increased supply and subdued wage growth are combining to put an end to Australia’s long housing boom. The downturn is most obvious in Sydney, where average home prices were down 3.4 percent in April from a year earlier. The city was previously the epicentre of the boom -- as recently as a year ago, Sydney prices were increasing at an annual pace of 16 percent. Away from the urban centres and in smaller cities, where homes are more affordable without the need for large loans, prices are still rising or seeing smaller falls.\nTWO WEEKS' PROFITS Apple has won US$539 mln from Samsung in a patent case seven years after the battle began.

But that doesn’t mean regulators can ignore the wave of scams, fraud and market manipulation designed to snare gullible punters.With U.S. law enforcers now probing trading practices such as “spoofing” – illegal and aggressive order cancellations designed to move markets – this looks very much like the beginning of a sustained crypto cleanup. Drawing investors back in, even with the promise of a less Wild West-style market, will take longer than cheerleaders expect.Probing price manipulation in crypto market was a natural next step for the authorities., which have ramped up scrutiny of everything from new token sales to crypto-hedge funds in recent months. There’s plenty of data evidence to dig into, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC have demanded information from a lot of companies.64307757\nThere are the “pump-and-dump” chat-rooms where traders take advantage of thinly traded digital currencies. Elsewhere, exchanges have been accused of being open to spoofing or so-called “wash” trading, where one entity buys and sells the same order. The popular Coinbase exchange faces allegations from clients of insider trading.Of course, it’s natural to question the authorities’ track record of putting spoofers and manipulators behind bars, even those working in traditional financial markets. It’s a fairly recent phenomenon. The practice of spoofing was only made illegal in the U.S. in 2010, and the first conviction was in 2015. In January, the CFTC announced the creation of a new Spoofing Task Force to “root out” the practice. So there’s still no established model for building a successful anti-spoofing case – for example, what a jury would deem to be a suspicious level of order cancellations.64307762\nBut the drive by law enforcers to dig into the crypto world and demand more transparency is here to stay. This can only dent the aura, and price, of Bitcoin. We don’t know the true “worth” of a crypto-currency – although there are many wacky price targets – but there’s evidence that the price is closely linked to the ecosystem where it is traded. One recent research paper found that a near-tenfold rise in Bitcoin’s price in 2013 was driven primarily by two bots engaging in suspicious activity in a thin market.The market today is very different, with more traders, more coins and more exchanges, but greater transparency is bound to have an impact. Bitcoin fell to its lowest price in more than a month after Bloomberg’s report on the U.S. criminal probe.64307765\nWhat happens next? Crypto-evangelists will no doubt argue that a better maintained market is a healthy development, and one that will pave the way for the flood of institutional Wall Street money that always seems to be right around the corner. Plenty of market participants have been asking for more transparency. New crypto exchange Legolas, for instance, has criticized the incumbents as being opaque and vulnerable to manipulation.Still, the idea that big risk-averse institutional investors will jump in just as authorities start to trawl the depths of this murky market seems fanciful. Speculation has been Bitcoin’s chief appeal, of course, but the necessary cleanup operation will drag on its price for some time to come.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of economictimes.com, Bloomberg LP and its owners)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lionel laurentbitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T06:54:11.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a1f54aa911cc053ae4b868e2800f9bbfce02009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ5ko8FWCTyIEELoUdczYjs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Why choose Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why choose Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-25T04:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a1f54aa911cc053ae4b868e2800f9bbfce02009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ5ko8FWCTyIEELoUdczYjs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "grendel25", "published": "2018-05-25T04:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why choose Bitcoin?", "text": "Bitcoin has become a gateway and utility coin.

bounty marketing campaign for our ICO. Despite the criticisms, Tezos' ICO is proof that token crowdsales are nonetheless incredibly scorching, each for traders trying to earn a quick buck by flipping new tokens and for crypto-related startups seeking to get funded. Nevertheless, while IPOs cope with investors, ICOs deal with supporters that are keen to buy a model-new activity much like a crowdfunding event. Thanks to this, most ICOs these days are Ethereum-primarily based, and to participate in the sale, you typically need to exchange your ETH for tokens.When a cryptocurrency startup company wishes to lift cash via a Preliminary Coin Providing (ICO), it normally develops an intend on a whitepaper which mentions precisely what the undertaking has to do with, what need( s) the task will meet upon completion, what does it value? Whereas ICOs use voting mechanisms within the precise platform (i.e. Aragon), others like CryptoTask use voting to control the discharge of funds in phases post-ICO. While there have been plenty of success tales, within the 2nd quarter of final 12 months, an Ethereum based mostly venture named The DAO entered an ICO to launch an funding fund without a fund supervisor, with the traders being concerned in all the funding choices upon launch. As such, AIO tokens allow investors to buy only one token and handle it in a protected, convenient method, as a substitute of having to accumulate 10 different wallets to carry their funds. Ethereum ‘s native value token, Ether, is mined by a Proof-of-Work protocol that is set to alter to Proof-of-Stake The Ethereum ICO was held from the 20th of July, 2014 to the 2nd of September, 2014 with 31.5k BTC ($18.4 million at the time). Steady coin is itself a tough sufficient process to be a standalone blockchain mission. Coin ICOs usually sell participation in an economy, whereas token ICOs promote a proper of possession or royalties to a mission or DAO. KICKICO is a web based blockchain technology-based mostly platform for reward-based mostly and donation-primarily based crowdfunding, which provides an access to on-line fundraising instruments carried out with mobile mining the assistance of blockchain expertise and sensible contracts. It often releases mobile mining a sure number of crypto-tokens and then sells those tokens to its supposed audience, most commonly in alternate for Bitcoins, however it may be fiat cash as well. It's finally the method of crowdfunding a brand new cryptocurrency undertaking, involving a token sale, with the cryptocurrency project elevating capital to fund operations, with investors receiving an allocation of the mission's tokens in return. When those limits are reached, the sale is completed, and the owners can use their tokens as they please. An instance of an efficient ICO task that paid to early financiers is the smart agreements platform known as Ethereum which has Ethers as its coin tokens. ICOs are sometimes used to fund the event of new cryptocurrencies or tasks that can work with the blockchain expertise as a spine. In case you liked this short article along with you would like to receive more info about mobile mining, supplyconceptsinc.com , kindly stop by the web-site. An IPO is a onetime sale with multiple intermediaries involved within the strategy of figuring out the circumstances, pricing, and many others., whilst ICOs can have multiple rounds of fund raising, with few if any intermediaries, the white paper the blueprint. There's loads of curiosity at present from an investor perspective, attributed to sizeable returns that buyers have loved up to now, demand driving prices, with massive costs features incentivising traders to lock in income, which may result in mass promote-offs that could finally wipe out investor cash, to not point out the company. ICOs are easy to structure resulting from the fact that of applied sciences just like the ERC20 Token Requirement, which abstracts plenty of the development process necessary to develop a model-new cryptographic possession. An example of a profitable ICO challenge that was profitable to early financiers is the clever contracts platform called Ethereum which has Ethers as its coin tokens. On the primary day of the month of August, the Bitcoin blockchain obtained split and gave rise to a completely new forex - bitcoin cash. However ICOs differ from crowdfunding as a result of the backers of the previous are inspired by a possible return of their monetary investments, whereas the funds raised in the latter marketing campaign are principally contributions. Most ICOs are scams and most cryptocurrencies (apart from Bitcoin, altcoins\") are shit coins. These funding rounds are generally called donations\" or presale tokens\" as an alternative of utilizing the ICO\" terminology, with a view to disassociate with legally mobile mining sensitive words and phrases. ICOs are the Wild West of financing — they sit in a gray zone where the U.S. Securities and Exchange Fee (SEC) and many different regulatory our bodies are still investigating echat for altcoin mobile mining them. Escrow wallets hold funds until the promised services or products is accomplished and the developer starts distributing the crypto forex and the coins turn into accessible for sale and alternate. Secondary market trading of virtual tokens or coins may happen on an alternate. So when you were to buy into an ICO of a promising younger firm, you'll commerce your Bitcoin or Ethereum (each relatively established cryptocurrencies) for brand spanking new cash the corporate had simply created. Some promoters and preliminary sellers might lead buyers of the virtual coins or tokens to expect a return on their funding or to participate in a share of the returns provided by the challenge. You can determine to keep them or trade them again into ETH at any point; a great deal of ICO participants quickly flip\" the tokens back into ETH, particularly if the tokens quickly get price compared to the ICO value.

Now, according to Bloomberg News , the US Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into whether price manipulations have contributed to the meteoric rises and crushing falls.\nThe coins prosecutors are examining include bitcoin and ether, which have both bounced up and down over the past 18 months. In 2017, after bitcoin began the year with a price of about $1,000 , it soared to just below $20,000 in December and then finished out the year at about $13,900. Ether followed an even steeper trajectory , beginning 2017 at about $8 and finishing at about $747. Prices for both currencies have experienced major volatility over the past six months.\nSpoofing and wash trades The DoJ probe is focused on whether those price swings were caused by illegal trading practices that have long manipulated securities prices in more traditional markets, Bloomberg reported, citing four people familiar with the probe. One of the practices is known as spoofing. That's when a trader floods an exchange with orders and then cancels them once the market price has moved in the desired direction. Another practice, known as wash trades, occurs when people transact trades with themselves to give the market a false impression of demand.\nThe lack of regulation and oversight in most of the exchanges where cryptocurrencies are traded make them a prime feeding ground for con artists and scammers. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has already opened dozens of probes of initial coin offerings for various cryptocurrencies, and those investigations have resulted in at least three prosecutions .

More Bitcoin has held up relatively well this week despite negative headlines about regulatory crackdowns.\nFor analysts with a long-term view, that price action fits with their thesis that increased scrutiny will shake out the bad actors and make the markets healthy enough for institutions to invest.\n\"In the long run this is WILDLY bullish,\" Brian Kelly, a CNBC contributor and head of BKCM, said in a note to clients Thursday. \"If the DoJ and CFTC feel as though they have 'cleaned' up the market, then it paves the way for a U.S. Physically backed Bitcoin ETF, and brings in institutional investors.\"\nBitcoin briefly hit a six-week low of $7,272 Thursday morning after Bloomberg reported the U.S. Department of Justice opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of cryptocurrencies. The report, citing sources, said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was assisting in the investigation.\nHowever, bitcoin soon recovered its losses for the day and was trading near $7,570 in the afternoon, down just 8 percent since Friday. The CFTC, which oversees bitcoin futures, declined to comment, as did the Justice Department.\n\"I have not seen any evidence of price manipulation in bitcoin markets, but am certainly in favor of increased oversight, as it can only help to instill further confidence in the crypto markets,\" said Joe DiPasquale, founder and CEO of BitBull Capital, a cryptofund that invests in other cryptofunds.\nOther negative news could have hit bitcoin's price harder this week, but did not.\nOn Monday, the North American Securities Administrators Association announced that an \"Operation Cryptosweep\" crackdown on cryptocurrency-related fraud has resulted in nearly 70 inquiries and investigations nationwide since the beginning of this month. Thirty-five enforcement actions are pending or completed.\n\"These actions signal that 'adult supervision' is coming to crypto and adding such oversight incrementally improves the structural integrity and legitimacy for the crypto-currency investor,\" Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a Thursday report. Lee maintained his mid-year price target of $20,000 on bitcoin and a year-end forecast of $25,000.\nThat said, it may take longer for the cryptocurrency market to recover from the regulatory uncertainty that has contributed to bitcoin's more than 50 percent plunge at the start of this year.\nLee had predicted bitcoin would get a boost last week from Consensus and other cryptocurrency conferences during New York City's \"Blockchain Week.\"\nBut the regulatory overhang persisted.

It starts at the bottom, a nation of no importance that suddenly and inexplicably grows richer and more powerful. The romans being the best known example, they expanded from their homeland and took over most of the known world.\nAfter the expansion of power, the people flourish. Trade and education grows among the people until everyone is free, healthy and as relatively happy as humans can ever be.\nThen decadence sets in. People become lazy, weak, hedonistic, the economy collapses and a lot of people die, either to famine or pestilence or war - death in whatever cloak.\nAnd then the cycle repeats. Ascendance, a short golden age, then decline.\nDuring the ascent the culture is mostly homogeneous. Not only same culture, but same ethnicity. After the peak when the decline sets in, it becomes multiculturalistic and multiethnic. Jews have no land of their own so they require a host culture to live in, and only declining cultures allow multiculturalism. That's why jews always push for leftist policy and ideology. It is literally a matter of survival for them, and lefties in the host cultures - traitors - always invite in the enemy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T02:46:32.113+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59283b36cff902462fb667ca8c7c6831da3ace9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosK88xwTGkiFAwhgnAPqn3G4FkXtxGnEuF_cEjpFUobC6hNxkiRVpOMcZ1Ui532VxVc8vFIbmZMBSY-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.co.uk", "site": "freelancer.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.co.uk/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "build me a bitcoin wallet software client for windows", "title_full": "build me a bitcoin wallet software client for windows", "published": "2018-05-25T04:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 56088, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59283b36cff902462fb667ca8c7c6831da3ace9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosK88xwTGkiFAwhgnAPqn3G4FkXtxGnEuF_cEjpFUobC6hNxkiRVpOMcZ1Ui532VxVc8vFIbmZMBSY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T04:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "build me a bitcoin wallet software client for windows", "text": "build me a bitcoin wallet software client for windows\ni need a bitcoin wallet software client\nits very easy as this stuff is all opensource\ndont contact me if you are charging more than 200$ Offer to work on this job now!

About a few months ago I came up with a new idea of making a Bitcoin Stress Toy. After a long time I finally got the product made and shipped. Ok check done. I knew that I didn't have a use-case or any value behind it. I felt I had to make it, because it was the first of its kind. I've barely put it out into the social media world and as expected havent had much feedback. I have come up with a few different ideas to sell & market. From selling individual pieces to selling large orders to content providers as a promotional thing.

It would be easy to spoof this market.\"\nThe regulatory crackdowns are being felt by several cryptocurrency exchanges, who have in some cases, requested authorities to regulate them.\nTo this effect, digital asset exchanges Gemini and Coinbase have cautiously treaded the cryptocurrency sector, placing a high emphasis on regulatory and internal fraud control. Additionally, these exchanges selectively list coins, usually after an elaborate vetting process.\nThe Winklevoss brothers-owned Gemini partnered with Nasdaq Inc. in April 2018 to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, and have publically appealed for their counterparts to set up a self-regulating body.\nBitcoin is currently trading near $7,577 at the time of writing on the Bitstamp exchange, up one percent on May 24's open. The digital currency hit a 42-day low of $7,267.24 on May 24.\nThe post DoJ Probe to Examine Bitcoin Exchanges For Alleged Price Manipulation appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T04:04:36.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "02d996fe1d727738aef56a727ed8543d43fc0af0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS1zjMf86qIRR9S._ctKQje899qBiFMkLMVo4oZAG1FF2DJv9mCejZTQgNh4gXoE28zpwU_iRGNlSaNmLl4_A3.wUcZz.ax60E8KS1NwJfdHFsf07KKHJZZxR69.mjmVAw-", "site_full": "www.wkrb13.com", "site": "wkrb13.com", "site_section": "https://www.wkrb13.com/feed/atom", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "WKRB News", "title": "Lightning Bitcoin [Futures] Reaches Market Cap of $0.00 (LBTC)", "title_full": "Lightning Bitcoin [Futures] Reaches Market Cap of $0.00 (LBTC)", "published": "2018-05-25T04:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2335.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "02d996fe1d727738aef56a727ed8543d43fc0af0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS1zjMf86qIRR9S._ctKQje899qBiFMkLMVo4oZAG1FF2DJv9mCejZTQgNh4gXoE28zpwU_iRGNlSaNmLl4_A3.wUcZz.ax60E8KS1NwJfdHFsf07KKHJZZxR69.mjmVAw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Pomrenke", "published": "2018-05-25T04:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lightning Bitcoin [Futures] Reaches Market Cap of $0.00 (LBTC)", "text": "Posted by Lisa Pomrenke on May 25th, 2018 // No Comments\nLightning Bitcoin [Futures] (CURRENCY:LBTC) traded up 3.7% against the U.S. dollar during the one day period ending at 21:00 PM E.T. on May 24th.

Fundstrat has predicted that the bitcoin price will reach $25,000 before the end of the year, an outlook it has not wavered from despite the recent downturn.\nThe bitcoin price traded sideways in the 24 hours before this article was written, despite significant intraday volatility that caused the flagship cryptocurrency to plunge from $7,738 to $7,331 in a span of just four hours.

Bitcoin had dropped to $7,362 at 10 am GMT on Thursday having almost hit $20,000 in December 2017.\nCNBC ’s Jackie DeAngelis requested Mr Lee: “Make the case to me. From an investor on the market, why do I wish to purchase Bitcoin now, as a result of it looks as if a scary commerce? “\nHe replied: “I believe the chart is fairly scary for folk as a result of bitcoin was $20,000 in December and it’s lower than half of that now. However the cause traders ought to care about that is, primary, I believe that the notion of blockchain as the way in which to resolve belief in a digital world has gained a number of traction especial out of consensus (convention).”\n“What traders aren’t connecting is which you can’t essentially simply say that ‘I consider within the blockchain.’ Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are important to how blockchains act within the securities.”\nMr Lee stated that the cryptocurrency has hit the extent it prices to supply, evaluating it to gold which is buying and selling at almost double the worth it prices to extract from the earth.\nHe stated: “The case I’d make for Bitcoin is, one, the price of producing and replicating a bitcoin right this moment as a retailer of worth is round $eight,000 absolutely loaded.”\n“So bitcoin is buying and selling at price. Gold as one other retailer of worth is buying and selling at greater than twice it’s extraction price.”\nBitcoin is steadily in comparison with gold as it’s steadily handled as a speculative or store-of-value asset. The investor stated that elevated curiosity from monetary establishments might additionally provoke an upturn within the cryptocurrency’s worth.\nHe stated: “I believe institutional traders have gained a number of curiosity they usually haven’t actually come into crypto but as there’s nonetheless some regulatory uncertainty.”\n“However that form of final allocation into crypto as an asset class goes to be a robust cause why bitcoin rallies.”\n“I believe it is an important story, it is an important know-how and I believe it’s underappreciated and that’s why we prefer it at $eight,000.”\n“Though it feels depressing to carry bitcoin at $eight,000, the transfer from $eight,000 to £25,000 will occur in a handful of days.”\nRegardless of Mr lee’s bullish feedback, the digital forex has confronted criticism by banks and finance consultants, with billionaire Invoice Gates telling CNBC he would guess towards the cryptocurrency and brief bitcoin if he might.\nThe Microsoft co-founder stated: “As an asset class, you are not producing something and so that you should not count on it to go up. It is type of a pure ‘larger idiot concept’ sort of funding.”\nHe added: “I agree I’d brief it if there was a simple approach to do it.”\nFinancial institution of England Governor Mark Carney additionally has been extremely important of the cryptocurrency panorama.

Sponsored Links\nThe department has ordered for a thorough scrutinization of exchanges and traders, in a bid to find the origin of fraudulent market activities, such as “spoofing,” fake market orders, and other types of manipulation.\nFederal prosecutors and representatives of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an authority that oversees the cryptocurrency market, will lead the investigation. U.S. DoJ Building . Source: gCaptain According to authorities, fraud is possible due to a variety of reasons, including nascency of the market (which makes it easier to influence), lack of action on the exchanges’ behalf, and a lack of regulations.\nThe authorities note that despite these factors, the digital asset market remains lucrative as ever, and continues to attract institutional players such as banks and hedge funds, industry figures, celebrities, and even Wall Street loyalists. Bloomberg’s Sources Echo Bitfinex’ed’s Warnings\nThe DoJ is explicitly looking into wash trading and market spoofing, types of fraudulent market activities which authorities took decades to eradicate from the futures and equities markets.\nThe risky ‘wash trading’ involves a person buying and selling assets to himself in a short time period, to effectively create an illusion of heightened market activity, attracting unsuspecting traders to dive in.\nIn contrast to this, spoofing is a relatively simple method and involves a trader to simply place a large buy/sell order of assets, and cancel the order once price moves closer to the desired direction.\nAccording to Bloomberg’ s sources, the DoJ is investigating the very same practices that cryptocurrency blogger and commentator Bitfinex’ed/BitCrypto’ed documented and scrutinized in 2017. Effortless Manipulation\nUndoubtedly, the limited regulatory scope makes the market a hotbed of fraud and scams, with several Initial Coin Offerings making away with millions of dollars in investors’ funds in 2018 alone.\nEchoing the thought is John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor, who has studied manipulation in cryptoasset markets:\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nThe regulatory crackdowns are being felt by several cryptocurrency exchanges, who have in some cases, requested authorities to regulate them.\nTo this effect, digital asset exchanges Gemini and Coinbase have cautiously treaded the cryptocurrency sector, placing a high emphasis on regulatory and internal fraud control. Additionally, these exchanges selectively list coins, usually after an elaborate vetting process.\nThe Winklevoss brothers-owned Gemini partnered with Nasdaq Inc. in April 2018 to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, and have publically appealed for their counterparts to set up a self-regulating body.\nBitcoin is currently trading near $7,577 at the time of writing on the Bitstamp exchange, up one percent on May 24’s open. The digital currency hit a 42-day low of $7,267.24 on May 24.

Ironically, he wrote the White House memo on cryptocurrency.\nHe is a blockchain expert and businessman. Forde was also a White House senior advisor in the office of science and technology during the Obama administration. He is now running for the Democratic nomination for the upcoming congressional elections in California.\nHis rival Dave Min, professor of law at the University of California and former SEC attorney, is circulating an advertisement against Forde’s campaign. He said that it is being illegally funded by Bitcoin [BTC] speculators who are against prevention of human trafficking and promotion of drug deals. Brian Forde has responded to allegations by saying:\n“My supporters didn’t HODL, but they made donations to my campaign in Bitcoin[BTC] is because they have faith in the technology. The comments accusing my supporters are completely inaccurate, sensationalist and it is due to my opponent’s lack of understanding of the technology. My supporters wouldn’t have donated to the campaign if they were just trying to speculate.”\nHe added:\n“While my opponent’s advertisement is trying to disparage a technology, what he doesn’t understand is that the United Nation is using is it to fight human trafficking worldwide and we need more rational technologists and scientists who can make policies based on evidence rather than politicians who making irrational decisions based on their emotions.”\nBrian Forde’s campaign has attracted support from cryptocurrency giants like the Winklevoss brothers and Mike Novogratz. He was a vital part of Obama’s Climate Data Initiative and TechHire during Barack Obama’s term. Brian Forde has become the head of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.\nThe US Federal Election Commission [FEC] has allowed political action committees to accept Bitcoin [BTC] as donations, given that donors identify themselves. Donations in Bitcoin are treated as in-kind donations which gives the candidates 10 days to transfer the BTC raised to their official campaign funds.

Photo: Reuters Peter Sabine - May 25, 2018 8:13am Bitcoin, human stupidity and the US$82 mln pizza order\nHow could a pizza order be worth US$82 million? The answer lies in Bitcoin pizza day, which first happened on May 22, 2010 – when Bitcoin user Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas with the cryptocurrency. Our friend spent 10,000 BTC on the Papa John’s order, in the first widely documented purchase of a goods with Bitcoin. BTC was priced at around US$8,200 on 22 May 2018, and so the order is now worth a cool US$82 million, an event celebrated in an annual Bitcoin pizza day.\nThey don’t have that brand in Hong Kong, but it better be some darn good pizza, because that kind of money would be able to buy you some of the nicest flats in the city. As a result people are bemoaning the fact that our pizza hero would have been HK$643.5 million to the good if he had just held on to those Bitcoin.\nStupidity? The judgment would be too simplistic. It all comes down to how one assigns value to assets or currency. Is an equivalent flat on the Peak worth all that money or merely a result of market manipulation? Should people have faith in Fiat currencies when they are subject to whims and manipulation of central governments and can be printed when needed as opposed to BTC, which has a cap?\nThe argument usually put forward is: Bitcoin and other alt coins are based on nothing and can’t buy any ‘stuff’. True, but it depends on sentiment of market and the people. The zeitgeist of this moment, is in digital culture, communication and now, currency. The idea is the most important element, the infrastructure will follow if this concept is strong enough.\nShould you go and put your life savings in Bitcoin? Hell no. Well, if you have an extremely high threshold for risk go for it. There are analysts out there who say Bitcoin will reach US$50,000 by the end of this year, and to the other extremes, those who believe it will be worthless. The likes of Warren Buffet and Bill Gates are famous sceptics, but the fact is no one has a crystal ball, or shall we call it, a ‘cryptoball’, particularly when it comes to digital currencies.\nThe fact is there is a strong demand for cryptocurrencies. One could argue this is the result of money laundering, criminal activities and pure speculation. Or you could say people are sick of the 5 ‘b’s:- Bad service from commercial banks and other financial entities- Blown-up fees for currency trading- Barriers of entry to investment and assets- Bailouts for those who destroy the market; see 2008- Bonuses for the established cartels\nSo what will happen next? A look into the cryptoball says it will be a rollercoaster ride. In any case, don’t call Laszlo Hanyecz an idiot. Proof of concept is a crucial step; our hero was the first man on the moon, the guy who led the charge on D Day, another in the pantheon of pioneers. If you get rich off BTC, thank him; if you lose everything and Bitcoin becomes worthless, remember that the guy got two pizzas for cheap.\nRC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter sabine", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T04:57:28.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87b032bbdc8d2c4896c8c1a48c297946a3d628db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqavrhWfxhmWgK7OtOaHTipsctlYiRVsjr_VLsVSfKBKcvMhxJf_x8X2A_LNoCX_h2850RW8teKgWcG6WZlnhrOVg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "The U.S. Justice Department Is Investigating Bitcoin Price Manipulation.

Company head of clients, products and core markets, Jeff Tessler, made the comments at an industry event in London this week which sparked speculation that Germany was about to enter the futures fray.\nUS exchange giants CME and CBoE launched Bitcoin futures in December which many speculate has led to the current price action following the ability to short the market. Conjecture aside, both exchanges have done very well out of their crypto related offerings and no European exchange has been able to follow suit with similar products. Deutsche Boerse could be the first one to do so.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Tessler said the emphasis at the moment was comprehension of the technology;\n“Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do.” Before adding “We are deep at work with it,”\nCrypto market volatility and regulation are also issues that need to be addressed; “we want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.” He added.\nBased on the value of the companies listed on it the Deutsche Boerse is one of the 10 largest stock exchanges in the world. It is not the first time the company has delved into the blockchain industry. Last June details were revealed about a plan to move the vast majority of its post-trade services to the blockchain. In March the group announced the development of a platform for more efficient securities lending using R3’s Corda blockchain technology.\nThe industry space is heating up, in April rival German stock exchange Boerse Stuttgart announced the release of a cryptocurrency trading app this year. The app, powered by a subsidiary of the exchange, will allow commission free trading of the top few cryptocurrencies.\nThe acceptance from mainstream financial institutions is a major step forward for the nascent crypto industry. If 2017 was the year they all exploded onto the scene, 2018 is the year of acceptance, adoption and regulation.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin. To get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay! Check our recent payments list as a proof.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- How do I use the plugin?\nSimply download the plugin and you will begin mining automatically. You will be mining as long as Mozilla Firefox is open.\n- What can I do if mining is blocked?\nYour security system (antivirus, adblocker and etc. ) probably blocked mining script money.js. You need to add CryptoTab or money.js to whitelist in your security system. Find «exceptions» or «whitelist» item in the menu of your security system and add money.js and Cryptotab.net to it. You can search more information exactly about your antivirus specifics in internet.\n- How long does it take before I can withdraw?\nIt depends on how often you keep Firefox open on a daily basis, but the minimum recommended withdrawal is 0.001 BTC, which usually only takes a few months to achieve.\n- How can I be sure that you really do payments?\nAll transfers of funds confirmed in Bitcoin blockchain transaction database and available to check. You can find it in our payment journal https://cryptotab.net/journal\n- How to withdraw money?\nWhen you want to transfer earnings to your bitcoin wallet, just click «Withdraw BTC» button in drop-down box at the top right side of the main page and put down your bitcoin wallet number (You need to sign in using one of the social networks account before it).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

So, what is this Bitcoin Cash all about then? 🤷\nJust as the name suggests, Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency in its own right. Based on the original Bitcoin, this new currency aims to replace cash altogether. Here is everything you need to know about it: Who created Bitcoin Cash? 🧐\nAlso known by its ticker BCH, Bitcoin Cash was created by a group of developers who were originally part of Bitcoin. Because these developers weren’t happy with the direction that the original currency was heading in, they decided to implement a 'Fork' to the bitcoin code, which marked the beginning of Bitcoin Cash. When was it launched? 📆\nLaunched in August 2017, Bitcoin Cash was created by miners and developers after disagreements within the bitcoin community over how best to scale Bitcoin to support future transaction volumes.\nThe new currency's sole purpose as is to provide a fast, cheap way of sending money across the globe. This was also the reason Bitcoin Cash has powerful supporters like Roger Ver of Bitcoin.com backing it. Why were some developers not happy with Bitcoin? 👩🏼‍💻\nAs the first mainstream cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was intended to replace fiat money (the Pound, the Euro etc.). The original currency was meant to do so by providing a fast , safe and secure type of electronic money which could be sent instantly, in any amount, anywhere in the world.\nBut some 8 years after Bitcoin’s creation, it was pretty clear the cryptocurrency was becoming more and more impractical for everyday use and instead, it was being used more as a type of digital investment, similar to buying and holding gold, for example.\nBitcoin was meant to replace fiat currencies by becoming the world's first decentralised digital currency that actually worked, but somewhere down the line something changed. 🕵🏻‍♂️\nBy May last year, a single Bitcoin transaction could take up to 4 days to complete and had an average cost of $28. In comparison, sending money abroad via a SWIFT transfer costs roughly the same amount and in some cases, takes less time to arrive in the recipient’s account.\nRead on & Subscribe to our Blog 👌🏻 Was this signalling the end of Bitcoin? 🔚\nNot really - seeing that more and more people were using Bitcoin (BTC) to store value rather than use it for its intended purpose as a transactional currency, part of the development community decided to change bitcoin's code, in order to cut fees and speed up transaction times.\nIn the community's view, this update to the code would put Bitcoin (BTC) back on its original path of becoming the world's first fully decentralised digital currency.\nBut some developers weren’t so happy about the proposed changes and wanted to maintain the current codebase - after all, developing and maintaining the original code was done with pride and patience. The solution was to split Bitcoin into two different cryptocurrencies . A fork in the Bitcoin Blockchain 🍴\nSo, after much controversy and debate within the crypto community, this change, also known as a hard fork , came into effect on the 1st of August 2017, and effectively split the Bitcoin blockchain into two separate ones – the original Bitcoin (BTC) and the newly created Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nA change in a cryptocurrency’s code is known as a hard fork because the blockchain (the ledger holding the currency’s entire transaction history) branches out to form a new one , thus giving birth to a new crypto offspring. Think of a 'hard fork' as a fork in the road and you're there! So what exactly makes BCH special? 🤔\nWhile Bitcoin Cash has many things in common with the original cryptocurrency (BTC), it also differentiates itself by offering a number of improvements in key areas such as: Increased blocksize - 32Mb as of 15th May (upgraded from 8Mb previously) No SegWit integration - the controversial upgrade that was added to Bitcoin (BTC) to allow for more transactions to be processed. Different transaction signature hashing algorithm - added to provide replay protection for Bitcoin Cash transactions against the Bitcoin chain\nBuy BCH & XRP with Revolut Crypto 👌🏻 Join Revolut for Free\nOver 1.5M people have used Revolut to set up a current account in 60 seconds, spend and send money fee-free globally using the real exchange rate, and hold and exchange 25 currencies.

Fundstrat, the ecosystem’s favorite financial professional crypto bull, is on record as welcoming government regulation, what it calls “adult supervision.”\nAlso read: Bitcoin Use Case: Limiting Government Growth Fundstrat Welcomes Adult Supervision of Crypto\nLegacy media, thanks to a Bloomberg article, ran wild with fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) this week, regarding a supposed US Department of Justice investigation of price manipulation. Weaker hands in response effectively sent bitcoin core (BTC) well below $8K, heading for 7, and the entire crypto market cap slid accordingly.\nDebate about regulation in the US and around the world has raged the entirety of cryptocurrency’s near decade-long life. Bitcoin licensing in New York, senate hearings, G20 central bankers urging global crypto laws, the requisite jockeying and lobbying for exclusive access to regulators, taken together, seems to be slouching toward something major coming down from financial minders. And well-publicized recent hacks haven’t helped confidence. There seems to be a new initial coin offering scam daily.\nRumors the DOJ is teaming with US bitcoin futures regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and possibly patching-in the US Securities and Exchange Commission can spook animal spirits, of course. Anecdotal evidence abounds. Add to that six rather frightening words, when strung together by regulators, that make speculators’ ears perk, “neither confirm nor deny an investigation” becomes all the evidence anyone needs to dump positions. Even large exchange Bitfinex has been subpoenaed by the CFTC.\nThe ecosystem’s favorite bull, Thomas Lee of Fundstrat, in a client letter, put a finer point on happenings: “These stories have pressured the crypto market, as regulatory action (and related headline risk) reduces risk appetite and also is a further deterrent for near-term inflows from new investors. However, these actions signal that adult supervision is coming to crypto and adding such oversight incrementally improves the structural integrity and legitimacy for crypto-currency investor. In other words, in order for institutional investors to be more actively engaged in crypto markets, such adult supervision is a necessary precondition.” Regulation is an Anathema to Bitcoin\nPrior to welcoming crypto regulation, Mr. Lee ate a giant, warm slice of humble pie following his Consensus conference bump prediction of many thousands in BTC price increase. Just the reverse, of course, happened, and Mr. Lee, to his credit, reappeared on as many shows to take his medicine. He acknowledged getting it badly wrong, but ultimately attributed the decline due to unforeseen regulatory rumors and, ironically, saturation at the conference of hype.\nIn a slide presentation graphic, Fundstrat continued to use “welcome,” as in crackdowns being “welcome and also widely anticipated.” On price specific manipulation investigations, they urged “this probe is again, a very welcome development.”\nTo crypto enthusiasts, they are decidedly torn. On the one hand, nearly everyone will agree bitcoin was developed to essentially leave government regulatory environments. Government regulations are not issued out of benevolence toward the hoi polloi. No, rather they’re instead an effort to pick winners and losers in terms of which sector of businesses lobbied the hardest, greasing wheels of states in their direction. Regulations enforce burdens often on startups, insulating more established and connected businesses from too much competition. Corruption, then, can and does become institutional. Present day banking is proof enough. Bitcoin, in Satoshi’s vision, releases adopters from financial cartels, at least in theory. To invite regulators goes against everything crypto stands for.\nOn the other hand, regulation does seem to be inevitable. And if it is, shouldn’t the ecosystem get out in front? Seems rational enough, and that’s a generous reading of Mr. Lee and Fundstrat’s comments. Nevertheless, the company remains bullish on bitcoin core (BTC). They point to Coinbase in particular and its staggering growth to 20 million customers, and BTC related wallet downloads of more than 3.5 million. They do, however, hold to a degree of caution if headlines remain negative and mining rewards/price reach parity.\nDo you think regulation of crypto is inevitable?

Whereas most of the illegal activity takes place online, that is not always the case. In South Africa, a kidnapping of a 12-year-old child is making headlines. This is mainly because the kidnappers have demanded a 15 Bitcoin ransom prior to releasing the child. Another Bitcoin-related Kidnapping\nIn the world of criminal activity, covering one’s tracks is not all that easy. This is especially true when dealing with payment methods which are far too easy to trace these days. For criminals, this means that using traditional payment methods is pretty much out of the question. That is why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are so appealing these days, as they seemingly provide a more anonymous option.\nIn South Africa, a very worrisome trend has begun to emerge over the past few years. It seems there has been a major increase in kidnappings involving a Bitcoin ransom. Given the perceived anonymity of Bitcoin, criminals consider this payment method far more appealing than other solutions. Even so, it doesn’t mean they will be successful in their attempts to obtain the world’s leading cryptocurrency.\nAn ongoing kidnapping in South Africa is making headlines right now. Three individuals have been taken into custody for their alleged involvement in the kidnapping of a twelve-year-old child. This abduction took place several days ago, yet the matter has not been resolved as of yet. It is unclear if these three individuals have any connection to the kidnapping or are innocent bystanders at this point.\nSo far, no official arrests have been made, and no charges have been filed, according to local sources. Additionally, the kidnappers have not been in contact with the child’s parent ever since making the 15 Bitcoin ransom demand. According to the kidnappers, failure to comply with their request will result in the child being hung and decapitated.\nNo further instructions regarding the Bitcoin ransom have been provided at this point. While the parents received this ransom note personally, it remains unclear if they will buy the cryptocurrency amount required to satisfy the kidnappers’ needs. Even so, paying 15 BTC is not a guarantee that the kidnappers will release the child.\nAll of this shows that criminals continue to favor cryptocurrency, even though it won’t serve their purposes whatsoever. That’s because various blockchain analysis firms keep close tabs on the Bitcoin network to monitor suspicious transactions. As such, they can identify senders and recipients of money. Bitcoin is not an anonymous payment method by any means, yet stories like these continue to give the world’s leading cryptocurrency a bad name.

A 51% attack is when a single entity engulfs the majority of the network (over 50% of it) and thus is able to carry out malicious activities. A similar attack has very recently been carried out on Verge.\nThe full extend of the Bitcoin Gold attacks is not yet registered, however, reports are starting to suggest that as much as $17 Million worth of Bitcoin Gold has been lost as a result of it.\nThe Bitcoin Gold team have published a response to this attack, in which they provide a very in-depth discussion about what has happened and what will happen as a result of this.\nSee it for yourself, here- https://bitcoingold.org/responding-to-attacks/\nAccording to Bitcoin Gold:\n“This is not due to some flaw in blockchain technology; any blockchain – even Bitcoin – can theoretically be attacked by a malicious actor who can control more hashing (computing) power than all the honest miners. Of course, the biggest risk is to a smaller network in the shadow of a bigger one.”\nMoreover:\n“While this problem isn’t unique to Bitcoin Gold and doesn’t represent a flaw, we consider our Exchanges to be critical partners in our Ecosystem, so in a theoretical sense, attacks on Exchanges are attacks on us all. And even when the attacker fails to steal BTC or some other currency from an Exchange after their double-spend, their 51% attack causes a “reorganization” on the blockchain, which is disruptive to honest users and steals mining revenue from honest miners… this means they literally are an attack on us all.”\nFinally:\n“We’re monitoring the situation carefully in a variety of ways to rapidly alert the Exchanges when we can tell an attack is in progress. (The last known attempt was on May 19th.) This is why many Exchanges dramatically increased their confirmation requirements, or else closed their deposit wallets entirely. We’ve been working at an incredible pace the past days to put the plan and pieces together, and we expect to upgrade our mainnet approximately seven days after the necessary software is up and running on our testnet . This upgrade will require some software updates on the part of Exchanges, Wallets, Pools, Explorers… While it would be better to give all our partners more than seven days to test and deploy to avoid disruption, these attacks have already forced disruption on us all, so we feel it’s best to get the upgrade completed as soon as we possibly can.”\nThese extracts cover just a small part of the story from Bitcoin Gold, however, hopefully this provides a brief account of what has happened. If you are a Bitcoin Gold investor and do have concerns about this, I suggest you have a look over the full article, as mentioned above.\nSo, what will happen next?\nBitcoin Gold are going to run some updates to attempt to recover from this, although, as we have seen with Verge , sometimes updates simply just expose new vulnerabilities. Hopefully Bitcoin Gold can recover from this and hopefully they are able to learn from mistakes made that may have led up to these attacks being so successful.

However, the payments suddenly stopped.\"\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n\"This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they've lost money,\" police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa's central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.\n(Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by Joe Brock/Keith Weir) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whtc south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:38:57.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7c9d85577329e14b5caa3e2a0f6c06c8f27e29b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwDmqfrujCYsCWdg2cN8lxY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7c9d85577329e14b5caa3e2a0f6c06c8f27e29b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwDmqfrujCYsCWdg2cN8lxY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nUse your personal link to invite more people and increase your chances of winning.

To us, a unifying set of mathematics can be used to predict all asset classes and generate an abnormal return that consistently out performs the world market portfolio. We have shown with our models are accurate in forecasting equities, indices, commodities , fx rates, bonds and even cryptos. Our models account for volatility and automatically adjust their parameters as the market changes. The model uses vast computation power and can be used to unlock insights that support trading action. We then use a genetic algorithm to find how much to weight each asset in the portfolio.\nHow much can you make with Grey Trading?\nWe have calculated our Forex Portfolios from the year 2000 to 2018 using Daily Close data. Our back tests are 100% accurate and our 100% real world solutions to making extraordinary profits simply by converting from one currency to another at the right time of the month. If you continue to keep swapping from one hot currency to the next hot currency you can compound gains month on month and year on year. Each trade had a wide margin for error meaning that you have up to 24 hours to place the trade. With the Grey Trading Approach, it is possible to generate above 7 figures starting from 10,000GBP in your first year. It is not essential that you start\nwith 10000GPB you can start with 2000GBP but you must realise that the likely target is then low end 6 figures after 12 months trading. Successful traders who implement our systems will follow strict emotional discipline. You must not invest money you can not afford to lose and you must understand that investments can go up as well as down. The tell-tale factor that determines your success will be your emotional management. Since positions are held for a minimum of 1 day and up to 90 days it can subject you to emotional fatigue.\nOur Approach In early 2016 I developed a theory that all financial securities could be categorised into 9 states. These states are the Steady Trend, Reversal, Strong Trend and Super Trend. The function characterising the separation between the different states is best describes as a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations allow us to make the function reverse once it reaches a threshold value. This threshold value is variable depending on a given volatility in the market in the last 20 trading days. Once the market goes approaches threshold the market begins to reverse, as institutions begin to take profit. These micro-cycles are very prevalent in the commodities markets. The third state in the cycle is the super uptrend when security prices accelerate beyond threshold levels this could be due to new information entering the market in the form of economic data releases. The super up trend is characterised by a cumulative abnormal return going beyond 3 standard deviations outside the average months volatility range. The quantitative nature of this strategy of our approach allows us to use equations, deviations and variance to calculate what state the market is in. We then adapt the model to the market by using a 20 day rolling volatility . This allows the threshold to adjust to market conditions which optimises the model for any security.\nOur approach relies on Open and Close Daily data for calculating market states quantitatively. We then distinguish in the next section how our process is then to determine what stage in the cycle we are in given previous states and the current state. We can confirm the cycle stage by using Daily Highs and Daily Lows aswell as the difference between the Open and Close price of the day. Our methodology is purely mathematical and can be thoroughly tested on any asset in the world market portfolio since data collection began back in 1987 ie the Second Big Bang.

A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n\"Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,\" the police said in a statement.\n\"Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.\"\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n\"This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they've lost money,\" police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa's central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.\n(Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by Joe Brock/Keith Weir) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wtvb south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:43:02.121+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "47c93f5910d988aaffd12a2c074a17b3679b5d11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoCRMKgJtqE6vjJzt7jeBhsM5RaomIFLBongymgkYyOLJ9Qbiw7MgX7FMhHvKHwFMHP2KxYTXboPg--", "site_full": "betiforex.com", "site": "betiforex.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin licks wounds, remains vulnerable – Forex news – Binary options", "title_full": "Bitcoin licks wounds, remains vulnerable – Forex news – Binary options", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "47c93f5910d988aaffd12a2c074a17b3679b5d11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoCRMKgJtqE6vjJzt7jeBhsM5RaomIFLBongymgkYyOLJ9Qbiw7MgX7FMhHvKHwFMHP2KxYTXboPg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin licks wounds, remains vulnerable – Forex news – Binary options", "text": "fedorenkoalexei\nBitcoin dropped for the fourth day in a row yesterday, with the price derailed an important intermediate support around $7,400. The coin refreshed April 12 lows at $7,260 and trimmed intraday losses by the end of the trading day. During the morning hours Friday, BTCUSD licks its wounds in the $7,600 area but remains vulnerable to further losses.\nThis time, the reason behind the latest sell-off was not a technical one. The US Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into price manipulation of large cryptocurrencies like bitcoin , and the market took this news rather painfully, despite the industry has become more immune to regulatory crackdown lately. The ongoing downtrend and quite high volatility exacerbated the negative market reaction to the news. Besides, as long as the regulatory uncertainty persists, long-term and institutional investors will likely remain out of the game, and this fact hurts the industry.\nIn the short term, the coin needs to confirm its recovery above $7,400 in order to resume the upside bias and return to $8,000 and higher. Once the dust settles, we may see further corrective rebound as the pair looks oversold and therefore attractive for opening longs. Should the current recovery attempts fail, the downtrend will gain traction, and the $7,000 figure will be at risk.
