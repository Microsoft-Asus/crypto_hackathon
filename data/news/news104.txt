Reports that Bank of England is considering a bank-run cryptocurrency garnered some attention.\nBitcoin was trading at $7,123.6 by 12:05AM ET (04:05GMT) on the Bitfinex exchange, down 3.9% over the previous 24 hours.\nEthereum, the world‚Äôs second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, plunged 8.8% at $524.8 on the Bitfinex exchange.\nRipple‚Äôs XRP token fell 8.8% higher to $0.55654 on the Poloniex exchange.\nMeanwhile, Litecoin slumped 5.4% to $112.27.\nMark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Monday that he would consider a digital currency run by the central bank, according to reports, although Carney then added it is not currently a pressing concern.\nHis comments contradicted with Bank of England‚Äôs announcement earlier this year, in which the bank said it would not issue a central bank-run crypto.

IPHoldings South West LLC started to threaten a small seller of bitcoin-themed t-shirts on Etsy with a lawsuit. As CCN reported on May 25, the business owner published the claim letter on his Reddit profile. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt believe it at first since I knew that bitcoin and the bitcoin logo are public domain, and even a similar trademark application in the US failed,‚Äù the user wrote.\nThe owner of a store with bitcoin merchandise posted on the Reddit a letter he had received from a company claiming to have a trademark for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù. The range of the goods under \"Bitcoin\" trademark includes footwear, clothing, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages.\nThe letter also contained a request asking to get rid of all the stuff that depicts a famous cryptocurrency. Furthermore, it was stated that Etsy store had to recall all fintech-related goods to the trademark possessor, otherwise, it would get sued.\nNevertheless, a deeper insight into the issue showed that A.B.C. IPHoldings South West LLC does own this trademark. The respective application had been submitted to the UK Intellectual Property Office in December 2017 and was approved last month.\nThis case seems to be the first successful one in the history of cryptocurrency market, as some companies have already tried to trademark the name of a world‚Äôs most popular financial technology. In March 2015, Urban Trend‚Äôs made an attempt to trademark bitcoin technology but got a rejection from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Massive price swings occur on a regular basis and cause a fair bit of negative market pressure. One of the main questions is whether or not there is effectively any degree of Bitcoin price manipulation taking place. The proof is in the pudding, but it remains difficult to say for sure. The Wild Bitcoin Price Swings\nOver the past nine years, there have been many debates regarding the Bitcoin price . It is an extremely unstable market, which tends to see ups and downs when people least expect it. To some users, this is a clear sign of market manipulation. Others see it as ‚Äúanother day at the office‚Äù. In a lot of cases, the BTC price is fluctuating for no apparent reason at all.\nFinancial markets, in general, seem to be prone to manipulation. It has happened before, and it will continue to happen for some time to come. People with a lot of money to spend will look for any way to improve their portfolio. This is no different in the world of cryptocurrency, which is perhaps even easier to manipulate, to a certain degree.\nMore specifically, all cryptocurrencies have a rather low market cap. Albeit $150 billion sounds pretty steep for Bitcoin, it is a small market compared to traditional assets. Anyone looking to influence cryptocurrency prices will effectively manipulate the markets whenever they see fit. Proving this is done on a large scale, however, will always remain rather challenging. The Manipulation Will not Stop\nThe US Justice Department is looking into Bitcoin price manipulation right now. Whether or not they will find anything out of the ordinary, remains to be seen. Even so, indicting anyone for this manipulative behavior will pose another big problem. Large holders of Bitcoin can effectively influence the market with a few clicks of a button, but that isn‚Äôt necessarily nefarious intent.\nVery few people benefit from a lower Bitcoin price. Miners need a specific BTC value to break even, let alone make a profit. Large holders of Bitcoin are not inclined to see their portfolio value drop either. Exchanges have no real benefit from a lower Bitcoin price either. As such, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence regarding cryptocurrency price manipulation. Not enough to effectively change this situation overnight, unfortunately.\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the Bitcoin price. Rest assured the manipulation will not stop, for better or worse. Those driving the price down will continue to do so until they are satisfied. The ultimate objective of doing so remains a bit unclear at this stage. An uneasy Bitcoin price situation will remain in place for quite some time to come.\nImage from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertchir/2018/05/28/i-would-be-shocked-if-bitcoin-prices-werent-manipulated/#1af555872be9", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/24/bitcoin-pressured-as-federal-prosecutors-investigate-price-manipulation/", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/28/bitcoin-price-watch-btc-usd-upsides-remain-limited/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price manipulation steers world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:19:01.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f5ee19b7303ec5fda7095e1d01c1d9b3035c1e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3xxRBLU.1TinfZ6POrERsP_hqa3nd1FOziufIOYcP.goi8TXhokM3vAY6cH0JFPigA--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7394.31", "title_full": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7394.31", "published": "2018-05-29T15:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f5ee19b7303ec5fda7095e1d01c1d9b3035c1e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3xxRBLU.1TinfZ6POrERsP_hqa3nd1FOziufIOYcP.goi8TXhokM3vAY6cH0JFPigA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T15:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7394.31", "text": "Home ¬ª bitcoin prize ¬ª bitcoin today ¬ª Current price of Bitcoin is $7394.31 Current price of Bitcoin is $7394.31 7394.31 ‚ñ∑ May 29, 2018 at 06:59PM #bitcoin #invest #money #bitcoin # invest #money The race for supremacy in crypto land changes daily and it is hard to keep up with the high paced markets.

We cover these opinions in today‚Äôs edition of Bitcoin in Brief. Of course, positive predictions are almost always balanced by some negative expectations; in this case they are part of a short-term prognosis.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Poloniex Responds to Frozen Accounts Complaints McAfee Sees Bitcoin Beyond $15,000 in June\nSoon after tweeting that ‚Äúinstitutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,‚Äù cybersecurity guru John McAfee issued another bullish prediction. Focusing on short term analysis this time, which he admits is not his favorite, he turns attention to several events that may influence the cryptocurrency market ‚Äì which, in his words, ‚Äúwill turn before June 12.‚Äù\nAccording to McAfee , the ‚ÄúKorea deal is done and Trump will sign the documents in Singapore on 12 June [‚Ä¶] The various noises being made are propaganda for domestic consumption,‚Äù he notes. After Singapore, the software businessman expects a visit by the US President to Japan, where ‚Äútalks on creating a gold backed US currency will commence.‚Äù\nBitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicts. His post also features several altcoins like golem, docademic, bezop, bitcoin private, and EOS. McAfee, who is a known supporter of cryptocurrencies and their adoption, has previously stated that the price of bitcoin will reach $1 million per coin by the end of 2020.\nIn recently recorded video , the internet security expert also talks about ‚Äúthe war we are all engaged in.‚Äù The banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto, in his judgement. In a rather calm tone, McAfee advises crypto enthusiasts to take action ‚Äì write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. John McAfee calls on his followers to also write the SEC and ask ‚Äúto leave us alone, because we are not a security [‚Ä¶] we are a currency.‚Äù Bitcoin Still a Buy, Good for Store of Value\nMcAfee is not alone in the optimists‚Äô camp. According to blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart, bitcoin is still worth buying, despite its continued losses. The increased number of use cases is a proof that BTC is becoming more institutionalized, he told CNBC . ‚ÄúEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space,‚Äù Bogart said, noting that banks are either going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they‚Äôre working on a custody platform, or are opening up a trading desk. Spencer Bogart advised investors to sell coins like cardano, tron, IOTA and NEO, but said they should hold cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum, ripple, and EOS.\nAccording to Matt Hougan, Global Head of Research for Bitwise Asset Management, the most compelling use case for bitcoin today is as a store of value, although he admits the idea is often dismissed because of the volatility of the cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúGold is solid. Bitcoin is volatile. It‚Äôll never work ‚Äì these statements are ignorant of gold‚Äôs history and devoid of imagination,‚Äù Hougan recently wrote in an op-ed piece for Forbes .\n‚ÄúBefore 1971, the US dollar was hard-backed by gold, and gold‚Äôs value was effectively vouchsafed by the full faith and credit of our government. When Richard Nixon took the US off of the gold standard, it set gold loose from its moorings,‚Äù Matt Hougan explains. ‚ÄúWhat followed was a period of huge volatility, as gold fought to establish itself as an independent store of wealth. In 1974, for instance, gold bullion prices rose 73%, before falling 24% in 1975. In 1981, gold lost 33% of its value, after being up 121% just two years prior,‚Äù he details. Russian Experts Expect Further Decline in Prices\nCrypto experts contacted by Russian media are not so optimistic, at least in the short run. The value of bitcoin core (BTC) will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold, they claim. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $7,450, while bitcoin cash (BCH) holds over $900.\nThe downward trend is largely due to decisions and statements made by regulators in a number of countries, points out Vladislav Antonov, analyst at Alpari. Several factors have caused the weakening of bitcoin, according to the expert. Recently, the US Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into supposed price manipulations in the cryptocurrency markets. News came out that authorities in India may impose 18 percent tax on crypto trading.\nSpeaking to RIA Novosti , Antonov also mentioned the crackdown on fraudulent ICO projects and suspicious crypto activities, part of the coordinated ‚Äú Operation Crypto-Sweep ‚Äù in North America. Another event that has influenced the prices is the expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25th.\nIgor Zartdinov, co-founder of the ICG crypto fund, says the decrease in the value of bitcoin occurs on a neutral-to-positive news background. He thinks that market manipulation is a possible explanation, as big players usually earn at the expense of small investors. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we are seeing now,‚Äù Zartdinov believes.\nWhat are your predictions about the future of crypto markets?

According to blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart, bitcoin is still worth buying, despite its continued losses. The increased number of use cases is a proof that BTC is becoming more institutionalized, he told CNBC . ‚ÄúEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space,‚Äù Bogart said, noting that banks are either going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they‚Äôre working on a custody platform, or are opening up a trading desk. Spencer Bogart advised investors to sell coins like cardano, tron, IOTA and NEO, but said they should hold cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum, ripple, and EOS.\nAccording to Matt Hougan, Global Head of Research for Bitwise Asset Management, the most compelling use case for bitcoin today is as a store of value, although he admits the idea is often dismissed because of the volatility of the cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúGold is solid. Bitcoin is volatile.

Russian Experts Expect Further Decline in Prices\nCrypto experts contacted by Russian media are not so optimistic, at least in the short run. The value of bitcoin core (BTC) will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold, they claim. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $7,450, while bitcoin cash (BCH) holds over $900.\nThe downward trend is largely due to decisions and statements made by regulators in a number of countries, points out Vladislav Antonov, analyst at Alpari. Several factors have caused the weakening of bitcoin, according to the expert. Recently, the US Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into supposed price manipulations in the cryptocurrency markets. News came out that authorities in India may impose 18 percent tax on crypto trading.\nSpeaking to RIA Novosti , Antonov also mentioned the crackdown on fraudulent ICO projects and suspicious crypto activities, part of the coordinated ‚Äú Operation Crypto-Sweep ‚Äù in North America. Another event that has influenced the prices is the expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25th.\nIgor Zartdinov, co-founder of the ICG crypto fund, says the decrease in the value of bitcoin occurs on a neutral-to-positive news background.

In 1981, gold lost 33% of its value, after being up 121% just two years prior,‚Äù he details.\nRussian Experts Expect Further Decline in Prices Crypto experts contacted by Russian media are not so optimistic, at least in the short run. The value of bitcoin core (BTC) will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold, they claim. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $7,450, while bitcoin cash (BCH) holds over $900.\nThe downward trend is largely due to decisions and statements made by regulators in a number of countries, points out Vladislav Antonov, analyst at Alpari. Several factors have caused the weakening of bitcoin, according to the expert. Recently, the US Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into supposed price manipulations in the cryptocurrency markets. News came out that authorities in India may impose 18 percent tax on crypto trading.\nSpeaking to RIA Novosti , Antonov also mentioned the crackdown on fraudulent ICO projects and suspicious crypto activities, part of the coordinated ‚Äú Operation Crypto-Sweep ‚Äù in North America. Another event that has influenced the prices is the expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25th.\nIgor Zartdinov, co-founder of the ICG crypto fund, says the decrease in the value of bitcoin occurs on a neutral-to-positive news background. He thinks that market manipulation is a possible explanation, as big players usually earn at the expense of small investors. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we are seeing now,‚Äù Zartdinov believes.\nWhat are your predictions about the future of crypto markets?

Over the last three weeks, Bitcoin price has dropped to trade at $7,400 on May 25, 2018.\nBut despite the high volatility, the currency has demonstrated tremendous resilience. On May 24, 2018, Bloomberg reported that the Justice Department in the US was initiating criminal investigations to determine whether Bitcoin prices are being manipulated. Following the announcement, the price of Bitcoin experienced a sudden drop to $7,339 but recovered later in the day to trade at $7,599 .\nBitcoin Institutionalization\nMainstreaming of Bitcoin is increasingly becoming evident in the banking sector. Speaking during an interview on CNBC on Friday, Bogart said increasing application of Bitcoin is a strong sign the digital currency is getting institutionalized.\n‚ÄúThe institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occurring. Every major bank is trying to do something in this space. Either they are going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, [or] they are working on a custody platform, or they are operating a trading desk. So, that‚Äôs absolutely taking place. A deeper institutionalization of Bitcoin is overall positive,‚Äù Bogart said.\nIn August 2017, Switzerland‚Äôs Falcon Private Bank allowed its customers to buy and hold Bitcoin as well as Litecoin , Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash , the first Swiss private bank to do that, On May 2, 2018. Rana Yared, an executive at Goldman Sachs was quoted on by New York Times saying the bank resonates with clients who prefer to hold Bitcoin.\n‚ÄúIt resonates with us when a client says, ‚ÄòI want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value‚Äô,‚Äù Yared said.\nThe bank set up a team to look into possibilities of trading Bitcoins. Further, Goldman Sachs has started establishing a Bitcoin trading desk to trade Bitcoin-futures for its customers.\nMorgan Stanley, a competitor of Goldman Sachs may also be headed in the same direction. On May 15, 2018, Nomura, an investment bank based in Japan made public its digital asset offering.\nCoinbase, the largest cryptocurrency in the US, has developed a product suite targeting hedge fund customers. The digital currency exchange strategically opened a branch in New York to reach hedge fund clients. The exchange is also strengthening its institutional investor services to facilitate large trades that are characteristic of sophisticated investors like hedge funds.\nHold or Sell\nAccording to Bogart, a majority of cryptocurrencies in the coin market today promise more than they can deliver.\nHe said many cryptocurrencies are ‚Äúover-promising and under-delivering. Meanwhile, you have a few that are kind of excelling at their use cases, Bitcoin being one of them,‚Äù he added.\nIn Bogart‚Äôs view, investors should be selling cryptocurrencies such as TRON , NEO , Cardano , and IOTA adding that ‚Äúa lot of those tokens are overvalued. They could go up significantly, but they also have a significant headwind.‚Äù\nOn the other hand, the venture capitalist advises investors to hold on currencies like Ripple , EOS , Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum that he termed as ‚Äòneutral‚Äô.

An example of one of these Altcoins is DasCoin which is rising in use and popularity in the cryptocurrency market.\nFor people looking to get in to cryptocurrency or for experienced buyers and traders, Altcoins can be an enticing option, but with all new things there may be some hesitation due to lack of information.\nBelow is an overview of some of the salient points to consider when looking at Altcoins as either your first cryptocurrency to purchase, or as a secondary option to diversify your assets.\nThe Difference Between Bitcoin and Altcoins\nMost people wonder what the difference is between Bitcoins and Altcoins. The need for a distinction between the two often leads people to believe these two cryptocurrency options differ on a fundamental level. But that assumption is generally incorrect. While there are differences between the two, on a fundamental level, Bitcoins and Altcoins are very much the same.\nBitcoins are the original cryptocurrency, and the first development in the sector to utilize blockchain technology. While it is constantly changing, experts in the field have noted some flaws and difficulties when using Bitcoins. This has led developers to develop their own alternatives to the Bitcoin , called Altcoins, which are all derivatives from the original Bitcoin and blockchain technology, but each offer their own approach to solve some of the clearer issues Bitcoin exhibits as a currency.\nIn the case of DasCoin for example, while it utilizes blockchain technology to operate as a cryptocurrency, it tackles the volume and expansion issues of Bitcoin, with an intuitively designed algorithm that ensures they are distributed as nodes are successfully integrated into the networks infrastructure, meaning that the network expands according to the volume and needs of its users, unlike Bitcoin.\nDifferent Uses for Altcoins like DasCoin\nOne key thing to remember about Altcoins is they have been modified from the general Bitcoin algorithm, and therefore can serve different purposes and offer different features than you may normally be accustomed to. Some users may also be confused as different options will have different interfaces and methods of use, which can put people off or cause difficulty down the line due to the many options available.\nPotential buyers of Altcoins such as DasCoin should check the details of the cryptocurrency, what it aims to be utilized for, and its differences from other options. This information is almost always easily available online in both an official capacity, and through discussions within the community concerning specific Altcoins.\nIn conclusion, when considering Altcoins as a potential cryptocurrency purchase, one simply needs to be aware of its differences from Bitcoin, and how each option can have a different use, and a different set of features and methods of use to go along with it.\n¬© YFS Magazine.

Massive", "text": "Bitcoin is a notoriously volatile market. Massive price swings occur on a regular basis and cause a fair bit of negative market pressure. One of the main questions is whether or not there is effectively any degree of Bitcoin price manipulation taking place. The proof is in the pudding, but it remains difficult to say for sure. \\n The Wild Bitcoin Price Swings \\n\nOver the past nine years, there have been many debates regarding the Bitcoin price . It is an extremely unstable market, which tends to see ups and downs when people least expect it. To some users, this is a clear sign of market manipulation. Others see it as ‚Äúanother day at the office‚Äù. In a lot of cases, the BTC price is fluctuating for no apparent reason at all. \\n\nFinancial markets, in general, seem to be prone to manipulation. It has happened before, and it will continue to happen for some time to come. People with a lot of money to spend will look for any way to improve their portfolio. This is no different in the world of cryptocurrency, which is perhaps even easier to manipulate, to a certain degree. \\n\nMore specifically, all cryptocurrencies have a rather low market cap. Albeit $150 billion sounds pretty steep for Bitcoin, it is a small market compared to traditional assets. Anyone looking to influence cryptocurrency prices will effectively manipulate the markets whenever they see fit. Proving this is done on a large scale, however, will always remain rather challenging. \\n The Manipulation Will not Stop \\n\nThe US Justice Department is looking into Bitcoin price manipulation right now. Whether or not they will find anything out of the ordinary, remains to be seen. Even so, indicting anyone for this manipulative behavior will pose another big problem. Large holders of Bitcoin can effectively influence the market with a few clicks of a button, but that isn‚Äôt necessarily nefarious intent. \\n\nVery few people benefit from a lower Bitcoin price. Miners need a specific BTC value to break even, let alone make a profit. Large holders of Bitcoin are not inclined to see their portfolio value drop either. Exchanges have no real benefit from a lower Bitcoin price either. As such, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence regarding cryptocurrency price manipulation. Not enough to effectively change this situation overnight, unfortunately. \\n\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the Bitcoin price. Rest assured the manipulation will not stop, for better or worse. Those driving the price down will continue to do so until they are satisfied. The ultimate objective of doing so remains a bit unclear at this stage. An uneasy Bitcoin price situation will remain in place for quite some time to come. \\n\n \\n Image from Shutterstock \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Manipulation Steers World‚Äôs Top Crypto in Difficult Direction appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T22:57:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87ce801418521e656c8548614f69dd99b281c52c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_acMKfwVWCe2vE3QXSxQPdRm.s_e5FTyAQpzNwH1tjpxF.s.NaoZAGZXhn3ix7IEiPIY9i9wLWV2vHi4QKonMTasKTvwgkzHCyKwbedVFyZ8UVzjMAdj8pqsfPUYagVoaV2Jqi4qdrhA--", "site_full": "www.2oceansvibe.com", "site": "2oceansvibe.com", "site_section": "http://www.2oceansvibe.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "2oceansvibe.com", "title": "The Hawks And A Bitcoin Company Are Doing Battle Over A R1 Billion Scam", "title_full": "The Hawks And A Bitcoin Company Are Doing Battle Over A R1 Billion Scam", "published": "2018-05-29T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90191, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87ce801418521e656c8548614f69dd99b281c52c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_acMKfwVWCe2vE3QXSxQPdRm.s_e5FTyAQpzNwH1tjpxF.s.NaoZAGZXhn3ix7IEiPIY9i9wLWV2vHi4QKonMTasKTvwgkzHCyKwbedVFyZ8UVzjMAdj8pqsfPUYagVoaV2Jqi4qdrhA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nereesha Patel", "published": "2018-05-29T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Hawks And A Bitcoin Company Are Doing Battle Over A R1 Billion Scam", "text": "The Clickhole Bitcoin Infographic You‚Äôve Been Waiting For\nWhile there are some scams out there that aren‚Äôt convincing enough to part you from your money, a recent Bitcoin scam has reportedly caused more than 28 000 South African investors to suffer losses exceeding R1 billion and counting, according to a business report by BusinessTech .\nThe scam goes a little something like this: an entity, known as BTC Global, tells clients they would earn 2% returns per day on their initial investment, 14% a week, and 50% in a month.\nAs part of the arrangement, payments were said to be made every Monday. Apparently, some of these investors were paid in terms of this agreement.\nSounds like the real deal at first.\nBut then the payments suddenly stopped, and that‚Äôs when the alarm bells started going off.\nThe Hawks released a statement on Friday, May 25, saying that the investigation involves a company identified as ‚ÄúBitCaw Trading Company, commonly known as BTC Global‚Äù.\nThing is, though, BitCaw Trading denies being involved. They‚Äôve refuted all links to this scam and BTC, and that it wants the Hawks‚Äô statement to be retracted or they will take the matter to court, according to another report by BusinessTech .\nBitCaw MD, Andrew Caw, said:\nWhile we appreciate that the Hawks are investigating BTC Global and the circumstances around the ‚Äòinvestment opportunity‚Äù‚Äô which folded earlier this year, we must clarify that BitCaw Trading is in no way related to BTC Global.

Users of deVere Crypto , the pioneering app by deVere Group, can now also buy, sell, store, and exchange Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and EOS (EOS), alongside Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Dash (DASH), Monero (XMR) and Stellar Lumens (XLM). The news comes as deVere release the findings of a new international poll in which it is revealed that 35 per cent of high net worth individuals are now already invested in or will make investments in cryptocurrencies before the end of 2018. The 600-plus respondents of this poll are deVere clients who currently reside in the U.S., the UK, Australia, the UAE, Qatar, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Spain, France, Germany and South Africa. Nigel Green , founder and CEO of deVere Group, comments: ‚ÄúThe addition of Bitcoin Cash and EOS to the deVere Crypto app is part of our ongoing commitment to clients. The users of the app are demanding an ever-wider, diversified crypto portfolio as the crypto sector expands and moves even further into the mainstream. ‚ÄúThis mainstream expansion is clearly evidenced by the fact that more than a third [35 per cent] of wealthy individuals around the world ‚Äì who are already likely to be successful investors ‚Äì are telling us that they already have exposure to crypto or that they will have by the end of this year.‚Äù He continues: ‚ÄúThe survey‚Äôs findings demonstrate that high net worth individuals are increasingly unable to ignore the huge potential of cryptocurrencies. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs now surging public awareness of the value, need and demand for digital, global currencies in a digitalised, globalised world.‚Äù ‚ÄúI expect that a broader awareness and understanding of the crypto sector will grow exponentially in the next year as the tech that underpins it further improves, as major corporations and financial institutions embrace it, and as regulation is further developed.‚Äù Speaking earlier this year, Mr Green noted: ‚ÄúAll the digital coins on deVere Crypto have different characteristics, strengths and values. ‚ÄúAs such these additions help to achieve portfolio diversification within this specific asset class and their individual traits make them useful in different ways for investors.‚Äù The deVere CEO concludes: ‚ÄúI believe that there is no longer any doubt that cryptocurrencies in some form are the future of money. ‚ÄúAnd, seemingly, this is a view increasingly shared by wealthy investors the world over.‚Äù Download the Free Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency\nA Guide to Trading, Investing and Managing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other digital currencies.

Now, the price of each BTC is about $9,000, which is much higher than the price it has shown for the first time: 10,000 bitcoins for a $15 pizza coupon. If I were the owner of the deal, I wouldn't have dared to eat pizza for the rest of my life.\nWhat do you think is the future price of bitcoin?\nBitcoin in the future will be more popular, with more and more users. Bitcoin will be a global currency and at that time bitcoin value will be more stable.\nThe way people are investing into bitcoin and social media is promoting it, there is no way bitcoin cannot reach the level of legal international global currency of the world.

Dan dalam waktu yang sedikit ini pasti penjualan token dapat sold out dan laku keras sehingga menciptakan proyek sukses.\nUntuk sampai sekarang penjualan token belum sold out bang tapi alhamdulilah sudah hampir mencapainya dan saya sangat berharap nantinya bitcoin crown ini bisa sukses dan masuk di exchange besar\nsyukurlah gan kalo penjualan tokennya lancar , ane ngga kaget si karna dari awal ane udah yakin kalo project ini bakalan bisa sukses besar, entah kenapa cuma liat dari namanya aja ane langsung mikir kalo project ini adalah project yang bagus soalnya ada kata bitcoinnya jadi kayak langsung nyita perhatian aja si dan menurut ane ini emang salah satu strategi marketing dari teamnya , good job lah\nmantap kali proyek ini penjualannya bisa dibilang lancar dan banyak pendukungnya jadi harapan saya sendiri smoga proyek ini sampai ico selesai bisa tercapai hardcap.\nBener gan dan waktu penjualan tinggal sehari saja, semoga ada paus yang menborong BTCC sehingga dapat target dan berhasil. BTCC ini memang bagus dan memberikan pendapatan yang luarbiasa serta memberikan kesegaran dalam otak setelah lelah bekerja, dengan game akan mendapatkan rasa senang dan hiburan.\nsudah selesai bounty ternyata, saya lihat bounty berjalan hanya 4 minggu, dan spreadsheets belum juga di updated apakah ada masalah dengan bounty Bitcoin Crown?.. dan semoga hanya terlambat saja, tidak ada masalah yang serius. dan pembagian hadiah dapat lancar\nUntuk AIRDOP Rode pertama sudah di bagikan gan,, Tinggal tahap kedua dan Bounty mungkin setelah ICO akan di ditribusikan\nKinerja team luar biasa begitu pula dev dan manajer, mereka telah melakukan pendistribusian bagi yang join aidrop, jadi untuk bounty jangan khawatir masalah ss, kesibukan mereka tidak terpantau oleh ss dibounty, jadi bersabar saaja, nanti sudah saatnya dapat up date ss.\nkalau memang untuk airdrop sudah di bagikan, tentu untuk bounty lainya akan segera menyusul dan sabar menunggu saja lagi pula ICO juga belum selesai dan tinggal sebentar lagi ICO selesai sabar aja gan, mungkin Spreadsheet akan di perbarui setelah ICO selesai sekalian.\nTim mereka bergerak cepat ICO saja belum berakhir airdrop sudah di distribusikan ,, semoga saja Bounty juga nanti pembagiannya lancar ,, Setelah ICO berakhir\nmemang cepat dan bagus pekerjaan dari tim BTCC ini dan tidak salah jika hasil yang mereka dapat dari penjualan token sampai sekarang ini sudah maksimal dan semoga sampai akhir ICO bisa mencapai hardcap.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T13:56:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a28b18626e5d2dad66c2a1e2dd97c02669ec052", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfZ3kyAF69RU3vfvDTEcq.GgMxfROo_wbafL4RJzJniEt4ioZDoLvYuU-", "site_full": "www.coinstaker.com", "site": "coinstaker.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Czechia Installs 10 New Bitcoin ATM in Prague‚Äôs Subway System", "title_full": "Czechia Installs 10 New Bitcoin ATM in Prague‚Äôs Subway System", "published": "2018-05-29T14:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.coinstaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Prague_Subway_ATMs.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a28b18626e5d2dad66c2a1e2dd97c02669ec052", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfZ3kyAF69RU3vfvDTEcq.GgMxfROo_wbafL4RJzJniEt4ioZDoLvYuU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-29T14:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Czechia Installs 10 New Bitcoin ATM in Prague‚Äôs Subway System", "text": "Czechia Installs 10 New Bitcoin ATM in Prague‚Äôs Subway System 0 Shares 0 Comments 2 Min. reading\nThe cryptocurrency industry keeps expanding all over the world, and Czechia is giving an important step.

Not sure how the BIP¬ís are actually approved or implemented and ATM believing is all basically comes down to getting Gavin¬ís ultimate approvi. Which like I said I worry may at some point ultimately be a issue.\nAnother thing I¬íve wondered since getting into BTC is what happens when all BTC are mined, people hodl, and people die? Is there any contingency in place or being planned to recover stale or dead bitcoins in wallets that are OBVIOUSLY non active addresses? Or will everything that is owned by dead investors or give up investors be doomed to simply be a burn loss?...\nAbout the dead part it is our responsibility to let others know our keys because this is the only thing how you will pass on your coins to somebody. There is always a possibility to create transactions and lock it with specific time. So you give to your spouse, kids, brother, sister or anybody else this transaction in this format that you are giving your bitcoins to them on that day. Of you happen to be alive you can simply transfer new coins to another address and make such transaction again.

Castle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, has created a course of residential treatment for those it deems to be crypto addicts.\nExperts told the Evening Standard that crypto trading can become a form of behavioural addiction, with traders obsessively glued to ‚Äúminute-by-minute‚Äù market fluctuations. The devised treatment program is therefore closer to existing methods for treating gambling addictions, rather than to substance abuse programs.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was quoted by the Evening Standard as saying: ‚ÄúThe high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. it provides excitement and an escape from reality. bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. it‚Äôs a classic bubble situation.‚Äù\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center‚Äôs new treatments. Marini told the Standard that ‚Äúintroducing life structure is key,‚Äù adding: ‚Äúi see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don‚Äôt like the world they‚Äôre in. the first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. this helps them identify with each other and realise that they‚Äôre not alone.‚Äù\nLast year, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his home as collateral for a $325,000 equity loan, in pursuit of making a mid-term profit on the cryptocurrency. Crypto community members, evidently viewing his investment mindset as equivalent to gambling , remarked that the move was ‚Äúalmost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.‚Äù\nFrom another perspective, there has been some discussion in the UK as to whether declaring your crypto trading to be gambling could help to avoid taxes with the British tax authority HMRC, which generally deems crypto profits as subject either to income or capital gains tax laws.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/news/man-borrows-325000-to-buy-bitcoin-investment-or-gambling-on-life-savings", "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-addicts-are-offered-treatment-in-uk-for-first-time-a3849456.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-blockchain-technology-is-taking-gambling-industry-to-new-level", "https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/907649/Bitcoin-tax-cryptocurrency-ripple-HMRC-capital-gains-earnings-gambling-bet-winnings", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/britain-introduces-crypto-task-force-to-foster-fintech-innovation"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris dunkan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony marini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris burn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peeblesshire", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:19:30.061+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a483f703907f77e3a424f86a674ebc513392cb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5kn7NitFT61zy3BKaONc3JYsOkpwkqVqgoweeamUl1hV8QMqHCFzWXbHzQv369EIoIM65Yf.42n4THDxEVyJQDR.F5GpOzFMFm55vv1G2E7Sy0Q66WA.8V0XXQSR52OZNQ--", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Five Cryptocurrencies Into One: Bitcoin Origin Launches Penta-Fork Multichain - Blockchain News", "title_full": "Five Cryptocurrencies Into One: Bitcoin Origin Launches Penta-Fork Multichain - Blockchain News", "published": "2018-05-29T14:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a483f703907f77e3a424f86a674ebc513392cb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5kn7NitFT61zy3BKaONc3JYsOkpwkqVqgoweeamUl1hV8QMqHCFzWXbHzQv369EIoIM65Yf.42n4THDxEVyJQDR.F5GpOzFMFm55vv1G2E7Sy0Q66WA.8V0XXQSR52OZNQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-29T14:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Five Cryptocurrencies Into One: Bitcoin Origin Launches Penta-Fork Multichain - Blockchain News", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T14:44:44.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "765d39ddedcde76f99696ce1825c47cadb5ece73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR4nwj9H35.Gq3Ns1Z9.r_Opy6t25OlVJ78zVKENTLEvZipqghuGiwjPc74_qhQB_M48bZeiSssNwRTjmvabJRBUbjB383HfqM-", "site_full": "it.slashdot.org", "site": "slashdot.org", "site_section": "http://idle.slashdot.org/index.atom", "site_categories": ["media", "hacking", "tech"], "section_title": "Slashdot", "title": "How WIRED lost $100,000 in Bitcoin", "title_full": "How WIRED lost $100,000 in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/bitcoin_64.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2202, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "765d39ddedcde76f99696ce1825c47cadb5ece73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR4nwj9H35.Gq3Ns1Z9.r_Opy6t25OlVJ78zVKENTLEvZipqghuGiwjPc74_qhQB_M48bZeiSssNwRTjmvabJRBUbjB383HfqM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "msmash", "published": "2018-05-29T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How WIRED lost $100,000 in Bitcoin", "text": " @07:00AM from the tough-luck dept.

Mattarella believed that confirming him would endanger the savings of Italians because Savona is not a fan of the Eurozone. The coalition‚Äôs plans for a universal income for all citizens while the country is ‚Ç¨1.3 trillion in debt may have also endangered the savings of Italians had the government been confirmed, but that‚Äôs another matter. The heads of the coalition parties are quite angry about this and are calling for Mattarella‚Äôs impeachment for refusing the will of the people, as they say in democratic parlance. The 5 Star Movement and the Northern League are also calling for new elections as soon as August, on the logic that maybe this time something different will happen. Meanwhile, Mattarella has appointed former IMF senior official Carlo Cottarelli as caretaker Prime Minister while Italian interest rates explode higher in uncertainy. Rates on 2Y government bonds have skyrocketed 109 basis points in three weeks, from a yield of -0.2% to a current yield of 0.89%. That means the Italian government, which previously was paid 0.2% interest to do nothing but borrow money for two years, will now pay 0.89% in order to do the same. In other words, debt is headed up, as always. Just faster now. What to do: Get out of Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese stocks and bonds. Contagion may spread quickly from here to the weaker Eurozone countries. ( NYSEARCA:EWI ) ( NYSEARCA:PGAL ) ( NYSEARCA:EWP ) Futures Down With Oil, Dollar Up, Gold Steady US Futures don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs happening in Italy either. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is set to open down 9 points as of now, or 0.33%. Dow Futures (^DJI) are also down the same amount, together with oil ( NYSEARCA:USO ) whose fall is continuing today on the back of news out of Saudi Arabia that the OPEC leader may increase production and that Russia is happy with oil at $60. With the dollar ( NYSEARCA:UUP ) up on Italian news battering the euro, gold ( NYSEARCA:GLD ) is also down below $1,300 on the back of dollar strength. What to do: A correction was overdue in the oil markets since the price advance has been exceptionally strong on Brent crude‚Äôs trip to $80. Saudi Arabia will has a vested interest in a high oil price, Iran is still being sanctioned, and Venezuelan oil production is not coming back online any time soon. The dollar may continue to show strength as the euro deteriorates into another round of debt crises. Cryptos Keep Falling Farther with Bitcoin Testing $7,000 In what appears to be a stepladder formation, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) keeps trading farther down by the day in an orderly decline now testing $7,000. Cryptocurrencies have been down every day for the past 8 days straight and are nearing support post December top. While it looks as of now that support will likely be reached, the question is what happens at that level. If it breaks and stop loss order are triggered, then the bottom could be a lot farther down. The Justice Department‚Äôs announcement looking into bitcoin spoofing (fake orders to move price) and wash-trading (trading with oneself to give the impression of price movements in a certain direction) hasn‚Äôt helped the situation. What to do: Catching a falling knife here could be dangerous. Best to let others handle this one. Has Subprime Auto Lending Finally Caught Up to the Automobile Industry? Nissan ( OTCMKTS:NSANY ) has announced a 20% cut in vehicle production for the North American market. The fact that auto loan delinquency rates are higher now than during the financial crisis, and this during boom times, certainly speaks caution and may be why Nissan is cutting back now. US sales have dived 6.5% so far in 2018, and if the auto loan market has more deteriorating to do, those figures could continue falling not just for Nissan, but for other domestic US car manufacturers as well. What to do: Monitor Ford ( NYSE:F ) and General Motors ( NYSE:GM ) to see if they will also be paring back production to sustain profitability. Fed‚Äôs Bullard Thinks We Hit That Magic Neutral Interest Rate Nobody Can Ever Find According to many people at the Federal Reserve, there is something called a neutral rate of interest that does not encourage nor discourage economic activity. Yet, is there really a neutral price for anything? Prices change all the time in response to market conditions without a central committee trying to find any right price for any specific time. Yet, the Fed‚Äôs James Bullard believes we may be at that point with interest rates, and therefore cautions against raising rates any further unless economic data and inflation come in stronger than expected. In other words, as always, the Fed is data-dependent.

Nelson ¬ª Bitcoins are digital currency ‚Äì and yes, lawyers are beginning to accept them from clients. They are also known as virtual currency or cryptocurrency since cryptography is used to control the creation and transfer of bitcoins. They use peer-to-peer technology with no central authority or banks. The issuance of bitcoins and the managing of transactions are carried out collectively by the network\nCryptocurrencies are created by a process called mining ‚Äì by becoming a miner of cryptocurrencies, you make money (not much unless you are a major league miner). We won‚Äôt go into all of the technology that is used to create and verify the transactions since it will probably make your head hurt. Mining is accomplished by executing complicated mathematic operations which takes a lot of processing power. Hence the new phenomenon of cryptojacking in which miners hijack the computing resources of unknowing victims so they can mine cryptocurrencies. And yes, your network could be victimized and there is little chance you would know unless so much power is used that your network slows down!\nToday there are a lot of different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is still one of the most well-known and popular. However, other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Litecoin, Ripple, Dash, etc., are gaining in popularity. They promise to scale better than Bitcoin and provide stronger anonymous protections. As of April 26, 2018, the amazing number of different cryptocurrencies is 1,759 according to investing.com‚Äôs current list located at https://www.investing.com/crypto/currencies. With all the various ‚Äúflavors‚Äù of digital currencies, we‚Äôre sure you‚Äôll find one to your liking.\nAll cryptocurrency transactions are recorded in a computer file called a blockchain, which is synonymous to a ledger that deals with conventional money. Users send and receive bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies from their mobile device, computer or web application by using wallet software. You can even use cloud services to host and manage your wallet(s). Frankly, we prefer to have direct control and keep our wallet(s) stored on local devices. Don‚Äôt forget to backup your wallet(s).\nWe won‚Äôt get into all the technical and legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies. Suffice it to say that these virtual currencies are here to stay and have value, although extremely volatile. In the U.S., cryptocurrencies are regarded as property rather than cash, with all the consequent tax implications.\nEthical issues\nLet‚Äôs deal with some of the ethical issues concerning the acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\nNebraska is the only state we are aware of that has issued an ethical opinion specifically for Bitcoin usage. Nebraska‚Äôs opinion states that lawyers may accept payments in digital currencies, but must immediately convert them into U.S. dollars. Any refund of monies is also made in U.S. dollars and not in digital currency.\nIt is well known that an attorney can‚Äôt access client funds until they are earned, hence the existence of trust accounts. Also, an attorney can accept property as payment, but there must be a valuation for the property. This is where accepting digital currencies could get a little muddy. The Virginia Rules require that a fee for legal services must be ‚Äúreasonable.‚Äù If attorneys receive digital currency, they should immediately convert and exchange it to actual currency AND put it in their escrow account. This effectively (and actually) puts a value on the cryptocurrency, which is exactly the process described in the Nebraska opinion. As part of the reconciliation and billing process, the lawyer would just note wording stating the number of bitcoins or other cryptocurrency and the market value at conversion. What the Nebraska opinion did not address is the handling of transaction fees, which can be rather substantial. The majority of lawyers will use an exchange to convert the cryptocurrency into cash. Who pays the fee for this conversion? And what if the client insists that the lawyer hold an advanced fee payment in bitcoin, instead of converting it to US currency? If bitcoin increases in value who gets the windfall‚Äîthe lawyer or the client? Who bears the risk if bitcoin drops in value?\nCriminal defense lawyers, of course, can face potential ethical and even criminal issues if clients pay them with assets they are determined to have acquired through illegal conduct. And yet, almost invariably, when we hear about lawyers accepting bitcoins as payment, the lawyers involved are criminal defense attorneys. For all the talk of ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù and the frequent inability to prove the connection between illegal conduct and bitcoins, it is clear that federal authorities believe the bitcoins are used to keep criminal activities financially untraceable. On the other hand, many legitimate businesses in the United States and Europe accept Bitcoin, including Dish Network, Overstock.com and Expedia.\nHolding Cryptocurrencies\nWhat if the lawyer wants to keep the cryptocurrency for their own use? Can they just keep the cryptocurrency in their own electronic wallet and deposit cash in the trust account on behalf of their client? The answer to this question depends on whether the bar considers bitcoin ‚Äúfunds‚Äù or ‚Äúproperty‚Äù which a client entrusts to the lawyer. See Rule 1.15. Client ‚Äúfunds‚Äù belong in a trust account but client ‚Äúproperty‚Äù must be safe kept by the lawyer. Since a lawyer cannot deposit bitcoin in a trust account, describing it as ‚Äúfunds‚Äù is a problem.\nWhen a client gives a lawyer bitcoin, it is ‚Äúproperty‚Äù not actual currency, but Rule 1.15 requires a lawyer to safeguard client property. This means making sure your digital ‚Äúwallet‚Äù is secure and backed up. If the lawyer wants to keep the bitcoin and give the client the equivalent value in cash, those funds must go into the trust account if the bitcoin was payment of an advanced fee. This would require the client‚Äôs consent and would be subject to the business transaction rule under Rule 1.8(a), requiring that the terms of the transaction be fair and reasonable, confirmed in writing and that the client be advised to seek independent counsel before entering into the agreement.\nOne legal ethicist, the late Professor Ronald Rotunda, disagreed with the Nebraska Bar‚Äôs Ethics Opinion 17-03 that says the lawyer must convert the cryptocurrency immediately into US currency. See Ronald D. Rotunda, ‚ÄúBitcoin and the Legal Ethics of Lawyers, Justicia Verdict Blog (November 6, 2017) at https://verdict.justia.com/2017/11/06/bitcoin-legal-ethics-lawyers. Professor Rotunda correctly explains how bar opinions have allowed that, subject to certain requirements, lawyers may accept from their clients stock and tangible property in lieu of cash for payment of legal fees even if the stock or property might fluctuate in value after the lawyer has accepted it. In Rotunda‚Äôs view, bitcoin is like gold in the sense that it is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it. The Nebraska opinion requires that lawyers ‚Äúmitigate the risk of volatility and possible unconscionable overpayment for services‚Äù by not retaining the digital currency and by converting it ‚Äúinto U.S. dollars immediately upon receipt.‚Äù To Rotunda, it is a business decision not an ethics decision if the client wants to shift the risk of volatility to the lawyer. If a client and lawyer agree to pay the lawyer with stock in lieu of currency and the original value is reasonable at the time the parties contracted, the fact that the stock goes up or down in value does not make the acceptance of the stock unethical. The bar opinions ‚Äúlook back‚Äù to the time that payment was accepted to determine whether the payment was ‚Äúreasonable,‚Äù and the lawyer may suffer a loss or a windfall, as the case may be. These bar opinions do not require that the lawyer sell the stock immediately to convert it to cash. In some initial public offerings, there may be ‚Äúblackout periods‚Äù in which the lawyer is prohibited from selling the stock. That bitcoin might drastically drop in value resulting in the lawyer being underpaid is not an ethics issue either, according to Rotunda. Lawyers are educated adults and can make the call to sell or keep the bitcoin and accept that risk.\nRotunda may have a point if the client pays the lawyer in bitcoin for past legal services. In that case, the lawyer has earned the fee and bitcoin becomes the property of the lawyer. The lawyer can accept risk with respect to his or her own property. That bitcoin cannot be deposited into a bank account is not ethics issue if the bitcoin is payment toward an earned fee. Even if the client paid the fee in cash, a lawyer cannot deposit an earned fee in a trust account because that would be commingling. The ethics rules do not require the lawyer to deposit an earned fee in an operating account either. The lawyer could deposit the cash directly into a personal checking account.\nIf the client gives the lawyer bitcoin as an ‚Äúadvance fee,‚Äù however, there are some problems. Rule 1.15 requires that a lawyer safe keep property that the client has entrusted to the lawyer. An ‚Äúadvanced fee‚Äù is property of the client until the lawyer has earned it. LEO 1606. If bitcoin plummets dramatically in value, and the client discharges the lawyer before the work is completed, the lawyer will not have kept safe sufficient funds or property to make a refund of the unearned fee as required by Rule 1.16(d); or, if the lawyer accepts bitcoin in settlement of a client‚Äôs claim, and the bitcoin loses value ,the lawyer is unable to pay the client or to discharge third-party liens as required by Rule 1.15(b). The lawyer may discharge these obligations with other funds or property but in doing so the lawyer would be making payments ‚Äúout of trust‚Äù and not in compliance with the rules.\nAnother problem arises out of the fact that the bar‚Äôs regulation of trust accounts and recordkeeping have not kept pace with technology and do not contemplate cryptocurrency. Lawyers are required to keep records of trust account transactions that are auditable and verified through an approved financial institution‚Äôs records and statements. No regulatory bar is currently equipped to audit Bitcoin transactions and storage.\nThe future\nUnless some serious security measures are built into Bitcoin, we wouldn‚Äôt recommend that you invest any serious wealth with the virtual currency.

who are already likely to be successful investors - are telling us that they already have exposure to crypto or that they will have by the end of this year.\"\nHe continues: \"The survey's findings demonstrate that high net worth individuals are increasingly unable to ignore the huge potential of cryptocurrencies.\n\"There's now surging public awareness of the value, need and demand for digital, global currencies in a digitalized, globalized world.\"\n\"I expect that a broader awareness and understanding of the crypto sector will grow exponentially in the next year as the tech that underpins it further improves, as major corporations and financial institutions embrace it, and as regulation is further developed.\"\nSpeaking earlier this year, Mr Green noted: \"All the digital coins on deVere Crypto have different characteristics, strengths and values.\n\"As such these additions help to achieve portfolio diversification within this specific asset class and their individual traits make them useful in different ways for investors.\"\nThe deVere CEO concludes: \"I believe that there is no longer any doubt that cryptocurrencies in some form are the future of money.\n\"And, seemingly, this is a view increasingly shared by wealthy investors the world over.\"\ne: george@priorconsultancy.co.ukt: +44 207 1220 925Twitter: @PriorConsults\ndeVere Group is one of the world's largest independent advisors of specialist global financial solutions to international, local mass affluent, and high-net-worth clients.

And the fact that when they gain their customer's trust it will bounce back to them as more and more people will patronize their product especially their good customer service.

They give 4% interest to the users, but they might get 6% to 10% interest from some other investment.

Featured Image VIA\nUnfortunately a lot of people didn‚Äôt really end up making the money that they hoped they would with many people losing a whole bunch as well. That didn‚Äôt meant that they didn‚Äôt have the bug though, and many people have continued to trade Bitcoin all over the shop in an attempt to get their money back or make even more.\nWhilst this might be fun if you‚Äôve got the disposable income to mess around with it, thanks to the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency fluctuations, people are now calling traders ‚Äòaddicts‚Äô and are fearful that they might get the same rush from trading that gamblers get from betting on sporting events and roulette etc and hoping that their numbers come in. As such, Castle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire on the Scottish borderlands is now offering a residential treatment problem for cryptocurrency addicts that teaches them how to live without the decimal points, percentages and up and down arrows.\nChris Burn, who is a gambling therapist at the hospital said the following about the possible problems of dealing with cryptocurrency:\nThe high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler.\nIt provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It‚Äôs a classic bubble situation. Image VIA\nI suppose he is right about that but I‚Äôm not sure if people are actually addicted to it. It seems like enough people are convinced of the problems associated with it to start this program though so maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Tony Marini is a former gambling and drug addict who is leading some of the courses and he said the following about them:\nHaving been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem.\nI see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don‚Äôt like the world they‚Äôre in.\nThe first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they‚Äôre not alone.\nI mean it really does sound like they‚Äôre taking this very seriously but I‚Äôm not even sure how you could be addicted to it because literally all you do is sit at a screen and press buttons and then watch some numbers go up and down and it could take days or even months for anything significant to even happen with it. At least when you‚Äôre actively gambling at the casino there‚Äôs a buzz right there and then from winning or losing, or if you‚Äôre doing drugs or drinking you‚Äôre getting a real buzz off those things altering your state of mind right there and then too. I can‚Äôt say I get the same feeling from messing around with cryptocurrencies but maybe I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones out there. Hope anyone suffering from cryptocurrency addiction reads this and checks into the Castle Craig Hotel to sort it out. Good luck.\nFor more cryptocurrency, check out Steven Seagal representing a new cryptocurrency..

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/Illustration\nLONDON (Reuters) Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain‚Äôs capital is willing to receive your donation ‚Äì in bitcoin\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n‚ÄúFor a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,‚Äù said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\nEmbed from Getty Images\n‚ÄúFor the donor, it‚Äôs just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque‚Äôs perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,‚Äù Musial said.\nEgypt‚Äôs Grand Mufti, the nation‚Äôs top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law , Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque‚Äôs decision.\n‚ÄúBitcoin is like any other currency. It‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ accepted by a group of people ‚Ä¶. We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ‚Ä¶ we are a charity ,‚Äù Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than ¬£10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month , a time when Muslim charities are most active.\n(Reporting by Parul Gupta; Writing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg; Editing by Alison Williams) TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/477724090"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lukasz musial", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la maison du bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shacklewell lane mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:06:42.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54729ec4c18b8d631b3ec60678c134e41f0c2789", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Ro7HPjld_tYf.2qfgA79ioJSqHJuhEkszp_fsnsCnQq2b755meZWJRt.pllQy61QDTZ9zfUX0aeo71soTBpD6s0k_vUQoqCe6mc6p07aODI9bK08gSLQ8p5YuSz_aU500V8112jMqz3..O8XiK6Kh", "site_full": "www.itwebafrica.com", "site": "itwebafrica.com", "site_section": "http://www.itwebafrica.com/component/fpss/module/119?format=feed&type=rss", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "Frontpage Slideshow (by JoomlaWorks) - ITWeb Africa", "title": "E-commerce start-up Dusupay believes bitcoin will help it scale", "title_full": "E-commerce start-up Dusupay believes bitcoin will help it scale", "published": "2018-05-29T13:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.itwebafrica.com/images/stories/Ntende_KennethDusupay.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54729ec4c18b8d631b3ec60678c134e41f0c2789", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Ro7HPjld_tYf.2qfgA79ioJSqHJuhEkszp_fsnsCnQq2b755meZWJRt.pllQy61QDTZ9zfUX0aeo71soTBpD6s0k_vUQoqCe6mc6p07aODI9bK08gSLQ8p5YuSz_aU500V8112jMqz3..O8XiK6Kh", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-29T13:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "E-commerce start-up Dusupay believes bitcoin will help it scale", "text": "Dusupay\nMost of the company's volumes are derived from Rwanda and Nigeria, although it also has a significant presence in other markets such as Uganda.\n\"The key to e-commerce in Africa in my point of view is built on ability to scale.

Abstract This article provides an examination of regulation theory as applied to Bitcoin. Through an examination of the parallels with Ogus‚Äô model for self-regulation, it is demonstrated that several unique features inherent to cryptocurrencies offer the benefits of regulatory oversight without the drawbacks. The article also provides a broader socio-regulatory analysis of Bitcoin in an attempt to better understand the benefits of competitive self-regulation for platform users. Finally, this article examines whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated by way of traditional State-based models and, if so, which of these approaches (if any) ought to be used to regulate the platform.

The abundance of renewable and cheap electricity has Bitcoin miners flocking to Iceland to set up shop. With the recent robbery of 600 computers specially fitted for Bitcoin mining, the national debate has focused its eye on Bitcoin mining. Al√æingi, the Icelandic Parliament, has discussed changing the framework around Bitcoin mining. With Bitcoin‚Äôs ever-rising value it appears that the trickle of Bitcoin mining will soon become a flood. This raises the question - Is Bitcoin mining beneficial for the Icelandic nation?\nIdeal mining site\nIceland is the perfect location for Bitcoin mining due to the natural surroundings. There is cheap and renewable energy in abundance. Hydroelectric and geothermal sources provide Iceland with a fraction less than 100% of the nation‚Äôs electricity. The energy-intensive process of Bitcoin mining also produces excessive heat. The cool air of the North Atlantic provides a natural cooling effect, negating the need for fitting mining centres with expensive air conditioning. These factors have Bitcoin miners raring to head for Iceland to engage in this modern-day gold digging.\nHigh electric use, high payout\nBitcoin mining is the process of validating the Bitcoin transactions that take place all over the globe. Specially fitted computers, with advanced processors, solve complex equations which they received they receive a small amount of Bitcoins for. The excessive energy output of the equations is due to the high amount of Bitcoins out there. The Bitcoin mining network uses more electricity than the whole of Ireland in one year. Bitcoins have a finite reserve, 21 million in total, with 16.7 million of them already in circulation, which leaves 4.3. million left to be mined. The more Bitcoin transactions out there, the more computing power needed to validate them. The payout for validating a transaction at this point in time is 12.5 Bitcoins per validation. Iceland is an ideal mining site as electricity and infrastructure cost per Bitcoin mined is far lower than most countries.\nTrouble in mining paradise\nIceland‚Äôs status as the go-to country for Bitcoin mining is not viewed favourably by all. Digital activist Sm√°ri McCarthy, an MP for the Icelandic Pirate Party has spoken of the need for a framework for Bitcoin mining. ‚ÄúWe are spending tens or maybe hundreds of megawatts on producing something that has no tangible existence and no real use for humans outside the realm of financial speculation\". Cryptocurrency mining requires almost no employees as well as being extremely hard to tax. Its detractors also claim that it provides very little in the form of capital investments. Some have even gone as far as stating that Bitcoin miners take advantage of Iceland.\nData storage of the future\nIt is not all doom and gloom, however, as there is great potential in the further growth of data centres. The technology giants Google and Facebook have both cast their eye towards Iceland as a potential site for their large-scale data storage centres. The rest of the Nordic countries are Iceland‚Äôs closest competitors for the future of large-scale data storage. ‚ÄúThe respective governments have placed an emphasis on improving the infrastructure, even connecting data cables north of the Arctic circle‚Äù, J√≥hann √û√≥r J√≥nsson, head of Data Centers Iceland stated. ‚ÄúThey have an incentive system in place for this type of industry to attract data centres to areas where there is an abundance of energy‚Äù.\nAluminium and Bitcoin ‚Äì One and the same?\nSome have drawn comparisons between the aluminium industry and Bitcoin mining, as both are energy-intensive industries which run 24/7. Iceland has lured large-scale aluminium manufactures with tax breaks since the turn of the century. In 2011, aluminium smelters in the country consumed 73.8% of the total electricity usage in Iceland. Some feel that the government is repeating the mistakes of the past ‚Äì as foreign companies and ventures take advantage of Icelandic pastures, while the country has little to show for it. Icelanders paid ‚Ç¨ 0.13 per kilowatt while it is estimated that Bitcoin data centres pay ‚Ç¨ 0.04 per kilowatt. While Bitcoin miners pay a lower price, the data centres are running 24/7, 365 days a year, paying for every minute. Their stay here is therefore not without benefit. Bitcoin also compares favourably to the aluminium industry as it leaves less of an environmental footprint.\nA chance to make a mark\nIt is unclear what the future holds for Bitcoin mining in the country. There are many eager to join the party but even more wish for the government to regulate the festivities. Cryptocurrencies are a borderline unregulated field, so Icelandic authorities have an opportunity to create a framework for the future which can benefit both miners and Iceland alike.\nEnergy statistics\nSources of electricity production in 2014:\nHydropower 71.04%\nWind plants 0.04%\nFossil fuels 0.01%\nNo other country produces more energy per capita than Iceland, with an average of 55,000 kilowatts per person in a year.
