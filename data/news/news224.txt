One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.\nWell, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it’s not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking.\nA few of the crypto aficionados tell their followers that gold can’t be a monetary asset because there are millions of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away in the Grand Canyon. While this may sound like quite an interesting conspiracy, there is no sound evidence to back it up. To believe in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. However, with logic being in short supply currently, I am not surprised that many believe in these fairy tales.\nOne of these ex-precious metals, now a highly qualified cryptoanalyst, suggested in a recent video that the “Gold is owned by the Bankers” so why would you want to own gold? Unfortunately, this is a false statement. While the Central banks own a lot of gold, it’s a lot less than what the private investors and jewelry owners hold. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for the largest stocks of above ground gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), followed by 40,000 mt of private investment, 32,600 mt of Central bank holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial usage and other: Free Reports: Get our Weekly Commitment of Traders Report: - See where the biggest traders (Hedge Funds and Commercial Hedgers) are positioned in the futures markets on a weekly basis. Get Our Free Metatrader 4 Indicators - Put Our Free MetaTrader 4 Custom Indicators on your charts when you join our Weekly Newsletter\nOf the total 190,000 mt of the world above ground gold stocks, jewelry consists of 48%, private investment 21%, Central bank 17%, and Industrial and other at 14% (Source: World Gold Council – Total above-ground stocks 2017) So, if we realize that nearly half of all above-ground gold stocks are in the form of jewelry, and then another 21% is owned by private investors, Central banks DO NOT own most of the gold. Even if we compare private investment to Official holdings, private investors own more gold than Central banks.\nNow, to the incorrect theory that there are millions of tons of gold in the world, can someone please tell me where all this additional gold came from?? If we understand that the increase in gold mine production paralleled the rise in silver and copper production, how could there be 10-20 times more gold than copper and silver???\nFirst, most of the gold ever mined was produced after 1900:\nAccording to the best data, we can get our hands on, 91% of all gold mined since 1493 was produced after 1900. Limited records of gold produced before 1493 suggest that wasn’t more than 10,000-15,000 mt.\nSecondly, if we look at historical world silver production, we see the same pattern:\nOf the total 48.5 billion oz of silver mined in the world between 1493 and 2016, 81% of it was produced after 1900. Also, the amount of silver mined annually compared to gold has been about 10 to 1. Assuming that total historical silver production was approximately 55 billion oz compared to 5.7 billion oz of gold, it turns out to be nearly a 10/1 ratio.\nFor there to be just 1 million tons of gold in above-ground stocks in the world, that would equal 32 billion oz of gold. Considering a 10/1 ratio of silver to gold production, then we should have mined 300+ billion oz of silver, not the 55 billion oz stated by the world authorities.\nSo, if we understand the logic here, why on earth do people continue to believe in the LOUSY CONSPIRACY that there are millions of tons of gold in the world?? Why, because lousy conspiracies sell a hell of a lot more newsletters and subscriptions than those that put out the facts and fundamentals.\nRegardless, Central banks own less gold than above ground jewelry stocks or private investors. While Central banks are controlling the gold and silver prices by funneling 99%+ of investors into stocks, bonds, real estate and cryptos, they cannot manipulate the price of precious metals too far below their cost of production.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand energy or the cost of production as a FLOOR for the gold and silver prices. Which means, the Central banks cannot push the price of gold and silver anywhere they please. What the Central banks CAN DO, is that they can BAMBOOZLE the public in putting their funds into the biggest Ponzi Schemes in history. By funneling the public’s money into stocks, bonds, and real estate, this caps the gold and silver price. This is the manipulation.\nNow, the notion that Bitcoin will replace gold as the King Monetary Asset is patently false because Bitcoin fails several important tests. First, Bitcoin trading volatility is too high to be used as a currency. I have heard from several people that using Bitcoin as a payment method is very frustrating because the price can fluctuate $1,000 in a very short time, thus making it a very stressful transaction for both buyer and seller.\nIf we compare the volatility of Bitcoin versus gold and fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the clear loser:\nBitcoin’s 30-day volatility of 3.73% is nearly 9 times more gold and 10 times more than the USD/EUR (US Dollar-Euro). While Bitcoin’s volatility could continue to decline in the future, it still needs a very high-tech electronic system to allow trade and payment.\nSecondly, Bitcoin and cryptos will not function well as the EROI of energy continues to fall, destroying the ability to scale up or maintain high technology. I recently watched a documentary about the Dark Ages on the history channel. After the fall of the ancient western Roman Empire (5th century), people who lived around the once great city in the 6th and 7th century knew that life was better in the past because they saw all these massive buildings and structures, but were now living mostly a peasant’s life.\nIn just 3-4 generations, people no longer remembered what it was like to live in Rome during its heyday. The great culture, technology, food, and trade of the ancient Roman Empire were gone for good. Most Americans today have no idea what life is like after a collapse of society.\nNot only will Bitcoin and the cryptos not survive the coming Falling EROI energy collapse, either will most of the advanced technology. Sure, some technology will be around, but it will claim the same fate as the ancient Roman Empire. For this reason, gold will always remain the KING MONETARY METAL and asset.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand the Falling EROI of energy as they mislead their followers into investing in just another fly-by-night bubble.

The cryptocurrency fell to $7, 925 on Bitfinex earlier today – the lowest level since Apr 18 and has retraced 50% of the gathering of the Apr 1 low of $6, 425 to May 5 large of $9, 990. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8, 120, representing a 2 percent fall in the last 24 hours. The recovery from the low of $7, 925 might be connected with the oversold conditions shown by the comparative strength indicator in the hourly graph.\nNevertheless, the profits will probably be short lived as the chances are stacked against the bulls, according to technological graphs. Daily graph. BTC closed well beneath the 50 day moving average yesterday, signaling a continuation of the sell off from the latest high of $9, 990. Further, BTC has also found approval below $8, 207, a level that acted as strong support from May 12. The 5 day moving average and the 10 day MA carries on to tilt down in favor of the bears. The relative strength indicator is also biased bearish. And last, but not the least, BTC’s turn lower from $8, 884 and fall below $8, 100 yesterday have generated a lesser highs and lows pattern .\nThus, it’s fairly apparent that the fall to 30 days lows in the last twenty four hours has the put bears on the driver’s seat. View. BTC looks set to test the immediate support lined up at $7, 787. A daily close below that level will be the final confirmation of bearish trend reversal and will probably be followed by a sell off $7, 000. Only a daily close above the 10 day MA would abort the bearish perspective and may yield sideways to positive action.

Price Highs = Employment Highs\nAccording to new research from “augmented writing” startup Textio, job offers relating to Blockchain and cryptocurrency rise and fall entirely depending on how valuable Bitcoin is in USD terms.\nResearchers analyzed job advertisements containing various terms, including Bitcoin, altcoin, cryptocurrency, crypto, cryptographic hash, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and decentralized currency.\nBetween May 2017 and February 2018, offers peaked in the third week of December, at a time when BTC/USD reached its all-time highs of around $20,000.\nTextio concludes the findings are proof of “how fast and fickle the job market is when it comes to hot technologies.”\n“…Textio found that Crypto jobs rise and fall with bitcoin currency price.

Jack Ma Yun, Alibaba community’s founder and executive chairman, spoke in a discussion board on Wednesday and spoke particularly of blockchain know-how, however expressed his doubts about Bitcoin (BTC).\n“There isn’t any bubble for blockchain, but there’s a bitcoin bubble,” Ma talked about in a panel on the 2d World Intelligence Congress forum.\nMa mentioned he has been studying blockchain for years and incredibly believes in its talents to clear up protection, and data privateness. The founder thinks that blockchain will also be used by every person together with people, establishments, and even governments. Ma expressed security a precise precedence for his company, as Alibaba conducts ‘trillions of transactions’ a quarter.\nMa mentioned:\n“Social networks may also now not need blockchain, but we are doing cyber web finance through which we manner trillions of buying and selling quantity. We must turn to blockchain , in any other case , it might be fatal.”\nThe enterprise reported $ 39.9 billion in each year income in its newest fiscal q4 profits liberate. Alibaba at present has 43 posted blockchain patent functions, which is followed via bank of the us which has 33.\nStanding floor\nMa talked about he first saw blockchain as a privateness and protection answer, but certainly not notion to show it into whatever thing like Bitcoin (BTC) to make cash. naturally, the founder doesn’t understand the need to break free from vital banks and hasn’t study the authentic whitepaper.\nMa is one in every of Asia’s richest guys, and his latest perspective towards Bitcoin (BTC) tremendously resonates with the chinese language govt’s contemporary movements. youngsters, in an interview again in December 2017, the founder informed CNBC Shanghai:\n“I don’t find out about Bitcoin in any respect. I’m specifically puzzled. in spite of the fact that it can basically work, the rules of global trade and the economic system may be fully modified… we’ve a crew that stories blockchain, but Bitcoin isn’t whatever thing that I want to pursue. We don’t care about Bitcoin.”\nIt seems that Ma has at all times felt this fashion in regards to the digital token, and the e-commerce huge gained’t ever see Bitcoin (BTC) on its platform. neatly, under no circumstances say not ever – we’ll see.\n>> Tom Lee Bitcoin Prediction Fail\nFeatured image: news", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack ma yun", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T21:10:21.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fff086a6986f590a4789cf9df889f19b997184d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREDx4uhUJXpyAVJwScup3RIlZmB5JwwYqpce3zXzONsuQTOQdCqfyE_1D_7TP0sGiva7B3DHxRXaIPxnp1AimN", "site_full": "www.valuewalk.com", "site": "valuewalk.com", "site_section": "https://www.valuewalk.com", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "ValueWalk", "title": "How You Could Get Crushed By Bitcoin", "title_full": "How You Could Get Crushed By Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-18T17:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17542, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fff086a6986f590a4789cf9df889f19b997184d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREDx4uhUJXpyAVJwScup3RIlZmB5JwwYqpce3zXzONsuQTOQdCqfyE_1D_7TP0sGiva7B3DHxRXaIPxnp1AimN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Guest Post", "published": "2018-05-18T17:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "How You Could Get Crushed By Bitcoin", "text": "Anyone who invested in cryptocurrencies three years must have made a fortune running into millions of dollars by the end last year. Bitcoin, in particular, caused a frenzy, especially when it became evident that businesses and institutions were already accepting it as a mode of payment.\n[REITs]\nQ1 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc , Also read Lear Capital\nstevepb / Pixabay However, claims of governments working in cahoots with banks in a bid to scuttle the rising popularity of virtual currency because they think it is a threat to not just hard currency but also world economy raised more questions than answers. And so for the crypto investor, the question is, whether the sudden interests from governments and reluctance by money regulatory authorities to authorize Blockchain investment into the mainstream economy is something to worry investors.\nAny investment is worth the risk\nAnother question you need to ask is, what are the risks involved? While an experienced crypto miner may have learned the ropes of, what about crypto newbies who are still learning the basics such as what is Bitcoin mining ? Is there any chance that he or he could get crushed before reaping anything out of say, a hundred dollars worth of investment on the lower end?\nWell, the truth is that every investment could either end up in losses or profits, in which case, you must be prepared to accept any outcome. People who trade Bitcoin in Binary Options could perhaps be labeled as some of the biggest risk takers here, but that doesn’t mean that a crypto miner is scared of getting crushed when things go south.\nIt’s not money in Bank\nThere is a number of online trading and money transfer platforms that are already accepting payment in Bitcoin. And even though their actions may have come as a new lease of life to crypto traders, the last one or so year has remained unpredictable for those presumed things will get better by the day. In particular, the months of February and March presented miners with a real test as Bitcoin value plummeted leaving investors shocked to the bone marrow.\nOver $100 billion U.S dollars in crypto value was wiped off the stock markets and since then, everyone who wants to start mining Bitcoin takes a safe stance even as they watch their investments grow, albeit, with fear of the unknown.\nHow you could get whipped\nThe point here is not to discourage anyone from putting their money in crypto trade but a warning shot that everything is not rosy. It is an open secret that investors know. Here are a few red flags in Blockchain that everyone should keep tabs on.\nHighly Volatile\nThere is enough proof already that Bitcoin is very volatile. By December last year, its value was pegged at $20k. However recent price fluctuations are a pointer to a future that is largely unforeseeable regarding crypto options and futures in the stock exchange. At one point, the value of Bitcoin plummeted to $7614 and that alone makes investors fret at the thought of having their long-term goals tied to Blockchain.\nThe threat of hacking\nStorage of Bitcoin takes place in computer hard drives and in online safes connected to servers of a trading platform. It means miners must invest in impenetrable security layers if they want to wake up to another day of making money in Blockchain. From having a strong computer password to acquiring protection from trusted third security software vendors, the threat of losing everything to hackers is something you should never rule out.\nICOs has no value\nICOs refer to initial coin offer. Now, as opposed to Initial Public Offer that companies provide to investors in a bid to raise capital when they go public, ICOs involves the selling of token. According to North American Securities Administration Association ( NASAA ), ICOs has no significant value to an investor. It is those who sell the tokens that benefit and not the buyer because the former may be doing it to raise money for funding a Blockchain project.\nLack of mainstream regulation\nThe value of money market does not only thrive on buying and selling but also on regulation by The Federal Reserve. Further, lack of insurance by bodies like Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation puts Blockchain on the precipice should the value of Bitcoin plummet to irredeemable levels. Cyber insecurities and threats of hacking could very well make that fear come alive.\nThe Bottom Line In a nutshell, while those who invested in Bitcoin sometimes back in 2016 may have made profits by up to 800%, there is no safe landing pad when its value falls to all-tight low thus amounting to huge losses. It is imperative to know it is safe to invest in cryptocurrencies . The challenge is further compounded by lack of approval for listing in the stock market, something which continues to make ICOs valueless. Never throw caution to the wind when you opt to invest in Blockchain.\nAbout the Author\nBeverly Lerch is an investment manager from a small financial company also involved in financial consulting on several educational websites including MyHomeworkDone.com .

The creator’s name is unknown, however the alias Satoshi Nakamoto was given to this person.\nAdvantages of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin transactions are made directly from person to person trough the internet. There’s no need of a bank or clearinghouse to act as the middle man. Thanks to that, the transaction fees are way too much lower, they can be used in all the countries around the world. Bitcoin accounts cannot be frozen, prerequisites to open them don’t exist, same for limits. Every day more merchants are starting to accept them. You can buy anything you want with them.\nHow Bitcoin works.\nIt’s possible to exchange dollars, euros or other currencies to bitcoin. You can buy and sell as it were any other country currency. In order to keep your bitcoins, you have to store them in something called wallets. These wallet are located in your pc, mobile device or in third party websites. Sending bitcoins is very simple. It’s as simple as sending an email. You can purchase practically anything with bitcoins.\nWhy Bitcoins?\nBitcoin can be used anonymously to buy any kind of merchandise. International payments are extremely easy and very cheap. The reason of this, is that bitcoins are not really tied to any country. They’re not subject to any kind regulation. Small businesses love them, because there’re no credit card fees involved. There’re persons who buy bitcoins just for the purpose of investment, expecting them to raise their value.\nWays of Acquiring Bitcoins.\n1) Buy on an Exchange: people are allowed to buy or sell bitcoins from sites called bitcoin exchanges. They do this by using their country currencies or any other currency they have or like.\n2) Transfers: persons can just send bitcoins to each other by their mobile phones, computers or by online platforms. It’s the same as sending cash in a digital way.\n3) Mining: the network is secured by some persons called the miners. They’re rewarded regularly for all newly verified transactions. Theses transactions are fully verified and then they are recorded in what’s known as a public transparent ledger. These individuals compete to mine these bitcoins, by using computer hardware to solve difficult math problems. Miners invest a lot of money in hardware. Nowadays, there’s something called cloud mining. By using cloud mining, miners just invest money in third party websites, these sites provide all the required infrastructure, reducing hardware and energy consumption expenses.\nStoring and saving bitcoins.\nThese bitcoins are stored in what is called digital wallets. These wallets exist in the cloud or in people’s computers. A wallet is something similar to a virtual bank account. These wallets allow persons to send or receive bitcoins, pay for things or just save the bitcoins. Opposed to bank accounts, these bitcoin wallets are never insured by the FDIC.\nTypes of wallets.\n1) Wallet in cloud: the advantage of having a wallet in the cloud is that people don’t need to install any software in their computers and wait for long syncing processes. The disadvantage is that the cloud may be hacked and people may lose their bitcoins. Nevertheless, these sites are very secure.\n2) Wallet on computer: the advantage of having a wallet on the computer is that people keep their bitcoins secured from the rest of the internet. The disadvantage is that people may delete them by formatting the computer or because of viruses.\nBitcoin Anonymity.\nWhen doing a bitcoin transaction, there’s no need to provide the real name of the person. Each one of the bitcoin transactions are recorded is what is known as a public log. This log contains only wallet IDs and not people’s names. so basically each transaction is private. People can buy and sell things without being tracked.\nBitcoin innovation.\nBitcoin established a whole new way of innovation. The bitcoin software is all open source, this means anyone can review it. A nowadays fact is that bitcoin is transforming world’s finances similar to how web changed everything about publishing. The concept is brilliant. When everyone has access to the whole bitcoin global market, new ideas appear. Transaction fees reductions is a fact of bitcoin. Accepting bitcoins cost anything, also they’re very easy to setup. Charge backs don’t exist. The bitcoin community will generate additional businesses of all kinds.

Shows May 18, 2018 143\nJobseekers looking for their big break with Bitcoin could have faced disappointment as offers exploded and crashed in line with prices. Price Highs = Employment Highs\nAccording to new research from “augmented writing” startup Textio, job offers relating to Blockchain and cryptocurrency rise and fall entirely depending on how valuable Bitcoin is in USD terms.\nResearchers analyzed job advertisements containing various terms, including Bitcoin, altcoin, cryptocurrency, crypto, cryptographic hash, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and decentralized currency.\nBetween May 2017 and February 2018, offers peaked in the third week of December, at a time when BTC/USD reached its all-time highs of around $20,000.\nTextio concludes the findings are proof of “how fast and fickle the job market is when it comes to hot technologies.”\n“…Textio found that Crypto jobs rise and fall with bitcoin currency price. However, since the crash, interest in blockchain jobs has fallen harder and stayed down for longer than bitcoin itself,” it summarized.\nSo if you’re looking for cryptocurrency jobs, watch the price of Bitcoin and make your move. No One Wants To Earn The Dip\nBitcoinist found that not only job offers but jobseekers come and go as Bitcoin fluctuates.\nAccording to data from Google Trends for ‘bitcoin jobs,’ search requests similarly reached a head in December 2017, only to disappear in the coming months.\nThe Philippines contributed the majority of interest from internet users, followed by Australia, the UK, Pakistan and Canada.\nBitcoinist further reported on the scale of the boom in job offers at the time of the price highs, with November seeing a surge of almost 6000% in vacancies with “bitcoin” in the title.\n“In an industry as new as cryptocurrency, I would expect fluctuations in the pace of job opening growth and of growth in job applicant pool,” a recruitment consultant meanwhile said at the time, foreseeing the subsequent volatility in the market.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin jobs data?

Morgan , is sinking its toes in a little deeper.\nJ.P. Morgan created a new position dubbed Head of Crypto-Assets Strategy, naming Oliver Harris, previously head of the banking giant’s in-residence program for fintech startups, to the role. With his new title, Harris will seek out cryptocurrency projects that can be taken to market, Fortune has learned.\nFinancial News first reported the news.\nHarris will work under the umbrella of J.P. Morgan’s blockchain initiative, headed by Umar Farooq. The bank has been experimenting with the blockchain — an immutable ledger of, oftentimes, transactions — over the past two years in a bid to solve banking-related inefficiencies. One experiment resulted in the creation of Quorum , an Ethereum-based blockchain for payments aimed at businesses. Notably, J.P. Morgan partnered with the team behind cryptocurrency Zcash to increase the privacy on that blockchain . The bank is now said to be considering a spinoff of that project .\nHarris is also set to lead the execution of that project, working closely with Christine Moy, program lead for J.P. Morgan’s Blockchain Center of Excellence.\nThat’s not to say the banking giant is suddenly hopping into Bitcoin trading in the way Goldman Sachs has done — at least not yet.\nWhen asked about the future of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and the bank potentially trading the asset, J.P.

Bitcoin, the most popular of the bunch, dropped 3.7 percent this week to $8,117.43 even as Arthur Hayes — the crypto exchange executive whose firm rented the Lamborghinis — predicted a surge to $50,000 by year-end.\nThis week’s slump is far from extreme by crypto standards, but the market’s resistance to Blockchain Week’s ballyhoo highlights one of the arguments often used by virtual currency pessimists — that most people who are willing to buy the coins have already piled in.\nWhile bulls point to a vast pool of pent-up demand from professional money managers, it’s far from clear that regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere will evolve in ways that attract institutional investors. Many Wall Street pros have dismissed the market as a speculative bubble, while Warren Buffett has likened Bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”\nThis week’s losses may have been the result of unmet expectations surrounding Consensus 2018, said Sunny Lu, the chief executive officer of blockchain-based logistics company VeChain Tech and one of the conference speakers.\n“The quality of projects and speakers were not really as good as expected,” Lu said. “I guess people just got disappointed.”\nNow read: Coincheck plotting its comeback bitcoin Blockhain Week Consensus cryptocurrency", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snoop dogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T17:43:05.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f12c2922e13460f91e07d200403512728f9bcfb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_3gMkC7nSPIXZaK6bu0kipF2YZiB_H.5hapSbxI0OfWHaxYibZXri6LjdotCXUKRF5xQSMGB.hCruEUDU9xxTzAj9a9oNjyIZEPs5Jexr7NcGCseSiSxmQ1i6WVrGEtKTN2zggfCGu4PRcdTZ_4vQ7", "site_full": "www.asit.com.es", "site": "asit.com.es", "site_section": "http://www.asit.com.es/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News As It Comes!", "title": "Bitcoin price: Massive boost for ETHEREUM and bitcoin as China backs blockchain", "title_full": "Bitcoin price: Massive boost for ETHEREUM and bitcoin as China backs blockchain", "published": "2018-05-18T16:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.asit.com.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/961682_1-1-150x150.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f12c2922e13460f91e07d200403512728f9bcfb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_3gMkC7nSPIXZaK6bu0kipF2YZiB_H.5hapSbxI0OfWHaxYibZXri6LjdotCXUKRF5xQSMGB.hCruEUDU9xxTzAj9a9oNjyIZEPs5Jexr7NcGCseSiSxmQ1i6WVrGEtKTN2zggfCGu4PRcdTZ_4vQ7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-18T16:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price: Massive boost for ETHEREUM and bitcoin as China backs blockchain", "text": "Business | By admin Bitcoin price: Massive boost for ETHEREUM and bitcoin as China backs blockchain\nETHEREUM beat Bitcoin to top spot in the first ever list from the Chinese government ranking the top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space.

Dorsey declared that he has hopes that bitcoin will continue to establish itself as the primary method of payments.\nDorsey is also a personal investor in bitcoin who expects the digital currency to be applied in trading of simple things like coffee and he anticipated a 10-year timeline for bitcoin to have dominated the industry. Dorsey is a huge fan of bitcoin and that the internet deserves a native currency but also accepted that he is not sure whether it will prove to be successful in long run.\nAccording to him Square, an IT service management company, can become a vanguard cryptocurrency that is legally allowed as one of the means among global payments system. He stated that If cryptocurrency were globally used, it would make it easy for Square to enter new markets around the world. \"If we were able to use it as a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we're in,\" he said .\nSquare launched cryptocurrency trading via its cash app in January this year.\nDorsey said at the Blockchain Conference in New York on Wednesday: \"The internet is going to have a native currency so let's help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.\"\nSquare spent $33.9 million to purchase bitcoin to permit customers to trade it via its Cash mobile payment app and this generated a revenue of $200,000. It sold a total of $34.1 million in bitcoin within the first quarter. Dorsey explained whether cryptocurrency like bitcoin could be used as the future for all payments: \"We have led with that mindset. But there's still a lot of skepticism and a lot of debate and a lot of fights. But that's where the magic happens, where creativity happens.\"\nThis year, bitcoin has fallen by roughly 40 percent and was trading near $8,260 on this Wednesday. Competing cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash similarly experienced downward trends in the previous week.\nIn March, Dorsey said that he had expectations that bitcoin is to become the single global currency within 10 years to come.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/960899/Bitcoin-set-to-be-world-dominant-currency-Twitter-CEO-backs-BTC-in-crypto-battle"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T16:43:22.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93bee8318d231522dd09631617398a52591085d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.aX6RsjGyewRI8YfG3lu8U36FW9DTpE0TIZJy3PLDrOM1dR0v9tCimV4RXnJnMa9oQwOD.A2bxh1UihZRorjKM8kwHRafdHvI-", "site_full": "www.androidomg.com", "site": "androidomg.com", "site_section": "http://www.androidomg.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Android OMG", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Puts Massive Strain on Electric Power", "title_full": "Bitcoin Mining Puts Massive Strain on Electric Power", "published": "2018-05-18T16:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93bee8318d231522dd09631617398a52591085d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.aX6RsjGyewRI8YfG3lu8U36FW9DTpE0TIZJy3PLDrOM1dR0v9tCimV4RXnJnMa9oQwOD.A2bxh1UihZRorjKM8kwHRafdHvI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AndroidGuy (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T16:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Puts Massive Strain on Electric Power", "text": "\nThe vast supply of electricity required to mine bitcoin is as contested as this weekend’s royal wedding.

In 2017, more than $5,3 million worth of Bitcoin - the benchmark cryptocurrency - was traded on the country's biggest digital currency exchange Golix. And as the price of Bitcoin peaked at $33 000 on the exchange late last year, from just $1 000 in January, more people joined in what has become the modern day \"gold rush\". Altogether, Golix has traded $20 million Bitcoin's worth since it started operations in September 2015. But it is the exchange's latest plans to raise $35,8 million through a special token sale that has forced the hand of authorities at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to ban cryptocurrencies. So what exactly is Bitcoin, and what's behind the investors' mania, and the regulators' fears? What is Bitcoin? To illustrate our case, we use Bitcoin to represent the rest of the smaller cryptocurrencies, which number more than 1 500. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created in 2009 by shadowy Japanese developer Satoshi Nakamoto, and has become the most valuable and most popular digital asset. It is not your everyday currency, the kind that one can hold in the hand like bond notes or US dollars. It is stored virtually - on smartphones, computers and tablets etc - more or less like your Ecocash and Telecash, but without the central regulatory authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not issued by a central bank or government - although Venezuelan authorities have issued their own cryptocurrency - with only 3 600 coins created through a process called mining each day. About 16,5 million Bitcoins are in circulation today, and only 21 million can ever be issued, a situation that has led some into predicting a growth of unhindered proportions for the digital currency. The technology behind Bitcoin is a complex one. Put simply, the system rounds up transactions by investors into what are known as \"blocks\", to be solved by math - the blockchain. To do this, one needs very powerful computers to work out a solution whether the transaction was possible. This is what is called mining. Once the other \"miners\" confirm the solution, the transaction goes through, with \"miners\" earning Bitcoin. Where can I buy Bitcoin in Zimbabwe? There are two main digital currency trading platforms in Zimbabwe, Harare-based Golix, and Styx24 in Gweru. With more than 50 000 investors actively trading on its exchange, Golix is the bigger of the two. The currency can also be bought on Local Bitcoins.com, a much bigger platform that connects thousands of people from all over the world. The price of Bitcoin, like other currencies, is typically decided by those willing to buy or sell it. To receive a Bitcoin, the buyer must have a Bitcoin address - a long list of alphanumeric characters. The system is built to protect privacy, so investors often get off without their identities being revealed. But once the address is lost, the Bitcoins are lost with it. I have got Bitcoin, so what? While there is no shop known to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment here, a small number of Zimbabweans have become active trading in cryptocurrencies. Some are using Bitcoin to pay for goods and services like university fees and health bills abroad easily, without having to queue up at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for it. And those overseas to send money back home. Last year, Golix processed about $1,8 million of such payments. Largely though, cryptos are now being looked at as an investment, buoyed by the 1 400 percent growth in the price of Bitcoin last year. Those with the coin are now unwilling to sale, hoping it will gain more value in future. It is not clear what will happen when the 21 million maximum Bitcoins are fully issued. On account of this, a number of optimistic experts have predicted the price to shoot to between $100,000 and $250 000 per coin in the next few years. Here, Golix has gone a step further. It launched a Bitcoin ATM in Harare last month, allowing investors to withdraw hard US dollars from the sale of their cryptocurrencies, a novelty in an economy where traditional ATM no longer dispense cash. But the biggest challenge remains a lack of liquidity and high demand, which have forced Bitcoin to trade a premium of about 40 to 60 percent to the global average price. For example, the international price of one Bitcoin was quoted at around $8 253 early morning on May 16. On Golix it was about $13 000. What are regulators saying? Regulation of digital money still remains as obscure as the virtual currencies debate itself. Bitcoin represents an era in financial technology that at best remains speculative, seldom understood by both citizens and by Government, though, in its current state, open to criminal abuse. There is no law that specifically supports or criminalises trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Zimbabwe, registered or not. The currency is neither defined as a security, commodity nor currency. Though somewhere the Securities and Exchange Act could help form the basis for future digital currencies regulation, should Securities Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe, which is mandated to regulate all securities, decides to do so. Looking at the stricter definition of a security, how it relates as any financial asset that can be bought, held or sold like shares, Bitcoin is in that sense a tradable security. And, therefore, subject to supervision by the SecZim, just like common stocks on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. When the regulation eventually comes, it may not necessarily directly apply to investors, rather to the cryptocurrency exchanges that support the trading of digital currencies. But the Reserve Bank has recently come down hard on crypto, directing commercial banks to stop dealing in, or with exchanges and people trading virtual money. This is by far the biggest blow yet to the development of digital assets in the country.

Bitcoin, the most popular of the bunch, dropped 3.7 percent this week to $8,117.43 even as Arthur Hayes — the crypto exchange executive whose firm rented the Lamborghinis — predicted a surge to $50,000 by year-end.\nThis week’s slump is far from extreme by crypto standards, but the market’s resistance to Blockchain Week’s ballyhoo highlights one of the arguments often used by virtual currency pessimists — that most people who are willing to buy the coins have already piled in.\nWhile bulls point to a vast pool of pent-up demand from professional money managers, it’s far from clear that regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere will evolve in ways that attract institutional investors. Many Wall Street pros have dismissed the market as a speculative bubble, while Warren Buffett has likened Bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”\nThis week’s losses may have been the result of unmet expectations surrounding Consensus 2018, said Sunny Lu, the chief executive officer of blockchain-based logistics company VeChain Tech and one of the conference speakers.\n“The quality of projects and speakers were not really as good as expected,” Lu said. “I guess people just got disappointed.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Bitcoin is trading at $8,127 just below its 50-day moving average, down 2.7% today, and has been stuck in a relatively narrow range by bitcoin standards for the better part of the week of $8,700 to $8,100, briefly dipping to $7,979 late Thursday London time.\nActivity on the Hong Kong-based BitMEX exchange, run by chief executive by Arthur Hayes who made his name as an ETF trader, and where bitcoin futures are traded on leverage of up to 100x, may have been responsible for the sub-$8,000 drop.\nThe liquidation of long positions in bitcoin on Thursday following a suspension on BitMEX may have contributed to briefly pushing bitcoin below the psychologically important $8,000 level.\nHayes in an appearance on CNBC's Fast Money predicted bitcoin would hit $50,000 by year's end, but he would say that wouldn't he.\nAccording to research site cryptocompare, trading volumes on the crypto exchanges it tracks is at the lowest for more than a year, coming in at 30,460 BTC.\nThe lacklustre performance of bitcoin, even against other altcoins never-mind fiat, continues despite some promising newsflow for the sector.\nBitcoin dominance of the crypto market has fallen to 37.45%, the lowest levels since February, according to coinmarketcap.\nMarket participants will be hoping the tight trading range and holding of support at $8,000 may be a pause before a renewed push higher. Circle to launch dollar-pegged crypto\nPayment startup Circle, whose backers include Goldman Sachs, announced this week that it would be releasing a cryptocurrency pegged to the value of the US dollar.\nCircle also completed a funding round this week, raising $110 million, valuing the company at $3 billion. Bitmain, the Chinese crypto mining giant took part in the funding round.\nCircle chief executive Jeremy Allaire plans for its Circle USD Coin project to leverage the use-case of crypto regarding speed of transfers and security compared to current fiat currency processes, as well as solve the volatility problem associated with crypto.\n\"It's a version of fiat that can move at the speed of the Internet with global reach, with much less cost, with high levels of security. It's a huge improvement for how fiat money transmission can work around the world for consumers and for businesses who might want to collect digital payment with tokens,\" Allaire explained.\nUSD Coin will be a regulated alternative to other so-called \"stablecoins\" such as Tether, which has been surrounded by controversy following the issuance of new coins without verifiable proof of backing by an equal amount of dollars.\nJack Dorsey the Twitter and Square chief executive is doubling- down on his faith in crypto as the \"native currency\" of the internet, although he is not sure bitcoin will be the one.\nSpeaking at the Consensus conference he said: \"I'm just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don't know if it will be bitcoin, I hope it will be bitcoin. I'm a huge fan.\"\nDorsey also revealed that not everyone at Square was enamoured with crypto and there have been heated debates about to what extent Square should embrace the nascent asset class. JPMorgan - from \"fraud\" to trading desk?\nJPMorgan has been the source of much mirth in the crypto community following its decision a few days ago to appoint Oliver Harris to the newly created position of head of crypto-assets strategy.\nJPMorgan has been working in the blockchain field for some time and, notably, was involved in helping Zcash to enhance its privacy features and it is thought that Harris will be working on a spin-off from that project as well as looking to make investments to bring blockchain start-ups to market.\nAlthough there is no firm indication that JPMorgan is setting up a trading desk imminently, it shows a softening of attitude in that direction. Some might say where Goldman Sachs leads, others follow - Goldman Sachs recently set up a trading desk for crypto.\nAs an aside, Zcash rose 40% this week when it was listed on the Gemini exchange owned by the entrepreneurial twins, the Winklevoss brothers.\nThe news from JPMorgan, the largest US investment bank, follows an interview with co-president Daniel Pinto who claimed that bitcoin will fail, either through being strangled by regulators or because \"people stop believing in it\".\nPinto added that he thinks the tokenisation of the economy \"is real\" and that although the bank had not traded bitcoin futures is was a in a position to do so. \"If we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No,\" he remarked in comments to CNBC.\nThe former head of blockchain development at JPMorgan, Amber Baldet, revealed the creation of a startup called Clovyr, along with co-founder Patrick Nielsen, also formerly of JPMorgan. Baldet aims to position Clovyr as a kind of app store for decentralised applications. Bitmain diversifying, bitcoin mining costs to mushroom\nBitmain, aside from making moves in Silicon Valley with its Circle investment, is also moving into artificial intelligence (AI), according to chief executive Jihan Wu in a rare interview.\nBitmain dominates the manufacture of ASIC chips, which are specialised processors optimised for mining bitcoin.\nGiven the persistent rumours of China's government looking to curtail mining activities in the country, Bitmain is planning to diversify and AI is the perfect fit. \"Artificial intelligence requires lots of computations,\" he told Bloomberg.\nConcerning mining and criticism of the amount power it consumes, a peer-reviewed paper from economist Alex de Vries estimates that the bitcoin network will use 0.5% of the world's electricity supply by the end of 2018.\nComputers compete on the bitcoin network to solve a mathematical problem and are rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins if they win, equivalent to about $100,000. Blocks are confirmed approximately once every 10 minutes.\n\"The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts),\" de Vries concludes.\nInstead of looking at hashrate, which is a measure of the computational resources of the network, to estimate electricity consumption, he extrapolates from the marginal cost of mining (average price x number of minted coins) while allowing for the fixed costs of equipment.\nVries assumes that miners, acting as rational economic agents, will tend to exit and enter mining activity in response to fluctuations in marginal costs. Blockchain ETF launch and China ranks Ethereum No. 1\nBitcoin believer Brain Kelly, founder and chief executive of BKCM a crypto-centric investment company, launched an exchange traded fund (ETF) this week. The actively managed fund is blockchain-focused and is a partnership with REX Shares. The REX BKCM ETF trades on the NYSE Acra exchange and has a 0.88% total expense ratio.\nKelly said of the Wednesday launch: \"I get asked all the time on how to invest in blockchain technology without dealing with storage, the fears of hacking, hedge funds, etc. My hope is the BKC ETF can provide this desired equity allocation to institutions and individuals alike.\"\nChina's ministry of information technology has created a crypto index listing 28 coins, and released its rating for each constituent a couple of days ago.\nTop of the heap is Ethereum, in second place is the social media network Steem, followed by Lisk, the German blockchain for which developers can code in the popular Javascript language, NEO the Chinese-based blockcain dapp platform with a high degree of centralisation, and in fifth place Komodo, which is a fork from Zcash and uses \"zero knowledge proofs\" to make transactions either totally private or transparent, depending on user requirements.\nBitcoin was rated at 13th in the index, which has produced similar criticisms to when the US ratings agency Weiss gave it a B- rating, with supporters saying not enough credit is given for the longevity (and hence security) of the bitcoin chain and superior adoption rate. HTC blockchain phone, eToro to launch full-blown crypto exchange\nHTC is the latest Chinese phone maker to announce plans for a blockchain phone, following news that Huawei was already in the throes of making one.\nOther industry news sees the global social trading platform eToro announce plans to enter the US market and to build a crypto exchange with accompanying crypto wallet.\nUp until now eToro exposure to crypto has been provided chiefly through contracts for difference products, but new rules in the European Union are making CFD dealing more expensive to provide and there has also been a clampdown on the level of margin that clients can use when trading the products.\nIn another indication that the crypto marketplace is slowly maturing and institutional interest increasing, Thomson Reuters launched real-time price feeds for six crypto and the CME futures exchange has released a reference rate and real-time prices for Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network.\nThe CME started trading bitcoin futures in December last year and the ether developments may signal an intention to launch an ether futures product.\nThere has been speculation since the launch of bitcoin futures on both the CME and CBOE, that they may have played a role in making it easier to short bitcoin and hence dampen the price, although the trading volumes are relatively low which throws some doubt on that line of argument.\nThese articles are provided for information purposes only.

So invest now and hold the coins for future.\nIt is also good because new investors find an opportunity to buy some bitcoin in low price. if the price raised as it was in the last month of the previous year there will be no new investors because of the very high price. volatility is the beauty of bitcoin because it attracts new investors and the market cap in increasing day by day and so will be the price.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T11:51:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e43f61039fa3482c074b08f703cbe6c2f22494d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbkJEADDtVI0zVcDIjC1WuMPHSdF6zHBQcJ2ZzhQFHsqG3hCX3UvQiU5SZ4DNk9ZbA--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Consensus wrap up: Where was the bitcoin rally?", "title_full": "Consensus wrap up: Where was the bitcoin rally?", "published": "2018-05-18T16:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e43f61039fa3482c074b08f703cbe6c2f22494d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbkJEADDtVI0zVcDIjC1WuMPHSdF6zHBQcJ2ZzhQFHsqG3hCX3UvQiU5SZ4DNk9ZbA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T16:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Consensus wrap up: Where was the bitcoin rally?", "text": "Consensus wrap up: Where was the bitcoin rally?\nNews\nThe news of deals and grand reveals at Consensus has been a constant flow for the past three days and all of it delivered with the usual fervor of futuristic big thinkers.

First, Bitcoin…”\nby Steve St Angelo of SRSrocco Report\nThere seems to be a lot of misinformation being peddled on the internet about gold and bitcoin. One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.\nWell, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it’s not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking .\nA few of the crypto aficionados tell their followers that gold can’t be a monetary asset because there are millions of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away in the Grand Canyon. While this may sound like quite an interesting conspiracy, there is no sound evidence to back it up. To believe in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. However, with the logic being in short supply currently, I am not surprised that many believe in these fairy tales.\nOne of these ex-precious metals, now a highly qualified cryptoanalyst, suggested in a recent video that the “Gold is owned by the Bankers” so why would you want to own gold? Unfortunately, this is a false statement . While the Central banks own a lot of gold, it’s a lot less than what the private investors and jewelry owners hold. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for the largest stocks of above ground gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), followed by 40,000 mt of private investment, 32,600 mt of Central bank holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial usage and other:\nOf the total 190,000 mt of the world above ground gold stocks, jewelry consists of 48%, private investment 21%, Central bank 17%, and Industrial and other at 14% (Source: World Gold Council – Total above-ground stocks 2017 ) So, if we realize that nearly half of all above-ground gold stocks are in the form of jewelry, and then another 21% is owned by private investors, Central banks DO NOT own most of the gold. Even if we compare private investment to Official holdings, private investors own more gold than Central banks.\nNow, to the incorrect theory that there are millions of tons of gold in the world, can someone please tell me where all this additional gold came from?? If we understand that the increase in gold mine production paralleled the rise in silver and copper production, how could there be 10-20 times more gold than copper and silver???\nFirst, most of the gold ever mined was produced after 1900:\nAccording to the best data, we can get our hands on, 91% of all gold mined since 1493 was produced after 1900. Limited records of gold produced before 1493 suggest that wasn’t more than 10,000-15,000 mt.\nSecondly, if we look at historical world silver production, we see the same pattern:\nOf the total 48.5 billion oz of silver mined in the world between 1493 and 2016, 81% of it was produced after 1900. Also, the amount of silver mined annually compared to gold has been about 10 to 1. Assuming that total historical silver production was approximately 55 billion oz compared to 5.7 billion oz of gold, it turns out to be nearly a 10/1 ratio.\nFor there to be just 1 million tons of gold in above-ground stocks in the world, that would equal 32 billion oz of gold. Considering a 10/1 ratio of silver to gold production, then we should have mined 300+ billion oz of silver, not the 55 billion oz stated by the world authorities.\nSo, if we understand the logic here, why on earth do people continue to believe in the LOUSY CONSPIRACY that there are millions of tons of gold in the world?? Why, because lousy conspiracies sell a hell of a lot more newsletters and subscriptions than those that put out the facts and fundamentals.\nRegardless, Central banks own less gold than above ground jewelry stocks or private investors. While Central banks are controlling the gold and silver prices by funneling 99%+ of investors into stocks, bonds, real estate and cryptos, they cannot manipulate the price of precious metals too far below their cost of production.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand energy or the cost of production as a FLOOR for the gold and silver prices. Which means, the Central banks cannot push the price of gold and silver anywhere they please. What the Central banks CAN DO, is that they can BAMBOOZLE the public in putting their funds into the biggest Ponzi Schemes in history. By funneling the public’s money into stocks, bonds, and real estate, this caps the gold and silver price. This is the manipulation.\nNow, the notion that Bitcoin will replace gold as the King Monetary Asset is patently false because Bitcoin fails several important tests. First, Bitcoin trading volatility is too high to be used as a currency. I have heard from several people that using Bitcoin as a payment method is very frustrating because the price can fluctuate $1,000 in a very short time, thus making it a very stressful transaction for both buyer and seller.\nIf we compare the volatility of Bitcoin versus gold and fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the clear loser:\nBitcoin’s 30-day volatility of 3.73% is nearly 9 times more gold and 10 times more than the USD/EUR (US Dollar-Euro). While Bitcoin’s volatility could continue to decline in the future, it still needs a very high-tech electronic system to allow trade and payment.\nSecondly, Bitcoin and cryptos will not function well as the EROI of energy continues to fall, destroying the ability to scale up or maintain high technology . I recently watched a documentary about the Dark Ages on the history channel. After the fall of the ancient western Roman Empire (5th century), people who lived around the once great city in the 6th and 7th century knew that life was better in the past because they saw all these massive buildings and structures, but were now living mostly a peasant’s life.\nIn just 3-4 generations, people no longer remembered what it was like to live in Rome during its heyday. The great culture, technology, food, and trade of the ancient Roman Empire were gone for good. Most Americans today have no idea what life is like after a collapse of society.\nNot only will Bitcoin and the cryptos not survive the coming Falling EROI energy collapse, either will most of the advanced technology. Sure, some technology will be around, but it will claim the same fate as the ancient Roman Empire. For this reason, gold will always remain the KING MONETARY METAL and asset.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand the Falling EROI of energy as they mislead their followers into investing in just another fly-by-night bubble.\nHOW TO SUPPORT THE SRSROCCO REPORT SITE\nMy goal is to reach 500 PATRON SUPPORTERS.

One is just simply riding on the other.\nNow, it appears, Bautista’s position has softened, bringing UnionBank beyond the level of participation of the majority of legacy financial institutions, which have stuck rigidly to Blockchain evangelism.\nThe major exception to date has been Switzerland, where banks have actively offered Bitcoin-based products since 2016 in what has become a highly-supportive environment for cryptocurrency usage.\nWhat do you think about UnionBank’s Bitcoin mining?

It is home to a few remittance services which rely on cryptocurrency. Moreover, the government made it clear Bitcoin can be used for remittance purposes. It is a validation of the world’s leading cryptocurrency being used for real-world use cases. So far, the Philippines is one of the only countries to take this specific step in recent years.\nUnionbank, the biggest bank in the country, recently showcased cryptocurrency miners during a business conference.While that may not seem important, it is another nod of approval toward cryptocurrency. While not a Bitcoin mining unit, it does show the institution is interested in cryptocurrencies.\nHow this venture will pan out exactly, remains a bit unclear. To this date, the bank has not confirmed it is involved in any cryptocurrency mining operation just yet. Even so, they are quite confident cryptocurrencies here to stay. More and more banks are getting on the cryptocurrency bandwagon these days. Ranging from trading desks to mining operations, things are certainly heading in an interesting direction.\nBitcoin and The Philippines\nIt is not the first time Unionbank shows an interest in cryptocurrency or its underpinning technology. Earlier this year, the institution announced a blockchain payment system. This venture is launched together with Visa. Although that feature does not involve cryptocurrencies, it shows its underpinning technology can effectively transform business models in the Philippines.\nAdditionally, the Philippines government introduced an “economic zone” for cryptocurrencies. In this zone, cryptocurrency companies are allowed to operate in a licensed environment. Surprisingly, this venture attracted a lot of attention from international firms. Especially companies from Japan, Malaysia, and Hong Kong are interested in this option. The economic zone accommodates all business models, including exchanges, mining, and initial coin offerings.\nAll of this is in stark contrast with a slight crackdown on Bitcoin users. The Philippine National Police has arrested Bitcoiners before. This was mainly due to allegations regarding running a Ponzi Scheme. Additionally, cloud mining is still somewhat frowned upon in this country. The Bitcoin situation in the Philippines is heading in an interesting direction right now. Unionbank’s recent “endorsement” is another surprising development in this regard.\n(Source: https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/18/unionbank-showcasing-cryptocurency-mining-hardware-raises-some-interesting-questions/) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "miguel cuneta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unionbank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines showcases bitcoin mining equipment financial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "largest bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unionbank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T03:14:25.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57b80099e5e09b5cd33f2112154af64a39fdb0b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSqdrrvfAmEpwP8P5KuuXt8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Many Country's Government think Bitcoin is a Illegal?", "title_full": "Why Many Country's Government think Bitcoin is a Illegal?", "published": "2018-05-18T15:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57b80099e5e09b5cd33f2112154af64a39fdb0b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSqdrrvfAmEpwP8P5KuuXt8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jessicaldiaseso", "published": "2018-05-18T15:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Many Country's Government think Bitcoin is a Illegal?", "text": "Bitcoin is a natural enemy of the government.

It is characteristic that throughout the current week, the market capitalization is kept approximately at these levels, while the bitcoin market has approached the previously announced target of $7,700-$7,800, where the first significant support takes place. The daily trading volume on the market also fell by about $3 billion from $22 billion to $19 billion.\nEarlier, the price of bitcoins fell below $8,000, the first time entering the region for 7,000 dollars since mid-April. On the chart, both simple and exponential moving averages demonstrate strong short signals even at around $7,925. The positive aspect is that the relative strength index (RSI)of bitcoin shows the oversold conditions.\nTraders were waiting for Blockchain Week in New York, the largest conference on cryptocurrencies in the world, and hoped that this global event would lead to a revival of the market and at least some attempts to gains.\nNevertheless, the bitcoin downtrend is still strong after falling below the key resistance level at $8200 the bulls to seize the initiative.\nFORTFS analysts reported throughout the week that the resistance level of $8,200 is an important support level to watch, and traders should closely monitor it. However, as soon as it was broken, it became obvious that the market would decline further.

Given that mining tends to use your CPU or GPU at high load, this clearly puts a strain on the power outputs. The exact level of total energy used for this production is unclear, but a report via the Independent suggests that despite the dip in price, mining continues to grow.\nThe report suggests that the total amount of energy required to supply the mining will by the end of 2018 take up roughly 0.5% of the total worlds energy output. That, to put into a more physical context, it roughly the same amount of power that Ireland uses. Incredible growth, but a strain on energy providers\nThis is the first time that such a peer report has been produced and is accurate, shows just how major an industry it has become. Of course, not everyone is agreeing with it, but from my perspective, I wouldn’t be surprised if the figure provided was accurate. If not, I wouldn’t expect it to be too far from the mark.\nAlex De Vries, an economist who produced the research has said: “We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Half a percent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.”\nGrowth has, of course, slowed down significantly since the boom. Particularly since Bitcoin is now at roughly 40% of its value from just last December. If trends continue though, then the Bitcoin mining industry might have to start finding some energy answers of its own.\nWhat do you think? Do the figures sound accurate to you? What should be done (if anything) in the industry to help curb this growth? – Let us know in the comments!

The bearish pressure is not relenting by any means, as market makers are intent on keeping the prices down for some time to come.\nWith the Bitcoin price now dropping below $8,200, it seems to be a matter of time until the value dips below $8,000 once again. That would certainly trigger an even bigger sell-off in the altcoin department.\nIt has been documented over the past few months how the Bitcoin price is seemingly incapable of catching a break. No solid positive momentum has been achieved at this stage, and it seems things will not necessarily improve in the near future either. The past three months have seen some attempts at recovering losses, but ultimately seem to result in lower lows for the Bitcoin price.\nMore specifically, three months ago, the Bitcoin price was hovering near the $12,0000 mark. Ever since that time, it has dipped below $11,000, then $10,000, and even hit $7,200 a few weeks later. While that is still the proverbial bottom as of right now, it remains to be determined if any positive momentum can be generated before the year 2018 comes to a close. The current trend doesn’t look all that promising so far, but things are always subject to change in the world of cryptocurrency.\nOver the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price has lost another 1.95% of its value. This decline pushes the price per BTC below $8,200, and will seemingly result in a price dip below $8,000 by the time the weekend has come to a close. It remains unclear what is causing all of this negative Bitcoin price pressure this year, but it seems evident things will not improve anytime soon.\nEven the Bitcoin trading volume is on the decline as of late, which is anything but promising. More specifically, the trading volume has dropped to $8.894bn, which is $2bn below what one would expect to see these days. This seems to indicate the overall demand for the world’s leading cryptocurrency is on the decline, which doesn’t bode well for Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency on the market these days.\nOKEx is still leading the charge in terms of Bitcoin trading volume, which is a bit surprising. Its USDT pair remains extremely popular and is well ahead of Bitfinex’s USD pair and the USDT market on Binance. All three platforms generate over $215m in 24-hour volume, which is rather interesting to keep an eye on. With Huobi and OKEx’s TRUE pair in the five as well, there is only one fiat currency market to speak of. That can prove to be problematic for the Bitcoin price moving forward.\nWhether or not the Bitcoin price can recover from this latest setback, remains to be determined. Anything is possible in the world of cryptocurrency these days, even though the current trend looks anything but promising. Then again, the weekend is usually very different from the rest of the week when it comes to cryptocurrency trading, and this weekend may prove to be somewhat interesting in this regard.
