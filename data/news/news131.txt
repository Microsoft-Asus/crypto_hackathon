Shailesh Bhatt, a builder based in the diamond city, wrote to Gujarat’s junior Home Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja in February, alleging that Amreli Police had extorted bitcoins worth ₹12 crore from him. Mr. Jadeja forwarded the complaint to the Crime Investigation Department (CID). A probe led to the opening of a Pandora's Box.\n“While probing the case, we learnt that Bhatt himself was an extortionist. He had extorted bitcoins worth ₹155.21 crore from others before he was kidnapped [for extortion] by the Amreli Police,” CID (Crime) Director General of Police (DGP) Ashish Bhatia told reporters on May 21. New case\nThe agency has registered a new case to book Bhatt and others, including Superintendent of Police (SP) Jagdish Patel and Police Inspector Anant Patel. Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Nalin Kotadia, currently absconding, is also an accused in the case.

Huge returns of 1%-4% per day were promised. Bhatt invested ₹2 crore in the enterprise. In December 2017, its promoters downed the shutters and went underground.\nTo recover his investment, Bhatt’s accomplices posed as Income Tax officials and kidnapped Piyush Savalia, who had worked with Bit Connect, on January 30, 2018. He was kept in a farmhouse at gunpoint and released two days later, on February 1. “On the morning of February 1, Bhatt’s men kidnapped Dhaval Mavani, another person associated with the company, and released him late on the same night. Mavani was forced to transfer 2,256 bitcoins worth ₹131 crore into their account. The builder and his accomplices had also transferred another 166 bitcoins worth ₹9.64 crore into their account,” Mr. Bhatia said, adding, “When we started a probe directed at Bhatt, he even paid ₹ 34.5 lakh to Piyush Savalia as hush money to keep him quiet.”\nThe former legislator, who played a fixer between Bhatt and the Amreli Police when the police extorted ₹12 crore bitcoins from Bhatt, allegedly received ₹60 lakh, of which the CID has recovered ₹20 lakh transacted through havala.\nMr. Bhatia estimates that the Bitcoin extortion racket is set to get bigger as more people who invested in the hope of making a quick buck became victims of organised crime. “So far, we have only caught two cases involving ₹167 crore,” Mr. Bhatia said. “We are investigating seven companies with investments in virtual currencies in which businessmen parked their illicit cash after demonetisation.”\nA senior official in Gujarat who declined to be named said, “It’s an open secret that people having a high volume of cash at the time of demonetisation converted their black money into crypto currencies with the help of havala operators.” Officials involved in the Bitcoin probe estimate that approximately ₹5,000 crore cash was converted into cryptocurrencies in Surat after demonetisation.

By Nathan Reiff | May 26, 2018 — 11:55 AM EDT\nAlthough cryptocurrencies have been in existence for nearly a decade, it is only in the recent past that they have come to dominate conversations among investors. Over a roughly two-year period, digital currencies have experienced a boom in interest and value previously unseen in the area. Now, hundreds of cryptocurrencies have followed in the footsteps of early leaders like bitcoin (BTC), and there are a similarly staggering number of new applications and projects making use of blockchain technology as well.\nWhile digital currencies are undoubtedly incredibly popular, they remain a mystery in many ways. Of primary concern to many investors, analysts and advisors is the extreme volatility that the digital currency world as a whole has already exhibited. To take bitcoin as an example, the world's leading digital currency by market cap rose to prices of roughly $20,000 per token as of the last few days of 2017. It dropped significantly early in 2018 before climbing back up again earlier this spring. At its highest point during this upswing, BTC didn't even reach half of the value that it enjoyed just a few months prior.\nAs of this writing, BTC is hovering around $7,500. Still, investors who bought the cryptocurrency at this time last year are seeing their investments up by a factor of four, roughly. Approximately 5% of Americans, or about 16 million people, owned BTC as of the first months of 2018, according to Forbes . In this complicated investment scenario, what is the role of a financial advisor ? (See also: Basics for Buying and Investing in Bitcoin .) Big Brokerages Tend to Prohibit Recommendations\nMany of the major brokerages , including JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ), Wells Fargo & Company ( WFC ), Morgan Stanley ( MS ) and Merrill Lynch, have all prohibited their financial advisors from recommending cryptocurrencies to clients. In late 2017, even as BTC was reaching ever higher to new record levels, Merrill banned trading of bitcoin futures and the Bitcoin Investment Trust, an investment product related to the cryptocurrency and offered by Grayscale. For its part, Wells Fargo has issued research primers on digital currencies, and it also lets its advisors present these documents to their clients. However, it stops there, not allowing advisors to make specific recommendations on account of the complexity and volatility of the space.\nWhy do these brokerages not allow their advisors to recommend bitcoin and other digital currencies? Certainly, the extreme volatility and unpredictability of the space is a primary concern. Beyond that, though, there is a sense of regulatory uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency space. Even now, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already worked to clarify aspects of the digital currency space, there remains a great deal that is uncertain.\nFor example, the debate continues on as to the exact conditions under which token can be considered a financial security . So far, a very small number of digital currency assets have been registered as securities, and yet the SEC has suggested that securities laws of various types may apply to the space. From the perspective of a financial advisor or brokerage, this is a dangerous place to be; if an advisor recommends that clients buy a particular digital currency and the SEC later deems that asset to be an unregistered security, that would mean trouble for all parties. (For more, see: How SEC Regs Will Change Cryptocurrency Markets .) Reasons for Recommending\nWhile many brokerages and advisors have chosen to remain out of the cryptocurrency fray, others believe that it is worth exploring. Former Merrill Lynch financial advisor and co-author of the book \"Cryptoassets\" Jack Tatar believes that big brokerages are doing clients a disservice by avoiding the digital currency space. \"You're taking the ability of an advisor who has a lot of education and knowledge, and you're basically telling them they can't even discuss this with a client,\" he says, adding that \"it's only a matter of time, maybe three or four years from now, when you'll have a number of cryptocurrency ETFs available. These firms will back-track their policies. But meanwhile, investors will have missed an opportunity for gains.\" (For more, see Why Buy This Expensive Bitcoin Trust Instead of Bitcoin? )\nTatar believes that digital currencies ought to be treated as an alternative asset class . He argues that \"if the financial services industry had created bitcoin, everyone would have bitcoin in their portfolio right now.\" He continues by suggesting that products created by financial services, including collateralized mortgage obligations , volatility indices and similar products might otherwise not be considered suitable investments, and yet they are because of who created them. Essentially, he believes that big brokerages are avoiding digital currencies because they haven't managed to set themselves up in such a way as to profit from the space.\nThere are advisors who tell clients about cryptocurrency investment opportunities in spite of employer policies prohibiting this action. While brokers may not be allowed to execute a cryptocurrency trade, they can still tell clients to make a personal investment in the area, for instance.\nOthers, like independent financial advisor Ric Edelman of Fairfax, Virginia, aim for an approach somewhere in between the two extremes. Edelman does not proactively recommend digital currencies to his clients. However, if they ask about them, he offers advice. He tells them that \"if [they] choose to invest, [they] should do so with no more than 2%\" of a portfolio and that they should \"be prepared to lose it all.\" For Edelman and others, caution is key, but it's also important to note that brokerages completely deny the existence of this new space. He suggests that \"the industry is slowly changing, but [the big brokerages] remain unconvinced.\" (For additional reading, check out: The Future of Cryptocurrency .)", "highlightText": "",

On May 24, 2018, Frankfurt-based Deutsche Borse AG has hinted it’s weighing the possibility of offering clients bitcoin and other crypto-related products. Fighting the Bitcoin Bug\nAccording to Bloomberg , the highly-reputed stock exchange has noted a more liberal approach towards bitcoin and other blockchain-based virtual currencies. Present at an industry event in London by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe ( AFME ), the company’s head of clients, products, and core markets, Jeffrey Tessler , noted that the firm is carefully studying bitcoin and the underlying technology:\n“Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do. We are deep at work with it.”\nThe former Executive Vice president of the Bank of New York also hinted that the super volatile nature of the world’s flagship cryptocurrency, as well as the regulatory uncertainties surrounding the nascent digital assets industry, makes it crucial to study the ecosystem extensively before jumping in.\n“Before moving forward with anything like Bitcoin, we want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.” Advertisement advertisement It’s Only a Matter of Time\nWhile Tessler and his firm are waiting for the storm to settle before diving into the crypto oceans, the CME and CBOE are still doing brisk business with bitcoin. May 2018 has also seen the launch of the ether futures contracts by Crypto Facilities, a London-based digital assets company entirely regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ).\nInterestingly, however, Tessler is not alone in his decision. Back in April 2018, the CEO of Nasdaq, Adena Friedman told CNBC that they would consider launching a cryptocurrency exchange when bitcoin is done scaling all the regulatory hurdles, and the markets get more mature.\n“Certainly Nasdaq would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time. If we do look at it and say it’s time, people are ready for a more regulated market, for something that provides a fair experience for investors.” Bitcoin Futures Contracts Responsible for the Price Slump\nMay is almost gone, and the bear market is still upon us, threatening fire and brimstone. Of a truth, the regulatory pressures that the authorities have subjected the crypto ecosystem to since September 2017 has taken its toll on the markets.\nHowever, recent research by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco points to the fact that the CME and CBOE bitcoin futures contracts are responsible for the unending bitcoin bloodbath. An excerpt from the document reads:\n“Similarly, the advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.”\nAt press time the price of bitcoin is just above the $7,500 price region.

He has rejected conditions offered by US investigators, his lawyer said. Vinnik, a Russian expert in cryptocurrency technologies, is being held in a Thessaloniki jail. Washington accuses him of laundering at least $4 billion in Bitcoin through a trading platform. He is also sought for extradition by Russia for alleged fraud. Vinnik wants go back to Russia and is ready to cooperate with investigators, his lawyer Timofey Musatov said in an interview with RIA Novosti, published on Saturday. Musatov noted that his client has \"no choice\" as his children and wife, who became ill as a result of overwhelming stress relating to her husband's arrest, are in Russia. \"I want, in any circumstances, that my activities or my crimes are investigated in Russia. If I am guilty, I must be brought to punishment. I will cooperate with the investigation. I want to be in Russia under any circumstances,\" the lawyer said , citing his client. Vinnik can also shed light on some other crimes involving cryptocurrencies, Musatov says, adding that damning information he could provide may place his life under threat. Following reports that an attempt on his life by poisoning was being planned, Greek authorities have beefed up security, the lawyer confirmed. The Thessaloniki court earlier supported Vinnik's extradition to both Russia and the US, and the final decision is to be made by the Greek minister for justice. Meanwhile, the defense team is fighting the extradition to the US as Vinnik refuses to cooperate with Washington. \"Alexander Vinnik has completely rejected all such proposals [to work with the US investigators]. He has a very clear, unequivocal position - not to agree to any conditions suggested by the Americans under any circumstances. He is ready to take the risk of coming to the Russian Federation,\" Musatov said. Vinnik was arrested in the resort area in northern Greece in July. If Washington's request for extradition is granted, Vinnik may face up to 55 years behind bars for the charges brought against him.

Why is privacy important , why private coins will go up? I got 3 angles to discuss : First the dumbos and crybabies angle !!! Bitcoin is bu-bu-l , crypto is used by crimi-naals!!? Morons can't be more wrong !! Why - because bitcoin and even anonymous coins are way more traceable than paper, gold, betting chits, hookers, bribes... Duhhhh. What were criminals using before 2009??? Duuuhhhh . Here's a hypothetical money laundering situation You go in the bank with $50000 dirty smelly rumpled notes . -Where u got these , sir?? - Found them on me train bubba, under some magazine !! - Welcome to our bank sir!!! Coffee , car, hookers ? Duhhhh. Now same situation with crypto coins : -Where u got these , sir?? - Found them on me train bubba, DASH was under some bottle , PIVX and XDN were spilling from the table !! - Hold on to call few policemen !! Duhhhh. Now the angle of normal people who own crypto . Tomorrow you go into the shop to buy whiskey bottle . Most expensive is 0.0001 bitcoin for Black label Johny The guy gets your bitcoin and checks your transaction history ... Oh look....there's balance of 40 bitcoin worth 2 million ?!? Previous history reveals you bought 2 Lamborginis, island in Greece , 5 houses.... Chain of transactions goes back to 2012 when you bought 1000 bitcoin f rom some exchange .!!! So when u go next in the shop...they wait for u with a baseball bat and beat you enough to give them all 40 bitcoin . Now you think bitcoin is not so great and should go the privacy coins route To be continued.... with tax inspection angle...

One of many parallel ways to see it is that a coin at $8k can either 2x or ½x (in each of every 4 months period), until 2022. Then you see the expected price burst to $250k.\nHowever within the various binomial pathways, we have the most bullish 15% (or the most bubblicious 15% of all rarified bubbles ), would be worth $1.5m. Empirically we can't substantiate anything close to this theoretical probability since we don’t have that many relevant bubbles to gauge it. And if you exclude this extreme tail outcome, what remains is a 1:7 chance for a price to be a rich $70k, and 6:7 chance for the price to still free-fall further below $6k.\nEconomics professor Nouriel Roubini provides us his opinion.\nMuch more likely to be close to $250 than to $250000 IMHO. https://t.co/DJHEJl8JvS — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) May 25, 2018\nIt’s not for me to judge for someone else if this a good 5-year investment distribution for people, but one shouldn’t fool themselves instead into thinking Tim Draper’s price estimate of $250k implies a 50/50 chance of being above versus below $250k. This extreme-growth exponential model that arrives at $250k is also relying on an immeasurably small probability of a value being much higher than $250k (same idea would apply to other bulls such as John McAfee or our follower Tom Lee.) And there are many ways for this probability to come down, or for the up-branches of the binomial tree above to not have a high 50% chance, both of which have the impact of negating the potential benefit from this most bullish scenario.\nLast, here is a bonus chart to contemplate.\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/statisticalideas/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim draper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nouriel roubini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T18:14:51.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c2245d918df1ba207b921b55315454fb8bb3b5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhER3GmgG1ptjvUh0A04zmkw-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-26T18:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c2245d918df1ba207b921b55315454fb8bb3b5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhER3GmgG1ptjvUh0A04zmkw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-26T18:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 26, 2018 WEB Bitcoin Origin Crunchbase Bitcoin Origin- World's first Multi Fork meets serverless Blockchain.

On May 24, 2018, Frankfurt-based Deutsche Borse AG has hinted it’s weighing the possibility of offering clients bitcoin and other crypto-related products.\nFighting the Bitcoin Bug According to Bloomberg , the highly-reputed stock exchange has noted a more liberal approach towards bitcoin and other blockchain-based virtual currencies. Present at an industry event in London by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe ( AFME ), the company’s head of clients, products, and core markets, Jeffrey Tessler , noted that the firm is carefully studying bitcoin and the underlying technology:\n“Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do. We are deep at work with it.”\nThe former Executive Vice president of the Bank of New York also hinted that the super volatile nature of the world’s flagship cryptocurrency, as well as the regulatory uncertainties surrounding the nascent digital assets industry, makes it crucial to study the ecosystem extensively before jumping in.\n“Before moving forward with anything like Bitcoin, we want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.”\nIt’s Only a Matter of Time While Tessler and his firm are waiting for the storm to settle before diving into the crypto oceans, the CME and CBOE are still doing brisk business with bitcoin. May 2018 has also seen the launch of the ether futures contracts by Crypto Facilities, a London-based digital assets company entirely regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ).\nInterestingly, however, Tessler is not alone in his decision. Back in April 2018, the CEO of Nasdaq, Adena Friedman told CNBC that they would consider launching a cryptocurrency exchange when bitcoin is done scaling all the regulatory hurdles, and the markets get more mature.\n“Certainly Nasdaq would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time. If we do look at it and say it’s time, people are ready for a more regulated market, for something that provides a fair experience for investors.”\nBitcoin Futures Contracts Responsible for the Price Slump May is almost gone, and the bear market is still upon us, threatening fire and brimstone. Of a truth, the regulatory pressures that the authorities have subjected the crypto ecosystem to since September 2017 has taken its toll on the markets.\nHowever, recent research by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco points to the fact that the CME and CBOE bitcoin futures contracts are responsible for the unending bitcoin bloodbath. An excerpt from the document reads:\n“Similarly, the advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.”\nAt press time the price of bitcoin is just above the $7,500 price region.\nThe post German Stock Exchange Ponders Offering Bitcoin Trading to Clients appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\nfrom BTCMANAGER https://btcmanager.com/german-stock-exchange-ponders-offering-bitcoin-trading-to-clients/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeffrey tessler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "association for financial markets in europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche borse ag", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T11:53:38.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12cd3ffc3678a079c1150f94a2a86cd213fd4827", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp17xRzsLDEtttEcPiGMI4IO7CQKAHJNAe6rIBcPBDQxQ--", "site_full": "blogotariat.com", "site": "blogotariat.com", "site_section": "http://blogotariat.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Blogotariat - Oz Blog News Commentary", "title": "A limit to Bitcoin scale?", "title_full": "A limit to Bitcoin scale?", "published": "2018-05-26T18:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12cd3ffc3678a079c1150f94a2a86cd213fd4827", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCp17xRzsLDEtttEcPiGMI4IO7CQKAHJNAe6rIBcPBDQxQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Admin", "published": "2018-05-26T18:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "A limit to Bitcoin scale?", "text": "A limit to Bitcoin scale? May 27, 2018 - 01:05 -- Admin\nEric Budish has a new paper out on “The Economic Limits of the Blockchain.” He demonstrates a potentially fundamental contradiction at the heart of ‘proof of work’ schemes to support cryptocurrencies — the most famous of which is, of course, Bitcoin. It is an incredibly clear issue so I figured I would recount it here.\nAs is well-known, there is a ‘open entry’ mining game at the heart of Bitcoin which generates a reward, P_block, in each (10 minute) period it is played for one lucky miner. Miners can improve their odds of winning by investing in computational power. If there are N units of computational power on the network and you own n of them, your expected return is Prob{win}*Reward = ( n / N )P_block. Moreover, as I described in a previous post , (and also in my paper with June Ma and Rabee Tourky), the ‘open entry’ aspect means that if each unit of computational power costs c per period, then free entry means that:\nProb{Win per Unit}*Reward = Average Resource Cost per Unit\nBecause someone is going to win, what this means is that:\nReward = Total Resource Cost of the System\nor in this case:\nP_block = cN\nWhat Budish adds to this picture is the demand-side of the equation. In particular, while the supply-side leads to lots of computational power being applied to win a block, the benefit of this is supposed to be robustness against some form of attack. For instance, in a “majority attack,” if there are currently N * units of computational power on the network, then by paying cN * + e (where e is a little bit), an attacker can potentially get control of the network. In some situations, a simple majority isn’t enough and you might need AcN * to get control where A (> 1) is a parameter that represents the super-majority you might need to apply your computational power in order to take control for t periods (in expectation).\nIn this case, you get At.cN * – t .P_block during the t periods of attack. But above we know that P_block = cN , so this equation becomes:\n( A – 1) t. P_block > V_attack\nHere V_attack is the reward an attacker might get. If the cost of the attack is greater than V_attack, an attack will not occur and the system will be robust.\nThe big insight is that this is all in terms of flow returns. Why? Because computational power being applied to mining is assumed to be fungible (and so can be easily deployed in and out of the system at will). In addition, during the attack you actually get P_block which lowers the cost of the attack. Once the attack is over, everyone competes as per normal. So Budish notes that Bitcoin is an institution whose long-term viability is based on the potential for very short-term enforcement mechanisms. That is not a good sign.\nThe above equation is good news in the sense that a higher P_block means that it is less likely an attack will be mounted. However, when we think about a double spending attack, the value of V_attack is related to the value of bitcoins which, of course, is positively related to P_block. So in that sense, the more valuable the transactions, the less robust is Bitcoin. In other words, everything was fine so long as Bitcoin was economically unimportant but as it becomes important there is a problem.\nNow, people will note that the ‘best’ chips these days for mining are ASIC chips. These cannot be repurposed for other uses. Hence, the equation Budish identifies may not hold. Indeed, having non-fungible chips makes Bitcoin more robust. Why? To attack you need to invest in ASIC computational power and hence, V_attack must be correspondingly higher to justify that attack. As it becomes hard to find arguments why V_attack would be high without Bitcoin just collapsing, things may be OK.\nWhat is instructive here is that Nakamoto described Bitcoin a democratic like system with “one-CPU-one-vote” which meant that any person could participate. But if it is only robust with specialized chips, that democratic philosophy is undermined. In other words, Bitcoin is only likely to be long-lasting and robust as an institution because technology has subverted the very democratic-style principles that were core to its founding vision.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3103104", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eric.budish/research/Economic-Limits-Blockchain.pdf&hl=en&sa=X&scisig=AAGBfm3rki6S8gqmiyuSbMiJPqTmHAYeAQ&nossl=1&oi=scholaralrt", "https://digitopoly.org/2017/12/17/ending-the-bitcoin-energy-drain/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric budish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "june ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabee tourky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T19:55:09.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "059383ce91589f52d6d94aa7d868bf7fe08d42ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFZTDDL3Ps1yM.o_nmRc_9KJt4_VKtPqr0K.CfkZg3ibFpQm5SEhLvG760yXFi3q3xAlKSk5RmOE_cU9kTk9zFYI7hX6qEUMw_SUna71Ob1x7", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "title_full": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "published": "2018-05-26T18:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_722959630.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "059383ce91589f52d6d94aa7d868bf7fe08d42ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFZTDDL3Ps1yM.o_nmRc_9KJt4_VKtPqr0K.CfkZg3ibFpQm5SEhLvG760yXFi3q3xAlKSk5RmOE_cU9kTk9zFYI7hX6qEUMw_SUna71Ob1x7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-26T18:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "text": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018 by 0\n-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis The price of Bitcoin has faced unexpected downward pressure in May as Consensus 2018 did not produce enough enthusiasm for a bullish move.

Bitcoin stalled below the $10,000 area in early May and has been steadily returning to the 2018 lows.\nWilly Woo, a BTC technical analyst with 62,500 followers on Twitter, is not very optimistic about where the market is moving next.

And this is not fair to the guy who made that 10,000btc exchange if the spotlight is going to be on him alone. It will make many cast aspersions on the dude as being stupid and then believe the buyer is lucky and smarter for that exchange. We can't really be sure the shop still has the bitcoin intact. Researchers should find out what eventually happened.

In the current scenario and since the last few months, the value of Bitcoin has been very stable and consistent as a result of which the number of people investing in the currency have increased which is the only thing responsible for the appreciation of prices. Furthermore, the tech expert shave been optimistic about the future of the technology and I believe it will expand more in short time.\nYeah of course right now is the best time for investing in bitcoin because the price is below $10000 and I am sure that you will never find this chance in the future.

Slowly but surely it's becoming easier to spend BTC, BCH, and a range of other cryptos throughout the continent, with payment services like Wirex and Paytomat leading the charge. It's now possible to spend bitcoin in hundreds of restaurants and stores throughout Eastern Europe, as well as anywhere that accepts Visa in the whole of mainland Europe and the UK.\nAlso read: SA Central Bank Comes Up With Another Nickname for Cryptos – \"Cyber Tokens\"\nWirex Rolls Out Its New Crypto Debit Cards When crypto debit cards were cancelled in Europe last year, with a Visa subsidiary to blame, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency holders were left clutching worthless pieces of plastic. But as crypto companies have forged new alliances with payment processors, crypto debit cards have started to return, and hopefully this time they're here to stay. In the past two weeks, Wirex has begun dispatching physical cards to UK and mainland European customers who were on its waiting list. News.Bitcoin.com had a chance to put one of the cards to the test, topping it up with BTC and then spending it in-store and online, and was impressed with the results.\nProcessing a cryptocurrency payment with Paytomat A full review of the Wirex crypto debit card follows below, after a quick look at what Paytomat have been up to. The cryptocurrency payment system supports 11 cryptos including bitcoin cash and zencash, and has support from over 330 restaurants and stores at present, mostly in Eastern Europe. It's since expanded into Western Europe, however, with a launch that took place in an Amsterdam soup kitchen earlier this month.\nPaytomat CEO Yurii Olentir said: \"Amsterdam is one of the most crypto-friendly places, so we chose it for our kick-off in Western Europe. With millions of tourists visiting every month, cryptocurrencies can be a very convenient payment method. For example, a transaction in Bitcoin Cash takes just a couple of seconds and the fee is miniscule.\"\nIn total, Paytomat supports BCH, ZEN, XEM, DASH, WAVES, LTC, ETH, NANO, DCR, XZC and BTC, and as a video demonstration shows, paying for a meal with bitcoin cash is quick and easy:\nA Quick Look at the Wirex Crypto Card in Action I applied for a Wirex card weeks ago, and succeeded after several failed attempts at address verification. At one point I feared I was never going to convince their KYC I lived where I claimed to live, but a stamped bank confirmation letter finally did the trick. The team's customer support was helpful throughout, to their credit. Last week, Wirex announced that its cards were finally ready to ship. Mine arrived in a beautifully packaged sleeve that folds out to reveal the slogan \"The most versatile payments card in the world\" accompanied by a heart emoji face.\nIf I thought the presentation was good, the activation turned out to be even slicker. With the Wirex app already installed on my phone, all I had to do was hold the card in proximity to the device and the NFC chip automatically extracted the last four digits of the card and the CVV number. I clicked the verification email link and that was it: my card was good to go. Wirex accepts BTC and LTC, but no BCH or ETH unfortunately. Hopefully they'll add more cryptocurrency support in due course. For now, I fired over some BTC, and not long afterward a notification informed me that my coins had arrived.\nA Few Hiccups, But Otherwise Impressive For users who don't already have cryptocurrency to hand, Wirex enables you to top up your card using your existing bank account; transfers reportedly clear within a few hours. With my BTC loaded, I tried to transfer the balance to GBP so I could spend it, but accidentally swapped into LTC instead; the process is a little confusing. At the second time of asking, I worked out how to complete the swap, and within seconds my litecoin had been exchanged for British pounds. My daughter had been pestering me to buy more reading credits for her iOS app, and so my first £10 of crypto went on purchasing virtual gems.\nI planned to test the card at a restaurant next, but when it came to pay the bill realized that I didn't know the PIN for the Wirex card, and was forced to use an alternate method to settle up. Back home, I searched through every submenu of the Wirex mobile app and desktop platform to find where the PIN number was located. I got there, eventually, though it wasn't intuitive at all. This minor grumble aside, the card works perfectly, and there's even 0.5% in cashback to be earned on all purchases – paid in BTC.\nEvery time you use your Wirex card, you're credited cashback in satoshis Naturally, Wirex make their cut in terms of the exchange rate you're offered every time you switch from fiat to crypto and vice-versa. This is still preferable to having to cash out crypto through Localbitcoins.com or similar every time you need to spend money in the \"real world.\" On first impressions, the Wirex card looks very good.

This will boost up their economy if the country stop using high budgets on making paper money and its printing also costs a lot. In order to save this money the country will adopt Bitcoin and this will demolish the paper money that costs a lot.

Distinguish Their Differences and Avoid Investment Traps", "text": "\nIn recent years, with the rise of Bitcoin, more and more investors have turned their attention to this area. Even some pioneers have already earned enough money through speculation while some have fallen into the abyss. So, what are the differences between Bitcoin and the more traditional stocks?\n1. Conceptual Difference\nStock is a certificate of ownership issued by a joint stock company. It is a kind of negotiable securities issued by a joint stock company to raise funds to each shareholder as a certificate of ownership and to obtain dividends.\nBitcoin is a virtual currency. It does not rely on specific currency agencies to issue, but on a number of calculations based on specific algorithms. Its total quantity is limited, fixed to 21 million, and no one can change it.\nAccording to the concept, we can see that stock is a kind of securities, while bitcoin is a kind of currency. In English, if you want to buy a commodity, you must first convert your stock into cash, but you can buy it directly with bitcoins.\n2. Holding Value Difference\nBy holding the stock, we not only have the value of the stock itself, but also have:\nØ Corporate decision-making power;\nØ Profit distribution rights;\nØ Preemptive stock options;\nØ Right to allocate assets;\nFor example:\nYou own 51% of a company's shares and this year the company runs very well which has completed the goal of making 10 billion yuan, 51% of which belong to you.\nYou recently get addicted to watching the live broadcast and found that the live broadcast was very profitable. So you met with other shareholders to discuss it. Although the current major business of the company is on car and your proposal on company transformation has been unanimously opposed by other shareholders, this company will still experience a transition to live broadcast from tomorrow because you have an absolute controlling stake.\nUnfortunately, the company's transformation failed and went bankrupt. The liquidation was carried out, and the remaining assets of the company were only 1 hundred million. Then 51 million of them still belonged to you.\nDifferently, by holding Bitcoin, we hold money.\n3. Transaction Mechanism Difference\nAs a relatively mature trading market, there are various restrictions on the stock market. Although these restrictions limit our freedom of transaction to a certain extent, it can also be regarded as a protective measure to protect our interests.\nThe emerging Bitcoin market does not contain so many restrictions, but because of too free, the risk will also increase.\nIn terms of transaction time limits, Bitcoin uses the T+0 mechanism, while stocks use the T+1 mechanism.\nWe personally think that in these two mechanisms, the T+1 mechanism is more suitable for retail investors. Because in the T+0 mechanism investors can sell after buying the same day, the possibility of speculation greatly increases, and it is easy to make the market more unstable. Retail investors, because of less access to information, are easy to suffer losses.\nHowever, in the T+1 system, what made people more crumble was that if the price suddenly dropped after purchasing the shares, although it was aware that the situation was not good, due to the limitation of the trading mechanism, it was impossible to immediately sell the stocks. People can only look at the k-line graph with tears coursed down the cheeks.\nIn addition, there is still a limit to the rise and fall of stock market. If a stock rises or falls more than 10% in a day, the stock has reached the peak of the daily rise and fall. While there is no such limit in the Bitcoin market.\nFor example:\nYou have 1 billion and want to invest. If you choose stocks, even though the stock market is good, you would not make more than 100 million a day.\nAnd if you buy bitcoins with all your 1 billion and Bitcoin price skyrockets next day, you would be delightedly to find that the coin you hold could be discounted to 10 billion and you would feel it would not be long before you could be a real millionaire!\nOn the third day when you wake up, because of the serious credit crisis caused by hacker attack, the value of the currency plunged, your 10 billion is only 10 dollars left now, so you could only take the 10 dollars to McDonalds to order two burgers.\n4. Risk & Challenge Difference\nThe higher the risk, the greater the opportunity. All investments are inseparable from risks and opportunities.\nStock, as a kind of security, its value represents people's confidence in the company. As a virtual currency, Bitcoin's value represents people's confidence in the currency.\nAlthough the value of both reflects people's confidence in them, the value of stocks has a better measurement because the listed company as an entity company manifests its own value through its operating condition.\nBitcoin is a virtual currency with no measurable object in its true value. It can be vividly visualized that people gather together to blow a bubble, and no one knows when the bubble will burst, and it is not even clear whether it will be destroyed.\nBut on the other hand, although Bitcoin is highly risky, its potential opportunity is also enormous. What can it ultimately achieve? No one dares to make a prediction.\nIn conclusion, there are actually many differences between stocks and bitcoins which look similar. But as an investment, they have something in common: risk and return are always accompanied by each other. The stock market is risky, while Bitcoin is much riskier. As an emerging currency, the future of Bitcoin is full of unknown. Is it heaven or hell ahead? We will see what happens.\n submitted by /u/LifeWowLHP to u/LifeWowLHP\n[link] [comments]\nfrom reddit.com: search results – challenge coins https://ift.tt/2sfLOXU\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "avoid investment traps", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:31:58.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abff333a77035d30365a582e89efb8118a0e0342", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va79.Kc4B9NJ5iHtE.8._cnBNBR0MOTVo5uXauRTGkOwZpemLN5N333KPV1gVE7QoCmQ--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "How to use bitcoin testnet wallet", "title_full": "How to use bitcoin testnet wallet", "published": "2018-05-26T17:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abff333a77035d30365a582e89efb8118a0e0342", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va79.Kc4B9NJ5iHtE.8._cnBNBR0MOTVo5uXauRTGkOwZpemLN5N333KPV1gVE7QoCmQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Happy ITWala", "published": "2018-05-26T17:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to use bitcoin testnet wallet", "text": "8 2 bumped to the homepage by Community ♦ 9 hours ago\nThis question has answers that may be good or bad; the system has marked it active so that they can be reviewed.

I did transaction more than 12 hours ago. Aahh! But I see your point, my Bitcoin core is yet far behind and thus may have not seen the transaction. Let me wait for it to finish synchronizing. – Happy ITWala Apr 24 at 6:05 Yes, you won't see it until synchronization is finished. I think that's the issue. If so, could you either delete this question, or else post your own answer and accept it (click the check mark)? This site tends to get quite cluttered by unanswered questions. – Nate Eldredge Apr 24 at 14:12 (I see you have a few other questions with answers that you haven't accepted - it would be good to either do that, or else leave a comment explaining why it doesn't resolve your issue. The site will continually bump questions whose answers aren't upvoted or accepted.) – Nate Eldredge Apr 24 at 14:13 Thanks Nate. Yeah, I am bit of newbie on stack exchange. I see your point.

Es posible gracias a la criptografía de última tecnologia y un protocolo de hash llamado SHA-256\nLo que se traduce en, gente muy inteligente, talentosa y poderosa trabajando en este proyecto.\nLas transferencias de Bitcoin son irreversibles y funcionan igual que el dinero en efectivo, no hay intermediarios como sucede en paypal o con las tarjetas de credito\nEsto garantiza que los bitcoin son enviados de persona a persona instantáneamente a través de una red de Internet\ntener un bitcoin es asi de seguro, imagínate que abres tu billetera y cada billete que tienes está protegido por 100 candaditos únicos que solo se desbloquean con cada pago que decides hacer voluntariamente\nY lo más importante: ¿Como ganar bitcoins para ti?\nAqui comienza lo verdaderamente bueno de este tutorial. Asi que preparate porque te voy a enseñar una forma completamente innovadora y descentralizada de trabajar por Internet y crear proyectos altamente productivos y rentables\nTe voy a mostrar todas las alternativas que tienes para comenzar a ganar bitcoins, y te voy a enseñar cómo almacenarlos de las formas mas seguras que existen, y tambien que aprendas a comerciar con ellos\npero antes voy a poner a volar tu imaginación por unos instantes, ponme atencion\nrecuerdas que te dije que los tokens suman 21 millones de bitcoins verdad?\ncada token se llama satoshi y un solo bitcoin se puede dividir en 100 millones de unidades (tokens) osea de satoshis. Si te regalo un bitcoin puedes enviar cantidades tan pequeñas como 10 mil satoshis a miles de personas\nImaginate que alguien te regala 10 mil satoshis, te aconsejo que los cuides muy bien, ya que en la actualidad 10 mil satoshis equivalen aproximadamente a 1$ dólar con 35 centavos que no es mucho\npero imaginate que su precio en unos meses suba a los 100 mil dólares(cada bitcoin), ahora cada satoshi o token que tienes, va a aumentar su valor y tendrás ganados 5 veces ese valor osea mas de 6 $ dólares\nEn conclusión: toda esta tecnología matemática puede ser algo complicada, pero lo que significa en la práctica es que Bitcoin puede hacerte millonario y cambiar el mundo tal cual lo conocemos\nParte 1 Cómo almacenar los Bitcoins de forma segura\nSi ya estas decidido a ganar muchos bitcoins este año debes pensar en las mejores formas de almacenarlos, que sean prácticas, seguras y acordes a cada situación.\nBilleteras en la nube: Los wallet como blockchain.info, xapo, o coinbase son billeteras que puedas usar para almacenar tus bitcoins, estas se alojan en Internet y funcionan parecido a paypal, inicias sesión y puedes enviar y recibir pagos de bitcoin\nBilleteras de Hardware: Las billeteras de Hardware ofrecen altos niveles de privacidad y seguridad, sus bitcoins son recibidos y almacenados en un dispositivo USB de clase HID y sus llaves privadas se mantienen secretas\nBilleteras Móviles: Las billeteras móviles como Bitcoin Wallet son seguras y descentralizadas, la aplicación es una buena elección para gente sin conocimientos técnicos que quiera almacenar, enviar y recibir BTC (Bitcoins)\nBilleteras de escritorio: Si tienes computadora con mucha capacidad y memoria, puedes descargar el nucleo completo de toda la red de bitcoin. Y almacenar tus bitcoins en tu propia computadora. Sin embargo no es tan fácil de usar como las billeteras de App o los wallet en la nube. Pero si mucho mas segura\nBilleteras de papel:\nMi preferida, toda esta era de gran tecnología y dispositivos lujosos. Se resume para mi a una hoja de papel. No me importa si se cae el Internet, si destruyen mi computadora o si roban todos mis correos y cuentas\nTengo todos mis bitcoins en mi billetera, doblados en una hoja de papel. Y las claves privadas enterradas 10 metros bajo tierra en una montaña que solo conozco yo.\njajaja, bueno estoy exagerando un poco. Pero bueno, es verdad, si tienes mas de 1 bitcoin te recomiendo almacenarlos de la forma más segura. En una billetera de papel\nAprende como:\n- Abre la pagina https://www.bitaddress.org/ espera que cargue bien, y luego apaga el modem de Internet.

Slowly but surely it’s becoming easier to spend BTC, BCH, and a range of other cryptos throughout the continent, with payment services like Wirex and Paytomat leading the charge. It’s now possible to spend bitcoin in hundreds of restaurants and stores throughout Eastern Europe, as well as anywhere that accepts Visa in the whole of mainland Europe and the UK.\nAlso read: SA Central Bank Comes Up With Another Nickname for Cryptos – “Cyber Tokens” Wirex Rolls Out Its New Crypto Debit Cards\nWhen crypto debit cards were cancelled in Europe last year, with a Visa subsidiary to blame, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency holders were left clutching worthless pieces of plastic. But as crypto companies have forged new alliances with payment processors, crypto debit cards have started to return, and hopefully this time they’re here to stay. In the past two weeks, Wirex has begun dispatching physical cards to UK and mainland European customers who were on its waiting list. News.Bitcoin.com had a chance to put one of the cards to the test, topping it up with BTC and then spending it in-store and online, and was impressed with the results. Processing a cryptocurrency payment with Paytomat\nA full review of the Wirex crypto debit card follows below, after a quick look at what Paytomat have been up to. The cryptocurrency payment system supports 11 cryptos including bitcoin cash and zencash, and has support from over 330 restaurants and stores at present, mostly in Eastern Europe. It’s since expanded into Western Europe, however, with a launch that took place in an Amsterdam soup kitchen earlier this month.\nPaytomat CEO Yurii Olentir said: “Amsterdam is one of the most crypto-friendly places, so we chose it for our kick-off in Western Europe. With millions of tourists visiting every month, cryptocurrencies can be a very convenient payment method. For example, a transaction in Bitcoin Cash takes just a couple of seconds and the fee is miniscule.”\nIn total, Paytomat supports BCH, ZEN, XEM, DASH, WAVES, LTC, ETH, NANO, DCR, XZC and BTC, and as a video demonstration shows, paying for a meal with bitcoin cash is quick and easy: A Quick Look at the Wirex Crypto Card in Action\nI applied for a Wirex card weeks ago, and succeeded after several failed attempts at address verification. At one point I feared I was never going to convince their KYC I lived where I claimed to live, but a stamped bank confirmation letter finally did the trick. The team’s customer support was helpful throughout, to their credit. Last week, Wirex announced that its cards were finally ready to ship. Mine arrived in a beautifully packaged sleeve that folds out to reveal the slogan “The most versatile payments card in the world” accompanied by a heart emoji face.\nIf I thought the presentation was good, the activation turned out to be even slicker. With the Wirex app already installed on my phone, all I had to do was hold the card in proximity to the device and the NFC chip automatically extracted the last four digits of the card and the CVV number. I clicked the verification email link and that was it: my card was good to go. Wirex accepts BTC and LTC, but no BCH or ETH unfortunately. Hopefully they’ll add more cryptocurrency support in due course. For now, I fired over some BTC, and not long afterward a notification informed me that my coins had arrived. A Few Hiccups, But Otherwise Impressive\nFor users who don’t already have cryptocurrency to hand, Wirex enables you to top up your card using your existing bank account; transfers reportedly clear within a few hours. With my BTC loaded, I tried to transfer the balance to GBP so I could spend it, but accidentally swapped into LTC instead; the process is a little confusing. At the second time of asking, I worked out how to complete the swap, and within seconds my litecoin had been exchanged for British pounds. My daughter had been pestering me to buy more reading credits for her iOS app, and so my first £10 of crypto went on purchasing virtual gems.\nI planned to test the card at a restaurant next, but when it came to pay the bill realized that I didn’t know the PIN for the Wirex card, and was forced to use an alternate method to settle up. Back home, I searched through every submenu of the Wirex mobile app and desktop platform to find where the PIN number was located. I got there, eventually, though it wasn’t intuitive at all. This minor grumble aside, the card works perfectly, and there’s even 0.5% in cashback to be earned on all purchases – paid in BTC. Every time you use your Wirex card, you’re credited cashback in satoshis\nNaturally, Wirex make their cut in terms of the exchange rate you’re offered every time you switch from fiat to crypto and vice-versa. This is still preferable to having to cash out crypto through Localbitcoins.com or similar every time you need to spend money in the “real world.” On first impressions, the Wirex card looks very good. My only concern is that now my kids and girlfriend have a direct line to my bitcoin, I fear for my crypto.\nDo you use a crypto debit card and if so what’s your experience of it?

The most workable one came in the form of batching bitcoin transactions, and batching’s popularity has increased in the background of a general bear market that started in early 2018. Technical Underpinnings of Batching\nAt the time, it was noticed that blocks were not used to their fullest potential. This inefficiency led to higher fees across the network. As CCN reported , the Coinbase exchange was called out for dragging their feet on batching, which increased the fees everywhere since Coinbase engaged in massive transaction volume.\nMiners are limited to 2MB worth of transactions per block, which also creates the economic gain for them. Batching relieves fee costs because multiple transactions in a single block take up less space than if they were spread across multiple blocks. Exchanges were congesting the mempool with smaller transactions that weren’t optimized in batches.\nDavid Harding explained the solution in August 2017. While average bitcoin users couldn’t implement batching with bitcoin wallets, the work fell on exchanges to implement batching as “good stewards of the bitcoin network.” Findings on the Batching Adoption Bitcoin Mempool Size | Source: Blockchain.info\nBatching is taking hold gradually, according to a recent analysis .\nWith a time frame starting from November 2017, the analysis looked at total output value of all transactions and separated out batched transactions from unbatched. The increase in batching is not as dramatic when you look at the number of transactions. However, the report’s biggest finding was the increase value amount in btc of the transactions processed as batches.\nIt states:\n“…even though batched transactions make up an average of only 12% of all transactions, they move between 30%-60% of all Bitcoins, at peak times even 70%.”\nThe finding is evidence for a huge stress relief on the network, along with SegWit adoption. As reported last year, the mempool drama let to $700 million being stuck as unconfirmed transactions. As everyone knows, nobody likes it when they are confused about where their money is. While the fiasco had a few issues at play, batching transactions as a custom could help minimize it from happening again if the bitcoin network is ever attacked with fake transactions or another surge of volume.\nExchanges are stepping up to the call, probably helped by the fact that batching helps business.\nAdditionally, in contrast to some in-fighting about the scaling debate, batching stands as an accomplishment for the bitcoin community as a whole. As an organic effort, users put pressure on exchanges and other high-volume users to take up batching, and that pressure appears to be working.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://medium.com/@hasufly/an-analysis-of-batching-in-bitcoin-9bdf81a394e0"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "mempool drama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T18:36:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2830dd8d5157cdf669063c7a42454482efd74a66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS.sDEItbhbo9BeU.juP1SRG17yxlFFLyYlKv.VWydurIdZezy2RKh2iUFD1cwOeNlgo9OrO7MLNwYNBdtYbVCxWJrRD5vsSBy_K1uJraNrL6ccaKDMb8SFmcEtEuMAVsYY-", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Bitcoin backlash as ‘miners’ suck up electricity, stress power grids in Central Washington", "title_full": "Bitcoin backlash as ‘miners’ suck up electricity, stress power grids in Central Washington", "published": "2018-05-26T17:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2830dd8d5157cdf669063c7a42454482efd74a66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS.sDEItbhbo9BeU.juP1SRG17yxlFFLyYlKv.VWydurIdZezy2RKh2iUFD1cwOeNlgo9OrO7MLNwYNBdtYbVCxWJrRD5vsSBy_K1uJraNrL6ccaKDMb8SFmcEtEuMAVsYY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-26T17:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin backlash as ‘miners’ suck up electricity, stress power grids in Central Washington", "text": "Bargain electric rates are attracting digital currency entrepreneurs, but three public utilities districts are reassessing how they deal with the surging demand, and whether they should even try to keep up.

Bchpls is currently in open beta which means the public can test the software at their own discretion, so news.Bitcoin.com decided to test the program’s feature services.\nAlso read: Chinese Exchange Launching Southeast Asian Crypto Trading Hub Giving the New PoS System Bchpls.io a Test Run\nThis week we decided to test out a new PoS system specifically designed for merchants who want to accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at any physical location. The application called Bchpls.io is free, and there are no servers needed as all it takes is an internet connection and two devices (cashier & customer). Merchants can accept the funds into any wallet of their choice and set up the name of their business on the invoice. Funds are sent to a one-time-only address as a new address is used for each sale so incoming revenue is kept private. Setting Up a Store Name and Fiat Currency Pair for Pricing\nWhen entering the website users are greeted with a purple-orange themed page that asks the user to sign up. After hitting the register tab the merchant enters a valid email address and sets a strong password to set up their account. The next screen asks the merchant to add the store name and the fiat currency they wish to use to calculate BCH invoices. Following this step the user has to tether a Bitcoin Cash wallet to the store account and Bchpls uses the Xpub (extended public keys) to generate a receiving address on the cashier side. Tethering a Wallet to Bchpls.io With Extended Public Keys\nUsing the Bitcoin.com Wallet simply create a new wallet with the store’s name and go to the section called “wallet information.” The next screen will reveal the BCH wallet’s Xpub keys, after scrolling down to the bottom. Tap the Xpub section and the Bitcoin.com Wallet will automatically copy and paste the extended public keys. Paste this text into the Bchpls page where it says ‘derivation path,” and hit next.\nAfter that, the merchant is all set, and a page is created which shows information for an access key, cashier screen, and the customer screen. Both screens provide a URL with a QR code created on the invoice page. Unfortunately, there is no address section yet available to copy and paste, as the invoice only supplies a QR code that needs to be scanned.\nAfter the merchant set-up is complete the account holder simply registers a sale on the platform which calculates a new invoice every time. Merchants can also cancel the invoice as well before it is paid just in case there happened to be an error during the process. The Softwares’ Roadmap and Monetization Plans\nThe Bchpls developer explains in the future they plan to monetize by adding custom features or the “ability to operate more than one PoS session at the same time.” Down the line, Bchpls plans to add products management, custom designs, receipts, multiple PoS, and a merchant directory.\nCurrently, the beta program is not open source nor does it offer a client-side (trustless) option but the developer says he will provide these things soon.\n“This is not available on Github at the moment — It is currently a hosted service — The site does not store any private keys or BCH on your behalf,” explains the Bchpls developer. “You provide your Xpub (public key), then any orders made will be made directly to addresses generated from your Xpub.”\nNote that this is not an e-commerce payment gateway solution, it is a POS system for a brick-and-mortar setup. It is also not a solution for people who want automatic settlement into Fiat. It only settles in BCH directly into your wallet — The client-side-only implementation will be open sourced once it is ready.\nBchpls is yet another application that helps promote Bitcoin Cash infrastructure and adoption and most BCH proponents seem to like the platform. Some individuals will likely wait for a more reliable release and others will also wait for a client-side open source version. All in all, Bchpls was extremely easy to set up and any brick-and-mortar business could start using it at their shop.\nWhat do you think about Bchpls.io?

Slowly but surely it’s becoming easier to spend BTC, BCH, and a range of other cryptos throughout the continent, with payment services like Wirex and Paytomat leading the charge. It’s now possible to spend bitcoin in hundreds of restaurants and stores throughout Eastern Europe, as well as anywhere that accepts Visa in the whole of mainland Europe and the UK. Also read: SA Central Bank Comes Up With Another Nickname for Cryptos – “Cyber Tokens” Wirex Rolls Out Its New Crypto Debit Cards When crypto debit cards were cancelled in Europe last year, with a Visa subsidiary to blame, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency holders were left clutching worthless pieces of plastic. But as crypto companies have forged new alliances with payment processors, crypto debit cards have started to return, and hopefully this time they’re here to stay. In the past two weeks, Wirex has begun dispatching physical cards to UK and mainland European customers who were on its waiting list. News.Bitcoin.com had a chance to put one of the cards to the test, topping it up with BTC and then spending it in-store and online, and was impressed with the results. Processing a cryptocurrency payment with PaytomatA full review of the Wirex crypto debit card follows below, after a quick look at what Paytomat have been up to. The cryptocurrency payment system supports 11 cryptos including bitcoin cash and zencash, and has support from over 330 restaurants and stores at present, mostly in Eastern Europe. It’s since expanded into Western Europe, however, with a launch that took place in an Amsterdam soup kitchen earlier this month.\nPaytomat CEO Yurii Olentir said: “Amsterdam is one of the most crypto-friendly places, so we chose it for our kick-off in Western Europe. With millions of tourists visiting every month, cryptocurrencies can be a very convenient payment method. For example, a transaction in Bitcoin Cash takes just a couple of seconds and the fee is miniscule.” In total, Paytomat supports BCH, ZEN, XEM, DASH, WAVES, LTC, ETH, NANO, DCR, XZC and BTC, and as a video demonstration shows, paying for a meal with bitcoin cash is quick and easy:\nA Quick Look at the Wirex Crypto Card in Action I applied for a Wirex card weeks ago, and succeeded after several failed attempts at address verification. At one point I feared I was never going to convince their KYC I lived where I claimed to live, but a stamped bank confirmation letter finally did the trick. The team’s customer support was helpful throughout, to their credit. Last week, Wirex announced that its cards were finally ready to ship. Mine arrived in a beautifully packaged sleeve that folds out to reveal the slogan “The most versatile payments card in the world” accompanied by a heart emoji face. If I thought the presentation was good, the activation turned out to be even slicker. With the Wirex app already installed on my phone, all I had to do was hold the card in proximity to the device and the NFC chip automatically extracted the last four digits of the card and the CVV number. I clicked the verification email link and that was it: my card was good to go. Wirex accepts BTC and LTC, but no BCH or ETH unfortunately. Hopefully they’ll add more cryptocurrency support in due course. For now, I fired over some BTC, and not long afterward a notification informed me that my coins had arrived.\nA Few Hiccups, But Otherwise Impressive For users who don’t already have cryptocurrency to hand, Wirex enables you to top up your card using your existing bank account; transfers reportedly clear within a few hours. With my BTC loaded, I tried to transfer the balance to GBP so I could spend it, but accidentally swapped into LTC instead; the process is a little confusing. At the second time of asking, I worked out how to complete the swap, and within seconds my litecoin had been exchanged for British pounds. My daughter had been pestering me to buy more reading credits for her iOS app, and so my first £10 of crypto went on purchasing virtual gems.\nI planned to test the card at a restaurant next, but when it came to pay the bill realized that I didn’t know the PIN for the Wirex card, and was forced to use an alternate method to settle up. Back home, I searched through every submenu of the Wirex mobile app and desktop platform to find where the PIN number was located. I got there, eventually, though it wasn’t intuitive at all. This minor grumble aside, the card works perfectly, and there’s even 0.5% in cashback to be earned on all purchases – paid in BTC. Every time you use your Wirex card, you’re credited cashback in satoshisNaturally, Wirex make their cut in terms of the exchange rate you’re offered every time you switch from fiat to crypto and vice-versa. This is still preferable to having to cash out crypto through Localbitcoins.com or similar every time you need to spend money in the “real world.” On first impressions, the Wirex card looks very good. My only concern is that now my kids and girlfriend have a direct line to my bitcoin, I fear for my crypto. Do you use a crypto debit card and if so what’s your experience of it?

Reports about these promising developments in the labor market and the public sector come from Australia. Also, the Slovak tax authority intends to use blockchain technology for more efficient tax collection. Also read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash Crypto-Based Hiring Platform Supports Instant Pay Option A new employment service offers to cut out banks and pay workers in real-time using cryptocurrency. Another feature will rate employees using a blockchain-based reputation and review process, designed to ensure that higher quality work gets paid better. The “Pay As You Go” system has been launched recently in Australia. Sergei Sergienko, the entrepreneur behind the project, claims that instant salary payments are possible with cryptos, tokens, and thanks to the underlying technology – blockchain. His “global job platform” Laborx is developed to do exactly that – pay employees while they are working, so that everyone can start spending on the way home. “The way for people to be remunerated is based on pre-Industrial Revolution kind of wages – you spend the time in the factory, and you get paid,” he said, quoted by Business Insider Australia. “If you look around, everything else has changed. And it’s really, really weird that the way people get paid for their services, for their time, for their work, has not gone through any revolution of sorts,” Sergienko noted.\nThe businessman, who owns a successful labor hire, staffing and training company called the Edway Group, believes that the revolution comes in the form of the “Labour-Hour Tokens” (LHT) and the hiring ecosystem of Laborx, which is now live in beta version. Using it, companies can hire anyone – from top experts from around the world, to local fruit pickers – and pay them instantly with cryptocurrency. “A fair hour’s pay for a fair hour’s work” has been promised. Laborx also features a tokenized reputation system. Its developers say that it combines dozens of candidate data points and stores the information on a blockchain. The platform is said to ensure job seekers get their best market rate, while also eliminating payment delays and disputes. “If your reviews are consistently good, you can charge more per hour for your services. And the person who hires you knows you’re worth it,” Sergei Sergienko explains. Other cryptocurrency projects to be trialing this model include time-based “knowledge transfer” service Whenhub, founded by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. Distributed Ledger to Be Used For Welfare Delivery While the private sector has been developing a crypto-hiring platform, Australian authorities have been planning to employ blockchain technology to improve the welfare payments delivery in the country. The intentions were made public recently by the Digital Transformation Agency, a government body tasked with the digitization of public services and government institutions. The project to put social security payments on blockchain will pilot the wider implementation of the technology. “Our plan is to look for use cases across the Commonwealth with an initial focus on the welfare payment delivery system. Then, working with our digital service standard, we’ll conduct user research with a view to having a prototype by the end of next financial year,” said DTA’s acting CEO Randall Brugeaud during the Cebit Australia conference in Sidney last week. Recently, The DTA received AU$700,000 from the 2018-19 budget to probe the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the public sector. Brugeaud commented that the funds will give his agency an opportunity to explore innovative ways to securely and efficiently deliver government services using blockchain. Slovak Tax Authority Eyes Blockchain for Efficient Collection The Financial Administration of Slovakia aims to become a pioneer in blockchain technology implementation. The tax authority in Bratislava intends to use it to streamline its processes and procedures. The main objective is to make tax collection more efficient, the president of Finančná Správa, František Imrecze told Hospodárske Noviny. The technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, will be implemented in Slovakia’s taxation system to initially process about 2 percent of all tax payments, the publication details. The use of blockchain technologies is expected to increase the trust of taxpayers and protect their personal data. Authorities also hope to increase the transparency of tax collection, reduce red tape and minimize costs, Imrecze explained. Members of the local crypto community and the non-government sector are not sure about the prospects of the project. According to Martin Lindák, analyst with the liberal think-tank F. A. Hayek Foundation, the transparency and security of blockchain applications are there only when they are decentralized. A blockchain lacking this key feature would be just an overpriced database for the public administration, Lindák warned in conversation with the newspaper.

This project will satisfy my course requirements but will also be presented by me at an upcoming Seoul Bitcoin meetup in early July.My presentation will mainly be centered on the following components but will will also include how Bitcoin works by the nature of these components:1) Teaching about Bitcoin can help learners understand and take interest in: economics, game theory, information theory, privacy and censorship, ethics, politics, cryptography, coding (explanation of how it’s true and why it’s important)2) How to teach about Bitcoin (what to start with and steps through the process & useful methods/activities/analogies)My goal is to explain how teaching about Bitcoin can be a valuable educational tool. I’d appreciate any of your thoughts, experiences, resources (links, video, images, Ppts).Title: Bitcoin: A Cross-Curriculum Education ToolFormat: PowerPoint PresentationExigency: Bitcoin is something I have grown to love studying and teaching about. It encompasses aspects of my childhood education that I have always disliked, yet which I now enjoy. I believe Bitcoin can serve as a strong educational tool to motivate and educate young learners, garnering interest in important fields that are often taught with little real world application. Bitcoin can solve those teaching woes because it is shockingly brilliant.Audience: My audience will be learners (high school and up) who know little to nothing beyond having heard the word “Bitcoin”, but who are willing to learn about it and open to the possibility that it might be a good for it to be used as an educational tool to possibly incorporate into a classroom curriculum.Constraints: There are perhaps too many aspects of Bitcoin to explain, yet they are all important to the system. Some parts are very technical, and it will be challenging to find a balance between explaining certain things at a surface level and diving deep into the technical details.Thanks in advance via /r/Bitcoin https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8m994q/bitcoin_educators_why_is_it_important_and/?utm_source=ifttt ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:06:16.067+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d35116ba48fae5db1a31c2c7c1ba657850d347e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUYss612RTIRV1exIPe1bhsZ.AaNbqF89xAjJW9TZFcPbORnxzI7srwPm9E9LBGTQxp5LmQUSNpZXKKlc5H7a_cVl6uJPqTROFs32szydkmUc", "site_full": "alterminds.xyz", "site": "alterminds.xyz", "site_section": "http://alterminds.xyz/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Alter Minds", "title": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "title_full": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "published": "2018-05-26T17:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d35116ba48fae5db1a31c2c7c1ba657850d347e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUYss612RTIRV1exIPe1bhsZ.AaNbqF89xAjJW9TZFcPbORnxzI7srwPm9E9LBGTQxp5LmQUSNpZXKKlc5H7a_cVl6uJPqTROFs32szydkmUc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alter Minds", "published": "2018-05-26T17:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "text": "May 26, 2018 | Crypto\nThe price of Bitcoin has faced unexpected downward pressure in May as Consensus 2018 did not produce enough enthusiasm for a bullish move. Analyst Willy Woo said the virtual currency may only find its upside in Q3/Q4 2018. Until then, bulls may find bid opportunities at prices as low as $5,500. Bitcoin to Complete Downside At $5,500-$5,700, Analyst Says The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure in 2018 following an extensive race to the top, with Bitcoin breaching the $20,000 level. Traders were expecting the Blockchain Week in New York to trigger a new bullish momentum, but the market lost $52 billion after a disappointing event. Bitcoin stalled below the $10,000 area in early May and has been steadily returning to the 2018 lows. Willy Woo, a BTC technical analyst with 62,500 followers on Twitter, is not very optimistic about where the market is moving next. Woo expects the market to give in to bears for a downswing towards $5500-$5700.\nI think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can’t see $7000 holding. Most likely we’ll balance a bit, then we’ll slide through. Long timeframes here, looking into June for rough timing of this to play out at a best guess. /1 pic.twitter.com/pCN0N97vp6 — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 26, 2018\n“NVT Signal is still too high. We need more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price, or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. To drive up transactional activity in a bear slide is very unlikely IMO”, Woo said, also referring to the extreme market moves. “Volatility is still too high. I’m looking for a sustained low band of volatility which tends to be a signal for the end of the detox and the next accumulation phase. It’s still got some time to ride down.” The BTC analyst argues that his $5500-$5700 prediction is further supported by a high Standard NVT and a Volume Profile cliff below $6800. “When I run the above scenarios against detoxing at a $6800-$7000 floor, it seems a very unlikely path we’ll play out at the $7000 level. This is given the time we need for NVT and volatility to baseline. (…) I don’t necessarily think we’ll fall through the 5000s… sure it’s a possibility but it doesn’t have to. It’s not a repeat, it’s not Mt Gox and Willybot pushing up price with faked orders, we aren’t detoxing from a scam bubble. Technically $5000s is a very strong support band.” The cryptocurrency market in 2018 is more mature compared to 2014 as there no longer “a few whales randomly pushing things around anymore”, which provides a more reliable understanding of price based on fundamentals. Woo says that BTC is not a market on long time frames. Instead, it is an adoption curve (climb, consolidation, climb, consolidation). The analyst expects Bitcoin to steadily drop to $6,800 before plunging to $5700, which should be followed by a leveling out of the drop and a flat zone. The next bullish momentum should come in Q3/Q4 2018, according to Woo.

Look at These 3 Companies First", "text": " About to Buy Bitcoin? Look at These 3 Companies First\nBitcoin was a joyride for early investors, as the cryptocurrency surged from less than $100 earlier in the decade to more than $19,000 last December. However, the digital coin has fallen to around $7,500 since then as the hype and speculation around it seem to have peaked. At the same time, Google searches for “bitcoin” have also dropped sharply since December.\nWhile crypto fans may be unfazed, the majority of the market seems to have moved on. If you’re considering buying bitcoin for the high upside potential it exhibited last year, you may be better off with this group of stocks, which all have the potential to deliver big returns. Keep reading to see why our panel of Motley Fool investors recommendPayPal(NASDAQ:PYPL),Yelp(NYSE:YELP), and Trivago(NASDAQ:TRVG).\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe pioneer in online payments\nLeo Sun (PayPal): PayPal, which was spun off of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015, popularized digital payments long before bitcoin became relevant. Unlike its industry peer Square (NYSE:SQ), PayPal refuses to add bitcoin transactions to its platform, saying that volatile prices make bitcoin unsuitable for payments.\nPayPal’s core business is rapidly growing. It’s posted double-digit sales growth every quarter since its spinoff, and analysts expect revenue to rise 17% this year (despite eBay’s decision to gradually part ways with PayPal by 2023). Its earnings are expected to rise 23% this year.\nLast quarter, PayPal’s revenue rose 24% annually, while its total payments volume (TPV) rose 27% to $132 billion on a constant currency basis — supported by 30% growth in merchant services TPV, 50% growth in peer-to-peer payments (thanks to its subsidiary Venmo), and 52% growth in mobile payment volumes.\nIts total number of transactions climbed 25% to 2.2 billion, as its total number of transactions per active account rose 8% to 34.7 over the past 12 months. Its new active accounts rose 35% annually. Those robust growth figures indicate that PayPal continues to gain steam as an international digital payments platform — which is now available in 202 countries and 25 currencies. PayPal also recently acquired Square’s rival iZettle for $2.2 billion to expand its reach into mobile point-of-sale systems.\nPayPal’s stock isn’t cheap at 35 times this year’s earnings. But it’s arguably a smarter play on a cashless and cardless future than bitcoin.\nTake advantage of Yelp’s pullback\nSteve Symington (Yelp): Bitcoin investors are all too familiar with unexpected pullbacks. So if you’re considering buying some of the popular cryptocurrency, you might appreciate taking a look at Yelp instead. When Yelp announced strong quarterly resultsearlier this month — posting higher-than-expected revenue and narrowing its per-share losses — it seemed strange at first to see shares of the local business-review website fall almost 8% in response.\nBut more important to Wall Street was the underlying source of that quarterly beat. While Yelp’s impressive results were driven by accelerating advertising revenue growth — ad sales climbed 20% year over year to $214 million, comprising the vast majority of its total revenue — that acceleration came as a result of the company’s adoption of non-term advertising contracts. Put simply, Wall Street wants to see whether newer advertisers will stick around, especially those that are trying Yelp for the first time precisely because of those more flexible contracts.\nTo be fair, Yelp’s co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman admitted during this quarter’s call that the company is going “through this change with a bit of caution about what we may see in the coming months.” But Yelp management also insisted the move is a concerted effort, preceded by nearly two years of testing, followed by a broader ramp up in the new contracts that began in the third quarter of 2017.\nTo that end, Yelp was comfortable enough with the sustainability of this shift to modestly increase its full-year guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Alas, the market would have none of it.\nBut if Yelp can prove to investors that its accelerated ad growth is good for more than just a single quarter’s outperformance, I think the stock will soar.\nA promising turnaround candidate\nJeremy Bowman (Trivago):Like bitcoin, Trivago shares have also tumbled in recent months. After the stock surged following its IPO in December 2016 as it was spun off fromExpedia, it’s now given up more than 80% since last July.\nThat decline has come largely due to Booking Holdings’ decision to scale back on advertising on the platform, focusing on profitability rather than market share, which had the effect of making Trivago’s revenue decline 3% year over year in the first quarter as comps were unfavorable, with Booking still on the platform a year ago.\nThe hotel-booking specialist is now projecting flat revenue for the year. However, the company should return to growth as it laps the issues with Booking Holdings, and it expects revenue to increase in the second half of the year.\nThe online travel industry is still growing steadily, and Allied Market Research projects it will grow at a compound annual rate of 11.1% from 2016 to 2022. Trivago’s exclusive focus on hotels should give it an advantage over more-diversified platforms, and as consumer awareness of the platform improves, it should outgrow the overall industry.\nAt this point, the stock looks oversold, as the current weakness is temporary. The stock could easily double from here once revenue growth accelerates again. This entry was posted in Bank Stocks on by admin .

The kidnappers are demanding ransom be paid in bitcoin.\nSouth African schoolboy Katlego Marite, 13, was snatched by a gang in the eastern province of Mpumalanga on Sunday. The kidnappers are demanding a ransom be paid in bitcoin.\nLagos, Nigeria (CNN) — A group of South African kidnappers who snatched a 13-year-old boy as he played with friends have demanded a $120,000 ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency, police say.\nPolice say Katlego Marite was taken by three men in a car as he played with two friends near his home in the eastern province of Mpumalanga.\nPolice spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told CNN the incident in the coal-mining city of Witbank was over in minutes and the abductors seemed to make a beeline for Maria\n\"His friends reported that these were full grown men who just went for him and grabbed him into the car and dropped a ransom note. They demanded that his parents should pay a ransom in bitcoins.\"\nHlathi said the sum demanded was 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash.\nA copy of the ransom note was also posted on several social media accounts.\nThe kidnappers warn the parents not to involve the police, saying: \"We have your child. Your child will not be harmed if the following demands are met.\"\nThe note asks the boy's family to pay 1 bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27. The family has yet to pay any of the ransom, Hlathi said.\nBitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets.\nThe ransom note also included information about a wallet to which to send the payment\nHlathi said the case was puzzling as Marite's parents are not wealthy and do not know what bitcoin currency is.\nHe added that he was not aware of any other ransom demands for bitcoins or any virtual currency in South Africa.\nAlthough South Africa has a high crime rate, Hlathi said Witbank is a mining area where kidnapping is not frequent.\nIn December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than one million in bitcoins for releasing their victim -- an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange, according to a report from Reuters news agency.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leonard hlathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katlego marite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mpumalanga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "witbank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T16:58:07.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a2cb8797b6148544db86064d474b86cac09c0a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL2hbWBT3oWTb_pZg55r6_l2t_feSK1yyOqc86SNbaCXKSaFtJF5Syb8v3UjwDG9g39evMruLXNmbFraTQYOEWo345h6YR9hcGQOBFA2lNtg--", "site_full": "forumrun.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://forumrun.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Форум Видео 2017", "title": "Live trading.

He is ready to take the risk of coming to the Russian Federation,” Musatov said.\nVinnik was arrested in the resort area in northern Greece in July. If Washington’s request for extradition is granted, Vinnik may face up to 55 years behind bars for the charges brought against him.

He is ready to take the risk of coming to the Russian Federation,” Musatov said.\nVinnik was arrested in the resort area in northern Greece in July. If Washington’s request for extradition is granted, Vinnik may face up to 55 years behind bars for the charges brought against him. The suspect denies wrongdoing and says the case is a US set-up.\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://ria.ru/interview/20180526/1521380884.html", "https://www.rt.com/news/426658-russian-vinnik-security-prison/", "https://ria.ru/interview/20171116/1508928184.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aleksandr vinnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vinnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "musatov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timofey musatov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ria novosti", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thessaloniki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:03:02.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c031090f47c66d736d435e3851e459d730943c9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRxSHdT.9W6Y4b7zkgcy7JdTmcNj.iYcDlKEJ64ypUxEa5nWHKbWzoi", "site_full": "online.gambling.org", "site": "gambling.org", "site_section": "http://online.gambling.org/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Online.Gambling.org", "title": "Betting on Bitcoin", "title_full": "Betting on Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-26T16:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c031090f47c66d736d435e3851e459d730943c9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRxSHdT.9W6Y4b7zkgcy7JdTmcNj.iYcDlKEJ64ypUxEa5nWHKbWzoi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-26T16:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Betting on Bitcoin", "text": "\nBitcoin has been the topic of much media attention these last couple of years and people are lining up to bet on Bitcoin in many different ways. The first and most obvious way that people are betting on Bitcoin is through the BTC markets where you can bet on the price of bitcoin itself. In 2017 the price of Bitcoin rose from just under $1,000 at the start of the year to almost $20,000 at its peak price in December. Clearly 2017 was a good year to bet long on Bitcoin. 2018 has been a different story so far, however, as the price has since seen a steady decline down to the current levels of around $7,500 per BTC.\nBitcoin futures were introduced in December 2017 which created a new way for people to bet on Bitcoin. In the BTC futures market investors buy or sell futures contracts which is essentially the same thing as betting on the future price of Bitcoin. Before the futures market was introduced it was difficult for investors to bet against the price of Bitcoin or bet short. The futures market now makes it much easier to short Bitcoin and the price has seen a major pullback in the process.\nBitcoin gambling is another way that people are betting on Bitcoin . Bitcoin casinos are online casinos that allow gamblers to bet with BTC instead of fiat currencies. Some of the most notable Bitcoin casino sites are hybrid casinos that allow deposits and withdrawals in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. These hybrid casinos are likely to become the future of Bitcoin gambling and possibly even the future of the entire online gambling industry.\nCasino gamblers looking for a Bitcoin casino to gamble with can find a guide to the best bitcoin gambling sites at the all new Gambling.site . This guide with bitcoin casino reviews lists popular gambling websites for betting at casinos with Bitcoin (BTC).\nSo if betting on BTC is something that you would like to do then you have many different ways to gamble with Bitcoin. Just remember that BTC is very volatile in its nature and bitcoin betting is not for the faint of heart.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoin.org/", "https://gambling.site/best-bitcoin-gambling-sites/", "http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/bitcoin-futures.html", "https://vrslots.io/bitcoin-casinos/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin  bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:51:11.065+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e018f34e89b0d3ef4929a50708348c3bf8fb017", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtGcMc4qJ5blN6XkRUdK6Ipc_oWfix_RCLawiwiV7.Qk_0fmQQWVu1rGOQl_MgkrXXkRhLnZMUWwSEcLA54U9bCn3_C0Yur4x11qcqB4b0eusQ--", "site_full": "www.startup365.fr", "site": "startup365.fr", "site_section": "http://www.startup365.fr/feed/", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Startup 365", "title": "#Blockchain Spending Bitcoin in Europe Is Getting Easier Thanks to Wirex and Paytomat", "title_full": "#Blockchain Spending Bitcoin in Europe Is Getting Easier Thanks to Wirex and Paytomat", "published": "2018-05-26T16:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/paytomat-cryptocurrency-bch-768x769.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e018f34e89b0d3ef4929a50708348c3bf8fb017", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtGcMc4qJ5blN6XkRUdK6Ipc_oWfix_RCLawiwiV7.Qk_0fmQQWVu1rGOQl_MgkrXXkRhLnZMUWwSEcLA54U9bCn3_C0Yur4x11qcqB4b0eusQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Startup365", "published": "2018-05-26T16:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "#Blockchain Spending Bitcoin in Europe Is Getting Easier Thanks to Wirex and Paytomat", "text": "#Blockchain Spending Bitcoin in Europe Is Getting Easier Thanks to Wirex and Paytomat Posted on by Startup365\nEuropean cryptocurrency holders have reason to be cheerful. Slowly but surely it’s becoming easier to spend BTC, BCH, and a range of other cryptos throughout the continent, with payment services like Wirex and Paytomat leading the charge. It’s now possible to spend bitcoin in hundreds of restaurants and stores throughout Eastern Europe, as well as anywhere that accepts Visa in the whole of mainland Europe and the UK.\nAlso read: SA Central Bank Comes Up With Another Nickname for Cryptos – “Cyber Tokens” Wirex Rolls Out Its New Crypto Debit Cards\nWhen crypto debit cards were cancelled in Europe last year, with a Visa subsidiary to blame, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency holders were left clutching worthless pieces of plastic. But as crypto companies have forged new alliances with payment processors, crypto debit cards have started to return, and hopefully this time they’re here to stay. In the past two weeks, Wirex has begun dispatching physical cards to UK and mainland European customers who were on its waiting list. News.Bitcoin.com had a chance to put one of the cards to the test, topping it up with BTC and then spending it in-store and online, and was impressed with the results. Processing a cryptocurrency payment with Paytomat\nA full review of the Wirex crypto debit card follows below, after a quick look at what Paytomat have been up to. The cryptocurrency payment system supports 11 cryptos including bitcoin cash and zencash, and has support from over 330 restaurants and stores at present, mostly in Eastern Europe. It’s since expanded into Western Europe, however, with a launch that took place in an Amsterdam soup kitchen earlier this month.\nPaytomat CEO Yurii Olentir said: “Amsterdam is one of the most crypto-friendly places, so we chose it for our kick-off in Western Europe. With millions of tourists visiting every month, cryptocurrencies can be a very convenient payment method. For example, a transaction in Bitcoin Cash takes just a couple of seconds and the fee is miniscule.”\nIn total, Paytomat supports BCH, ZEN, XEM, DASH, WAVES, LTC, ETH, NANO, DCR, XZC and BTC, and as a video demonstration shows, paying for a meal with bitcoin cash is quick and easy: A Quick Look at the Wirex Crypto Card in Action\nI applied for a Wirex card weeks ago, and succeeded after several failed attempts at address verification. At one point I feared I was never going to convince their KYC I lived where I claimed to live, but a stamped bank confirmation letter finally did the trick. The team’s customer support was helpful throughout, to their credit. Last week, Wirex announced that its cards were finally ready to ship. Mine arrived in a beautifully packaged sleeve that folds out to reveal the slogan “The most versatile payments card in the world” accompanied by a heart emoji face.\nIf I thought the presentation was good, the activation turned out to be even slicker. With the Wirex app already installed on my phone, all I had to do was hold the card in proximity to the device and the NFC chip automatically extracted the last four digits of the card and the CVV number. I clicked the verification email link and that was it: my card was good to go. Wirex accepts BTC and LTC, but no BCH or ETH unfortunately. Hopefully they’ll add more cryptocurrency support in due course. For now, I fired over some BTC, and not long afterward a notification informed me that my coins had arrived. A Few Hiccups, But Otherwise Impressive\nFor users who don’t already have cryptocurrency to hand, Wirex enables you to top up your card using your existing bank account; transfers reportedly clear within a few hours. With my BTC loaded, I tried to transfer the balance to GBP so I could spend it, but accidentally swapped into LTC instead; the process is a little confusing. At the second time of asking, I worked out how to complete the swap, and within seconds my litecoin had been exchanged for British pounds. My daughter had been pestering me to buy more reading credits for her iOS app, and so my first £10 of crypto went on purchasing virtual gems.\nI planned to test the card at a restaurant next, but when it came to pay the bill realized that I didn’t know the PIN for the Wirex card, and was forced to use an alternate method to settle up. Back home, I searched through every submenu of the Wirex mobile app and desktop platform to find where the PIN number was located. I got there, eventually, though it wasn’t intuitive at all. This minor grumble aside, the card works perfectly, and there’s even 0.5% in cashback to be earned on all purchases – paid in BTC. Every time you use your Wirex card, you’re credited cashback in satoshis\nNaturally, Wirex make their cut in terms of the exchange rate you’re offered every time you switch from fiat to crypto and vice-versa. This is still preferable to having to cash out crypto through Localbitcoins.com or similar every time you need to spend money in the “real world.” On first impressions, the Wirex card looks very good. My only concern is that now my kids and girlfriend have a direct line to my bitcoin, I fear for my crypto.\nDo you use a crypto debit card and if so what’s your experience of it?

have reason to be cheerful. Slowly but surely it’s becoming easier to spend BTC, BCH, and a range of other cryptos throughout the continent, with payment services like Wirex and Paytomat leading the charge. It’s now possible to spend bitcoin in hundreds of restaurants and stores throughout Eastern Europe, as well as anywhere that accepts Visa in the whole of mainland Europe and the UK.\nAlso read: SA Central Bank Comes Up With Another Nickname for Cryptos – “Cyber Tokens”\nWirex Rolls Out Its New Crypto Debit Cards When crypto debit cards were cancelled in Europe last year, with a Visa subsidiary to blame, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency holders were left clutching worthless pieces of plastic. But as crypto companies have forged new alliances with payment processors, crypto debit cards have started to return, and hopefully this time they’re here to stay. In the past two weeks, Wirex has begun dispatching physical cards to UK and mainland European customers who were on its waiting list. News.Bitcoin.com had a chance to put one of the cards to the test, topping it up with BTC and then spending it in-store and online, and was impressed with the results.\nProcessing a cryptocurrency payment with Paytomat A full review of the Wirex crypto debit card follows below, after a quick look at what Paytomat have been up to. The cryptocurrency payment system supports 11 cryptos including bitcoin cash and zencash, and has support from over 330 restaurants and stores at present, mostly in Eastern Europe. It’s since expanded into Western Europe, however, with a launch that took place in an Amsterdam soup kitchen earlier this month.\nPaytomat CEO Yurii Olentir said: “Amsterdam is one of the most crypto-friendly places, so we chose it for our kick-off in Western Europe. With millions of tourists visiting every month, cryptocurrencies can be a very convenient payment method. For example, a transaction in Bitcoin Cash takes just a couple of seconds and the fee is miniscule.”\nIn total, Paytomat supports BCH, ZEN, XEM, DASH, WAVES, LTC, ETH, NANO, DCR, XZC and BTC, and as a video demonstration shows, paying for a meal with bitcoin cash is quick and easy:\nA Quick Look at the Wirex Crypto Card in Action I applied for a Wirex card weeks ago, and succeeded after several failed attempts at address verification. At one point I feared I was never going to convince their KYC I lived where I claimed to live, but a stamped bank confirmation letter finally did the trick. The team’s customer support was helpful throughout, to their credit. Last week, Wirex announced that its cards were finally ready to ship. Mine arrived in a beautifully packaged sleeve that folds out to reveal the slogan “The most versatile payments card in the world” accompanied by a heart emoji face.\nIf I thought the presentation was good, the activation turned out to be even slicker. With the Wirex app already installed on my phone, all I had to do was hold the card in proximity to the device and the NFC chip automatically extracted the last four digits of the card and the CVV number. I clicked the verification email link and that was it: my card was good to go. Wirex accepts BTC and LTC, but no BCH or ETH unfortunately. Hopefully they’ll add more cryptocurrency support in due course. For now, I fired over some BTC, and not long afterward a notification informed me that my coins had arrived.\nA Few Hiccups, But Otherwise Impressive For users who don’t already have cryptocurrency to hand, Wirex enables you to top up your card using your existing bank account; transfers reportedly clear within a few hours. With my BTC loaded, I tried to transfer the balance to GBP so I could spend it, but accidentally swapped into LTC instead; the process is a little confusing. At the second time of asking, I worked out how to complete the swap, and within seconds my litecoin had been exchanged for British pounds. My daughter had been pestering me to buy more reading credits for her iOS app, and so my first £10 of crypto went on purchasing virtual gems.\nI planned to test the card at a restaurant next, but when it came to pay the bill realized that I didn’t know the PIN for the Wirex card, and was forced to use an alternate method to settle up. Back home, I searched through every submenu of the Wirex mobile app and desktop platform to find where the PIN number was located. I got there, eventually, though it wasn’t intuitive at all. This minor grumble aside, the card works perfectly, and there’s even 0.5% in cashback to be earned on all purchases – paid in BTC.\nEvery time you use your Wirex card, you’re credited cashback in satoshis Naturally, Wirex make their cut in terms of the exchange rate you’re offered every time you switch from fiat to crypto and vice-versa. This is still preferable to having to cash out crypto through Localbitcoins.com or similar every time you need to spend money in the “real world.” On first impressions, the Wirex card looks very good. My only concern is that now my kids and girlfriend have a direct line to my bitcoin, I fear for my crypto.\nDo you use a crypto debit card and if so what’s your experience of it?

Part 5", "text": "You guys keep asking, so rather than responding to individual PMs, I'll just post an update here, for those following my portfolio. I think I need to start a blog or something.\nAnyway, the short story is that nothing much changed in my portfolio, and by and large, it still looks like it did a month ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8g795n/what_does_the_portfolio_look_like_from_someone/\nI did not \"buy the dip\". It didnt dip hard enough for that to make sense yet, as the value of my crypto portfolio is still pretty large compared to everything else I own, and this dip didnt make a meaningful difference in that regard. Should bitcoin drop to the $5-6000 range or ethereum below $450, thats when I would start buying in significantly again. Or if I win the lottery and my fiat position suddenly 10 folded, then Id buy some more crypto too :).\nI took some profits in iExec RLC; it went parabolic after the intel partnership announcement, and finally entered the top 100. Anyone who bought RLC because I told them to months ago, you're welcome :). Im still very bullish on it, but it had gone up too fast and had become a larger position than my ethereum. Moreover, many other tokens looked incredibly oversold and I wanted to buy those. So I sold some RLC pretty much at its peak (even managed a small sale @0.0039 ether on idex!) and I put the profits mostly in to buying more Ambrosus and ADA during the panic. Both of which had done very poorly, but both of which are still solid long term holds IMO.\nI also put some really low bids on idex for tokens with a large spread and at the peak of the panic, I picked up some heavily discounted trac, devery, wepower, TE-food, cargo-x and GET.\nFinally, I did buy one new token, I got me some Idex membership tokens. Holding at least 1 token will reduce my fees to zero on idex, and I suspect its value will rise over time if idex becomes more popular. Its already up 20% since I got mine. One tip: you have to withdraw the token from the exchange, and then keep it in your ether wallet for a week before the perks kick in. That 1 week is made clear, but having to withdraw isnt well explained anywhere.\nFiat wise, Im obviously down over the past month, but not that much. More important to me, is that BTC and ether denominated, Im up, and pretty much at a ATH. Well, at least if I constrain \"all time\" to the past 12 months, I dont expect to ever again have as many bitcoins as I had in 2012... Also, a lot of the tokens I hold are small caps, and I would struggle to liquidate them, so take that valuation with a grain of salt.\n submitted by /u/Vertigo722\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T11:38:55.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73fbbf938f14d6ebd6feaee6e060b37d4ce0b35b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbochIk26e0hN9kbHlI2t2mf_I4yKFfFlLFEvn5jlA1oPrgI2YwQ7BTJVQH4BTA0nPXR2S6mfXwnIDo5_0YowepHxoozjn1dLaymvOHiUz95SLXqTdBDNlm", "site_full": "helioscsp.com", "site": "helioscsp.com", "site_section": "http://helioscsp.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HELIOSCSP", "title": "Bitcoin Or Not, Here’s Why Concentrated Solar Power Is The New Nuclear", "title_full": "Bitcoin Or Not, Here’s Why Concentrated Solar Power Is The New Nuclear", "published": "2018-05-26T16:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://helioscsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/U.S.-Department-of-Energy-Solar-Energy-Technologies-Office.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73fbbf938f14d6ebd6feaee6e060b37d4ce0b35b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWbochIk26e0hN9kbHlI2t2mf_I4yKFfFlLFEvn5jlA1oPrgI2YwQ7BTJVQH4BTA0nPXR2S6mfXwnIDo5_0YowepHxoozjn1dLaymvOHiUz95SLXqTdBDNlm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jose Santamarta", "published": "2018-05-26T16:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Or Not, Here’s Why Concentrated Solar Power Is The New Nuclear", "text": "Hydrogen production Energy storage (thermal, electrical, or chemical)\nThe devil is in the details, though. Nuclear advocates are looking for growth hotspots in regions like the Middle East and China ( thanks, Bill Gates! ), where local opposition is not a particularly troublesome obstacle for energy developers.\nThe situation is different in countries like the US, where the ghost of Three Mile Island still lingers over the prospects for renewing the nation’s stock of aging nuclear power plants.\nAside from environmental concerns, the falling cost of renewable resources in the US makes nuclear power look like bad economic policy , to boot.\nThat doesn’t mean nuclear energy will evaporate completely in the US, but it does mean that the prospects for growth are limited.\nMeanwhile, innovative new forms of solar power and other renewables have a good chance of leaping into the breach, . Solar Power As The New Nuclear\nThat’s where solar power comes in. More specifically, that’s where concentrating solar makes an entrance.\nThe US has been a big fan of concentrating solar power despite some earlier criticisms, and the Energy Department is still exploring ways to kick the technology up to the next level.\nThat brings up some interesting comparisons with the development of nuclear energy.\nRecall that the US solar industry got a jumpstart from the space race between Russia and the US, but it took another generation (or more) before the technology found its footing in commercial use on Earth.\nThat kind of trajectory is similar in the nuclear industry, where the nuclear arms race of World War II pumped up the early stage R&D muscle, then it took a while before the technology transferred to civilian energy production.\nCoal was the dominant power source back then, so it was relatively simple to sell nuclear on the basis of high output, high reliability and less air pollution.\nThe problem for nuclear power nowadays is that solar power and other, cleaner options are available.\nThe reliability issue is also becoming a moot issue with the advent of energy storage and smart grid technology.\nAs for high output, the Energy Department just announced a new $72 million round of funding for new high temperature concentrating solar power technology, so let’s take a quick look at one of the teams in that batch. The Falling Particle Factor\nThe new round of funding is split among three teams, which are competing to see who gets to build a new facility for testing new high temperature CSP technology.\nSandia National Laboratories will lead one of the teams with a $10.5 million slice of the funding pie, and earlier this week the lab sketched out its goal:\nCurrent concentrating solar power systems can heat a substance to 565 degrees Celsius. The goal of this new project is to reach temperatures greater than 700 C, which would boost efficiency and lower the cost of electricity generated from concentrating solar power.\nFor those of you new to the topic, CSP involves using specialized mirrors to focus sunlight on a central point. That heats a liquid that can be used to produce steam to generate electricity. The liquid can also double as an energy storage medium, and/or excess electricity can be stored in batteries.\nSandia’s twist is to use ceramic particles as a sand-like medium for trapping solar heat and storing it.\nThe technology is called “falling particle” because the particles are literally dropped through a beam of concentrated sunlight.\nThe advantage is that the ceramic particles are more durable than molten salt, which is the conventional material of choice for CSP :\nThe falling particle receiver developed at Sandia drops sand-like ceramic particles through a beam of concentrated sunlight, and captures and stores the heated particles in an insulated container below. The technique enables operating temperatures of nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius.\nSuch high temperatures translate into greater availability of energy and cheaper storage costs because at higher temperatures, less heat-transfer material is needed.\nAccording to Sandia, the current crop of CSP systems are only about 40% efficient in terms of converting thermal energy to electricity. Falling particle technology could jump that up to 50% — or far more.\nHere’s the outlook from Sandia engineer Cliff Ho, cited in a 2013 Sandia press release:\nOur goal is to develop a prototype falling particle receiver to demonstrate the potential for greater than 90 percent thermal efficiency, achieve particle temperatures of at least 700 degrees Celsius, and be cost competitive. The combination of these factors would dramatically improve the system performance and lower the cost of energy storage for large-scale electricity production.\nThe 2013 leg of the project was initially funded at up to $4 million through former President Obama’s SunShot Initiative, resulting in the successful demonstration of a prototype device.\nHo is still leading the project, and in this week’s press release he explains the next steps:\nWe have demonstrated a prototype for the continuously circulating falling particles, and now we are adding six hours of storage, a 1-megawatt heat exchanger and a particle lift to demonstrate the entire thermal system.\nHo also explains the advantages of ceramic particles:\nWe believe particles are the best option for going to higher temperatures for advanced power cycles. The particles are inexpensive, durable and non-corrosive. They can be stored directly, they don’t freeze and they can reach temperatures over 1000 C.\nSo, onwards and upwards. The Sandia team has two years to hammer out the details, then design a pilot-scale facility and see how it stacks up against the other two teams. The winning team will get another $25 million to construct and operate the facility. Speaking Of Nukes…\nMeanwhile, for those of you familiar with Saudi Arabia’s recent pursuit of nuclear energy , here’s an interesting tidbit: the Sandia CSP team includes King Saud University and the Saudi Electricity Company among its long list of partners. King Saud University was also a partner in the 2013 round.\nAnd, Saudi Arabia is also a partner in what will be the world’s largest PV power plant , so there’s that (wait — bigger than this one ?).\nHmmm, hedging bets, much? If you have any thoughts on where Saudi Arabia is heading with its energy policy, drop us a note in the comment thread.\nCome to think of it, lend us your ideas about bitcoin. Are we locked in a losing game of energy whack-a-mole or can bitcoin go mainstream without consigning us to all but certain doom?\nWe’ve reached out to Sandia to bring you some additional insights into falling particle technology, so stay tuned for more on that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=35192", "https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/20/low-can-solar-go-new-biggest-everything-solar-project-worlds-lowest/", "https://cleantechnica.com/2016/05/03/bill-gates-still-trying-corral-wild-nuclear-unicorn/", "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/30/530708793/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-to-shut-down-in-2019", "https://www.triplepundit.com/2017/10/trump-admin-pours-12-billion-dying-nuclear-energy-project-georgia/", "https://share-ng.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/falling_particle/#.WwPyA8gh21E", "https://share-ng.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/solar_pilot/#.WwOJ8cgh0fN", "https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/26/17144446/saud-arabia-nuclear-weapons-trump-iran-deal", "https://cleantechnica.com/2018/05/16/concentrating-solar-power-gets-a-72-million-never-give-up-never-surrender-moment/", "https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/28/saudi-arabia-softbank-will-partner-to-build-worlds-largest-solar-power-plant/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new nuclear hydrogen", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "three mile island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:09:51.039+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 19108, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=13100", "requestsLeft": 531}
