BTG forums seem to have been tracking the hack, going as far back as last week, monitoring the controversial coin’s hashrate, ultimately determining a 51% attack was under way.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash Bitcoin Gold Gets $18 Million Haircut\n“An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use ‘51% attacks,’” Bitcoin Gold forum poster Mental Nomad announced a week ago, “to perform ‘double spend’ attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.”\nA founding economic principle of bitcoin was its alleviation of the double spend problem. It was a main stumbling block in the historical race to create a viable cryptographic monetary form – foiling a great many coders along the way. Satoshi Nakamoto solved it through a decentralized, distributed ledger confirmation process (blockchain). Going as far back as its genesis block from early 2009, users can be confident transactions aren’t rebroadcast. Like clockwork, 6 times an hour, blocks are added – copied to nodes within the universal network. The offending wallet, according to the BTG team.\nOne way to achieve double spending is known as a 51% attack. It’s accomplished by bogarting the network’s computing power. With a majority, bad actors can get between the Nakamoto solution and transaction confirmations. By stymieing block completion in the usual manner, all sorts of mischief can arise: blockchain mining rewards redirected, users’ transactions reversed, etc. Not too long after, a double spending attack can commence, acting as the fiat equivalent to counterfeiting. Needless to type, any crypto suffering from such a problem is certain to immediately lose user confidence. Such attacks are interesting for another reason, as Mental Nomad is careful to point out. “There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets,” he assured last week. “It appears that actions on the part of the exchanges have deterred the attacker, for now.” And hitting exchanges tends to elicit little sympathy, at least initially, due to users being insulated. Exchanges are particularly vulnerable because they generally covet large deposits, which only compounds the problem in cases like these. GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft\nOver period of days, batches of BTG were deposited into exchanges supporting the forked coin, only to be sent back to the depositor’s wallet. The lag between such a transaction and some exchanges’ discovery is sufficient enough to nab tokens, doubling the filthy lucre. Exchanges trading bitcoin gold have responded by upping transaction confirmation filters, but evidently to no avail as the attacker gains ever-more BTG network control.\nBitcoin Gold team members seem to have communicated with some exchanges. “Requiring more confirmations greatly increases safety,” the forum details. “Until now, some Exchanges were operating with less than five confirmations required. We have been urging higher limits to prevent such an attack, and urging manual review of large deposits of BTG before clearing the funds for trading.” Indeed, according to BTG, “One of the targeted Exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past. In their words, ‘we are 100% sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.’” The traditional way BTC has been able to thwart double spend attacks.\nEvidence put forward by the BTG team points to address GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft as the attacker’s wallet; mined coins, according to the forum post reside at GXXjRkdquAkyHeJ6ReW3v4FY3QbgPfugTx. More than 388,201.92404001 BTG were funneled through the wallet, totalling more than $18 million according to Bitcoin Gold Explorer . That a top thirty crypto by market cap can be so easily troubled is a giant of enough problem, but it could also take exchanges down in the process – something the ecosystem is very sensitive to since Mt. Gox. And though, for now, BTG is confident enough to suggest users are not at risk, history shows that can quickly be the case as an exchange freezes withdrawals in an effort to stop hemorrhaging.\nBitcoin Gold has been beset by controversies since its birth fork late last year, including a recent dust-up between BCH advocate Craig Wright and BTG founder Jack Liao . To be fair, however, it is not the only blockchain to suffer a 51% attack. Mere days ago, recently Chinese government highly rated coin verge (XVG) was made to heel, again. These pages reported XVG, “On the morning of May 22, Suprvona, one of the largest altcoin mining pools, informed its 19,000 Twitter followers that verge was suffering yet another 51% attack, causing all blocks to be rejected.”\nDo you think the BTG hack spells doom for the coin?

The RBZ had also banned banks from processing transactions involving crypto-currency trades.\n“The ban was lifted,” Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya, communications manager at Golix told CCN on Thursday afternoon.\nHe said a statement would follow. However, it has emerged that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe officials, including the governor, John Mangudya, did not turn up for court proceedings. This prompted the High Court in Harare to issue a default ruling that essentially lifted the Zimbabwean central bank’s ban.\n“We are hoping that we can immediately go back to doing business and processing the order book,” said an official.\nGolix had stopped the order book on Thursday as it sought to deal with the disruption to its operations after the central bank ban, the exchange said in a notice to members Thursday morning.\nA Relief to Crypto Traders The news brought relief to bitcoin and other crypto traders and investors in Zimbabwe who were now unable to trade on an exchange platform. Golix runs an online crypto exchange platform as a well as a bitcoin ATM in central Harare.\n“Where is the party,” proclaimed one trader on Telegram as news of the lifting of the ban spread. “RBZ ban on cryptos lifted by the High Court. Administrative justice is alive and well in this jurisdiction. Section 68 of the Constitution is our best friend,” tweeted lawyer, Fadzai Mahere.\nIn its application against the central bank’s move, Golix said “the ban in effect outlaws and classifies as illegal Applicant’s operations”.\n“The Respondents are in fact purporting to classify the trade in cryptocurrency as illegal,” it added.\nRespondents were cited as the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and central bank governor, John Mangudya.\nGolix further argues in its court application that the decision taken by the central bank to ban it from cryptocurrency trading in the country amounts to “lawmaking, a function that belongs to the legislature” and not the central bank.\nAfter banning banks from processing cryptocurrency transactions in the country, the central bank of Zimbabwe subsequently wrote to Golix last week, ordering it to shut down its operations.\n“All cryptocurrency exchange houses operating in the country, including Bitfinance (Private) Limited (also known as Golix), are required to cease all virtual currency exchange operations,” wrote Norman Mataruke, the central bank’s registrar of banking in a letter to Golix dated May 15.\nMataruke also directed that cryptocurrency exchange platforms in Zimbabwe were “required to take all the necessary steps to close the cryptocurrency accounts or ‘wallets’ of your customers and to make good any funds currently held on behalf of customers” trading and investing virtual currencies.\nHarare High Court Order – CCN by CCN on Scribd\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mangudya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhlalwenhle ngwenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golix", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zimbabwe court lifts central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harare high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "harare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golix", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T03:02:03.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6b6089e7f90a46172521852cd5e5cccb9d16948", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZRhO4NEstkl3BOYvOuSDTkOZlk5K.QKVWMJ6aEp3xj7sA--", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Fundstrat’s Lee: Bitcoin is ‘Underappreciated’, Will Reach $25,000", "title_full": "Fundstrat’s Lee: Bitcoin is ‘Underappreciated’, Will Reach $25,000", "published": "2018-05-25T00:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6b6089e7f90a46172521852cd5e5cccb9d16948", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZRhO4NEstkl3BOYvOuSDTkOZlk5K.QKVWMJ6aEp3xj7sA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-25T00:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fundstrat’s Lee: Bitcoin is ‘Underappreciated’, Will Reach $25,000", "text": "Advertisement Get exclusive analysis and cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nThe bitcoin bears may be in control at the moment, but that is not leading one cryptocurrency market strategist to recoil. Fundstrat Global co-founder Thomas Lee is standing firm on his outlook for the bitcoin price to reach USD 25,000 by year-end despite the fact that the leading cryptocurrency has just revisited April lows and slumped to the USD 7,500 threshold.\nThe market drop is serving as an indication that “bitcoin is underappreciated”, Lee said on CNBC, adding that’s why Fundstrat likes it at USD 8,000. He reiterated his top-10 day theory, in which historically all of bitcoin’s annual gains are achieved on the best 10 trading days of the year. Lee reminds investors that “bitcoin doesn’t have to go up in a diagonal line.”\nEven though the broader cryptocurrency market didn’t rally during the Consensus summit last week, it was a clear demonstration of the strong interest in the blockchain, as evidenced by the thousands of people who showed up, which Lee notes is anecdotal evidence that the market is resonating.\n“The notion of blockchain as a way to solve trust in the digital world has gained a lot of traction, especially out of consensus. And what invsetors aren’t conectinng is that you can’t necessarily just say ‘I believe in the blockchain.’ Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are essential to how blockchains operate in the security,” said Lee on CNBC.\nMeanwhile, reports suggest there is a talent shortage of blockchain developers given the robust demand stemming not only from startups but also global corporations looking to integrate the public ledger. For example, Google, which recently extended a job offer to Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin.\nInstitutional Capital to Power Bitcoin Rally Lee acknowledges that bitcoin could be a “scary trade” for investors, given that it has shed more than half its value from its December 2017 highs and that holding at USD 8,000 — which is at-cost for bitcoin mining — could feel “miserable.” What investors should remember, however, is that the market rally is contingent on a couple of milestones being reached in the market, including institutional capital coming off the sidelines and regulation taking shape.\n“Institutional investors have gained a lot of interest and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there’s still some regulatory uncertainty. But that ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies,” said Lee.\nFundstrat’s Lee was forced to eat some crow when a bitcoin rally he predicted for Consensus 2018 didn’t materialize, but he acknowledged that his prediction was “too optimistic.”\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T03:02:01.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5cd3c40075c8ccb6a3e2943a2bf6d46238cce69c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFua177Xskmz1X02bGXZGZaXK.q5KEY5yWiSY1C7cHazDP9F1WrJiqoLS98EKWp5ykfm4MqcBWnuqaSGei5tAjksDxj1umDwhUlgk168cFfLyKaeoY73UiO3AkXVl_dxSt4PPL0OJcyQlfy", "site_full": "www.livemint.com", "site": "livemint.com", "site_section": "http://livemint.com//rss/money", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "money", "title": "Bitcoin price manipulation to be focus of US criminal probe", "title_full": "Bitcoin price manipulation to be focus of US criminal probe - Livemint", "published": "2018-05-25T00:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2018/05/25/Photos/Processed/bitcoin-kSI--621x414@LiveMint.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4429, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5cd3c40075c8ccb6a3e2943a2bf6d46238cce69c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFua177Xskmz1X02bGXZGZaXK.q5KEY5yWiSY1C7cHazDP9F1WrJiqoLS98EKWp5ykfm4MqcBWnuqaSGei5tAjksDxj1umDwhUlgk168cFfLyKaeoY73UiO3AkXVl_dxSt4PPL0OJcyQlfy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Robinson, Tom Schoenberg, Bloomberg", "published": "2018-05-25T00:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price manipulation to be focus of US criminal probe", "text": "Home » Money Bitcoin price manipulation to be focus of US criminal probe The US probe is focused on illegal practices that can influence Bitcoin prices — such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling 04 08 PM IST Matt Robinson, Tom Schoenberg, Bloomberg Bitcoin extended its Thursday declines after the probe report, and was down 3% to $7,409 as of 9:32am London time. It’s down more than 20% since a 4 May peak. Photo: Bloomberg\nNew York, Washington: The US Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up US scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter.\nThe investigation is focused on illegal practices that can influence prices — such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the review is private. Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3% to $7,409 as of 9:32 am London time. It’s down more than 20% since a 4 May peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading — forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise — it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 — has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry.\nSome market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.

It has led to a lot of pushback and even court cases amidst crypto businesses closing.\nIndia’s relationship with Bitcoin is rocky at best, but also confusing and convoluted, and well worth examining as so much has happened in just the past few months.\nBitcoin and blockchain in review India had a very productive 2017 in terms of the growth, adoption, and acceptance of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\nOne of India’s leading trade associations, ASSOCHAM, held a global summit on Bitcoin and blockchain in March 2017.\nIn May 2017, the demand for Bitcoin grew exponentially and abruptly, so much that India’s largest exchanges had to put a limit on Bitcoin purchases due to lack of supply.\nIn June, Zebpay, one of India’s leading Bitcoin exchanges established back in 2012, became the seventh most popular app in the finance category on India’s Apple app store, even higher than the apps of many national banks.\nIn October, it was reported that the major Bitcoin exchanges in India were attracting more than 200,000 new users every month.\nThis was all going on with negative rumbling from the RBI already in the background, as it was issuing warnings throughout the year cautioning people about buying Bitcoin.\nThe rumbling gets louder While there was huge growth and interest from individuals and companies in cryptocurrency and blockchain, the RBI was mostly unswayed, and in the government remained similarly unimpressed.\nIn the hopes of deterring buyers, India’s Ministry of Finance called Bitcoin a ponzi scheme and said it had no intrinsic value, but this was announced only a few days after Bitcoin topped a high of $20,000, and mostly fell on deaf ears.\nBut those warnings started turning into actions as the banking sector took tangible steps to try to slow down Bitcoin’s growth and progress.\nBanks dig in their heels On January 21, 2018, it was reported that a number of major banks in India had suspended or greatly curtailed functionality on exchange accounts.\nState Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank had all taken strong actions against crypto exchanges, either closing accounts or severely limiting functionality. The reason given was the risk of dubious transactions, according to local reports.\nOn February 14, Citibank India banned its customers from using credit cards to purchase cryptocurrencies. It also took the measure one step further by banning the use of debit cards for crypto purchases, Quartz India reported.\nThe move by the banks, coupled with a negative mention about Bitcoin by finance minister Arun Jaitley during his budget speech, had an impact as Bitcoin businesses started feeling the heat and were unprepared to operate in such a negative climate.\nOn February 28, crypto exchanges BTCXIndia and ETHEXIndia then informed their customers via email that they were stopping trading activities, citing the “stress” on their business caused by governmental actions discouraging crypto.\nThis all led up to the RBI’s big announcement of its ‘ban’. They explained in their statement that the move was justified by the associated risks that the government had been warning against all this time.\nThus, it has been decided that, effective immediately, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Regulated entities that already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified timeframe.\nHope remains While the news was seen as semi-positive since it was not a direct ban on cryptocurrencies, it was still a blow for India’s burgeoning cryptocurrency environment.\nHowever, a day after the ‘ban’ was announced, hope was slightly renewed as the RBI also said that it was considering creating its own cryptocurrency. RBI Deputy Governor B.P. Kanungo had some positive things to say about the technology. He told The Times Of India:\n“Technological innovations, including virtual currencies, have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system. We recognize that the Blockchain technology has potential benefits for the financial sector and we believe that they should be encouraged to be exploited for the benefit of the economy.”\nA big backlash Despite the positivity about the technology and the economic potential cryptocurrencies could offer India, the fact of the matter was that the damage was done, and already the fledgling crypto ecosystem was taking hits as exchanges closed.\nThis triggered a backlash from Indian citizens as well as some big crypto-influencers.\nTim Draper, the well-regarded tech investor, called the RBI’s decision a huge mistake and warned that it would drain India of cryptocurrency experts, which it would clearly need if it did see potential in the technology.\nFurthermore, a petition garnered over 17,000 signatures, urging the RBI to reverse its decision on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The reason for signing this petition for many was expressed as:\n“It could lead to an increase of irregular cash trading of cryptocurrencies in India. In addition, the ban could take away potential revenue to the government from crypto exchanges, and instigate a crypto market price drop ‘due to the knee jerk reaction in which prices got impacted.’”\nThis unfortunately was not strong enough to sway the RBI’s decision, which then led to sterner measures being taken.\nLegal intervention On April 22, 2018, the High Court of Delhi reportedly issued a notice to the RBI, the Ministry of Finance, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council alleging that RBI’s decision to end dealings with crypto businesses violates the constitution.\nHowever, as this issue began to climb up the judicial ladder, it was halted when the Supreme Court of India was called upon. On May 12, the Supreme Court declined to grant an interim injunction against the RBI.\nLater on, the Supreme Court came forward again and said that no petitions could be filed in any High Court of India against the RBI crypto decision. This decision will be in place until July, when the Court will set a hearing date for the existing petition on July 20.\nWhat’s happening on the ground floor? For all the rumbling coming out of India from court battles and petitions to these bans on dealing with crypto, it is always important to see how the news is affecting the crypto-users on the ground floor.\nEvan Luthra, an Indian cryptocurrency investor and entrepreneur, spoke to Cointelegraph about what is going on, and how the government is really just looking to play it safe.\n“What most people need to understand is that the views and opinions of a few people in the government don’t make a law,” Luthra told Cointelegraph. “The Indian government is just trying to play it safe and actually bringing light to the whole industry.”\n“The process taken by the government is not the wrong intention. It is for putting a stop to people who are doing scams and running ponzi schemes. The actions taken will only slow down the process but it cannot stop the adoption. That's the beauty of decentralization, that it cannot be stopped or controlled by any central authority. If people choose to adopt Bitcoin, crypto, or Gladage, or any other token, for example, directly without converting into fiat, it will next leap in the industry.”\n“The government has only put a stop to conversion into fiat but they are actively promoting the technology. Even the Prime Minister is going out in public and explains the benefits of adopting the technology. In the coming days things will get much better even on the regulatory side.”\nLuthra’s point, that the government has good intentions, does make sense. However, their implementation is rubbing people the wrong way in the short term. Still, down the line, when this move has cleared away scams and ponzi schemes, perhaps it will be viewed in a better light.\nThe battle rages It is a baffling situation that the Indian cryprocommunity finds themselves in as their central bank is slowing the progress of Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies in general. The government does not have a positive outlook on crypto, but they are not banning it.\nRather it is being choked out by the banking system which is now under pressure from the community, who is involving the courts. India is fighting internally about the future of cryptocurrency with even the banks admitting that there is a lot of promise in the technology.\nThe next step in India’s battle for cryptocurrency legitimacy will come on July 20, when the courts sit down and look over the new petitions, but until then, the cryptocummunity has to try to survive even with the banking squeeze.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoiners", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T03:02:20.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5557158a031d54c55a5dc81b1f80396e98038b94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ5ko8FWCTyIYC0cx5Dvp_k-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Why choose Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why choose Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-25T00:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5557158a031d54c55a5dc81b1f80396e98038b94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ5ko8FWCTyIYC0cx5Dvp_k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NiinaKub", "published": "2018-05-25T00:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why choose Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: Vjatri on May 24, 2018, 02:00:59 PM My point is that why everyone choose Bitcoin there's a lot of top rated coins are available then why people buying Bitcoin most?\nim think people choose bitcoin because they do not really knows about other coins, they are new commers, but when they explore this market more ,then they will sell this coin for better altcoins", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T04:02:49.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1b5d5ee98625ece72dd6c76dc24645493215cb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVCz5x3iRo.W_sS9H7JYX38VdMOlviYB_rrWdZP3chI3IH.sMCspjZ_g--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Nigeria Today", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Hacked for $18 Million", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gold Hacked for $18 Million", "published": "2018-05-25T00:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BTG-probs-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1b5d5ee98625ece72dd6c76dc24645493215cb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVCz5x3iRo.W_sS9H7JYX38VdMOlviYB_rrWdZP3chI3IH.sMCspjZ_g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nigeria Today", "published": "2018-05-25T00:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Hacked for $18 Million", "text": "8874 Bitcoin Gold Hacked for $18 Million\nIt appears Bitcoin Gold (BTG) has been double spend attacked over and over again, totalling something in the neighborhood of $18 million at current prices. BTG forums seem to have been tracking the hack, going as far back as last week, monitoring the controversial coin’s hashrate, ultimately determining a 51% attack was under way.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash Bitcoin Gold Gets $18 Million Haircut\n“An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use ‘51% attacks,’” Bitcoin Gold forum poster Mental Nomad announced a week ago, “to perform ‘double spend’ attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.”\nA founding economic principle of bitcoin was its alleviation of the double spend problem. It was a main stumbling block in the historical race to create a viable cryptographic monetary form – foiling a great many coders along the way. Satoshi Nakamoto solved it through a decentralized, distributed ledger confirmation process (blockchain). Going as far back as its genesis block from early 2009, users can be confident transactions aren’t rebroadcast. Like clockwork, 6 times an hour, blocks are added – copied to nodes within the universal network. The offending wallet, according to the BTG team.\nOne way to achieve double spending is known as a 51% attack. It’s accomplished by bogarting the network’s computing power. With a majority, bad actors can get between the Nakamoto solution and transaction confirmations. By stymieing block completion in the usual manner, all sorts of mischief can arise: blockchain mining rewards redirected, users’ transactions reversed, etc. Not too long after, a double spending attack can commence, acting as the fiat equivalent to counterfeiting. Needless to type, any crypto suffering from such a problem is certain to immediately lose user confidence. Such attacks are interesting for another reason, as Mental Nomad is careful to point out. “There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets,” he assured last week. “It appears that actions on the part of the exchanges have deterred the attacker, for now.” And hitting exchanges tends to elicit little sympathy, at least initially, due to users being insulated. Exchanges are particularly vulnerable because they generally covet large deposits, which only compounds the problem in cases like these. GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft\nOver period of days, batches of BTG were deposited into exchanges supporting the forked coin, only to be sent back to the depositor’s wallet. The lag between such a transaction and some exchanges’ discovery is sufficient enough to nab tokens, doubling the filthy lucre. Exchanges trading bitcoin gold have responded by upping transaction confirmation filters, but evidently to no avail as the attacker gains ever-more BTG network control.\nBitcoin Gold team members seem to have communicated with some exchanges. “Requiring more confirmations greatly increases safety,” the forum details. “Until now, some Exchanges were operating with less than five confirmations required. We have been urging higher limits to prevent such an attack, and urging manual review of large deposits of BTG before clearing the funds for trading.” Indeed, according to BTG, “One of the targeted Exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past. In their words, ‘we are 100% sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.’” The traditional way BTC has been able to thwart double spend attacks.\nEvidence put forward by the BTG team points to address GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft as the attacker’s wallet; mined coins, according to the forum post reside at GXXjRkdquAkyHeJ6ReW3v4FY3QbgPfugTx. More than 388,201.92404001 BTG were funneled through the wallet, totalling more than $18 million according to Bitcoin Gold Explorer . That a top thirty crypto by market cap can be so easily troubled is a giant of enough problem, but it could also take exchanges down in the process – something the ecosystem is very sensitive to since Mt. Gox. And though, for now, BTG is confident enough to suggest users are not at risk, history shows that can quickly be the case as an exchange freezes withdrawals in an effort to stop hemorrhaging.\nBitcoin Gold has been beset by controversies since its birth fork late last year, including a recent dust-up between BCH advocate Craig Wright and BTG founder Jack Liao . To be fair, however, it is not the only blockchain to suffer a 51% attack. Mere days ago, recently Chinese government highly rated coin verge (XVG) was made to heel, again.

What is Bitcoin The Bitcoin world is abuzz with both excitement and curiosity… and the opportunity for upside potential to skyrocket. Everyone from everyday Joes to reputable experts are betting on Bitcoin’s success.\nIt’s been a wild 8 years since Bitcoin’s release. Most notably, we’ve seen headlines of people who fortuitously purchased bitcoins early on turn into kid-millionaires. With the immense potential of new cryptocurrencies, our attention often turns to Bitcoin as a quintessential example of what’s to come.\nWe’ve designed this guide to teach you about Bitcoin so that you’re up to speed and ready to join the crypto-world. Beginners Guide:What is Bitcoin?\nWhat is Bitcoin? Released as an open-source software in 2009, Bitcoin is often credited as the world’s first cryptocurrency and is best defined as a digital currency that only exists electronically.\nBitcoin is decentralized, meaning it doesn’t have a central issuing authority or political institution that controls the amount of bitcoin in circulation. But the Bitcoin platform is far from anarchy.\nThe whole process is pretty simple and organized: Bitcoin holders are able to transfer bitcoins via a peer-to-peer network. These transfers are tracked on the “blockchain,” commonly referred to as a giant ledger. This ledger records every bitcoin transaction ever made. Each “block” in the blockchain is built up of a data structure based on encrypted Merkle Trees. This is particularly useful for detecting fraud or corrupted files. If a single file in a chain is corrupt or fraudulent, the blockchain prevents it from damaging the rest of the ledger.\nInstead of relying on a government to print new currency, Bitcoin’s blockchain programming handles when bitcoins are made and how many are produced. It also keeps track of where bitcoins are and ensures the transactions are accurate.\nThere are currently about 17 million bitcoins in circulation. There isn’t a central regulatory agency or government controlling the supply of bitcoins, meaning the supply is controlled by design. The total supply to ever be created is capped at 21 million bitcoins.\nThis cap raises an argument that Bitcoin could have problems scaling. However, since Bitcoin is essentially infinitesimally divisible (meaning users can transfer as little as 0. 1 bitcoins), this doesn’t really create a scaling issue. The magic number of 21 million is arbitrary.\nIt’s believed that Bitcoin was designed to become a deflationary currency to combat the government’s use of inflation as a hidden taxation to redistribute earned wealth. Many people praise Bitcoin for empowering the people by overthrowing the currency printing powers of transient politicians.\nHow Does Bitcoin Work? One of Bitcoin’s most appealing features is its ruthless verification process, which greatly minimizes the risk of fraud. Since Bitcoin is decentralized, volunteers—referred to as “miners”—constantly verify and update the blockchain. Once a specific amount of transactions are verified, another block is added to the blockchain and business continues per usual.\nWhat is “Mining”? Instead of a single central server verifying every transaction, essentially every other person on the network verifies each transaction.\nCue the “miners.”\nLet me simplify the process so we all understand: Miners are presented with a complicated math problem and the first one to solve the math problem adds the verified block of transactions to the ledger. The calculations are based on a Proof of Work (POW), or the proof that a minimum amount of energy was spent to get a correct answer.\nThere aren’t actual human beings hunched over computers with scraps of notebook paper and calculators doing pre-calculus homework; hardware is used to perform Bitcoin mining.\nBitcoin’s built-in reward system compensates successful miners with a chunk of bitcoins. The reward changes over time per Bitcoin’s programming, and the block reward halves about every four years. The current reward for each new block of verified transactions is about 12.5 bitcoins.\nThe mining processes have become increasingly sophisticated. The most popular method uses ASICS–Application-Specific Integrated Circuits. ASICS are hardware systems similar to CPU computers that are built for the sole reason of mining bitcoins.\nBitcoin mining operations take a lot of effort and power, and the sheer amount of competition makes it difficult for newcomers to enter the race and profit. A new miner would not only need to have adequate computing power and the knowledge to use it to outcompete the competition, but would also need the extensive amount of capital necessary to fund the operations.\nA Simple Bitcoin Transaction Example While Bitcoin’s underlying technology may seem hard to grasp, using Bitcoin does not have to be difficult. Here’s an example of how simple a real world Bitcoin transaction can be.\nA Simple Bitcoin Transaction Infographic\nBitcoin Wallets: How to Store Your Bitcoins So, you’ve got this digital currency. You can’t really chuck it in your pocket. Let’s go through some useful definitions before we jump into storing cryptos:\nExchange platform: where you trade money for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin. You can also trade one cryptocurrency for another. Wallet platform: essentially a bank account where your cryptocurrencies are kept. Hard wallet: an “offline” wallet that is not linked to a network. Public Cryptographic Key: your account number. Similar to how someone would send money to your bank account via your account number, your public cryptographic key is the information you give to someone to receive cryptos. Private Cryptographic Key: the key that allows you to spend your Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. You guard this with your life. If someone has access to it, they can transfer (steal!) your bitcoins. Now that we’ve got that out of the way, we can discuss Bitcoin wallet better.\nWhen you hear of bitcoins being hacked, you’re probably hearing about an “exchange platform” being hacked. Since Bitcoin’s blockchain structure makes it EXTREMELY difficult to hack (borderline impossible), it is considered very secure.\nExchanges, however, are a different story. Perhaps the most notable Bitcoin exchange hack was the Tokyo-based MtGox hack in 2014, where 850,000 bitcoins with a value of over $350 million suddenly disappeared from the platform. This doesn’t mean that Bitcoin itself was hacked; it just means that the exchange platform was hacked. Imagine a bank in Iowa is robbed: the USD didn’t get robbed, the bank did.\nIndustries surrounding Bitcoin are new and not without their kinks. Bitcoin advocate and esteemed venture capitalist Marc Andreessen stated, “MtGox had to die for Bitcoin to thrive. Its former role from early Bitcoin days has been supplanted by better, stronger entities.”\nEven though most wallet platforms are considered extremely secure, the prospect of hackers makes many users paranoid.\nThat brings us to hard wallets. A hard wallet is essentially a USB that allows users to store their cryptographic keys offline and off of exchanges. Your cryptographic key only lives on your hard wallet and is impossible to hack (unless someone physically steals your hard wallet).ledger nano s hardware wallet\nHard wallets are so secure that there are countless stories of people carelessly misplacing a hard wallet full of cryptos and never being able to recover thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of bitcoins.\nSome users opt to use a “paper wallet,” which is essentially your cryptographic keys on a piece of paper stored somewhere safe like a bank vault. Although paper wallets are not recommended, they can be done either by an online key generator (not recommended due to threats of malware) or handwritten.\nFor more information on Bitcoin wallets, read out Guide to Finding the Best Bitcoin Wallet.\nWhy use Bitcoin? Bitcoin is often hailed as the future of the monetary world for a variety of reasons.\nIt’s decentralized and brings power back to the people. Launched just a year after the 2008 financial crises, Bitcoin has attracted many people who see the current financial system as unsustainable. This factor has won the hearts of those who view politicians and government with suspicion. It’s no surprise there is a huge community of ideologists actively building, buying, and working in the cryptocurrency world. Freedom. The concept that one could carry millions or billions of dollars in Bitcoin across borders, pay for anything at any time, and not have to wait on extended bank delays is a major selling point. Security. Bitcoin payments don’t necessarily need to be tied to one’s personal information. Since personal information is left out of the transactions, users aren’t as exposed to threats such as identity theft. Bitcoin can also be backed up and encrypted to ensure the security of your money. Low Transaction Fees. Banks and companies like PayPal charge to send and receive money. Bitcoin replaces the 2.5% “transaction fee” with one that’s only a fraction of that. The Immutable Ledger. Bitcoin’s blockchain public ledger is objective. People trust it to be fair because it is based on pure mathematics, rather than the human error and corruption of questionable politicians.\nWhat are the disadvantages of Bitcoin? For all its advantages, Bitcoin does still pose some significant issues.\nPerhaps one of the largest reasons everyone hasn’t jumped on the Bitcoin train is because its price is shrouded in uncertainty. Many people are concerned with…\nLegal Gray Area. Major governments have largely remained on the sidelines, and this has created both a sense of potential and apprehension for Bitcoin proponents and critics respectively. Bitcoin isn’t backed by a regulatory agency and a government would technically be ceding power by supporting a decentralized currency. This has been largely officially unaddressed. Bitcoin’s price, however, tends to be very sensitive to any news concerning the US government’s opinion of cryptocurrencies. For example, when the SEC denied the approval of bitcoin-based exchange-traded-products—essentially bitcoin-backed assets on the stock market—in 2017, Bitcoin’s price dropped 18%. Yet while the price and adoption of Bitcoin would be affected by government action, governments are unable to criminalize Bitcoin. In fact, governments such as the United States and China have invested in it at some capacity. Exchange hacks. As stated above, an exchange hack has nothing to do with the integrity of the Bitcoin system… but the market freaks out regardless. This trend seems to minimize as users see that cryptos recover from exchange hacks. As exchanges evolve and become more secure, this threat becomes less of an issue. Additionally, outside investments funneling into exchanges are providing the capital for them to grow stronger. Illiquidity. This is mostly moot due to Bitcoin’s $47 market cap but it still makes users sweat. It’s highly unlikely that Bitcoin’s price would plummet and you’d be unable to take action, but it’s still unsettling. As more investors invest, however, illiquidity becomes a negligible risk, as there will likely always be a buyer for Bitcoins waiting. Volatility. This very reason many speculators are attracted to Bitcoin is the same reason many potential users are hesitant to get involved. Users that look at Bitcoin as a speculative investment option are essentially gambling on the process, and the future price of Bitcoin is largely unknown. There are estimates that Bitcoin will both be worth pennies in a few years, while some predict that a single bitcoin will be worth $500k in three years. As new investors continue to invest and the market cap grows, Bitcoin’s price could become more stable. Lack of adoption by businesses. The price volatility is a large reason that many businesses have yet to adopt Bitcoin as a form of payment. Increased consumer adoption and price stability will eventually mitigate this disadvantage. Another disadvantage is that while many people have heard of Bitcoin, few understand exactly what it is or how it functions. Guides like this help to push the needle and build a foundation, but it’s ultimately on the users to seek out more information.\nBitcoin’s strength lies in its networking effect. The more we spread the word and grow the Bitcoin community, the better off our bitcoins will be.\nHow to Buy Bitcoin As mentioned above, in the early years of Bitcoin it was difficult to find a trustworthy place to buy the cryptocurrency. With the increase in demand for Bitcoin, numerous new companies have sprouted to help facilitate easily purchasing Bitcoin.\nThese days, many Bitcoin exchanges have received huge investments from venture capitalist. They’re also now more heavily regulated, especially those based out of the United States. You can compare exchanges and view our in depth reviews in our How to Buy Bitcoin Guide. We’ve also listed our top two recommended options below:\nCoinbase launched in 2012 with the hopes of giving users an easier way to buy Bitcoin. Since its launch, the San Francisco based startup has become the most commonly recommended buying option for newbies. You can learn more in our complete Coinbase Review and User’s Guide.

While they launched more recently than many of their competitors, the New York based cryptocurrency exchange has quickly built a great reputation in the crypto community.

Nakamoto claims to be a man living in Japan born on April 5th, 1975 but there are speculations that he is actually either an individual programmer or group of programmers with a penchant for computer science and cryptography scattered around the United States or Europe. Nakamoto is believed to have created the first blockchain database and have been the first to solve the double spending problem other digital currency failed to. While Bitcoin’s creator is shrouded in mystery, his Wizard of Oz status hasn’t stopped the digital currency from becoming increasingly popular with individuals, businesses, and even governments.\nBitcoin’s Popularity It’s important to take a look at Bitcoin’s popularity over time because… well, have a look below:\nGoogle Trends structures the chart to represent a relative search interest to the highest points in the chart. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term “Bitcoin” and a value of 50 means it was half as popular at that time. A score of 0 indicates that the term was less than 1% as popular as the peak. It’s amazing how the searches relating to Bitcoin have spiked in the past few years.\nWhen Bitcoin began circulating in 2009, its early adopters consisted of programmers and a niche crowd of technical people. Its popularity over time indicates that many of the disadvantages of Bitcoin will likely dissipate as Bitcoin becomes more standard.\nLineCandleOHLC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T09:36:40.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6840d6cb56bd0fb88123e1f2f302fc2743128c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQZZlTHOo_51IKyQUAj4egkd6s6jqEcAe0qRzhanypQUqcKA_8FoJjKiy5M0ClURFlRvTKjOLy6btvMBchBypONosA5uU6o8bDwh80BE7Z6_ykHa40UqKiCSI7Ih3aWsz8-", "site_full": "www.slashgear.com", "site": "slashgear.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.slashgear.com/slashgear", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "SlashGear", "title": "Bitcoin price manipulation probe underway at Justice Department", "title_full": "Bitcoin price manipulation probe underway at Justice Department", "published": "2018-05-25T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://c.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin_cc0_pixabay.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10823, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6840d6cb56bd0fb88123e1f2f302fc2743128c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQZZlTHOo_51IKyQUAj4egkd6s6jqEcAe0qRzhanypQUqcKA_8FoJjKiy5M0ClURFlRvTKjOLy6btvMBchBypONosA5uU6o8bDwh80BE7Z6_ykHa40UqKiCSI7Ih3aWsz8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brittany A.

According to the tipsters, the DOJ has teamed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to determine whether some traders have or had been manipulating the price of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The sources say this is a criminal probe.\nREAD: What is Bitcoin? Let AI explain\nThe investigation was leaked by sources talking to Bloomberg , which reports that both federal prosecutors and the CFTC are looking into whether some traders have been engaging in various illegal schemes to alter crypto prices.\nThese methods include things like pushing out a flood of fake orders to manipulate other traders into either selling their cryptocurrencies or buying up existing currencies. Such manipulation tactics are illegal and come with stiff penalties.\nA lack of regulations make cryptocurrencies particularly susceptible to such tactics. Some nations have taken major steps toward restricting or outright banning cryptocurrencies for these reasons and others. Japan, for example, has started regulating currencies like bitcoin, while China has simply banned them.\nThe sources claim that spoofing and wash trading schemes are of particular interest to the DOJ, which is giving focus primarily to bitcoin and ether. However, the probe is reportedly still in its early stages and it’s unclear whether it will lead to any sanctions. Neither government agency has confirmed the report at this time.

Spoofing involves traders flooding the market with fake orders in an effort to artificially inflate or deflate prices. The report said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is cooperating with federal prosecutors as part of the probe.\nThe investigation is the latest government intervention in the cryptocurrency market, which investors have long celebrated for its decentralized and unregulated status. Cryptocurrency trading hubs China and South Korea have also recently implemented new regulations on cryptocurrency trading in an effort to cut down on fraud and money laundering. Earlier this year, a study by the University of Sydney and the University of Technology Sydney found that 25 percent of all bitcoin users and 44 percent of all bitcoin transactions were associated with criminal activity.\nBitcoin prices tumbled 4.8 percent on Thursday, briefly dropping below $7,500 and hitting their lowest levels in six weeks. The value of bitcoin has dropped by 44.4 percent so far in 2018, but some bitcoin bulls are sticking to their guns when it comes to the battered cryptocurrency.\n\"I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven't really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty,\" Fundstrat analyst Thomas Lee says. \"But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.\"\n[Read: What's the Best Bitcoin Wallet? ]\nAt the same time, some bitcoin bears, such as Vanguard Group economist Joe Davis, see absolutely no value in the cryptocurrency whatsoever.\n\"I'm enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible,\" Davis wrote earlier this week. \"As for bitcoin the currency?

(credit: xe.com )\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have taken a wild ride over the past 18 months. Now, according to Bloomberg News , the US Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into whether price manipulations have contributed to the meteoric rises and crushing falls.\nThe coins prosecutors are examining include bitcoin and ether, which have both bounced up and down over the past 18 months. In 2017, after bitcoin began the year with a price of about $1,000 , it soared to just below $20,000 in December and then finished out the year at about $13,900. Ether followed an even steeper trajectory , beginning 2017 at about $8 and finishing at about $747. Prices for both currencies have experienced major volatility over the past six months. Spoofing and wash trades\nThe DoJ probe is focused on whether those price swings were caused by illegal trading practices that have long manipulated securities prices in more traditional markets, Bloomberg reported, citing four people familiar with the probe. One of the practices is known as spoofing. That's when a trader floods an exchange with orders and then cancels them once the market price has moved in the desired direction. Another practice, known as wash trades, occurs when people transact trades with themselves to give the market a false impression of demand.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

charts.Do you think Bitcoin will finally hit 20K this month if its price increase rapidly?\nI am optimistic that the price of bitcoin will hit at $20k but not for this year. We had many issues and bad news about crypto that makes the price at downfall and we are just moving at midrange. Sooner we can find ways to make it and reach as high as $20k and make this currency the best digital assets of the world.\nYeah probably by the last quarter of this year we'll see a real bull run happen. I'm also quite positive about another all time high for this year but it's ok if it doesn't.

The BTC\\/USD pair declined sharply and even broke the $7,600 support level. It traded towards the $7,400 level before finding buyers. A low was formed near $7,440 from where a fresh upward correction was initiated and the price moved above $7,600. \\n\nThe price managed to move above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low. However, there are many hurdles for buyers around the $8,000 level. At the moment, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low is acting as a resistance near $7,700. There are also two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. The second trend line is significant since it is formed via connecting the $8,300 swing high. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing a few positive signs above $7,500. Having said that, a break above the $8,000 barrier is must for buyers to gain control. On the other, if buyers fail to push the price above $8,000, there is a risk of yet another slide back to $7,500. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is struggling to move back above the 50 level. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $7,500 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $8,000 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC\\/USD Sellers In Control appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T15:28:44.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85820c9509dfab0546789b36890030d19c3987f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUN0ovAacwwI9XIEfdTCZtga5Ml_3ZHIQZgc2l5EGOUfkWva9GEj.LMwoqvzBOxGN4CFmKmpqOtx5F6acoBDeCP4", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price declined sharp", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price declined sharp", "published": "2018-05-24T23:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85820c9509dfab0546789b36890030d19c3987f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUN0ovAacwwI9XIEfdTCZtga5Ml_3ZHIQZgc2l5EGOUfkWva9GEj.LMwoqvzBOxGN4CFmKmpqOtx5F6acoBDeCP4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-24T23:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price declined sharp", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price declined sharply and moved below the $1,000 support against the US Dollar. \\n Yesterday\\u2019s highlighted major bearish trend line with current resistance at $1,080 is intact on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair is currently correcting higher towards the $1,050 and $1,080 resistance levels in the near term. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price failed to recover and declined below $1,000 against the US Dollar. BCH\\/USD may correct higher, but upsides are likely to be limited. \\n Bitcoin Cash Price Decline \\n\nThere was a sharp increase in selling pressure from $1,150 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and broke many supports such as $1,100 and $1,050. The decline was such that sellers succeeded in pushing the price below the $1,000 handle. BCH is now trading well below the $1,100 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. \\n\nIt traded as low as $967.5 recently before buyers appeared. At the moment, the price is consolidating losses with a correction angle towards $1,100. An initial resistance is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,191 high to $967 low. More importantly, yesterday\\u2019s highlighted major bearish trend line with current resistance at $1,080 is intact on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. The same trend line resistance is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,191 high to $967 low. Therefore, if the price corrects higher, it could face sellers near the $1,050 and $1,080 levels. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is in a bearish trend with a decent support near $960-80.

The gap between the moving averages is also widening to reflect strengthening bearish pressure. This signals that a break of support is still plausible. \\n\nHowever, RSI is already indicating oversold conditions and may be ready to pull up. In that case, bitcoin price could retreat to the 38.2% Fib near the mid-channel area of interest around $7,900 or the 50% level at the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point.

Because of this, I think we will go looking towards the bottom of the overall consolidation, which is closer to the $6500 level. I think rallies are more than likely going to be sold at this point, as crypto currencies continue to struggle. When you look at this chart, it’s not hard to see that the latest high was lower, and I think we may eventually go low enough to test the $6000 level. A break down below there unwinds this market to the $5000 level. I don’t have any interest in buying this market, at least not right now. I will evaluate each daily candle for signs of a bottom, but right now we don’t have it. The US dollar is the strongest fiat currency that I follow right now, so it makes sense that we are struggling. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nBitcoin also sold off against the Japanese yen, breaking through the ¥900,000 level during the day on Wednesday. We are now approaching the ¥800,000 level and look very likely the test the bottom of the overall consolidation area that extends down to the ¥700,000 level. From the bounce in April, we did not reach the top of the consolidation area which is at the ¥1.25 million level, a very ominous and bad sign indeed. We break down below the ¥700,000 level, the next leg lower in this market will start. Otherwise, we could see a bit of a bounce from there and perhaps an attempt to reach the ¥1 million level again. In the next few days though, I would anticipate sellers on short-term rallies and of course sellers adding to positions on breakdowns. All things being equal, Bitcoin does not look healthy right now. We are not in panic mode, but we are most certainly negative. \\n\\n\n\\n\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T15:26:57.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3aa34d8c8e2045269f344c4b028258858a714720", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUNaOmyZiVWQD_CTlqLurK4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Advantages and disadvantages of bitcoin.😊", "title_full": "Advantages and disadvantages of bitcoin.😊", "published": "2018-05-24T23:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.669, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3aa34d8c8e2045269f344c4b028258858a714720", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUNaOmyZiVWQD_CTlqLurK4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Flomo", "published": "2018-05-24T23:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Advantages and disadvantages of bitcoin.😊", "text": "may have a lot to explain above, but obviously bitcoin is a good investment assets. and kekurangnnya is ups and downs of significant prices unexpectedly.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:03:00.046+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e223e15ca34594b9e81432c1d3ebc3ce37c564c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je1IvSnozaN6fRhuvyaZdbosuhnXQBH75TFHSnSy2.IIWC9QvS6fdloQuX4bY_qtLp80nwX8qcO.R_j9kAFRzteKj._EryUQDh5yIEx7Gufp1Iqd6isCUWyGJPhtN5JBmc-", "site_full": "cranberrykiss.com", "site": "cranberrykiss.com", "site_section": "http://cranberrykiss.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "cranberrykiss", "title": "Purchase 300 mg Zyloprim compare prices – BitCoin Is Available – Express Delivery", "title_full": "Purchase 300 mg Zyloprim compare prices – BitCoin Is Available – Express Delivery", "published": "2018-05-24T23:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e223e15ca34594b9e81432c1d3ebc3ce37c564c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je1IvSnozaN6fRhuvyaZdbosuhnXQBH75TFHSnSy2.IIWC9QvS6fdloQuX4bY_qtLp80nwX8qcO.R_j9kAFRzteKj._EryUQDh5yIEx7Gufp1Iqd6isCUWyGJPhtN5JBmc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fashion Berry", "published": "2018-05-24T23:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Purchase 300 mg Zyloprim compare prices – BitCoin Is Available – Express Delivery", "text": "Zodiac Beauty Tags Purchase 300 mg Zyloprim compare prices – BitCoin Is Available – Express Delivery Purchase 300 mg Zyloprim compare prices Generic Zyloprim How Much Cost Cheapest Zyloprim.

From a technical point of view, the service works as follows: ACINQ receives and aggregates incoming payments, and then periodically sends cash transactions to the recipient’s purse. In other words, companies can offer their clients instant and low-cost payments, receiving funds through the usual cash transaction.\n“We charge only a commission of 1% for payments. At the same time, automatic payments to your wallet are free, as we carry out their batching among merchants. The threshold amount for automatic withdrawal can be set in the range 0.1-1 BTC,” the company’s blog notes.\nAlso, users can make a payment to the purse manually, however in this case you will have to pay a commission of 0.5 mBTC.\nAccording to ACINQ representatives, although using Strike and assuming the need to trust a third party, the level of risk is minimal, since the service sends a cash transaction every time the total amount of payments reaches a user-adjustable threshold.\n“For example, if you set the threshold for withdrawal to be 0.1 BTC, you will never trust us with an amount exceeding 10 million Satoshi”\nThe documentation for setting up the Strike service and registering the account is available on the link.\nAlso, developers noted that work is currently under way to integrate Strike with the WooCommerce plugin. In addition, ACINQ is considering the possibility of partnership with the Canadian Internet company Shopify, which specializes in developing software for online and retail stores. The company serves 500,000 trading companies with a combined turnover of $ 45 billion.\nEarlier, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tested the possibility of integrating the Lightning Network with smart contracts.

This article gives the author’s personal strategy when it comes to trading the Bitcoin (BTC/USD).\nTRADING CONDITIONS .\nBitcoin has gone through an explosive price increase over the past couple of years and it is important to note that this cannot go on forever. As time passes, the type of trading strategy that will be most useful to Bitcoin traders will change as the market dynamics also change. As the Bitcoin comes of age, some of these strategies will probably become more effective while others become obsolete. Therefore the strategy about to be discussed below, is useful to the current trading conditions but will need to be further scrutinised and revised in the future before being used.\nTIME FRAME .\nDue to the high volatility in the trading price of BTC/USD a longer time frame is appropriate as it eliminates most of the trading noise. Activity is still low when it comes to trading Bitcoin as evidenced by the high average spreads. For these reasons, the 4 hour chart will be used in making the trading decisions.However, in future if trading becomes more active and the market more liquid, then shorter time frames can be used.\nINDICATORS .\n* The following indicators will be used:\n* Relative Strength Index - RSI 14.\n* Simple Moving Average - SMA 18 and SMA 60.\n* Highest Value Over Specified Period – Max 60\n* Lowest Value Over Specified Period - Min 60\nTRADING .\nDue to the long time frames being employed it should be noted that the strategy will have a low trading frequency.\nCONDITIONS FOR LONG TRADES.\nThe first step will be to check of the price is higher than it was in the past 60 candles.

BTC\\/USD is currently recovering ground towards a few key barriers like $7,800 and $8,000. \\n Bitcoin Price Analysis \\n\nThe past 5-6 sessions were mostly bearish as bitcoin price tumbled below the $8,000 support against the US Dollar. The BTC\\/USD pair declined sharply and even broke the $7,600 support level. It traded towards the $7,400 level before finding buyers. A low was formed near $7,440 from where a fresh upward correction was initiated and the price moved above $7,600. \\n\nThe price managed to move above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low. However, there are many hurdles for buyers around the $8,000 level. At the moment, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low is acting as a resistance near $7,700. There are also two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair.

BCH\\/USD may correct higher, but upsides are likely to be limited. \\n Bitcoin Cash Price Decline \\n\nThere was a sharp increase in selling pressure from $1,150 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and broke many supports such as $1,100 and $1,050. The decline was such that sellers succeeded in pushing the price below the $1,000 handle. BCH is now trading well below the $1,100 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. \\n\nIt traded as low as $967.5 recently before buyers appeared. At the moment, the price is consolidating losses with a correction angle towards $1,100. An initial resistance is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,191 high to $967 low. More importantly, yesterday\\u2019s highlighted major bearish trend line with current resistance at $1,080 is intact on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. The same trend line resistance is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,191 high to $967 low. Therefore, if the price corrects higher, it could face sellers near the $1,050 and $1,080 levels. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is in a bearish trend with a decent support near $960-80. A break below the mentioned $960 support may open the doors for a push towards the $900 level. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators: \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is slowly recovering in the bullish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is moving higher and is currently 40. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $980 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,080 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH\\/USD Jaw Dropped Below $1,000 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T15:14:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "279d6045d99d58298fd0b017370a85366c5e464d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNCq8uouSQpg.EasdISvFeXUceNrdc06sM7jVJtLFu8EPqpG4c_GiDDL7dwD37YR4OmC15O7RvHi3zzqXJnfO7Vt76sydwlAtzQ--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "published": "2018-05-24T23:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "279d6045d99d58298fd0b017370a85366c5e464d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNCq8uouSQpg.EasdISvFeXUceNrdc06sM7jVJtLFu8EPqpG4c_GiDDL7dwD37YR4OmC15O7RvHi3zzqXJnfO7Vt76sydwlAtzQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Jenn", "published": "2018-05-24T23:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price continues to trend lower but is currently testing short-term support. \\n A bullish divergence can be seen on stochastic, signaling a possible bounce back to the top. \\n The Fibonacci retracement tool shows the nearby upside targets. \\n \\n\nBitcoin price could be due for a bounce off the channel support back to the nearby Fibonacci retracement levels. \\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals \\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. The gap between the moving averages is also widening to reflect strengthening bearish pressure. This signals that a break of support is still plausible. \\n\nHowever, RSI is already indicating oversold conditions and may be ready to pull up. In that case, bitcoin price could retreat to the 38.2% Fib near the mid-channel area of interest around $7,900 or the 50% level at the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point. The 200 SMA lines up with the highest Fib at the $8,200 level and the channel resistance. \\n\nStochastic has formed slightly higher lows while price made lower lows, creating a bullish divergence.

Even though the dollar lost some ground to its peers after the release of the FOMC meeting minutes for May, BTC\\/USD has carried on with the drop, presumably from negative remarks by Fed official Kashkari earlier on. \\n\nIn addition, another report by the Fed signaled that bitcoin has a hypothetical value of just $1,800.

You may have some type of malware on your computer that resulted in your funds being stolen because your private information was somehow obtained. One of the most common types of these are browser extensions posing as bitcoin price tickers that are actually stealing your account information. There's also the possibility that you visited a phishing site posing as Blockchain. We've also heard of computer viruses that detect when an address is in your clipboard, and replace the one you wanted to use with an address controlled by this malicious party.\nBy design, Blockchain never has access to users' accounts or funds. If you keep your password and private key backups secure, then your funds are always safe with us. Since this information has been compromised, be sure to never use this wallet or any addresses contained within it. I'd also highly advise against using the same password again. I'm truly sorry that you had funds stolen from you. That certainly is an extremely frustrating experience.\nIf youd like to learn more about how our wallet works, please visit: https://blockchain.info/wallet/how-it-works .\"\n\"\nKeenan (Blockchain)\nMay 24, 04:58 EDT\nHello,\nI'm very sorry this has happened but as a non-custodial wallet provider, we do not collect or hold information about users identity or have access to funds in any way.

Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: scepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 per cent to $7,409 as of 9:32am. London time. It’s down more than 20 per cent since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders Colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading — forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise — it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 — has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realise the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry. Some market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T14:44:53.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40c015590e321b330d47a7a788ea52ff984c4471", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTI0t6oIhxim5yhAdkvjEV6tRhOcWpJk4VlucS9OI4DwWHIGd8Lxd_3hX6.RJwPo5pbv4ZjMyeB7hQNvIGUdBubQicca6us4TQQOgcqnWWMYg--", "site_full": "www.promocoupons24.com", "site": "promocoupons24.com", "site_section": "http://www.promocoupons24.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["marketing", "couponing", "shopping", "business"], "section_title": "Udemy Free Coupon Code & Discount Coupons", "title": "Bitcoin in 1 Hour - Send, Receive, Trade and Secure Bitcoin Udemy $10 coupon 93% Off", "title_full": "Bitcoin in 1 Hour - Send, Receive, Trade and Secure Bitcoin Udemy $10 coupon 93% Off", "published": "2018-05-24T22:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WaKUg4iMeQI/WwcSW8CHsbI/AAAAAAAAKp0/HO7XjzDkMykwxXmXaAH7YiQvkzJ-qb-dgCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/bitcoin-course.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 32475, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40c015590e321b330d47a7a788ea52ff984c4471", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTI0t6oIhxim5yhAdkvjEV6tRhOcWpJk4VlucS9OI4DwWHIGd8Lxd_3hX6.RJwPo5pbv4ZjMyeB7hQNvIGUdBubQicca6us4TQQOgcqnWWMYg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Raaz Bhuiyan (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T22:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in 1 Hour - Send, Receive, Trade and Secure Bitcoin Udemy $10 coupon 93% Off", "text": "Submit Coupon Bitcoin in 1 Hour - Send, Receive, Trade and Secure Bitcoin Udemy $10 coupon 93% Off Comprehensive and Full Bitcoin Basics Course for everyday transactions - Quickly Learn to Trade, Buy, Sell, Send, Receive, Trade and Store Your bitcoin.

Self-interest and default settings imposed by the financial institution that is the custodian of the IRA are often not in the benefit of the individual account holder. It is therefore no surprise that so many people now seem to want to find the best Roth Bitcoin IRA , which is a self-directed IRA that allows you to truly diversify your portfolio.\nUnderstanding the Best Roth Bitcoin IRA\nA self-directed IRA is incredibly appealing. As the name suggests, it means that you have control over your investments. It also means that you no longer have to pay for obscure “maintenance fees”. The IRA (Individual Retirement Account) was first formed in 1974 , at which point the self-directed option was immediately available. However, a lot of people opted for the traditional form, made up of bonds, stocks, and mutual funds, simply because they had little knowledge about investing.\nThe Investments to Be Made in Roth Bitcoin IRAs\nYou can invest in anything that you like in a self-directed IRA and this now officially includes Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrencies as well. Other elements that you can include are mortgages, real estate, structured settlements, tax liens, franchises, tenants in common (TIC), and so on. There are a number of prohibited transactions, including collectibles and life insurance, but almost everything else can be included. This means that you can create a highly diversified portfolio, which is a strong portfolio.\nOf course, in order to hold a Roth Bitcoin IRA, you do need to find a custodian for the administration thereof. Because cryptocurrencies have only recently been officially accepted, it can still be a little bit difficult to find custodians willing to accept them and work with them. However, once you find one, you will have a passive manager behind you who you only have to pay a nominal fee, leaving you to work on your own with your preferred investments.\nWhy You Should Consider the Roth IRA\nWhen you decide to roll over to a self-directed Roth Bitcoin IRA, you will be empowered to learn about investments and to become successful. As with all IRAs, you will be able to grow your money tax free. Because it is self-directed, you can focus on the things you are actually knowledgeable about such as bitcoin, real estate, or anything else.\nDifferent Accounts to Self-Direct\nThe IRA is, so far, the only investment account in which you can officially include cryptocurrencies.

You will rarely see these illegal methods used in established stock markets, but some may be using them to profit in the largely unregulated world of cryptocurrencies, teeming with millions of inexperienced traders.\nAccording to the report, the Justice Department is working with CFTC officials on the investigation, which is said to be in its early stages. The investigation is reportedly focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\nA recent analysis by investor Sylvain Ribes, for example, has shown that a large amount of volume seen on some popular cryptocurrency exchanges is likely fake and exists only due to practices such as wash trading. And a recent paper , published in the Journal of Monetary Economics, concluded that suspicious trading activity may have been responsible for Bitcoin's rapid jump in price from $150 to $1,000 in late 2013.\nThe price of Bitcoin has been on the decline since May 5, when it briefly hit $9,950, and is currently at $7,543. The market cap of the world's most popular cryptocurrency stands at $128.6 billion. Ethereum is following a similar trajectory.

Chief executive Andrew Kiguel stated he was pleased with the work conducted thus far, given that Hut 8 started operations in late December 2017. 828 bitocans produced in the first quarter of 2018 combine another approximately 500 pieces extracted since December, meaning the business currently has a reservation of over 1, 300 bitcoins, he explained in a statement.\nNevertheless, Hut 8 isn’t done developing its facilities: he noticed that the organization has begun construction of a brand New datacenter at the City of Medicine Hat, that will more than triple the organization’s mining capacity. The new centre will start production in Sept, he said, adding. The City of Medicine Hat site will include an additional 40 BlockBoxes. Once operational, Hut 8 will have 57 BlockBoxes, representing a 335% increase from current mining capacity, securing our position as among biggest Bitcoin miners listed in the world, with a total of 66.7 MW of power capacity and 448 PH/s. With this increase in BlockBoxes from 17 to 57, we anticipate our daily mining production can increase significantly.\nWe consider our City of Medicine Hat Facility will signify operational excellence and set a brand new international benchmark for industrial scale cryptocurrency mining operations. At present prices, Hut 8 spends roughly $2, 615 CAD per bitcoin mined, in accordance with the report. Nevertheless, due to bitcoin’s dropping price, it’s Recording a loss of almost $4 million CAD on its own profit margin.

It was first traded on January 3rd, 2009. Bitcoin’s total supply is 17,051,987 coins. The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoin and the currency’s Github account can be viewed here . Bitcoin’s official Twitter account is @bitcoin and its Facebook page is accessible here . The official website for Bitcoin is bitcoin.org . The official message board for Bitcoin is bitcointalk.org .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be purchased on the following cryptocurrency exchanges: BitBay, Upbit, CEX.IO, Octaex, Omicrex, Gemini, BTCC, Fatbtc, Kucoin, Binance, Huobi, CoinsBank, Exrates, RightBTC, BitMEX, bitFlyer, Fisco, Coinhub, Lbank, itBit, Coinsuper, Korbit, YoBit, BTCBOX, OKEx, Bibox, Exmo, BCEX, EXX, IDAX, Tidex, GOPAX, OEX, ZB.COM, Coinroom, Bittrex, CoinEx Market, Negocie Coins, Trade By Trade, Bithumb, BtcTrade.im, HitBTC, Gate.io, Luno, B2BX, CoinTiger, Bitstamp, CoinEgg, Sistemkoin, Iquant, xBTCe, Ethfinex, Coinone, Kraken, OTCBTC, Coinrail, C2CX, Hotbit, OOOBTC, Livecoin, LakeBTC, Bitbank, Zaif, Paribu, Bitinka, CoinBene, GDAX, Cobinhood, Poloniex, DragonEX, Bitfinex, Quoine, Simex, Bit-Z, fex, BitForex, Neraex, WEX and TOPBTC.
