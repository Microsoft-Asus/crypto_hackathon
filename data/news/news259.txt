It seems only fitting to have the 2018 National Settlement Services Summit (NS3) close with a lively discussion of this topic.\nDuring the session titled ‚ÄúBlockchain, Bitcoin and You,‚Äù three industry insiders will discuss how the growth of Blockchain and cryptocurrency stands to benefit title agents, lenders, Realtors and borrowers.\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sound too simplistic but it‚Äôs just going to change the way we do everything,‚Äù Crypto Realty Group CEO Piper Moretti said. ‚ÄúRather than going to several different sources for all the information that we need as Realtors, we‚Äôll be able to close on a house in a matter of a few days rather than a month to 45 or 60 days. Transactions will be infinitely faster. That‚Äôs the end goal, I believe.‚Äù\nMoretti will be joined by John Heck, director industry general manager at DXC Technology Co. and formerly of IBM, and Matt Einheber, principal at Transfer: Real Estate Intelligence.\nIn addition to speed, the speakers will detail how Blockchain could improve fraud mitigation, reduce errors, cut down on paperwork and much more.\nMoretti said she is working with some startups in the process of developing essentially a one-stop shop for all parts of the real estate transaction, from beginning to end. The efficiency of Blockchain enables them to dream big in terms of ushering in a new modern era of real estate transactions.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll look at traditional recordkeeping, which is completely archaic, and what is hopefully coming down the pike,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt really just comes down to adoption. How fast can we do it and how fast can we learn it.‚Äù\nSome states already are taking steps to better accommodate Blockchain, she noted, such as Arizona and California. Both states have introduced legislation to make Blockchain a legal form of recordkeeping, which could alleviate issues with the use of cryptocurrency that continue to crop up.\nThe speakers also will touch on how companies can effectively protect borrowers‚Äô sensitive information and keep them abreast of information that is pivotal to a smooth home-buying process.\nFor more information on the 2018 NS3, including the agenda and a list of speakers, click here .

The company has about 15 percent share of the global market for bitcoin mining chips and computer equipment, trailing Chinese rival Bitmain , according to a February report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\nCanaan, founded in 2013, sells computer equipment under the ‚ÄúAvalon‚Äù brand with fast customized chips that win digital coins by solving complex math problems. The company‚Äôs hardware often ends up in remote locales housing large mining pools that depend on cheap electricity, Co-Chairman Jianping Kong said in an April interview.\nCanaan Creative co-chairman Jianping Kong, right, with founder and CEO N.G. Zhang in April. Photographer: Billy H.C. Kwok/Bloomberg\nThe company also announced last year it was developing dedicated chips for use in artificial intelligence applications.\nNo final decisions have been made, and details of the offering could change, the people said. Kong, the Canaan co-chairman, declined to comment on details of the IPO preparations.\nCanaan was preparing last year to list on China‚Äôs National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market known as the New Third Board, before opting to pursue a Hong Kong IPO.\nIn 2016, electrical equipment manufacturer Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric Plc attempted to acquire Canaan, according to filings at the time. The deal didn‚Äôt go through due to the ‚Äúgreat uncertainties‚Äù surrounding China‚Äôs securities environment and regulatory policies, Shandong Luyitong said in a September 2016 statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange.

As mentioned then, ETH/USD was showing relative strength among the major cryptos, which still remains the case. Although last week‚Äôs pullback saw Ethereum go below the $700 support level, it has now risen back above it and price never broke below the invalidation level of $627 to tilt the bias back to bearish. With Ethereum also back above the 200-day average, the bullish bias thus remains intact for the time being. We had also identified the area between $800 and $835, which was formerly support, as the next resistance zone. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Source: TradingView and FOREX.com UK* As it turned out, this area did in fact turn into resistance. However, the resulting sell-off from this area has been mild thus far, pointing to modest profit-taking there. Going forward, the bulls will be hoping that it clears this $800-$835 resistance range in order to confirm that the buyers are well and truly in control again. If this happens to be the case then the next bullish objective would be the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1016/7. Alternatively, if Ethereum goes back below the aforementioned $700 support level and holds below it for a while then this would increase the likelihood of a breakdown below that $627 level. In this potential scenario, Ethereum‚Äôs next stop could very well be around the next support at $535 or lower. *Please note, this product is not available to US clients.

The Beijing conference hosted the well-known Chinese blockchain expert Li Jiang, Professor Chen Zhong of Peking University, Professor Jingsha He of Beijing University of Technology and Sun Yi of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, among other guest speakers. Sponsored Links China: The Blockchain Enthusiast\nDeputy Director Huang Zihe gave the welcoming address on behalf of the China Electronic Information Industry Development Institute. He stated that the CCID is focused on blockchain technology and other industrial research and that the think tank has formed the Blockchain Institute and the China Blockchain Ecological Alliance specifically to investigate the blockchain‚Äôs application to public life. The organizations act as facilitators and agitators for blockchain technology sharing and development.\nThe conference ethos centered on pointing to areas or roles of government where blockchain technology could help streamline processes and improve the public experience. It also looked at international trends in the technology and attempted to identify relevant focus areas going forward. China banned ICOs and subsequently anything crypto in September 2017.\nThe Peking professor Chen Zhong noted that the technology is still in the early stages and that further development, changes and applications are constantly coming to light. Admitting that there remain many challenges, he also spoke of the need to roll out the technology in practical application on diverse projects in order to build a body of experience that can guide future applications.\nOpinions agreed that the legal, regulatory and marketing of blockchain applications needed to be effected together, for a comprehensive approach to enabling the technology. The conference‚Äôs main function was to propel the evaluation of blockchain technology as practically applied so that a book of knowledge develops as quickly as possible.\nProfessor Jingsha He noted his area of focus is the development of blockchain technology security and privacy protection issues, echoing comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve and others that stem from as far back as 2016. He is also particularly interested in the technology‚Äôs ability to innovate in the arena of data storage.\nHe‚Äôs academic colleague Professor Sun Yi pointed out the need to proactively develop the surrounding blockchain ecosystem, paying particular attention to interoperability, something he said should be a focal point that will enable blockchain projects to interact seamlessly with one another. There was widespread agreement on this, acknowledging that obtaining interoperability between private and public chain apps while incorporating AI and big data technologies, was paramount. Bitcoin and Others Under Review\nAs per the think tank‚Äôs criteria for determining which public chain assessment projects to investigate, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Ethereum, Litecoin, NEO and more than a dozen others were selected for scrutiny and analysis that will hopefully contribute to future apps. The full list for the monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index includes; Ark, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, BitShares, ByteCoin, Cardano, Dash, Decred, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Hcash, IOTA, Komodo, Lisk, Litecoin, Monero, NANO, NEM, NEO, QTUM, Ripple, Siacoin, Steem, Stellar, Stratis, Verge, Waves and Zcash.\nThere are five criteria for selecting focus public chain projects, namely; an independent main chain, easily generated nodes, a published block explorer tracking and sharing information, open source code and a website with contact details. The release of the first draft of a global public-owned chain technology evaluation index was a focal point of the gathering.\nThe China Electronic Information Industry Development Institute‚Äôs site will be the sole online outlet for the evaluation index.

Therefore, the RBI cannot unilaterally decide for the government on the legality of bitcoins\nIn its response, the RBI also confirmed that the committee is due to submit a report on cryptocurrencies come June 30 and insisted that the working group will study the regulatory approach taken by other countries before proposing a regulatory framework in India.\nMeanwhile, despite mainstream reports to the contrary this year, bitcoin isn‚Äôt banned in India despite recent curbs led by the central bank which effectively barred Indian citizens from purchasing cryptocurrency through their bank accounts.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "central bank tells supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "securities and exchange board of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "information technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T22:35:55.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f61c4c85ecc82bfaecf3641e73fe0c00a3fe0fa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQIe_NEjjG5iw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-05-15T16:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f61c4c85ecc82bfaecf3641e73fe0c00a3fe0fa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQIe_NEjjG5iw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Globb0", "published": "2018-05-15T16:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Where are the popular domain hotspots? this is an interesting graphic from Nominet\nFull size link https://www.nominet.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Map-Of-The-Online-World.jpg\nInteresting to see 30+ million of the domains on one small pacific island", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:52:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13ad2343b5cd383c3ee27f775bd1d9bf452d0c49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY1LgLyA15ke84xq0BLiV166MJgWSBOhTbNmDRfur1KaII9m_dAdHcMc-", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Florida County Becomes First US Locality to Accept Bitcoin for Taxes", "title_full": "Florida County Becomes First US Locality to Accept Bitcoin for Taxes", "published": "2018-05-15T16:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13ad2343b5cd383c3ee27f775bd1d9bf452d0c49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY1LgLyA15ke84xq0BLiV166MJgWSBOhTbNmDRfur1KaII9m_dAdHcMc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T16:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Florida County Becomes First US Locality to Accept Bitcoin for Taxes", "text": "Seminole County, Florida, has officially become the very first county in the US to accept Bitcoin to pay their taxes.\nResolving an Expensive Issue In an official announcement dated May 14 th , Joel M. Greenberg, Seminole County's Tax Collector, disclosed that his office will be accepting both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as means for payment of different services beginning this summer.\nFor a long time, users who chose to pay their taxes with a credit or debit card were charged with hefty fees. This was because they were using a third-party payment processor such as Visa or Mastercard. Now, as the agency will begin accepting cryptocurrencies, these days will be no more.\nThanks to Bitcoin technology, the Seminole County Tax Collector will reduce transactions fees and improve payment accuracy, efficiency, and transparency. Greenberg:\nWe live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government, [‚Ä¶] The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.\nSaving on Fees The agency subtly states that by allowing its taxpayers to use Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the heavy fees which are associated with using third-party payment processors will be eliminated. That's great, but who's the one who has to pay those fees in the first place?\n\"Interchange is a small fee paid by a merchant's bank (acquirer) to a cardholder's bank (issuer) to compensate the issuer for the value and benefits that merchants receive when they accept electronic payments,\" MasterCard's official website reads.\nThus, Seminole County's Tax Collector claims that the main premise of the new payments option is to reduce the costs paid by the government. The more money saved on fees, the more tax money for spending for social benefits. Though, the words used in the announcement may lead taxpayers to believe that they will be saving money.\nBut Why Pay Taxes in Bitcoin? It goes without saying that an official tax agency recognizing cryptocurrencies as an official payments method is significant. But how necessary is it really?\nThere are two types of taxpayers: those who own cryptocurrencies and those who don't. In order for the latter to take advantage of the implanted change, one would have to jump through various hoops: research and learn how to use a Bitcoin wallet, register on an exchange and go through the KYC process to buy BTC or BCH, and only then can they send it to the Tax Collector's receiving address.\nThis is quite bothersome and there doesn't seem to be much incentive for the layman to use cryptocurrency to pay taxes compared to existing methods.\nThe former group however is more likely to take advantage of the new payment option since they already have cryptocurrency and are familiar with how it works. But let's stop for a moment and think about this.\nOne of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin is its pseudonymous privacy. Therefore, some may see this as a Trojan Horse getting bitcoin holders to reveal their identities, and to the local taxman no less. What do you think?\nWould you pay your taxes with cryptocurrencies if you could?

The Fundstrat team believes that the price of mining per coin has proven to be always a great asset in the past. Since the issue of mining increases as the quantity of bitcoins mined grows nearer to the established maximum amount, \"this amount of support\" may also increase, Investopedia reported.\n\"Bitcoin miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees ‚Ä¶ we argue that the Price/Miner's Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019,\" the company said in a statement. Separately, Lee believes that the annual Consensus conference, due to take place from May 14 to May 16, with nearly 7,000 attendees registered for this year's event, could fuel considerable gains, propelling the BTC coin above $10,000. Previous Consensus events have all led to a rise in the BTC market cap by up to 70 percent.\nBuyBitcoinsInNigeria ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam doctor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat global advisers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "investopedia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:18:00.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52635b2e51124c72967d58ede351e61c84a4d94e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhJE4GjaDtB3DR.z6HmHB7nk-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T16:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "52635b2e51124c72967d58ede351e61c84a4d94e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhJE4GjaDtB3DR.z6HmHB7nk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T16:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ‚ãÖ May 15, 2018 NEWS This may be the year that institutional money will buy bitcoin , markets research firm Tabb says CNBC \"If 2017 was the year cryptocurrencies went mainstream, then 2018 is certainly shaping up to be the year they go institutional,\" the capital markets ...

While bitcoin rallied from as low as $8,200 per single coin to approach the $9,000 mark, it has retreated today.\nAt mid-morning, bitcoin sat at $8,500 per single coin, down just over two percent. The rest of the market fared no better, as most coins in the top 20 in market cap were down several percentage points, with just a few outliers showing less than one percent gains.\nBitcoin market highlights for the 24 hours ending May 15, 2018 at 1:00 pm U.S. Eastern Time\nThe highest price seen was $8,925.65 on the Simex exchange at 4:48 pm yesterday. Simex saw $52,355,300 of bitcoin change hands.\nThe lowest price seen was $8,465.21 on Coinsuper‚Äôs exchange at 11:06 am today. Coinsuper‚Äôs 24 hour volume was $44,307,300.\nThe average price on the surveyed exchanges, as weighed by volume, was $8,713.01.\nVolatility was a bit lower than average, with the BlockTribune Volatility Index coming in at 44.7. A higher number indicates greater price volatility with 50 describing an average day.\nThese statistics were consolidated from 10 different exchanges.

Resolving an Expensive Issue\nIn an official announcement dated May 14 th , Joel M. Greenberg, Seminole County‚Äôs Tax Collector, disclosed that his office will be accepting both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as means for payment of different services beginning this summer.\nFor a long time, users who chose to pay their taxes with a credit or debit card were charged with hefty fees. This was because they were using a third-party payment processor such as Visa or Mastercard. Now, as the agency will begin accepting cryptocurrencies, these days will be no more.\nThanks to Bitcoin technology, the Seminole County Tax Collector will reduce transactions fees and improve payment accuracy, efficiency, and transparency. Greenberg:\nWe live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government, [‚Ä¶] The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options. Saving on Fees\nThe agency subtly states that by allowing its taxpayers to use Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the heavy fees which are associated with using third-party payment processors will be eliminated. That‚Äôs great, but who‚Äôs the one who has to pay those fees in the first place?\n‚ÄúInterchange is a small fee paid by a merchant‚Äôs bank (acquirer) to a cardholder‚Äôs bank (issuer) to compensate the issuer for the value and benefits that merchants receive when they accept electronic payments,‚Äù MasterCard‚Äôs official website reads.\nThus, Seminole County‚Äôs Tax Collector claims that the main premise of the new payments option is to reduce the costs paid by the government. The more money saved on fees, the more tax money for spending for social benefits. Though, the words used in the announcement may lead taxpayers to believe that they will be saving money. But Why Pay Taxes in Bitcoin?\nIt goes without saying that an official tax agency recognizing cryptocurrencies as an official payments method is significant. But how necessary is it really?\nThere are two types of taxpayers: those who own cryptocurrencies and those who don‚Äôt. In order for the latter to take advantage of the implanted change, one would have to jump through various hoops: research and learn how to use a Bitcoin wallet, register on an exchange and go through the KYC process to buy BTC or BCH, and only then can they send it to the Tax Collector‚Äôs receiving address.\nThis is quite bothersome and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much incentive for the layman to use cryptocurrency to pay taxes compared to existing methods.\nThe former group however is more likely to take advantage of the new payment option since they already have cryptocurrency and are familiar with how it works. But let‚Äôs stop for a moment and think about this.\nOne of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin is its pseudonymous privacy. Therefore, some may see this as a Trojan Horse getting bitcoin holders to reveal their identities, and to the local taxman no less. What do you think?\nWould you pay your taxes with cryptocurrencies if you could?

It finds that the Dec. 17 launch of bitcoin futures at exchange giant CME Group , owner of the venerable Chicago Mercantile Exchange, triggered a collapse in the digital currency by making it easier to ‚Äúshort‚Äù bitcoin‚Äìor bet on its price falling.\n‚ÄúThe rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence,‚Äù a group of researchers from the San Francisco Fed and the Stanford Graduate School of Business write in the note, released online Monday.\nFutures are a tool for betting on whether the price of something‚Äìsuch as gold, pork bellies, or Treasury bonds‚Äìwill rise or fall. The San Francisco Fed is essentially saying that launching a futures market on an asset that‚Äôs never had its own futures market could add downward pressure to the prices of the asset. Until the launch of bitcoin futures, there were few easy ways to short it.\nBut that‚Äôs not how things played out when CME revealed its plan to list bitcoin futures. That announcement, on Oct. 31, was widely seen as a vote of confidence in bitcoin and a huge step forward in its evolution from a niche product favored by hackers and libertarians into a mainstream investing fad.\nAccording to research site CoinDesk, bitcoin more than tripled from $6447.67 on Oct. 31 to its record intraday high of $19,783.21 on Dec. 17‚Äìthe same day bitcoin futures began trading at CME. Bitcoin was trading at around $9,400 late Monday afternoon.\nBitcoin futures actually started trading on Dec. 10, at CME‚Äôs cross-town rival, Cboe Global Markets But the researchers say trading was thin until CME‚Äôs launch a week later. They compare the post-Dec. 17 price drop in bitcoin to two other bitcoin price declines in 2017, and they find that the drop after the CME launch was much deeper and longer-lasting.\nCME disputed the idea that its futures caused the bitcoin crash. ‚ÄúMany factors influence price, and it is worth noting that the futures market is still trading a fraction of the cash bitcoin market each day,‚Äù a CME spokeswoman said.\nThat isn‚Äôt the first time the introduction of a derivative contract has been blamed for a big price drop. In a 2012 paper, a pair of economists at George Washington University and Yale University argued that the 2005-06 introduction of credit default swaps, or CDS, on certain mortgage-backed securities eventually caused a drastic drop in the price of those securities. That‚Äôs because the CDS allowed bearish traders to express their view on an overvalued market, as anyone who has watched ‚ÄúThe Big Short‚Äù can attest.\nSomething similar happened with bitcoin, according to the San Francisco Fed‚Äôs note. ‚ÄúOnce derivatives markets become sufficiently deep,‚Äù it says, ‚Äúshort-selling pressure from pessimists leads to a sharp decline in value.‚Äù MARKET NEWS\nSEE HOW MUCH YOU GET IF YOU SELL NGN", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://quotes.wsj.com/CME", "https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2018/may/how-futures-trading-changed-bitcoin-prices/?utm_source=frbsf-home-economic-letter-title&utm_medium=frbsf&utm_campaign=economic-letter", "http://quotes.wsj.com/CBOE"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexander osipovich", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford graduate school of business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago mercantile exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:58:29.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0fd7902c740df652c8770d041c60171dcd30dcce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVtPlBWiFyDuDev8ARJMLMuv3KYmAEivN_rBH7lmbFlcQJkscN6IYf_hnkZTHcrJGeubyf0xPlcZy9FPuswtbXxY-", "site_full": "www.dailyfx.com", "site": "dailyfx.com", "site_section": "https://rss.dailyfx.com/feeds/all", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "games"], "section_title": "DailyFX - Feeds all", "title": "Bitcoin: Sub-9K Level Holds Based on Sentiment", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Sub-9K Level Holds Based on Sentiment", "published": "2018-05-15T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10, "comments": 0, "shares": 10}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0fd7902c740df652c8770d041c60171dcd30dcce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVtPlBWiFyDuDev8ARJMLMuv3KYmAEivN_rBH7lmbFlcQJkscN6IYf_hnkZTHcrJGeubyf0xPlcZy9FPuswtbXxY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dylan Jusino,", "published": "2018-05-15T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Sub-9K Level Holds Based on Sentiment", "text": "Bitcoin: Sub-9K Level Holds Based on Sentiment by Dylan Jusino\nBe sure to check out our Bitcoin Trading Guide if you're new to cryptocurrencies !

County Becomes First US Locality to Accept Bitcoin for Taxes Florida County Becomes First US Locality to Accept Bitcoin for Taxes bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nSeminole County, Florida, has officially become the very first county in the US to accept Bitcoin to pay their taxes. Resolving an Expensive Issue\nIn an official announcement dated May 14 th , Joel M. Greenberg, Seminole County‚Äôs Tax Collector, disclosed that his office will be accepting both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as means for payment of different services beginning this summer.\nFor a long time, users who chose to pay their taxes with a credit or debit card were charged with hefty fees. This was because they were using a third-party payment processor such as Visa or Mastercard. Now, as the agency will begin accepting cryptocurrencies, these days will be no more.\nThanks to Bitcoin technology, the Seminole County Tax Collector will reduce transactions fees and improve payment accuracy, efficiency, and transparency. Greenberg:\nWe live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government, [‚Ä¶] The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options. Saving on Fees\nThe agency subtly states that by allowing its taxpayers to use Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the heavy fees which are associated with using third-party payment processors will be eliminated. That‚Äôs great, but who‚Äôs the one who has to pay those fees in the first place?\n‚ÄúInterchange is a small fee paid by a merchant‚Äôs bank (acquirer) to a cardholder‚Äôs bank (issuer) to compensate the issuer for the value and benefits that merchants receive when they accept electronic payments,‚Äù MasterCard‚Äôs official website reads.\nThus, Seminole County‚Äôs Tax Collector claims that the main premise of the new payments option is to reduce the costs paid by the government. The more money saved on fees, the more tax money for spending for social benefits. Though, the words used in the announcement may lead taxpayers to believe that they will be saving money. But Why Pay Taxes in Bitcoin?\nIt goes without saying that an official tax agency recognizing cryptocurrencies as an official payments method is significant. But how necessary is it really?\nThere are two types of taxpayers: those who own cryptocurrencies and those who don‚Äôt. In order for the latter to take advantage of the implanted change, one would have to jump through various hoops: research and learn how to use a Bitcoin wallet, register on an exchange and go through the KYC process to buy BTC or BCH, and only then can they send it to the Tax Collector‚Äôs receiving address.\nThis is quite bothersome and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much incentive for the layman to use cryptocurrency to pay taxes compared to existing methods.\nThe former group however is more likely to take advantage of the new payment option since they already have cryptocurrency and are familiar with how it works. But let‚Äôs stop for a moment and think about this.\nOne of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin is its pseudonymous privacy. Therefore, some may see this as a Trojan Horse getting bitcoin holders to reveal their identities, and to the local taxman no less. What do you think?\nWould you pay your taxes with cryptocurrencies if you could?

The price of bitcoin has risen by 5 per cent in the 24 hours since the Consensus conference kicked off in New York, as the fourth annual blockchain technology summit once again provided a boost to the volatile cryptocurrency. Analysts predicted the price rally earlier this week, after bitcoin had fallen to a three-week low. ‚ÄúWe expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years,‚Äù Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said in a note to clients ahead of the conference. The price of bitcoin has rallied this week, as the world's most valuable cryptocurrency continues its recovery from its worst ever start to a year (Reuters) More Bitcoin has already hit its lowest price point of the year, according to Mr Lee, having fallen to around $6,500 in early February. ‚ÄúIn general, we see 2018 being a strong year, but we see the larger and more established blockchains growing in dominance in 2018,‚Äù the research note said, highlighting ethereum as one of the other cryptocurrencies set to benefit. ‚ÄúBottom line: We expect bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus.‚Äù The turn-around in fortunes has been reflected across cryptocurrency markets, with ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple all seeing significant gains since early April. The latest price is still only just over half of the highs bitcoin reached in late 2017, when it peaked close to $20,000. Since then, bitcoin has suffered from its worst ever start to a year ‚Äî fitting with some analyst theories that the world's most valuable cryptocurrency was experiencing a bubble. The rapid decline was followed by a relative period of stability that many cryptocurrency experts predicted would precede more gains. How high could the price of bitcoin go? Cryptocurrency analysts vary dramatically in their predictions for bitcoin's price. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said in February that cryptocurrencies \"could drop to near-zero at any time,\" telling his Twitter followers to not put in more money than they can afford to lose. Since then, ethereum's price has fluctuated between $950 and $350 and currently hovers around $800. May 2018 will be the last time we ever see #bitcoin under $10,000 ‚Äî Charlie Shrem (@CharlieShrem) 3 May 2018 Others have been far more optimistic, with bitcoin expert Michael Jackson telling The Independent that he believed bitcoin would recover to its heights of last year, and even go well beyond. As bitcoin's price approached $10,000 this week, one Twitter user noted that its average daily growth rate since 2009 is around 0.5 per cent.

Countries around the world are trying to determine how they are going to treat cryptocurrencies. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) has halted several ICOs and hinted at the need for greater crypto regulation.\nI am into cryptocurrency because of freedom, I can't deny to myself that I have worries regarding this issue. And as an investor, I really have no choice but to stay with crypto once the governments around the world have control to cryptocurrencies (if that became possible).\nSo as much as we can, also invest with physical properties with what you've earned. For we don't know what will happen next with our money in the digital world.\nThis is not an advice. It's simply a shared idea.\nHow about you?

When that happened, people panicked and spread news that bitcoin's dying and the world of cryptocurrency is falling. What people failed to realize is that its decentralized and volatile nature make those type of scenarios common to the cryptocurrency world. Technically, if prices are decreasing in the market, people should acquire more and invest in order to maximize their profits in the future. But low prices are not usually an indicator to invest as you are still bound to observe the market.\nQuote: from: Rana590 on January 18, 2018, 03:51:36 AM Obviously it is a great thinking. Bitcoin is so cheap than before. So it is the wiser decision to invest more and more now. It is the negotiable price of bitcoin where if we buy now, will be profitable in huge amount. So buy more and more for holding.\nIt is actually a stellar method. Assuming that bitcoin prices decrease, it is obvious that people should acquire more in order to maximize their profits in the long-run.

The owner of the computer that finds the solution to a problem receives 25 BTC (newly mined) as a reward. Because in 2014, such a problem was solved every 10 minutes, 25 BTC were put into circulation every 10 minutes.\nBased on the paragraph, the students were asked to answer five questions, which were all about mathematical problems but developed on the provided description of Bitcoin.\nThe questions asked were relevant to the real world Bitcoin, including calculating the year by which the reward for miners will be lower than one Bitcoin and determining the maximum amount of Bitcoins that can ever be in circulation.\nCryptocurrencies are increasingly striking interest in the mainstream.\nSome of the world‚Äôs largest companies including Facebook , Nasdaq , NYSE , JP Morgan , and Goldman Sachs have all recently jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon.\nWith the number of companies taking interest in cryptocurrencies on the rise, there is an equivalent rise in the opportunity to work and innovate in the sector.\nWhile the initiative might not be the best segway into blockchain technology, it is an interesting way to expose younger audiences to cryptocurrencies ‚Äì and an even more intriguing attempt at making exams ‚Äúfun.‚Äù\nBut maybe it is the television shows that do a better job at sparking the interest among the younger generations, in which case, Silicon Valley is right on the spot !\nYou can see the examination paper here .

You can easily create an account on their official website and start to earn Bitcoins and various other cryptocurrencies using their cloud mining services. Bitcoin cloud mining at HashGains is a rather simple process involving three basic steps. To begin with, you must do the registration on their site which takes only a few minutes to get done. Following this, you can browse through the various plans on display on the site to choose your plan and then proceed to make payments for it. Once the payment is over, you are free to collect the Bitcoins.\nHashGains has made a name for itself as a leading Bitcoin cloud mining ¬ª company because they offer cutting edge technologies. The company has multiple data centers spread all across the globe. This is what makes them capable of guaranteeing a high uptime to the clients. They have reliable data centers in various countries like the US, India and China which offer super fast hashing rate for mining the Bitcoin.

Resolving an Expensive Issue\nIn an official announcement dated May 14 th , Joel M. Greenberg, Seminole County‚Äôs Tax Collector, disclosed that his office will be accepting both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as means for payment of different services beginning this summer.\nFor a long time, users who chose to pay their taxes with a credit or debit card were charged with hefty fees. This was because they were using a third-party payment processor such as Visa or Mastercard. Now, as the agency will begin accepting cryptocurrencies, these days will be no more.\nThanks to Bitcoin technology, the Seminole County Tax Collector will reduce transactions fees and improve payment accuracy, efficiency, and transparency. Greenberg:\nWe live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government, [‚Ä¶] The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options. Saving on Fees\nThe agency subtly states that by allowing its taxpayers to use Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the heavy fees which are associated with using third-party payment processors will be eliminated. That‚Äôs great, but who‚Äôs the one who has to pay those fees in the first place?\n‚ÄúInterchange is a small fee paid by a merchant‚Äôs bank (acquirer) to a cardholder‚Äôs bank (issuer) to compensate the issuer for the value and benefits that merchants receive when they accept electronic payments,‚Äù MasterCard‚Äôs official website reads.\nThus, Seminole County‚Äôs Tax Collector claims that the main premise of the new payments option is to reduce the costs paid by the government. The more money saved on fees, the more tax money for spending for social benefits. Though, the words used in the announcement may lead taxpayers to believe that they will be saving money. But Why Pay Taxes in Bitcoin?\nIt goes without saying that an official tax agency recognizing cryptocurrencies as an official payments method is significant. But how necessary is it really?\nThere are two types of taxpayers: those who own cryptocurrencies and those who don‚Äôt. In order for the latter to take advantage of the implanted change, one would have to jump through various hoops: research and learn how to use a Bitcoin wallet, register on an exchange and go through the KYC process to buy BTC or BCH, and only then can they send it to the Tax Collector‚Äôs receiving address.\nThis is quite bothersome and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much incentive for the layman to use cryptocurrency to pay taxes compared to existing methods.\nThe former group however is more likely to take advantage of the new payment option since they already have cryptocurrency and are familiar with how it works. But let‚Äôs stop for a moment and think about this.\nOne of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin is its pseudonymous privacy. Therefore, some may see this as a Trojan Horse getting bitcoin holders to reveal their identities, and to the local taxman no less.

Story by Neer Varshney\nCryptocurrencies have found a ton of admirers recently, but guess who isn‚Äôt loving them right now ‚Äî Dutch high school students.\nThis year‚Äôs VWO examination ‚Äì a matriculation test high school students are required to take to be eligible to pursue university education in the Netherlands ‚Äì featured an unorthodox theme: Bitcoin .\nThe students were provided a description for Bitcoin and how the cryptocurrency is mined:\nBitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. It exists since January 1, 2009 and can be used to pay at online stores or for other online services. Bitcoin is not issued by a central bank, unlike normal money. Instead, Bitcoin is created by letting computers work on solutions for selected mathematical problems.\nIt works like this: anyone can run special software on his or her computer to contribute to solving such a mathematical problem. The owner of the computer that finds the solution to a problem receives 25 BTC (newly mined) as a reward. Because in 2014, such a problem was solved every 10 minutes, 25 BTC were put into circulation every 10 minutes.\nBased on the paragraph, the students were asked to answer five questions, which were all about mathematical problems but developed on the provided description of Bitcoin.\nThe questions asked were relevant to the real world Bitcoin, including calculating the year by which the reward for miners will be lower than one Bitcoin and determining the maximum amount of Bitcoins that can ever be in circulation.\nCryptocurrencies are increasingly striking interest in the mainstream.\nSome of the world‚Äôs largest companies including Facebook , Nasdaq , NYSE , JP Morgan , and Goldman Sachs have all recently jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon.\nWith the number of companies taking interest in cryptocurrencies on the rise, there is an equivalent rise in the opportunity to work and innovate in the sector.\nWhile the initiative might not be the best segway into blockchain technology, it is an interesting way to expose younger audiences to cryptocurrencies ‚Äì and an even more intriguing attempt at making exams ‚Äúfun.‚Äù\nBut maybe it is the television shows that do a better job at sparking the interest among the younger generations, in which case, Silicon Valley is right on the spot !\nYou can see the examination paper here .

Basically I want to live off of my bitcoin, so will just be putting small amounts onto a prepaid card (or using a card that can withdraw directly from my bitcoin on the spot when using ATM) into various foreign currencies as I travel frequently all over the world. I won't be making any big purchases but just need enough for spending money. I don't want to link this to any bank account.\nWhat do you guys use? What is cheapest/safest? What are issues with taxation?\nAppreciate any info!

Although revenue was flat compared to the year before, underlying operating profit and underlying earnings per share both increased more than 90%.

Within the shipbroking division, tanker freight rates are low. Nevertheless, the order book increased by 13% during the year. Looking forward, chairman David Moorhouse said in today‚Äôs report that he expects world trade and global shipping demand to continue to grow ‚Äúin line with economic growth projections.‚Äù Yet he thinks it‚Äôs unlikely there‚Äôll be a recovery in tanker rates before next year because of the growth of the tanker fleet.

At the end of 2013, Braemar‚Äôs share touched 550p or so, suggesting a potential gain of more than 100% from today‚Äôs levels just to get back to where it was before.

Agency(HSARPA)\nBitcoin is being taken more seriously than ever before. Just a few years ago we were laughed at for suggesting Bitcoin would compete with the FED. Now we have presidents of FED banks speaking at the annual preeminent Bitcoin conference.\nBitcoin is turning institutions inside out. Individuals act principally in their best interests ; even if their behavior harms the group as a whole. This is called \"Tragedy of the commons\" ; when a resource is overutilized to the point where it is unusable for everyone.\nBitcoin turns this on its head. Bitcoins properties attracts speculators looking out for their best interests. These speculators then have an interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed and use the leverage at their disposal to do so.\nSo while Bitcoin is a threat to the power and sovereignty of every government and bank on Earth ; it is individuals who make up those institutions.\nIndividuals within governments and banks adopt Bitcoin for (hopeful) personal profit. These people aren't trying to overthrow governments and banks; but they will do what they can to soften their institutions stance on their investment.\nAs Bitcoin continues going through its growth cycles it attracts more and more individuals. More and more people in more institutions that have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin grow. These people support projects and initiatives that increase Bitcoins usefulness and therefore adds to its overall value proposition; which helps create a positive feedback loop.\nThat is the genius of the Bitcoin revolution. No bloodshed required. No protesting. Bitcoin is as much applied computer science and cryptography as it is a global psychological operation. We are re-inventing the concept of value.\nInstead of fighting the old system we are building a better system. Instead of forcing people to change with threats of violence; people willingly change to chase profits.\nThe end-game for this revolution is the end of central banks. Global Value/Currency Standard. Peoples savings will grow in value over time at the pace of productivity increases. People will no longer lose value to inflation. Governments will not be able to spend money they do not have. Unprofitable businesses supported by subsidies will fail. Defense spending will fall dramatically around the globe.\nBitcoin can solve most of the problems whose root cause is \"money\".

Genesis, as many of you reading this might know, is the world‚Äôs largest cloud bitcoin mining company, with over 2 million customers worldwide. It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm.\nThis week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation.\nTell us how you got started in this industry.\nI‚Äôve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin‚Äîit progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it.\nHow would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It‚Äôs a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.\nThe conventional banking system really shows its limitations when we try to move money between developed and underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa. There are some serious inefficiencies that, frankly, many of the big banks just aren‚Äôt interested in fixing. But with bitcoin, you don‚Äôt have to worry about that. You can send money to, say, a coffee farmer in Africa, and he‚Äôll receive it directly.\nMoney transfers are only one among a number of many other uses. Bitcoin is also a store of value. It‚Äôs one of the few assets that I would say are uncorrelated to the broader financial markets.\nAs for blockchain, it has innumerable world-changing applications across a wide range of industries. That‚Äôs why I believe it‚Äôs crucial that people have the right information about blockchain and understand it. If people don‚Äôt understand it, and it gets overhyped, I‚Äôm afraid it could start going in the wrong direction.\nWe recently mined the 17 millionth bitcoin, leaving only four million left. Explain why it becomes exponentially more difficult to mine coins the closer we get to that 21 million-coin ceiling.\nIt‚Äôs not that the mining itself becomes more difficult. To answer this, I think we have to look at two components.\nOne component is the daily supply of bitcoin. At the moment, only 1,800 bitcoins can be generated every day by the whole network, meaning all the miners worldwide. But it‚Äôs important to remember that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined, the rewards are halved. What this means is that after the next halving, which I believe is expected sometime in 2020, the number of bitcoins mined a day will fall from 1,800 to 900. And then after the next halving, it‚Äôll be 450. This helps reduce the supply in a natural way.\nclick to enlarge\nThe second component is a measure of how many miners and how much computing power is in the network. If more miners come online, then of course the competition becomes greater. Because the daily supply is already fixed, your market share shrinks.\nclick to enlarge\nThink of it like the California Gold Rush. Mining gold at first was relatively easy because the metal was plentiful and there were few miners. By the end, it became more difficult because the easy gold had already been claimed, and you were competing with far more miners. We‚Äôre seeing the same thing happen with bitcoin and other mineable digital currencies.\nSpeaking of computing power, HIVE Blockchain just announced that it expanded to 24.2 megawatts (MW), up from 2.4 MW in August. What‚Äôs next in the pipeline for HIVE?\nYes, the last expansion was a massive build-out in Sweden. It was done in three phases. I think this was a remarkable achievement for HIVE, that it could add so much computing power so quickly.\nThis is only the beginning. The year is still long and you can expect to see some bigger expansions on the way. In September, for example, we‚Äôre going to ramp up another bitcoin mining facility worth 20 MW, which is very exciting. And from there it goes even further.\nG20 finance ministers are scheduled to share their plans for more uniform regulation of cryptocurrencies by July. What are your expectations?\nI personally think that this is very good and that it will bring more professionalism into the market. The momentum and adoption has grown so much and so rapidly that there really needs to be some kind of strategy‚Äîthe world‚Äôs economic leaders can‚Äôt just leave this space untouched. Anyone who believes otherwise isn‚Äôt facing reality.\nHaving said that, regulating this market will not be easy because it‚Äôs in a whole other dimension than anything that has come before it. As an analogy, imagine someone trying to regulate flying cars using the same measures that have been written for cars driving on the street. It wouldn‚Äôt make any sense. So there will certainly need to be some innovation to get it right. I think it‚Äôs also important that the regulators talk to the right people, the industry leaders. They have good input, and I think it could be a very fruitful dialogue.\nAlong those same lines, South Korea‚Äôs central bank just announced that it was looking seriously into how the Korean economy might use blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, there‚Äôs talk of the country going cashless by 2020. Do you think that‚Äôs where the global financial systems are headed?\nI think there‚Äôs a natural incentive for governments to go in that direction because, of course, they want to have greater control over their economies. But as is the case with overregulation, too many controls‚Äîor going completely cashless‚Äîcould be harmful to the economy. This is certainly part of a long and interesting debate, and I‚Äôm curious to see how it plays out, in South Korea and elsewhere.\nWhere do you see the best application of blockchain technology right now?\nBlockchain‚Äôs greatest contribution is its ability to erase boundaries. It completely removes the element of trust‚Äîor distrust, I should say‚Äîand adds a stabilizing effect to nearly every industry because of decentralization.\nTake the global banking industry, for example. You don‚Äôt need to look far to find some serious inefficiencies, as I mentioned earlier. We‚Äôre already seeing some very concrete instances where blockchain can be of help here. The banks recognize this and are getting together to make use of this technology to improve their services.\nWhat‚Äôs been the greatest challenge you‚Äôve faced so far in your journey?\nFor me, the greatest challenge can usually be found in the moment that you‚Äôre currently in. I always compare this industry to the beginning of the internet‚Äîno one knew where it was headed or what it would eventually look like. Most people had a general idea that it was innovative and could benefit the world, but the full implications were unclear.\nSimilarly, no one knows where blockchain and cryptocurrencies might take us, and having to deal with this constant uncertainty is, I‚Äôll admit, not trivial. You must always be prepared to act quickly in response to another bitcoin fork, a hack or some other unexpected event. These are things that keep you up at night.\nBut it‚Äôs exciting. I think what history has shown again and again is that it‚Äôs dangerous to be ignorant and to not have an open mind. Not everything was euphoric and wonderful when the internet first emerged. Problems still occur online, but I believe most people would agree that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nNo industry is without its challenges, and as long as you‚Äôre willing to address them, it can be very rewarding. As for blockchain technology, I‚Äôm very happy and thrilled to be a part of it this early on.\nInterested in learning more?

This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nA rising window occurred (where the top of the previous shadow is below the bottom of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bullish trend.

Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 19.4966. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a sell 4 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 50.04. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 30 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -97. This is not a topping or bottoming area.

St. Louis Fed Chief bitcoin , crypto , crypto news , news #bitcoin #invest #money\nThe president of the St. Louis Fed says the US dollar could end up ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù by Bitcoin, notes crypto‚Äôs ability to cut costs in trade. A top US policy maker made mostly positive remarks about Bitcoin , also not ruling it out as a potential ‚Äúthreat‚Äù to the US dollar, in an interview with CNBC Monday, May 14.\nSpeaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the Consensus 2018 conference in New York Monday, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard also identified positive aspects of cryptocurrency , namely revolving around cutting costs in trade. He stated that crypto is ‚Äúfacilitating trade that would not otherwise occur. Some of that‚Äôs illegal, but some of that is avoiding costs that would otherwise be there.‚Äù\nAsked whether Bitcoin was a threat to the US dollar, Bullard voiced uncertainty about the potential competition the leading cryptocurrency could pose, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so at this point [...]. We don‚Äôt know how the future‚Äôs going to unfold.‚Äù\n‚ÄúMy idea is that there‚Äôs a lot of currency competition going on right now,‚Äù Bullard meanwhile continued on the topic of dollar supremacy, adding:\n‚ÄúThe dollar has been the winner historically because it‚Äôs backed by the largest economy and a relatively stable policy in terms of low inflation and that‚Äôs going to be tough to beat. But a lot of people here want to beat it.‚Äù\nOn the topic of blockchain, Bullard was much more openly bullish, saying:\n‚Äúwe think blockchain technology is very interesting [..] we want to be very engaged and thoughtful as this proceeds.‚Äù\nHe also responded to a question of whether or not the Fed was considering issuing its own cryptocurrency, saying noncommittally, ‚Äúwe can certainly look at that as a possibility. And there are different parts of the Fed that look at all kinds of applications of blockchain technology. But I wouldn‚Äôt say there‚Äôs any plan at this point.\nThe comments continue the trend of general crypto support from the St. Louis Fed. In January this year, the reserve bank published a dedicated paper titled ‚ÄúA Short Introduction to the World of Cryptocurrencies‚Äù in which researches forecast it was ‚Äúlikely‚Äù that Bitcoin and altcoins would ‚Äúemerge as their own asset class.‚Äù ¬Æ‚ìî‚ì¢‚ìû‚ì§‚ì°‚ìí‚ìî‚ì¢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cnbc", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/st-louis-fed-sees-future-in-crypto-as-important-asset-class-bitcoin-as-digital-gold", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/14/st-louis-feds-james-bullard-talks-bitcoin-and-the-economy.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bullard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james bullard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "suggests st. louis fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:21:52.044+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2d72a33fe4a6be9e64d649f93c2764e8e34cdc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRJju.flQuBv2SZsl6EGDs8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Reasons why Bitcoin is droping:", "title_full": "Reasons why Bitcoin is droping:", "published": "2018-05-15T14:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2d72a33fe4a6be9e64d649f93c2764e8e34cdc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRJju.flQuBv2SZsl6EGDs8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mix max", "published": "2018-05-15T14:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Reasons why Bitcoin is droping:", "text": "I think the new regulation in Germany is also one of the causes of bitcoin being dropped.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic//File Photo\nMay 15, 2018\nBy Fiona Lau and Jennifer Hughes\nHONG KONG (Reuters) ‚Äì Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers are set to test international investor appetite for cryptocurrencies with plans to raise as much as $1 billion each ‚Äì in what are expected to be the world‚Äôs largest bitcoin-focused floats to date.\nCanaan Creative has applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for an IPO while Zhejiang Ebang Communication has started working with advisers on a Hong Kong float, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\nWhile the price of bitcoin <BTC=BTSP> has tumbled 35 percent this year and Beijing has tightened its grip on trade in the virtual currency, equipment makers are still hungry for capital to fund growth and to meet still robust demand for their machines.\nBoth are seeking as much as $1 billion, IFR said, which would dwarf other known listings for crytopcurrency firms.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment.\nCanaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world‚Äôs bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China‚Äôs push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nEbang delisted from China‚Äôs National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nWhile many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain ‚Äì the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin ‚Äì few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly.\nIn Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX <DCC.AX> and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software.\nAnother miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern.\nIn Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain <HIVE.V> last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalization of $333 million.\nCanaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan‚Äôs float, IFR added.\nCredit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBitcoin mining equipment makers make computers with special chips that mine the coins more efficiently than more mainstream chips made by companies such as Intel.\n(Reporting by Fiona Lau at IFR and Jennifer Hughes; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang, Alun John and Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Edwina Gibbs)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reuters/dado ruvic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiona lau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T15:05:38.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4284cfb6fc9d36b59902984a2868bf76a34da546", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTNPZ9B8RhQUhjXMiD57F7c-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin in India.", "title_full": "Bitcoin in India.", "published": "2018-05-15T14:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4284cfb6fc9d36b59902984a2868bf76a34da546", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTNPZ9B8RhQUhjXMiD57F7c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoindian", "published": "2018-05-15T14:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in India.", "text": "Quote: from: elloco4ever on May 14, 2018, 06:49:12 PM Quote: from: Phoenixpple on May 14, 2018, 06:16:31 PM Today we see a piece of news about India's policies to restrict its own encrypt exchanges, which may be interpreted as a growing popularity of a large population in India, such as bitcoin, and I think India will not ban the bitcoin trade, and India's economy has a large and appropriate introduction of some restrictive measures.\nI believe that the government of India is planning to implement some sort of tax on the transactions of bitcoins, there might be a set limit beyond which bitcoin transaction might be taxed but as of now Nothing have been officially announced.\nWithout any official news from the authorities, we should not conclude, already many of friends are paying taxes on Bitcoin exchanges.

Bitcoin‚Äôs Lightning Network: How Can it Solve Bitcoin‚Äôs Biggest Problem Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork in Focus With the Bitcoin Cash hard fork in focus through the day, the market remains divided on whether the hard fork will drive increased demand for Bitcoin Cash that would weigh on Bitcoin. Should sentiment across the market turn negative ahead of today‚Äôs fork, we would expect Bitcoin to be pinned back from any material moves until the hard fork dust settles.\nFailure to move through to $8,800 levels could see Bitcoin face some selling pressure through the middle of the day to bring the day‚Äôs first major support level $8,330.9 back into play, such a move likely to see Bitcoin call on sub-$8,000 support levels before any recovery.\nWe can expect a choppy day ahead, with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash battling it out, Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term bearish trend still intact.\nElsewhere, Ripple‚Äôs XRP was amongst the front runners, up 2.52%, with DASH leading the way, up 3.29% at the time of writing.\nBTC/USD 15/05/18 Hourly Chart More Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: USD/JPY Fundamental Daily Forecast ‚Äì A Surge in Treasury Yields Could Spike Dollar/Yen Higher EURO Loses Momentum Post Mixed Comments from ECB Board Members Soybeans Rebound Following News that China Could Begin to Import U.S. Products Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Takes the Battle to Bitcoin DAX Index Waiting for Direction Greenback Gains Ground Against Loonie Ahead of US Retail Sales Data", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://fxempire.engine.adglare.net/?433759641&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-takes-battle-bitcoin-500703&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/gary-cohn-world-will-global-cryptocurrency-point-500295", "https://t.me/fxempireen", "https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-takes-battle-bitcoin-500703", "https://t.me/fxempireen&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/soybeans-rebound-following-news-china-begin-import-u-s-products-501875", "https://www.fxempire.com/education/article/bitcoins-lightning-network-complete-guide-can-solve-bitcoins-biggest-problem-499385", "https://www.fxempire.com/education/article/ethereum-commodity-security-whats-difference-499362", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e7n0fkEzTWQmRjDFHbJvEw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/228d60a5ba4847851590d9d33cd97abc);", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/greenback-gains-ground-loonie-ahead-us-retail-sales-data-500729", "http://fxempire.engine.adglare.net/?433759641", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/euro-loses-momentum-post-mixed-comments-ecb-board-members-500690", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/dax-index-waiting-direction-500711", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e7n0fkEzTWQmRjDFHbJvEw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/228d60a5ba4847851590d9d33cd97abc", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/usd-jpy-fundamental-daily-forecast-a-surge-in-treasury-yields-could-spike-dollar-yen-higher-501872"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T15:30:35.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32210, "moreResultsAvailable": 6310, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=25900", "requestsLeft": 403}
