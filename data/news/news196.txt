They are often referred to in TV shows, cartoons, and even entire networks. The recent step of Bitcoin towards mass adoption is featuring the popular freemium game, The Simpsons: Tapped Out.\nThe Simpsons: Tapped Out is a very popular game within the genre launched in 2012. Owned by EA Mobile and available in iOS, Android, and Kindle Fire, the game has been around for over half a decade. EA estimates that it has made more than $130 million since its launch. A new update called Crypto Cool will tart up the game and heighten interest of crypto enthusiasts.\nThe Simpsons : Tapped Out game adds an interesting new update. #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/kbveN2jmT4\n— Armin van Bitcoin ⚡ (@ArminVanBitcoin) May 15, 2018\nThe game begins as per usual: Homer is not taking his nuclear power plant job seriously, playing mobile games instead of working. Martin is talking about blockchain all the time, mentioning it numerous times, without explaining exactly what it is. Admitting that he had never heard of blockchain \"until last week\", he says: \"I mined some bitcoin with my computer, and then the value went through the roof\" and adds: \"Now I act like I'm an expert on it!\"\nOnce players completed this task, they are also be asked to encourage three youngsters to mine bitcoin on their computers.\nBitcoin is mentioned in different shows as well. In 2014, it was mentioned in Family Guy and Supernatural. It has also been mentioned in Almost Human, House of Cards, Person of Interest, and the Good Wife.\nAs was previously reported by Coinspeaker, in the latest episode 7 of Season 5 in HBO's 'Silicon Valley' series, cryptocurrencies have taken the center stage and became the theme of the episode. The episode is titled as \"Initial Coin Offering\" and takes a balanced approach while covering the very controversial and complex space of ICOs.\nCryptocurrencies started occupying Youtube as well. Recently, cryptocurrency Youtuber Jason Appleton — known as Crypto Crow — has inked an agreement with CBS for a 13-episode cryptocurrency show that will air later this year (first) in New York markets as a test for popularity.\n\"This will be the first time a cryptocurrency Youtuber has launched their own television series fully paid for by Bitcoin. All promotional sponsors, features and the like are paid by Bitcoin,\" the CBS announcement reads.\nEpisodes of the Crypto Crow Show will be targeted at informing beginners about topics including cryptocurrencies, ICOs, mining, trading, and more.\nThe post The Simpsons: Tapped Out Adds Bitcoin Mining in the Latest Update appeared first on CoinSpeaker .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "armin van bitcoin ⚡", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ea mobile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto cool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ea", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:14:25.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "627c7be92226e9c10ad7376cae7d6683d9cd7666", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LjiwXgP1IgoGP4JRiZuSiqg-", "site_full": "www.instaforex.com", "site": "instaforex.com", "site_section": "http://news.instaforex.com/en/analytics/rss/?x=BAED", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex analysis review", "title": "BITCOIN Analysis for May 21, 2018", "title_full": "BITCOIN Analysis for May 21, 2018", "published": "2018-05-21T14:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "627c7be92226e9c10ad7376cae7d6683d9cd7666", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LjiwXgP1IgoGP4JRiZuSiqg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T14:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN Analysis for May 21, 2018", "text": "21.05.2018 13:13 BITCOIN Analysis for May 21, 2018\nBitcoin has been quite bearish recently which lead the price to reside at the edge of $8,000 support area. The price is currently showing some bearish rejection in the process which is expected to push higher towards $8,500 and later towards $9000 in the coming days. Though there have not been any negative fundamental on the cryptomarket and Bitcoin, such bearish momentum is viewed as a result of investors' insecurity or just a hoax created for sweeping amateur traders away from the market. As for the current scenario, the price is expected to push higher towards $9,000 with a slower pace. Later if the price breaks above $9,000 with a daily close, further impulsive momentum is expected with a target towards $10,000 in the future. As the price remains above $8,000 support area with a daily close, the bullish bias is expected to continue further.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

Ong was apprehended as part of a sting operation by Federal agents. Apart from jail time, Ong must also forfeit about $1.1 million worth of bitcoin and cash. The Sting Operation\nOng first appeared on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) radar in 2016 after he posted an online ad about his bitcoin trading business. Federal agents soon contacted him and in no time had set up a $12,000 bitcoin sale. Ong met with the undercover agents at a Tukwila McDonald’s, and the deal went through. The agents again contacted Ong for another deal, this time worth $50,000.\nOne of the red flags for the undercover agents was the high fees charged by Ong. In a statement by the postal inspector to the court:\nBased upon my training and experience, I know that this is a substantially higher service fee than that charged by legitimate, (Treasury Department)-licensed bitcoin exchangers.\nAccording to the details of the operation made available to the media, Ong had a policy of not wanting to know where his clients got their money. After one of the agents let slip about drug deals, Ong is quoted as saying:\nSo, there is one thing I tell people is I don’t really care what they use the bitcoin for. It’s better that I don’t actually know because then I can have plausible deniability. I am not interested in what you buy or sell (bitcoin) for, so please do not mention it or have your friends mention it either. The Arrest\nAfter a couple of deals, federal agents confronted Ong as part of an anti-money laundering task force, whereupon he agreed to stop his unlicensed bitcoin trading activities. He broke the terms of the deal, however, and proceeded to conduct three more illegal bitcoin trades with undercover agents. Ong was arrested on July 21, 2017, and charged with five counts of money laundering and one count of running an unregistered money-transmission business. According to the indictment, Ong laundered approximately $290,000. U.S. Unlicensed Bitcoin Trading Crackdown\nSince 2016, tracking domestic bitcoin traders has been a mandate of the DHS task force. It all came about in the aftermath of the arrest of David Burchard for the illegal sale of marijuana using Tor. Since then, several federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and DHS have made several arrests of unlicensed bitcoin traders. In 2017, Missouri native Jason Klein was arrested for selling roughly $75,000 worth of bitcoin to undercover FBI agents.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Treasury department classified bitcoin trading as a “money services business.” Thus, bitcoin trading in the country is subject to regulations which make unlicensed crypto trading a criminal offense.\nDo you think the sentence was harsh? Should unlicensed P2P cryptocurrency trading be illegal?

The report predicts that the energy footprint of the world's most popular cryptocurrency will reach 7.7GW by the end of the year, thus amounting to close to 0.5-percent of the global electricity needs. The Bitcoin network is now consuming 67TWh of energy on a yearly basis, up from 32TWh estimated by the same author in December.\nThe figures themselves are speculative to a degree as the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin eliminates the possibility of taking highly accurate measurements, according to the author. The estimates are hence largely derived from the computing capabilities of the Bitcoin network, though the fact that miners around the world are opting for highly diversified rigs makes direct conversions of processing power to energy consumption impossible. Mr. de Vries hence opted for the most conservative method and assumed every miner on the planet is using the most efficient rig available – the Antminer S9. Given how that's verifiably not the case, the actual energy footprint of the Bitcoin network is understood to be much higher and may even surpass a single percentage point of all energy consumption on the planet by early 2019.\nThe new figures underline concerns about the viability of mining Bitcoin as a business endeavor, with many critics maintaining that doing so remains nothing short of a gamble. The currency is still enjoying support from some high-profile industry veterans such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whereas a significant portion of the technology industry is presently exploring the blockchain segment in general, even if they aren't certain or even optimistic about the long-term prospects of Bitcoin itself. Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are just some of the names that have already confirmed they're pursuing new use cases for digital public ledgers, i.e. blockchain solutions. #Google #Android #Smartphones #OS #News @ndrdnws #ndrdnws #AndroidNews Popular Posts:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data", "https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/05/facebooks-historic-exec-reshuffle-creates-blockchain-unit.html", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr", "https://ndrdnws.blogspot.co.il/2018/05/bitcoin-network-consumes-as-much-power.html", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b", "https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/tech-news", "https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/03/bitcoin-will-replace-all-currencies-in-10-years-twitter-ceo.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:16:54.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5c9afc2950ba6c2e5d14659b290c74024e56203", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va76xQjJPEXlTADZ30oMiMfrzcLbU9WiktxxicJgu6pl.tmTGmO5gPbiM-", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "Selling bitcoin for IDR", "title_full": "Selling bitcoin for IDR", "published": "2018-05-21T14:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5c9afc2950ba6c2e5d14659b290c74024e56203", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va76xQjJPEXlTADZ30oMiMfrzcLbU9WiktxxicJgu6pl.tmTGmO5gPbiM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Collins Ntota", "published": "2018-05-21T14:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Selling bitcoin for IDR", "text": "1 bumped to the homepage by Community ♦ 11 hours ago\nThis question has answers that may be good or bad; the system has marked it active so that they can be reviewed. 1 please be a bit more specific for others to be able to answer this question, and show what you have tried before.

Kennedy says it would be hubris to say the days of gold and silver are over. He says gold and silver will increase in purchasing power during the next crisis.\nBut Bitcoin may prove to be extremely profitable, Kennedy says. He shares his perspective on the correct ratio of metals and cryptocurrencies in a portfolio.

The report predicts that the energy footprint of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency will reach 7.7GW by the end of the year, thus amounting to close to 0.5-percent of the global electricity needs. The Bitcoin network is now consuming 67TWh of energy on a yearly basis, up from 32TWh estimated by the same author in December.\nThe figures themselves are speculative to a degree as the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin eliminates the possibility of taking highly accurate measurements, according to the author. The estimates are hence largely derived from the computing capabilities of the Bitcoin network, though the fact that miners around the world are opting for highly diversified rigs makes direct conversions of processing power to energy consumption impossible. Mr. de Vries hence opted for the most conservative method and assumed every miner on the planet is using the most efficient rig available – the Antminer S9. Given how that’s verifiably not the case, the actual energy footprint of the Bitcoin network is understood to be much higher and may even surpass a single percentage point of all energy consumption on the planet by early 2019.\nThe new figures underline concerns about the viability of mining Bitcoin as a business endeavor, with many critics maintaining that doing so remains nothing short of a gamble. The currency is still enjoying support from some high-profile industry veterans such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whereas a significant portion of the technology industry is presently exploring the blockchain segment in general, even if they aren’t certain or even optimistic about the long-term prospects of Bitcoin itself. Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are just some of the names that have already confirmed they’re pursuing new use cases for digital public ledgers, i.e. blockchain solutions.

Most people are becoming familiar of blockchain and cryptocurrencies thanks to names like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum,” Cappiello said, according to Techfinancials .\n“The VTM machines allows customers to buy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum with cash, with their smartphone-cryptocurrency e-wallets. They will also be able to send and receive peer-to-peer, without a bank. Worldwide, in the U.S., Europe and Asian countries, businesses are rapidly expanding their acceptance of cryptocurrencies in day-to-day peer to peer and business transactions,” he said.\n“Vendibit believes the customer should always come first. Cryptocurrencies are still new in South Africa, so making information easily available and understandable to a broad public is vital. It is key that people understand that the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is volatile,” he added.\nWhile adoption is growing, there has not been a great deal of clarity regarding regulation of cryptocurrencies in South Africa. The South African Revenue Service (SARS) recently revealed, however, that cryptocurrencies will be subject to normal income tax rules, iAfrikan reports.

Ma is a Government Chairman and founder of Chinese giant tech Alibaba. The firm is operating blockchain for a quite a few years and Alibaba began investing in the blockchain at the peak moment of the technology. Jack Ma on Blockchain\nDuring the event, Ma says that Blockchain is a hot word it is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is a tiny application of Blockchain. The Blockchain is not a huge gold mine, he says that Blockchain must be a solution which address the privacy and security issues in the digital era of technology.\nOn 16th May, Jack Ma spoke at the forum held at Second World Intelligence Congress in Tianjin. The founder of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd grips a total income estimated over $42 billion. It has indicated the importance of the underlying distributed ledger technology which drives Bitcoin than the legalized currency.\nJack conveyed his boredom over the blockchain technology that guides Bitcoin. Later he adds Bitcoin ranked for Blockchain maximalists. Jack came up with the responses on the usage of blockchain technology. Ma gave a comparable statement in the month of November 2017, The event “Dialogue with Jack Ma” was held in Shanghai. Ma says as follows\n“People must be cautious about the Bitcoin. It is a underlying technological innovation. The innovation is highly effective in coming days. Ma says that he pays more notice to a cashless modern society and Blockchain engineerings. Ma is also shameful that he never knows about Bitcoin.” Alibaba Cryptocurrency mining platform\nEven after Jack was amazed for Blockchain technology, and primarily used for the profits. Alibaba dint oppose to clout the advantages of blockchain. In the year 2018, January Alibaba was rumored to have invested in a cryptocurrency mining platform known as “P2P Nodes”. It has a tech giant registered a number of trademarks for a new Blockchain venture. It is considered as “Ether Lock” and “Ethernet Lock”.\nThe platform announced that Ma has invested in cryptocurrency, but as per sources like Weibo, a Twitter alternative in China says that Alibaba would not create virtual currencies and will not deliver mining platform. The P2P nodes web page was eventually shut down in a step which traced the ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency mining by the Chinese Government.\nThe Alibaba digital currency mining job seeks to maintain a constant growth. The mining is part of blockchain ecosystem and the firm is investing in the same. Bestowing to few sources, Alibaba ranked first for Blockchain-dependant patent applications than the previous year. It holds the most patents for Blockchain technology. Importance of Blockchain technology\nJack says his views on Blockchain technology is only concerned with safety and privacy. The methodology used in dispersed ledger technology enhances the growth and transfer of technology. The integration of Blockchain technology with a online finance environment is a vital process in Blockchain.\nFurther Ma adds that Social Networking site might use Blockchain but it is accomplishing a world-wide web finance which produces trillions of trading volume.

The SEC launched an educational website, HoweyCoins dot com , for a fake ICO.

The digital currency eventually closed the session at $8,513.25.\nWhile Bitcoin has largely managed to defend the $8,500 mark on Monday, it has slipped below that level in more recent trading. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $8,490, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nBitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole performed poorly last week, contrary to expectations that Coindesk’s Consensus conference, which was held on May 14-16 in New York, would have a positive impact on prices. Among the observers predicting a price boost was Fundstrat Global Advisors’ head of research Tom Lee, who admitted on Friday that his forecast was wrong.\n“Given conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction,” Lee wrote in a note to clients, as quoted by Bloomberg . “And coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided crypto-currency prices.”\nLee also said that the crypto market needed a “trifecta of progress”: “(i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed)”. “We got progress on (i) and (ii),” he wrote on Twitter.\nLee also noted that cryptocurrencies still faced “significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions”, but added that “it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions”.\nFundstrat still forecasts that Bitcoin would reach $25,000 by the end of the year.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $8,492.01, as of 11:15 BST. The digital coin has gained 1.9% in the past 24 hours.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-18/crypto-bull-tom-lee-owns-up-after-bitcoin-prediction-goes-awry"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin rall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T15:35:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3227d0983b002a483e31e961a1afc85775884bb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhJcOFFXa_6vwMEDe3xN4hPI-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-21T13:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3227d0983b002a483e31e961a1afc85775884bb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhJcOFFXa_6vwMEDe3xN4hPI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T13:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 21, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD's Bullish Scenario newsBTC Bitcoin price is trading with a positive bias above $8,400 against the US Dollar.

They all compare it with the tulip bubble, but the point is, we have not seen this bubble burst and it does not look like It's going to. There might be a correction, the price may fall to 14K or maybe even lower. But the price will remain above 8K, no matter what. So there's no bubble, at least, it won't burst.\nThe volatility of Bitcoin market on the treed is very apparent to happened, the price value may go down and goes up, depending the market movement on crypto currency trading. Bitcoin was hammered by a lot of issues like, the issue on Banned, Scammer, and now the, issue on Regulation by its country on Digital transaction of Bitcoin, This are just few of reason why Bitcoin price value goes down and up but not BUBBLE, if we look back on the market preview the market on Bitcoin project investment had survive the supposed Bubble, and we can see now a more favorable market trading investment for the Bitcoin and other ALT coin posted on the market.

Should we invest? Should we accept Bitcoin payments? Is the currency going to strengthen or will it completely collapse? The waters are becoming muddier as we go along. Expedia announced that it would accept the currency as a way of fueling further expansion. It is not the only company, either. There are several big names in the industry, like <a href=” https://www.16best.net/newegg/ “>Newegg</a> and Rakuten, that now accept the cryptocurrency. But should educational institut i ons follow this trend? New York’s Kings College and the University of Nicosia certainly seem to think so, so let us examine this more closely. The Advantages Of Accepting Cryptocurrencies Opens up a potential new income stream – if the currency does well, the institution scores. Offers more flexibility when it comes to payment opportunities which might give the institution the edge. Reduced transaction costs. No need for a middleman to handle payments. The Disadvantages Of Accepting Cryptocurrencies\nThis should be looked on as h i ghly speculative investment. The value could increase, or it could drop completely. Bitcoin is a lot like a stock market investment – in times of scarcity, the prices go up, in times of uncertainty, they drop again. If you need to sell during times of uncertainty, you won’t get a good price, even if you do manage to sell. Charges to use the Bitcoin network have increased sharply and it would seem that this trend will continue in future. There are no refunds possible on the network. So, if you pay a supplier the wrong amount, or pay it to the wrong person, you have to hope that they will give the money back. You have to take steps to protect your Bitcoin wallet. Currently, these are a highly attractive target for hackers. You also have to ensure that you never lose your access details. If you do, that is it – you have lost the money. There are definite advantages to accepting a cryptocurrency for a school, but doing so could also have some very serious consequences that cannot be ignored. The way forward would be for each institution to weigh these pros and cons very carefully.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.16best.net/newegg/&source=gmail&ust=1526982817638000&usg=AFQjCNEvnIIZW8Nvm8KBVoTo9VudTB12fg", "https://www.16best.net/newegg/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "university of nicosia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kings college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "expedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rakuten", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T13:30:25.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "97e0808411e59cd240b842c6d1647b61b45c433c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQQCJOQCZGyRQV8oB4uLH0OYd9z6zVO0G.PsiaiMKZGo7KgipilrQDLBuCYyHHR7PKCuyWbqJM2UeyKYWY6szlTJyo8YS3qzgBaExDH_w3__AePfYUTSKvisi_FhHcXkVd", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Proof Hashflare Isn’t A Scam! – Withdrawing From Hashflare – Bitcoin Mining Cryptocurrency", "title_full": "Proof Hashflare Isn’t A Scam! – Withdrawing From Hashflare – Bitcoin Mining Cryptocurrency", "published": "2018-05-21T13:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hqdefault-1523.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "97e0808411e59cd240b842c6d1647b61b45c433c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQQCJOQCZGyRQV8oB4uLH0OYd9z6zVO0G.PsiaiMKZGo7KgipilrQDLBuCYyHHR7PKCuyWbqJM2UeyKYWY6szlTJyo8YS3qzgBaExDH_w3__AePfYUTSKvisi_FhHcXkVd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Canadian Stock Trader", "published": "2018-05-21T13:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Proof Hashflare Isn’t A Scam! – Withdrawing From Hashflare – Bitcoin Mining Cryptocurrency", "text": "I want to address all the complaints that have been thrown my way…so let’s talk about HashFlare and Bitcoin Mining.

By Nathan Reiff | Updated May 21, 2018 — 6:00 AM EDT\nBitcoin has grown considerably in popularity over the past year, with prices surging and more and more cryptocurrency followers joining the field. As this has taken place, so too have the number of publicized hacking events increased as well . With more money being invested in digital currencies now than ever before, and particularly given that many investors are new to the system and may not know how to keep their investments secure, hackers are coming up with ingenious ways of stealing funds. Some of the most prominent thefts have been those that have taken place in plain sight: a recent hack rerouted tokens bound for one wallet for another. The victims watched as their tokens were stolen away from them, with nothing they could do about it. Here are a few ways to store your Bitcoins that may be safer than others .\n(Check out our Bitcoin Page for real-time price updates and news) Desktop Wallet\nA desktop wallet offers a number of advantages over an online wallet. While online wallets are easily accessed from anywhere in the world, they are also more vulnerable to potential hacking. Desktop wallets, on the other hand, are accessed only via your private computer, with personal security keys stored just on that machine. Thus, exposure of your security key online is reduced. Nonetheless, desktop wallets are still susceptible to hacks if your machine gets infected with malware designed to root out keys and steal Bitcoins. Hardware Wallet\nMore secure than a desktop wallet is a hardware wallet. These wallets are bits of hardware, external devices like USB sticks which you can carry around on your person. An added benefit of a hardware wallet is the complete anonymity with which you can transact. There is no personal information linked to the hardware, so no identifying data which could be leaked. Hardware wallets are resilient to malware, and if you happen to lose the wallet you'll be able to recover the funds using a seed phrase. Paper Wallet\nA paper wallet is also a relatively safe way of storing Bitcoin, although it requires a bit more advanced understanding of how digital currencies work. Generate a paper wallet online using any number of dedicated websites, or generate the wallet offline for even greater security. Paper wallets are stored easily because they don't take up a great deal of space, and they also offer true anonymity: they are simply a Bitcoin seed written in some way on a piece of paper. Physical Coins\nServices are cropping up which allow Bitcoin investors to buy physical Bitcoins . The coin you purchase will have a tamper-proof sticker covering a predetermined amount of Bitcoin. In order to purchase the physical coin, you may need to pay a slight premium over the value of the Bitcoin that you're buying, owing to the cost of the manufacture and shipment of the coin itself.

That’s the question that many would-be investors have been asking themselves over the past several months as they read about the rising value of these somewhat mysterious digital coins . On the one hand, they might feel that they’re too late to the party and that there’s no way they could possibly get more out of it than early investors did. Or perhaps they are worried by the volatility of the coins, caused in part by the somewhat rocky relationship they have with regulatory bodies and traditional financial entities. But the truth is that Bitcoin has really captured the public imagination to an extent that it seems like even now it can find more room to rise in value and do well for late-coming investors.\nOf course, that means that these investors have to understand the process and how they can make money from investing in Bitcoin. If you’d like to do your Bitcoin investing in a kind of hands-off manner, you might choose to employ a so-called “trading robot” from sites like Bitcoin Code . For those who prefer to get their hands dirty and want to see how they can make their own fortune on the backs of Bitcoin, here is a simple primer. What It Is\nThink of Bitcoin as just another form of currency, a la the foreign currencies that might be traded on the Forex market. It has an intrinsic value that fluctuates based on the number of investors who wish to buy it and the number of coins that are available, a simple question of the supply of demand. The supply of Bitcoin only rises when more of it is mined, which takes place whenever a transaction takes place using the coins. How It’s Different\nAlthough it acts as a currency and can be used as such, Bitcoin as an investment acts a little bit more like stocks that you would buy. It is prone to volatility that you would normally associate with stocks, perhaps even more so at this point in history because of the regulatory battles with it. For that reason, you can expect a greater profit from buying Bitcoin than if you bought dollars or pounds, but you can also be prone to bigger losses. How to Do It\nSince mining Bitcoin is a complicated process that isn’t guaranteed to produce results, your best bet is to simply buy an amount of Bitcoin from an exchange. You can then cash out when it rises in value or hold on it in the hopes of even bigger profits in the future. Most exchanges require you to buy in with some sort of traditional money and many will often hold the coins for you.

The Banks", "text": "Follow on Facebook Subscribe by Email Print This Post\nWhat Is a Fiat Currency System?\nBanks have always controlled the flow of money within the economy. The central bank is the controller of fiat coins, and these coins were the only currency that facilitated the financial transactions in all economies of the world. But the introduction of cryptocurrency saw the emergence of decentralized currencies that are gaining worldwide adoption.\nBanks generally allow digital transactions to a certain limit in order to prevent unauthorized, illegal activities. In most cases, the central banks of the respective countries enact certain rules and regulations. In case any fraudulent activity is detected, the banks have the authority to reverse the payment.\nWhat are Bitcoins?\nBitcoin , on the other hand, is a completely decentralized currency. The central bank of any particular nation doesn’t issue them. But anyone willing to mine Bitcoins can create them. The Bitcoin system facilitates the transfer of values between two parties. The information is encrypted in such a manner that your information will be away from the farthest reach of the hackers. Each transaction you make is verified by a group of computer nodes before being added to a digital public ledger where anyone can access. However, all transactions recorded on the ledger are irreversible.\nDifference Between Bitcoins and Banks?\nThe main difference between fiat currency and Bitcoin lies in the convenience with which either currency provides their users. The blockchain network can accelerate the monetary transactions in less than ten minutes, and the transaction charge is negligible. No wonder Bitcoin has created a metamorphic change in the meaning of investment to the investors. Unlike fiat coins, which can be issued as and when required, there are times when Bitcoin can’t be mined. There is, at present, a fixed number in circulation in the digital market.\nMany people say the emergence of Bitcoin will wipe out the fiat currency. This is mainly due to high profile people like Hikmet Ersek – CEO of Western Union – investing in these coins. Many people in the A-list, who considered as the richest, in the Silicon Valley, have started dreaming of making profits by investing in these alternative coins. In other words, these affluent people are becoming increasingly Bitcoin-friendly, and the main reason is the phenomenal increase in the value of these coins. Furthermore, these alternative coins, when compared to the regular currency, have high potential because the number of credit card transactions to the Bitcoin transaction is only 0.7% in the world’s largest economy- the USA.\nUpsides and Downsides of Both TheCurrencies\nThe normal currency system is under constant attack by inflation. If you deposit $100 in any bank, there is a possibility it will be worth only $90 next year. On the flipside, if you invest your hard-earned money in Bitcoin, the earning capacity of your money is immense. It can increase up to 200% next year. The only risk you have to face is from the hackers who constantly try to pry into the system for wrongful personal gain. By keeping all things aside, there are attempts by many governments to make these digital coins legal by extending legal support.\nThe Opinion of Central Banks About Bitcoins:\nJP Morgan ’s CEO believes that a Bitcoin investment is a bad one because there is a possibility of a steep downfall in the value of this investment at any time. He has issued an outright warning to the employees of the bank not to involve themselves in any transactions related to these alternative coins, the failure of which would attract penalties. He also added that in an economy, a central agency should only issue and control currencies, and those who wish to issue and control an alternative currency would face severe consequences. Since this currency was used by money launderers previously, this currency is not going to work and will collapse completely within no time.\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia doesn’t also show any interest in encouraging the people of their country to deal in such virtual currencies. It is a country where Bitcoin transactions are a dime a dozen. Still, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is of the opinion that there are not enough rules to control the working of virtual currencies, and there is a chance that the bank will reject any transactions that involve Bitcoin.\nThe Bank of America, which was once Bitcoin-friendly and facilitated transactions involving the buying and selling of the cryptocurrency , has now stopped dealing in these coins completely. Until recently, this bank associated with the Bitcoin exchanges to help its clients purchase and sell digital coins.\nThe Central Bank of China was on the verge of taking over of these digital coins when the whole idea fell through since the issuers of Bitcoin stopped any cryptocurrency transactions altogether. The governor of the Central Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda, is totally against digitalizing the central currency of his nation. He reasons it would symbolize the ready access of any layman to the currency system of Japan.\nThe Bundesbank says that the transactions involving Bitcoin are speculative and can be disruptive if Germany allowed its citizens to trade in alternative coins. But this bank is continuously trying to enhance the knowledge relating to the working of these digital coins.\nThe Bank of France has also expressed its fear of adopting virtual coins into its system. It is wary of the data security attacks if the bank allowed transactions involving Bitcoin.\nTo conclude, in spite of the similar working model between these virtual coins and that of fiat currency, no bank or nation has expressed its interest in accepting this virtual currency instead of traditional currency. Many were of the opinion that the introduction of virtual currency would disrupt the working of banks and would infiltrate the data stored in the banking systems. With no country favoring the adoption of digital coins for fiat coins, the future of Bitcoin is at stake. However, the investors can deal with Bitcoin as a part of their investments that would reap huge profits in the future.\nBitcoin Vs.

Culture By Katherine Abughazaleh\nWith a “B” chain around his neck and a flashy white coat, alumnus Arya Bahmanyar launched his rap career six months ago.\nWhen Bahmanyar is performing under his stage name CoinDaddy, he preaches about his passion for Bitcoin – unlike typical rappers.\nBahmanyar, who graduated in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in international business, raps about cryptocurrency in hopes of garnering mainstream interest in the market. Since stepping onto the scene as a joke between friends, CoinDaddy has released more than 40 songs on YouTube. His first release, a meditation tape titled “Affirmations for a Better Trade VOL 1,” was put out after a tough trading day.\n“I was doing a trade and it was just a bad trade. It just went sideways,” he said. “That night, I downloaded software off the internet to make music, and I just made a meditation tape for my friends.”\nBahmanyar makes music from home using free tracks he finds online. His lyrics are full of double entendres, and rapping about sex and alcohol through the frame of Bitcoin. He also raps over instrumentals of popular songs to parody them like Eminem’s “Stan” on the song “Charlie,” in which CoinDaddy accuses himself of plagiarism and drops insider references about the currency.\nMany of the songs contain dense verses about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency that may only be understandable to experts, but an irresistible refrain can carry you through the songs.\n“I don’t know if anybody would really understand them unless you’re really into crypto, as that’s who the target audience was when I first made it,” he said.\nPercussion rattles on the song “Alt Season (Where The Money At?),” an East Coast-style rap that delves into his showboating “pimp” persona with lyrics like, “I’m lightning fast and crypto rich, so hot I start to burn.”\n“Tales from The Blockchain” features a woozy bass drone with trap beats and has lyrics about the luxuries of excess money. In a parody boasting tone, CoinDaddy raps, “I play this game like a sport, sick gains then off to resorts.”\nBahmanyar said he became “obsessed” with cryptocurrency in 2013, after investing his savings in Bitcoin as prices dropped as low as $72 per coin. Today, each coin is worth several thousand dollars.\n“I went all in. Everything,” he said. “I just thought, what’s the worst case scenario? I’m already poor. I can’t get poorer. I just played it cool, and I just kept going, and I was rewarded.”\nAs the only Bitcoin rapper, Bahmanyar said he likes to maintain a sense of humor in his work to attract mainstream audiences and plans to make his music more accessible.\n“I’m thinking now of branching more toward making songs anybody can be a participant in, something anybody can understand, crypto or not,” he said.\nBahmanyar said after three months of releasing videos online, the amateur rapper found his big break. He said stories about him began circulating online and the internet became part of his inside joke. He said he was surprised as pictures of himself were sprawled out on a computer desk, with shimmery flare pants and a white fur coat lined in leopard print.\n“I see my photo, and it’s me dressed in a pimp costume leaned against a computer and I’m like, ‘Oh, my god. No. I was doing this as a joke!’” he said. “It was such a goof, like a big human meme or something.”\nBut CoinDaddy isn’t Bahmanyar’s only claim to cryptocurrency fame. When he’s not onstage at private performances, Bahmanyar is seen speaking at conferences about the advantages of the currency and explaining the system at seminars across the country.\nEven if his parody rap career isn’t sustained, Bahmanyar said he will continue advocating for the currency and hopes to introduce more people to the option as he continues speaking at conferences.\n“My heart and my pulse is crypto. Day in, day out,” Bahmanyar said. “This is all that I do. This is all that I am.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bahmanyar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coindaddy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katherine abughazaleh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason henry/new york times arya bahmanyar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arya bahmanyar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "better trade vol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T13:23:50.096+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c3e3c7f99ac0831167499b98a6b7bdbca10ce09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSUWBNqaav77XEeXi3y.rgA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why China banned bitcoin？", "title_full": "Why China banned bitcoin？", "published": "2018-05-21T12:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c3e3c7f99ac0831167499b98a6b7bdbca10ce09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSUWBNqaav77XEeXi3y.rgA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dhimas Kanjeng", "published": "2018-05-21T12:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why China banned bitcoin？", "text": "All countries that banned bitcoin include china because they worry that the use of bitcoin will make legal currency disappear because people prefer to use bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T08:27:31.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35a6c4d90dc3e67e4b53437e68889c720e4373c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqZ0fHKSS8bVWpV.2cF8lx.mUg.tkqNEMkoiacpfFsqYcisfeVNrYjn", "site_full": "brazil.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://brazil.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Brasil Notícias (Leitor de Notícias) |", "title": "Letter Demands Bitcoin Payment or Scammer Will Reveal Victims’ Secret", "title_full": "Letter Demands Bitcoin Payment or Scammer Will Reveal Victims’ Secret", "published": "2018-05-21T12:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35a6c4d90dc3e67e4b53437e68889c720e4373c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqZ0fHKSS8bVWpV.2cF8lx.mUg.tkqNEMkoiacpfFsqYcisfeVNrYjn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T12:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Letter Demands Bitcoin Payment or Scammer Will Reveal Victims’ Secret", "text": "56 minutes ago Letter Demands Bitcoin Payment or Scammer Will Reveal Victims’ Secret Thousands of men across the U.S. are being targeted in a scam where letters sent to them asking for thousands of dollars, reports WREG.

Ong was apprehended as part of a sting operation by Federal agents. Apart from jail time, Ong must also forfeit about $1.1 million worth of bitcoin and cash.\nThe Sting Operation Ong first appeared on the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) radar in 2016 after he posted an online ad about his bitcoin trading business. Federal agents soon contacted him and in no time had set up a $12,000 bitcoin sale. Ong met with the undercover agents at a Tukwila McDonald's, and the deal went through. The agents again contacted Ong for another deal, this time worth $50,000.\nOne of the red flags for the undercover agents was the high fees charged by Ong. In a statement by the postal inspector to the court:\nBased upon my training and experience, I know that this is a substantially higher service fee than that charged by legitimate, (Treasury Department)-licensed bitcoin exchangers.\nAccording to the details of the operation made available to the media, Ong had a policy of not wanting to know where his clients got their money. After one of the agents let slip about drug deals, Ong is quoted as saying:\nSo, there is one thing I tell people is I don't really care what they use the bitcoin for. It's better that I don't actually know because then I can have plausible deniability. I am not interested in what you buy or sell (bitcoin) for, so please do not mention it or have your friends mention it either.\nThe Arrest After a couple of deals, federal agents confronted Ong as part of an anti-money laundering task force, whereupon he agreed to stop his unlicensed bitcoin trading activities. He broke the terms of the deal, however, and proceeded to conduct three more illegal bitcoin trades with undercover agents. Ong was arrested on July 21, 2017, and charged with five counts of money laundering and one count of running an unregistered money-transmission business. According to the indictment, Ong laundered approximately $290,000.\nU.S. Unlicensed Bitcoin Trading Crackdown Since 2016, tracking domestic bitcoin traders has been a mandate of the DHS task force. It all came about in the aftermath of the arrest of David Burchard for the illegal sale of marijuana using Tor. Since then, several federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and DHS have made several arrests of unlicensed bitcoin traders. In 2017, Missouri native Jason Klein was arrested for selling roughly $75,000 worth of bitcoin to undercover FBI agents.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Treasury department classified bitcoin trading as a \"money services business.\" Thus, bitcoin trading in the country is subject to regulations which make unlicensed crypto trading a criminal offense.\nDo you think the sentence was harsh? Should unlicensed P2P cryptocurrency trading be illegal?

Ong was apprehended as part of a sting operation by Federal agents. Apart from jail time, Ong must also forfeit about $1.1 million worth of bitcoin and cash. The Sting Operation\nOng first appeared on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) radar in 2016 after he posted an online ad about his bitcoin trading business. Federal agents soon contacted him and in no time had set up a $12,000 bitcoin sale. Ong met with the undercover agents at a Tukwila McDonald’s, and the deal went through. The agents again contacted Ong for another deal, this time worth $50,000.\nOne of the red flags for the undercover agents was the high fees charged by Ong. In a statement by the postal inspector to the court:\nBased upon my training and experience, I know that this is a substantially higher service fee than that charged by legitimate, (Treasury Department)-licensed bitcoin exchangers.\nAccording to the details of the operation made available to the media, Ong had a policy of not wanting to know where his clients got their money. After one of the agents let slip about drug deals, Ong is quoted as saying:\nSo, there is one thing I tell people is I don’t really care what they use the bitcoin for. It’s better that I don’t actually know because then I can have plausible deniability. I am not interested in what you buy or sell (bitcoin) for, so please do not mention it or have your friends mention it either. The Arrest\nAfter a couple of deals, federal agents confronted Ong as part of an anti-money laundering task force, whereupon he agreed to stop his unlicensed bitcoin trading activities. He broke the terms of the deal, however, and proceeded to conduct three more illegal bitcoin trades with undercover agents. Ong was arrested on July 21, 2017, and charged with five counts of money laundering and one count of running an unregistered money-transmission business. According to the indictment, Ong laundered approximately $290,000. U.S. Unlicensed Bitcoin Trading Crackdown\nSince 2016, tracking domestic bitcoin traders has been a mandate of the DHS task force. It all came about in the aftermath of the arrest of David Burchard for the illegal sale of marijuana using Tor. Since then, several federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and DHS have made several arrests of unlicensed bitcoin traders. In 2017, Missouri native Jason Klein was arrested for selling roughly $75,000 worth of bitcoin to undercover FBI agents.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Treasury department classified bitcoin trading as a “money services business.” Thus, bitcoin trading in the country is subject to regulations which make unlicensed crypto trading a criminal offense.\nDo you think the sentence was harsh? Should unlicensed P2P cryptocurrency trading be illegal?

But traders and people who just want to get richer by doing nothing (HODLing) was never the intended beneficiary of Bitcoin—it’s the people who try to feed their families but lose their shirts to large financial corporations in the process.\nTo demand that an entire network like Bitcoin Cash yield to one’s goal of getting more money without doing anything, and drop its fundamental principles and pledges to the very people it promised to serve is an ultimate demonstration of unjustifiable and undeserved entitlement. While all rabid fanatics see in their bubble is bull runs and “shooting to the Moon,” in other parts of the world (yes, there are other parts of the world), the main thing people worry about is losing huge chunks of their hard-earned cash to transaction fees, and getting whatever’s left of that money to their families as quick as possible.\nBelieve it or not, contrary to what the comfortable would have themselves conveniently believe, for some,$1 can mean the difference between having food on the table and running on an empty stomach.

Here are a few points from the speakers and how they can help everyone—including those who live on less than $2 a day.

This SDK is that global payment system.”\nThe project is funded by nChain to promote its vision of making it easy for everyone to use Bitcoin Cash for payments. Bitcoin Cash fulfils the original vision for Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system specifically built for worldwide transactions.\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen remarks: “As Centbee has focused on user-friendly Bitcoin wallets and merchant payment solutions we have partnered with them to ensure retailers can accept Bitcoin Cash at in-store points of sale for goods and services. This SDK will make it easier for merchants, through their PoS systems, to join the world of bCommerce. Centbee smartly embraces Bitcoin Cash because of its bigger blocks, low fees and fast transaction network represent the true vision of Bitcoin.”\nLast year, Centbee successfully piloted the acceptance of Bitcoin payments at retail points of sale.\nIn January 2018, nChain’s investment arm, nChain Reaction, made an equity investment in Centbee.\nCentbee was founded in 2016 by co-CEOs, Lorien Gamaroff and Angus Brown. It is a gold member of AlphaCode, the fintech investment arm of Rand Merchant Investment Holdings.\nDominique Collett, head of AlphaCode, comments: “We are excited about what Centbee is doing – helping crypto to go mainstream and providing real-world transactional capability. The Centbee origin story is also a good one as Lorien and Angus met at AlphaCode. This is a great example of how putting smart people in a room together can unlock creative, new ideas and hopefully spawn large, successful businesses.\n“This was the premise of establishing AlphaCode as a fintech community – to stimulate the development of the next generation of financial services entrepreneurs.” Related", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "centbee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy n", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angus brown", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sdk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T09:45:20.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b87526f9e6aa825b4d8797372544288e7ca4934a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRGk_vTO9FCEkoEXvdDSqB8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin is dead?", "title_full": "Bitcoin is dead?", "published": "2018-05-21T11:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b87526f9e6aa825b4d8797372544288e7ca4934a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRGk_vTO9FCEkoEXvdDSqB8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bornMercurial", "published": "2018-05-21T11:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is dead?", "text": "In my view, Bitcoin cannot die because it is the king of all coins.

The buzz about Bitcoins is driven by speculation, an expert said here over the weekend, calling upon Tanzanians to caution injecting their money into cryptocurrencies.\nThe director of treasury and financial markets at CRDB Bank Plc, Mr. Alex Ngusaru, told the bank’s shareholders over the weekend that one should think twice before putting investing his/her money into Bitcoins due to their unpredictable trends.\n“The decision to invest remains purely on the interested individual.\nHowever, I would advise that you only invest in Bitcoins when you have enough extra income,” he said.\nThe figures he produced at the seminar, which was conducted prior to the CRDB’s 23rd Annual General Meeting (AGM), showed just how speculation is driving the value for Bitcoins. On December 15, 2017, the bitcoin registered its highest value with one bitcoin exchanging at $20,000 (roughly Sh44.4 million).\nHowever, on March 31, 2018, the value fell to $7,000 (Sh159 million). As of Thursday, it had picked to $8,500 ( slightly over Sh190 million).\n“Rumours is what makes the value of the bitcoin to rise. This is not the right avenue to invest the money if you don’t have extra cash,” he said. Cryptocurrencies are digital monies that use cryptic algorithms for security and run on a complex code system called blockchain.\nCryptocurrency transactions are generally anonymous and are not subject to any government or central bank regulation. Regulators warn that since cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any central bank, they are a safe haven for money laundering, terrorism financing, tax evasion and fraud.\nA number of high-profile bankers have, at different times, warned against investing in cryptocurrencies.\nThe former Bank of Tanzania Governor, Prof Benno Ndulu, said late last year that Tanzanians involved with cryptocurrencies were doing so at their own risks.\n“We have also heard that there are some groups of people in the country engaging in the business, but my message, for now, is that they should understand that they are putting themselves at risk and we can’t help in case anything bad happens,” Prof Ndulu was quoted as saying last year.\nTidjane Thiam, the chief executive officer for Credit Suisse - a Swiss multinational investment bank and financial services company based in Zürich – said late last year that most banks in the current state of regulation have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency, which has anti-money-laundering challenges.\nThiam added: “From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.”\nThe Citizen ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex ngusaru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ngusaru", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crdb bank plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crdb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "arusha", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T11:54:16.071+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ea1209900250293364a1fe00395a76b901f5be8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStazHI00VAAaXbG3XTJ8qM9qYjzU96wjnTL0joEWNusz.E64TVaZYKQx9Yo5ypoOBlNNj.khhqRod1N520Q.Lai2fD2.jOnHo-", "site_full": "forum.bits.media", "site": "bits.media", "site_section": "https://forum.bits.media/index.php?/forum/70-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8B-%D0%BE-bitcoin-%D0%B8-%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%85/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Разговоры о Bitcoin и криптовалютах - Bitcoin Forum", "title": "Eternal Trusts Bounty Campaign - Bitcoin -", "title_full": "Eternal Trusts Bounty Campaign - Bitcoin - Bitcoin Forum", "published": "2018-05-21T11:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forum.bits.media/uploads/monthly_2017_10/logo_bits.media_s.png.63c66d89ed24f0087a5dc1a84a44af7d.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18487, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ea1209900250293364a1fe00395a76b901f5be8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStazHI00VAAaXbG3XTJ8qM9qYjzU96wjnTL0joEWNusz.E64TVaZYKQx9Yo5ypoOBlNNj.khhqRod1N520Q.Lai2fD2.jOnHo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "swati10", "published": "2018-05-21T11:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Eternal Trusts Bounty Campaign - Bitcoin -", "text": "BOUNTY campaign of Eternal Trusts is live.\nDates: March 15 2018 - August 1 2018 (end of ICO)\nBounty fund: 60 million ETT tokens worth $600,000.

Each of these systems also have a database connected to it: Windows: Database is stored on your local computer. Dropbox: Database is stored on the Dropbox servers. Fedwire: Database is stored on the Fedwire servers. Cryptocurrencies essentially replace the US Dollars (or your local fiat currency) that you use to purchase these software services. The “database” that cryptocurrencies give you access to is based on blockchain technology. More on blockchain technology in the next section of this guide. But wait, what are the software services that you are getting? Isn’t a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin at https://bitcoin.org/en/ just a currency, like US Dollars? Not quite. The goal of cryptocurrencies is usually to improve on some type of existing software system or network. When you send money via PayPal, Fedwire or Western Union, you are basically sending fiat money electronically, similar to Bitcoin. However, that’s where the similarity ends. Platforms like PayPal have severe limitations on what you can and cannot do. For example, you cannot send/receive money from certain countries (like Nigeria). Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin want to make financial transactions more open and accessible to everyone around the world. Other cryptocurrencies solve other problems, which we will explore later in this guide. Is Cryptocurrency Real Money? Yes. Since this is a new concept to most people, it will take some time to become widely accepted.\nThis is where Bitcoin has been instrumental in paving the way for this new technology. Websites like Newegg at https://www.newegg.com/ take Bitcoin, along with the other traditional payment methods. Here’s what the checkout screen looked like after I added a drone to my cart. Payment processor Stripe at https://stripe.com/bitcoin also allows online merchants to accept Bitcoin. Notice that other coins like Ether or Litecoin are not accepted. However, the fact that Bitcoin is accepted, is a big step towards the adoption of other cryptocurrencies. Risks of Cryptocurrency Trading/Investing. Now that you understand the basics, what are the risks of trading these cryptocurrencies? There are quite a few, but here are the top three. 1. Some Technologies Will Fail. Remember that cryptocurrencies are basically software, created by people or companies. So just like Webvan or Pets.com in the dot-com bust, some of these technologies will fail. …and they will fail spectacularly. Right now, there is a lot of buzz around certain cryptocurrencies increasing several thousand percent, in a few months. This has a lot to do with ignorance and hype. Just like when people found out that this new thing called the “internet” would change the world of business. Did it change the world? Of course. But was there a lot of dumb money that overhyped the first wave of internet companies? Totally. So just remember, trading cryptocurrencies is kind of like trading a software stock. Some of the software will change the world.\nOthers will explode in a giant ball of fire. There are also a lot of scam coins out there, so be careful. Like penny stocks that are just a company on paper, almost anyone can create a new cryptocurrency. Learn how to separate the scams from the deeply under-priced currencies. Then use proper risk management and play the odds. 2. It Requires Technical Savvy. Let’s face it, cryptocurrencies were created by super nerds. Like with Linux, there is still quite a bit of technical know-how that is required. You don’t need to know how to code, but if you are “not good with computers” you may want to stay away from cryptocurrency trading, at least until they start building more user friendly interfaces. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not calling anyone dumb. I’m just saying that if you don’t possess a certain skillset, then you shouldn’t get involved in that area. This could cause you to lose a lot of money, very quickly. For example, I don’t know how to sew, so I don’t make my own clothes. If I did try to make my own clothes, everyone who meets me would think I’m a weirdo for wearing messed up pants. You get the picture. So if you aren’t so tech savvy, but still want to get involved, find someone you trust to trade for you. 3. There’s a Lot of Broker and Technology Risk. Since this is emerging technology, there are still a lot of unknowns with trading at scale and how brokers and the software will react to certain surprise events. If you think that Forex brokers are risky, then you should consider cryptocurrency brokers at least twice as risky. Not just because they could be shady, but there a still so many unknowns with the technology. However, I would still trust the bigger cryptocurrency exchanges over a lot of offshore binary options brokers. So the lesson is: Don’t keep too much of your coinage at the brokers. Move them off to your own wallet as soon as possible. I’ll get to wallets later in this guide.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T11:39:42.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5503825bb2d2a9d08013608359e4781017670f32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQLaZAXBJY1YrR_RP79CwNM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin: is it the coin of the future ?", "title_full": "bitcoin: is it the coin of the future ?", "published": "2018-05-21T11:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5503825bb2d2a9d08013608359e4781017670f32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQLaZAXBJY1YrR_RP79CwNM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jcag07", "published": "2018-05-21T11:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin: is it the coin of the future ?", "text": "Yes.

Each of these units generates as much heat as a portable heater, and the energy expenditure to merely get rid of this heat can be significant, depending on factors such as climate and chosen cooling technology, says researcher Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist.\nThe bitcoin network is processing 200,000 transactions per day and the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by end-2018.\n“Bitcoin has a big problem, and it is growing fast,” says De Vries.\nImage: Bitmain Technologies", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435118301776"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T11:38:43.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76642aad733272d617e946f151335768310355c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTNKp5ASFo8gh36fWJmafF85khGRNcHWOWzlOlE.wJ9Su84WDDeOk.uM7_JnGHW1OZff.nNmZLxMKUuDJSjlgTTrs_32iJKwBs-", "site_full": "investomania.co.uk", "site": "investomania.co.uk", "site_section": "https://investomania.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Investomania", "title": "Are investors becoming bored of Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Are investors becoming bored of Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-21T11:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://investomania.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Bitcoin-3-6463.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76642aad733272d617e946f151335768310355c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTNKp5ASFo8gh36fWJmafF85khGRNcHWOWzlOlE.wJ9Su84WDDeOk.uM7_JnGHW1OZff.nNmZLxMKUuDJSjlgTTrs_32iJKwBs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robert Stephens", "published": "2018-05-21T11:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Are investors becoming bored of Bitcoin?", "text": "Are investors becoming bored of Bitcoin? Could Bitcoin become less popular due to its constant volatility? May 21, 2018 Robert Stephens Bitcoin Bitcoin\nThe price of Bitcoin is unchanged on where it was a month ago. During that time, though, the virtual currency has been up by as much as 16% before falling back to its starting price.\nThis level of volatility is not unusual for the cryptocurrency. In 2018 it has been hugely volatile following what was an exceptional 2017 that saw its price rise from $1,000 to almost $20,000.\nNow though, it trades at $8,700 and I wonder if investors are gradually becoming disillusioned with its high level of volatility. After all, any asset which is up and down to such a large extent and in such a short space of time may leave investors feeling as though it is little more than a bet.\nIn my opinion, the long-term potential of Bitcoin is not hugely positive. I think that regulation could have a negative impact on it, with various lawmakers and Central Banks stating in recent months that there are fears surrounding its future usage.\nFurther, the infrastructure required for it to replace traditional currencies does not appear to be in place in my view. And with its supply being limited, it seems to lack the capacity to replace traditional currencies over the medium term in my opinion.\nAs a result, investors may begin to look elsewhere in order to generate investment returns. With the FTSE 100 and other stock markets experiencing significant growth in recent weeks, they may become increasingly attractive compared to Bitcoin.\nSure, the blockchain technology on which the virtual currency is built could have a wide range of uses. But the cryptocurrency itself appears to offer high volatility and limited upside potential in the long run in my view.\nDue to this, I wouldn’t be surprised if investor interest in it diminishes over the medium term, with other assets potentially providing a superior risk to reward ratio for the long term.

Coinsecure bought and sold Bitcoin against the Indian Rupee (INR).\nIts chief security officer, Amitabh Saxena, claimed that the Bitcoins were stolen when he was extracting Bitcoin Gold to distribute to customers . He had saved the private keys in plain text format and was online during the extraction process, which was against standard security protocol, considered very risky when dealing with such large amounts of bitcoin. All of the Bitcoins were transferred to a single wallet address.\nThe parent company of Coinsecure, Bitcoin Traders Pvt Ltd, however, doubted Amitabh Saxena’s story and suspected intentional theft. It filed a complaint stating this on 10 April to police unit Cyber Cell and requested that Saxena’s passport be revoked so he could not flee the country.\nCoinsecure is now sending emails to customers to facilitate the distribution of refunds. Customers have been told that they would be compensated with locked-in rates from 9 April, at a ratio of 90% INR to 10% BTC. According to Coinsecure, authorities have made the refund process very slow since the investigation is ongoing; direct permission from the police is required before any refunds can be sent.\nIt is not clear whether Coinsecure will ever re-open. If the stolen funds are not recovered, they will likely have to go into bankruptcy.\nCoinsecure made news earlier this year by negotiating with the Venezuelan government to be the main exchange for state-backed crypto Petro . This was a risky decision since the president of the United States, Donald Trump, signed an executive order on 19 March, making all Petro dealings illegal . Therefore, Coinsecure could not legally operate in the United States anymore.\nThe close timing between Petro being made illegal and the Coinsecure exchange being compromised and shutdown raised suspicion in some observers that these events were related.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinsecure.in/", "http://bitcoinnews.com/", "https://t.me/bconews", "https://cryptovest.com/news/coinsecure-offers-refunds-to-some-heist-victims-unlocks-exchange/", "https://cryptocoremedia.com/trump-sanctioning-venezuelas-petromoneda/", "https://cryptovest.com/news/venezuela-offers-india-30-discount-on-oil-if-paid-in-petro-cryptocurrency/", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://cryptovest.com/news/indias-coinsecure-loses-33m-in-suspected-insider-bitcoin-heist/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinsecure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amitabh saxena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saxena", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinsecure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin traders pvt ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:26:41.101+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "071ee82bb5f75e020372c9af1a42536058061dac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9zpNrFFAOBDCymGpXRhvvpXQ2mKEN6qpwQXrhPffJHhmF0CYtfdskbQ.fC79RG86RoK3yU4YUYyCtYKJanmSuQ0ygUq.u9CaGZNv8kskfqdpBlE6WZczU.QObu_r88nmlF7O9cN9sORDy24wnSiDt", "site_full": "www.elitepvpers.com", "site": "elitepvpers.com", "site_section": "https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/crypto-currency-trading/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Crypto Currency Trading", "title": "[B]27.50 Euro Amazon bestellung [S] 23 Euro in Bitcoin", "title_full": "[B]27.50 Euro Amazon bestellung [S] 23 Euro in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-21T11:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.259, "main_image": "https://www.elitepvpers.com/images/logo_99x99.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14693, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "071ee82bb5f75e020372c9af1a42536058061dac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9zpNrFFAOBDCymGpXRhvvpXQ2mKEN6qpwQXrhPffJHhmF0CYtfdskbQ.fC79RG86RoK3yU4YUYyCtYKJanmSuQ0ygUq.u9CaGZNv8kskfqdpBlE6WZczU.QObu_r88nmlF7O9cN9sORDy24wnSiDt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CemiPasha", "published": "2018-05-21T11:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "[B]27.50 Euro Amazon bestellung [S] 23 Euro in Bitcoin", "text": "Topic sagt alles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T20:40:29.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c06d79a0dbbd35f004f68f6dd846db618a71660d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOAroOUDaf_dRL4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown -
