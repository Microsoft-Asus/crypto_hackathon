The BTC.com wallet charges something like 300 satoshis per byte for each BCH transaction, which is an overcharge of 30,000%!\nBut there are many other wallets which are overcharging people as well!\nEven worse, the BTC.com wallet also incorrectly states that Bitcoin Cash transactions might take hours to confirm. This is completely untrue... this only applies to Bitcoin BTC. With Bitcoin Cash BCH, all transactions always get confirmed in the very next block.\nSo wallets such as the BTC.com wallet shouldn't really be listed with the same prominence as wallets which actually ARE doing things properly, such as the bitcoin.com wallet.\nAt the very least, let’s put an asterisk next to the wallets which aren't doing things correctly.\nThanks!\np.s.

Morgan , is sinking its toes in a little deeper.\nJ.P. Morgan created a new position dubbed Head of Crypto-Assets Strategy, naming Oliver Harris, previously head of the banking giant’s in-residence program for fintech startups, to the role. With his new title, Harris will seek out cryptocurrency projects that can be taken to market, Fortune has learned.\nFinancial News first reported the news.\nHarris will work under the umbrella of J.P. Morgan’s blockchain initiative, headed by Umar Farooq. The bank has been experimenting with the blockchain -- an immutable ledger of, oftentimes, transactions -- over the past two years in a bid to solve banking-related inefficiencies. One experiment resulted in the creation of Quorum , an Ethereum-based blockchain for payments aimed at businesses. Notably, J.P. Morgan partnered with the team behind cryptocurrency Zcash to increase the privacy on that blockchain . The bank is now said to be considering a spinoff of that project .\nHarris is also set to lead the execution of that project, working closely with Christine Moy, program lead for J.P. Morgan’s Blockchain Center of Excellence.\nThat’s not to say the banking giant is suddenly hopping into Bitcoin trading in the way Goldman Sachs has done -- at least not yet.\nWhen asked about the future of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and the bank potentially trading the asset, J.P. Morgan’s Head of Corporate and Investment Banking told CNBC: “We are looking into the space.”\n“I have no doubt that in one way or another, the technology will play a role,” he said Wednesday. “If we need to clear futures of Bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/2018/05/17/jpmorgan-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/", "https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/jpmorgan-crypto-strategy-20180517", "http://fortune.com/fortune500/jpmorgan-chase/", "http://fortune.com/2017/12/18/jp-morgan-bitcoin-zcash-wilcox/", "https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-blockchain-jpmorgan/jpmorgan-mulls-spin-off-of-blockchain-project-quorum-sources-idUKKBN1GY36O?mod=article_inline", "http://fortune.com/2018/04/02/chase-blockchain-jpmorgan-amber-baldet/", "http://fortune.com/2018/05/02/goldman-sachs-cryptocurrency-trading-desk/", "http://fortune.com/2016/10/04/jp-morgan-chase-blockchain-ethereum-quorum/", "https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/blockchain"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j.p. mo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.p. morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umar farooq", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "j.p. morgan", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T05:03:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b8fbc55a76700d7da46748d1a071d027f1c274a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVCLe79WFDatrrLVIn4yZQ8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Is Bitcoin price ready to touch the moon..??", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin price ready to touch the moon..??", "published": "2018-05-17T19:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b8fbc55a76700d7da46748d1a071d027f1c274a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVCLe79WFDatrrLVIn4yZQ8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rose119", "published": "2018-05-17T19:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin price ready to touch the moon..??", "text": "Quote: from: onrise on May 17, 2018, 01:14:21 PM Quote: from: Rose119 on May 17, 2018, 11:40:14 AM I don't think so. But for now I am just happy because I see that bitcoin will recover again ,well from now that bitcoin will slowly increase I am hoping that this will continue happen because I am holding a bitcoin and I don't want to lose my money.\nIt seems to be difficult because this year has not being that great so far considering few bans in place which is the reason for the fall. Yes the price will eventually be mark upwards to 10k and then 15k and so on. We do require some sort of momentum to pick the price rise and move upwards towards and create a new high price.\nIt is quite challenging to to know exactly how much bitcoin will reach these coming months. What is sure is that, we have to keep our attention to the sudden change of price and also be part of those who actively encourage non bitoin holders to be one of us.

Report - PwC - Economist - Alex - De The report, written by PwC economist Alex de Vries and published in the journal Joule, represents the first thoroughly reviewed estimate of the electricity used by Bitcoin mining and forecast of where the usage is heading.Most estimates up to now have been on the basis of the power efficiency of the hardware used, which gives the 2.55 gigawatt figure. However, de Vries argued this does not take into account other factors, such as cooling requirements, which have a cost of their own. Consumption - Problem - Approaches - Insight - Vries Forecasting future consumption is a whole other problem, and simply using existing approaches offers little insight. de Vries quoted a paper (PDF) which asserted that \"miners will produce [hash calculations] until their marginal costs equal their marginal product\". Author Adam Hayes disregarded hardware as sunk costs. de Vries disagreed and factored it into his work.The marginal product of mining is the number of Bitcoins found per day on average multiplied by the dollar price of Bitcoin. de Vries cited the example of 16 March 2018, when the marginal product was $15.34m.

The following is how you would have fared throughout the years if you had bought $100 worth of bitcoin back in 2011.\n2011: Off to a Good Start\nFor purposes of this comparison over time, the bitcoin market value prices from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index are used, and no fees or additional transactions are assumed, for the sake of simplicity. By buying $100 in bitcoins on Jan. 1, 2011, you would have benefited from a low market value of 30 cents per bitcoin and received a total of 333.33 bitcoins for your initial purchase.\nSince bitcoin traded at 6 cents for most of 2010, you would have timed your initial purchase right. In this first year, you would have had your first taste of the cryptocurrency's high volatility. For a brief moment on June 8, 2011, bitcoin hit a high of $31.91, making the paper value of your investment a cool $10,636.56. By December 31, 2011, bitcoin was trading at $4.72, so you would have turned your $100 into $1,573.32.\n[ You'd be off to a great start if you purchased Bitcoin in 2011, but would you have actually known what you are buying? Would you know what you're buying if you bought today? For those still unsure about how Bitcoin and cryptocurrency work, check out Investopedia Academy's Cryptocurrency for Beginners course. You'll learn the basics of blockchain, mining, the history of Bitcoin, and how to intelligently enter the crypto marketplace today. Enroll today!]\n2012: Steady Increase\nThe first day of 2012 would have welcomed you with a closing price of $5.27, bumping up your investment to $1,756.65. Throughout the first quarter of 2012, the price of bitcoin dipped below the $5 mark. It started appreciating again in May 2012, and closed at $13.51 on December 31, 2012.\nYour current investment would have stood at $4,503.29. In 2012, few businesses accepted bitcoin as a form of payment. For example, bitcoin payment processor BitPay only had 1,000 businesses using its platform. One of those businesses was Utah-based Bees Brothers, so you could have purchased 450 half-pound bags of honey roasted almonds for your friends and family.\n2013: The Big Ride\nUnlike the previous year, 2013 would have welcomed you with a slight dip to $13.30, turning your investment into $4,433.29. Throughout most of this year, you would have been losing sleep over the security of your bitcoins. On March 18, 2013, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued guidelines for individuals using bitcoin in the United States, causing problems for many, including the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange. The attacks by hackers against several bitcoin exchanges and the FBI seizure of more than 170,000 bitcoins from criminal online portal Silk Road caused the market price to go up and down.\nAs the Chinese media started promoting bitcoin as an alternative currency and Baidu began accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for some services, the price of bitcoin hit an all-time high of $1,147.25. Over some exchanges it went on to exceed $1,200 on December 4, 2013. Your paper value would have been $382,412.84. However, bitcoin did not fare well for the rest of the year, ending at $757.50 by December 31, 2013, making your investment worth $252,497.48.\n2014: The Big Downfall\nThe good news is that unlike previous years, in 2014, you could have spent your bitcoins at many companies, including Overstock.com, Microsoft, Dell and Time. Paying in bitcoins offers several advantages, including more convenience in mobile payments. Also, you could have withdrawn funds through an ever-increasing network of bitcoin ATMs around the world.\nHowever, the bad news is you would have seen your investment drop and hit a rock bottom value of $309.87 per bitcoin on December 30, 2014. By the end of this year, your investment would have been worth $106,565.60, or 240 Tribecca Home Uptown modern sofas at Overstock.com.\n2015: Ended Strong\nIn 2015, bitcoin showed a downward trend in price until late October, when the cryptocurrency started trading above $300 again. As of December 2015, bitcoin was trading at $413.51; at this point your investment was worth $137,835.29. This is a 137,735.29% return on your initial $100. The amount is less than half of that all-time high so far of $382,412.84 in November 2013, but still enough to buy a home in Burlington, North Carolina, where the median home value is $132,000 according to real estate marketplace Zillow.com.\n2016: A Nail-Biter\nThe bitcoin started off at $434.46 on January 1st, 2016, and had a relatively stable first quarter. Around the end of May, however, the bitcoin soared and reached $773.94 by mid-June, the highest since 2014. The steep increase was due to sudden Chinese demand, which somewhat decreased in the following weeks pushing the bitcoin back down to $638.22 at the end of the second quarter. Add the end of 2016, your investment was $257,977.42.\n2017-2018: All-Time Highs, And Still Soaring\nIn February 2017, Bitcoin broke its 2013 record and hit the $1169.04 mark (per Coinbase's price index). It hit other milestones as well, surpassing for the first time the price of one Troy ounce of gold. On November 28, 2017 it crossed the $10,000 mark and less than 24 hours later it was trading above $11,000. The price kept surging in December and hit an all-time high of $19,783 on December 17, which would have valued the investment at $6,594,267. Since then, the price has slid, trading at $10,074 on February 16, 2018, making your investment worth around $3,357,965. The price has come down further since then and stands, as of March 22, 2018, at $8,718, making your investment worth around $2,905,970.\nThe Bottom Line\nLearn about the risks of buying bitcoin, and avoid putting all your investments in this or other cryptocurrencies. While having bought and held on to $100 in bitcoin since 2011 would have been profitable, you would have suffered a lot of stress throughout the process.\nRelated Articles\n Tech\n Are There Taxes On Bitcoins?\n Here is a short guide to the tax implications when using or investing in bitcoins in the US.\n Tech\n Countries Where Bitcoin Is Legal & Illegal (DISH, OTSK)\n Although bitcoin has been in existence for five years, most countries still do not have consistent laws regulating the cryptocurrency.

A tech Futurist and Editor of FutureSin. WeChat: mikekevinspencer May 17 Peter Thiel Believes Bitcoin is the Next Digital Gold CoinTelegraph Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Paypal, has in 2018 reportedly bought $ 15–20 million of Bitcoin. Many tech tycoons are betting ‘long’ on Bitcoin, and believe it has the greatest chance of becoming a standard digital gold for the next era. Bitcoin has a digital store of value, instead of a means of transaction, is nothing new. However it’s volatility has made the entire cryptocurrency altcoin group — a highly risky investment for most investors. There are stories of huge gambles and even huge losses . However increasingly, Silicon Valley types are buying into crypto investments as a sort of “a hedge against the whole world falling apart”, the exact quote by Peter Thiel on March 15, 2018. “It’s like bars of gold in a vault that never move, and it’s a sort of hedge of sorts against the whole world going falling apart.” Meanwhile, Peter Thiel’s conviction of Bitcoin’s long-term viability is truly incredible. Peter Thiel’s investment arm, Founders Fund, has apparently, purchased hundreds of millions of the cryptocurrency. In repeated interviews with CNBC , Thiel really believes in Bitcoin as the main catalyst of crypto stores of value. Why exactly tycoons such as Thiel trust Bitcoin as if it will be “the biggest” of the cryptocurrencies for all-time, isn’t quite certain. Bitcoin is not an ecosystem of smart-contracts like a platform, but operates more like a pyramid scheme with a finite number of tokens. Peter Thiel is to put it mildly, a high net worth individual (HNI), with net worth of $2.6 billion in 2017. He can put a few million in a certain kind of investment, and it’s not such a big deal. Peter had made comments as far back as 1999 that monetary sovereignty’s time is limited and encrypted money will revolutionize the entire world. Thus for these Silicon Valley types, Bitcoin and crypto is a self-fulfilling prophecy of the kind of group-think they have been telling themselves and perpetuating for years; since the idealism of their youth. While Peter Thiel remains in the long game of Bitcoin, he’s not a total idiot, he knows the odds and pegs them at around 80 percent, that the world’s first cryptocurrency would ultimately become worthless. People have been claiming the end of money for decades now, and if fiat converted into blockchain digital money is one interpretation — that reality could be upon us as central banks pivot to the blockchain. In the act of doing this however, cryptocurrencies take on a new light and tangibility. If Facebook is building its own blockchain, it’s peer to peer form of payment will probably be a cryptocurrency. A FaceCoin or whatever, could change how consumers and users in countries where access to a bank account is limited, transact with the world, much like how WeChat pay rules transactions on the internet of New China. Peter Thiel according to a recent interview with CNBC, also believes as of 2018, that there is a 20–50 percent chance of Bitcoin going higher in its price. Consensus among Silicon Valley players appears to be that Bitcoin could become a long-term storage asset rather than a go to-asset. Meanwhile in Japan, Bitcoin as a means of transaction is becoming more universally recognized. Asia’s adoption of cryptocurrency markets inspite of regulatory pressure remains years ahead of America. Is Bitcoin the new bar of gold for the crypto investor elite? It’s too expensive to be as such for the average consumer or retail investor. It’s probably too volatile for any sane person to invest in post 2014 prices. It’s sky-rocketing value in late 2017 however, created an artificially high-demand for Bitcoin. It’s given cryptocurrencies a kind of long-tail mystique. There are thousands of altcoins and dozens of decentralized app platforms now, could one among them be the winner to usurp Bitcoin as the next digital gold? Peter Thiel with Paypal, let’s be honest, failed to turn PayPal in to a “new world currency”. PayPal’s fees to this day are as about as alternative as Coinbase, with ludicrously high transaction fees. But the product is convenience, works and has myriad partnerships. Peter Thiel’s ties to Facebook and Paypal makes him an important figure in the history of cryptocurrencies, and whether his bet on Bitcoin rises or falters doesn’t really matter as a footnote in history. Bitcoin was something they believed in, and that built the foundations of a new way of thinking on the blockchain and the emergence of a utility token economy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://creativecommons.org/ns#", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/15/peter-thiel-is-betting-on-bitcoin-to-be-the-online-equivalent-to-gold.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter thiel", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "peter thie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:40:28.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9064001253ae23bd9a5fd3569f2c1a8a8ffb589f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqq3i02RQzTBn3dOYsMG6AcfNqmRfKO.C0CSh1DS6N1JCjr8u467Lr2FW60aN91JNDHbxcDDTbkvQBW_tyBbj1xo.dRpTe4dZjaKCtfTJNyz561NdEetSUpr6f6omXZ1SwCWu0dkeNmNxZ8wayJLyZFOcgyyn3QhB_y5ljsz_eHXw--", "site_full": "technewstube.com", "site": "technewstube.com", "site_section": "http://technewstube.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tech News Tube RSS Feed", "title": "Great Scott!

However, de Vries argued this does not take into account other factors, such as cooling requirements, which have a cost of their own.\nForecasting future consumption is a whole other problem, and simply using existing approaches offers little insight. de Vries Quote: d a paper (PDF) which asserted that \"miners will produce [hash calculations] until their marginal costs equal their marginal product\". Author Adam Hayes disregarded hardware as sunk costs. de Vries disagreed and factored it into his work.\nThe marginal product of mining is the number of Bitcoins found per day on average multiplied by the dollar price of Bitcoin. de Vries cited the example of 16 March 2018, when the marginal product was $15.34m.\nRational behaviour dictates that mining is undertaken while marginal costs (electricity and hardware) are lower than the marginal product, with the two values moving towards an equilibrium. Calculating when that equilibrium, or ceiling, will be hit is at the heart of de Vries' work.\nde Vries told El Reg : \"Of course, if the Bitcoin price continues to rise so would this ceiling.\"\nAdmittedly, the Bitcoin craze has, at times, been anything but rational.\nBy assessing the profitability of Bitcoin mining machine manufacturers such as Bitmain, de Vries was able to put a price on the hardware needed and, along with an assumption that a machine such as the Antminer S9 would last for up to two years, calculate a more accurate estimate of electricity consumption.\nPower spike leads Chinese police to 600-machine mining rig READ MORE Just by using an estimate of Antminer S9 machine production, based on chip orders, de Vries came up with a whopping 8.92 gigawatts of electricity consumed, exceeding that of Austria.\nOf course, fluctuations in the price of electricity matter, and the report works with an average of 5 US cents per kWh. de Vries also admitted that secrecy on the part of mining machine manufacturers makes complete accuracy in estimating the point at which marginal cost and product equilibrium is reached impossible.\nHowever, with governments looking to the future and drafting policies around energy production, the research should give pause for thought. With the average electricity consumed per transaction standing at 300 kWh and potentially exceeding 900 kWh by the end of 2018, de Vries concluded: \"Bitcoin has a big problem, and it is growing fast.\"\nAs for what could be done, de Vries suggested to The Register :\n\"The best thing that could happen would be the replacement of mining with a clean consensus algorithm (these are in full development). On short notice a significant crash in the Bitcoin price might provide some relief.\" ®", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435118301776", "http://www.economicpolicyresearch.org/econ/2015/NSSR_WP_052015.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marty mcfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard speed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nvidia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T20:24:43.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9683cc978af02bb3341f6e5bb07159d6d45daf0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwaez9tRfpoUmxJvWMzQZJe8NwUXAiaTmLNel0.f7DiLmYf4AUo27yttHZWONdXj91zHFW.b6a_8htc.KzISiWnmaG.wmvTzdr87UadtJ5vpyGhOEEw.p6EWaYs2R1Jct07TQVztRDQokFQiSCmOB8W", "site_full": "feedjunkie.com", "site": "feedjunkie.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/feedjunkie", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Feedjunkie.com", "title": "Great Scott!

Ltd, the Chinese company behind the Avalon lineup of hardware equipment which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs, has officially submitted a listing application to Asia's third-largest equities market – the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nAlso Read: HTC to Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency-Focused Smartphone, Exodus\n$1 Billion IPO\nCanaan posted a preliminary prospectus on Tuesday revealing it brought in a revenue of 1.3 billion yuan in 2017 and that its net income jumped over 600% to 361 million yuan. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd. are named as joint sponsors of the proposed offering in the preliminary prospectus. The filing did not specify the amount Canaan will try to raise in the public offering but it is widely expected to be around $1 billion.\nThe Chinese ASIC cryptocurrency hardware market grew to 7.3 billion yuan in 2017 from just 50 million yuan in 2013, Canaan revealed in the filing, and consultant Frost & Sullivan extrapolates, that it will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020. The exact target date for the stock listing Canaan has in mind was not made public, and might change along with other details as the matter is evolving, but a person with knowledge of the situation told Bloomberg the company aims to start trading as soon as July 2018, just about two months from now.\nCanaan to HK The Hong Kong market wasn't the company's only possible avenue for listing. Last year Canaan was known to be looking to list on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market, and earlier this year it was reportedly examining its options for a US-based IPO. The company didn't explain why it eventually picked Hong Kong but it is safe to assume that the less hostile regulatory approach on the island, compared to both mainland China and the US, played a part in the decision.\nBack in April, we reported that the company employs around 200 people in Beijing and Hangzhou, mostly in R&D, and is looking to hire more. Canaan might use its chip development know-how and capabilities to create an unexpected new lineup of products. These can include home appliances such as television sets that mine cryptocurrencies \"while you sleep.\" Other developments include chips to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications and of course new hardware for mining additional cryptocurrencies.\nShould all stock investors add an ASIC producer to their portfolio to get exposure to the bitcoin market?

However, he also points out a few things that need to happen before that.\nIn an interview for CNBC, the chairman of the popular investment company, CoinShares, stood firm that Bitcoin's price will surge once again in a manner similar to the one in 2017. Yet, he outlines that there are two things that need to happen before that – better structuring as well as a comprehensive life cycle after Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\nEnhanced Structure – What Does it Mean? As for the first premise for a potential Bitcoin price surge, Masters outlines that the structure of cryptocurrencies has to continue to build. In his words:\nWe need to see this [cryptocurrency] structure continue to build, […] We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we're talking about and measure our performance.\nWith this, Masters hints that there are plenty of ways for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to go prior to reaching a state of maturity. In other words, the field is still in a rather early stage of its life cycle. To build on to that point, the Chairman of CoinShares says:\nWe're not even at the part yet where I'd say institutional investors even started in commodities. Because these things — indexation, custody and so on — aren't there to bring in those bigger people just yet.\nA lot of things have to come together to solidify the structure of cryptocurrencies. For one, clear regulations have to be laid down. Cryptocurrencies need to be defined. Governments across the world seem to be torn in the way they see them. While some countries like Thailand have already stepped forward to regulate cryptocurrencies as digital assets, others are still to take serious legislative actions.\nICOs – An Important Part Masters also stressed the importance of ICOs, and, most importantly, the way they turn out after the fundraising event is finished:\nWe need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle, […] And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.\nThe statements do have a lot of merit behind them. As it turns out, almost half of the ICOs didn't have any development work done before the ICO itself. What is more, it also seems that the post ICO performance is also poor due to the lack of value of the assets which are being sold. In other words, the tokens people are investing in are not really needed for the system, as noted by a study from ICORating .\nWith such improvements in the cryptocurrency sphere showing that the space is maturing, Masters believes that a rally in the price of Bitcoin will happen.\nDo you think that we'll see a surge in Bitcoin price like we did in late 2017?

Bhatt had claimed that he was kidnapped by Anant Patel and other policemen from Amreli Local Crime Branch and kept at a farmhouse near Gandhinagar.\nThe CID, that is handling the case, for its part had arrested Kirit Paladiya, who it says is the mastermind of the conspiracy. The CID had claimed that Paladiya stole 176 bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore from his partner, Shailesh Bhatt, by roping in Amreli policemen to enact the entire kidnap drama and that no bitcoins had been transferred to policemen’s accounts.\nThe CID crime claim that Paladiya was closely associated with ex-legislator Kotadia, who has given Rs 66 lakh of Rs 12 crore as his share. They also claim to have recovered Rs 25 lakh from a Rajkot-based builder, who is said to be close to Kotadia.\nBigger scam?\nKotadia for his part claims that the entire scam was not worth just Rs 12 crore as suggested by police but worth over Rs 240 crore. Fearing arrest, Kotadia in a social media statement earlier had also threatened to commit suicide with his family if complainant Sailesh Bhatt is not arrested.\nKotadia, who had won Gujarat Assembly elections in 2012 as representative of Gujarat Parivartan Party led by former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, became BJP legislator as Keshubhai merged his GPP with BJP. He, however, turned against BJP during the last Presidential polls and on the issue of Patel quota stir in the state.\n\"The only option left before the accused now is to either surrender or apply for anticipatory bail,\" Sudhir Brahmbhatt, a lawyer representing state agencies, said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirit paladiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anant patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nalin kotadia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "guj bjp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amreli local crime branch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paladiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gandhinagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amreli", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:07:47.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81e92e5b07f3aa161b72e46bdfb20815e71a29e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQH6.BkPOqy24SUtVKleSycggALXE7rNjwUraw57HkrIG8MtRW.JLbqDy3KCM1evzvs5VIB7CqEBPJufSLuv9vpHBl3ZqMUrjyCqRp5Nt.KSA--", "site_full": "hanistudio10.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://hanistudio10.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HANI STUDIO | Your Free Online Computer Academy", "title": "Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining Get 110 Ghs free Best New Free Cloud mining", "title_full": "Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining Get 110 Ghs free Best New Free Cloud mining", "published": "2018-05-17T19:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81e92e5b07f3aa161b72e46bdfb20815e71a29e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQH6.BkPOqy24SUtVKleSycggALXE7rNjwUraw57HkrIG8MtRW.JLbqDy3KCM1evzvs5VIB7CqEBPJufSLuv9vpHBl3ZqMUrjyCqRp5Nt.KSA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hani Studio (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T19:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining Get 110 Ghs free Best New Free Cloud mining", "text": "\nLink: http://tmearn.com/PUX0JE2 http://zipansion.com/jLoN Hi Guys Welcome to my youtube channel #hanistudio and i will show you in this video free bitcoin cloud mining fast site and Get free 110 GH/s Cloud mining power free best free bitcoin cloud mining and free cloud mining. if you want to watch more videos subscribe my channel and press bell icon for my updated videos notifications Thanks for watching ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T19:18:40.079+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c62d6d7cb311f8dff093c41493461244e9eaf7c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUy6gDzi20gTNRz8GrGdq9M-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marketplace", "title": "Will bitcoin disappear in the future?", "title_full": "Will bitcoin disappear in the future?", "published": "2018-05-17T19:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.047, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c62d6d7cb311f8dff093c41493461244e9eaf7c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUy6gDzi20gTNRz8GrGdq9M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James_Potter", "published": "2018-05-17T19:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin disappear in the future?", "text": "I think it's not disappeared, but I'll change to another form.

The low for the day reached $8200 on the Coinbase exchange. The high extended to $8483.48. The high price did find sellers just ahead of the 100 hour MA at $8487.74 currently. The sellers keep control as long as the price stays below that MA. We are currently trading near unchanged levels at $8303, up $12 on the day. A move below the swing low from May 12 at $8223, should see a run toward the two lows from yesterday around the $8100 level. A break below, would open the door for more selling. Looking at the daily chart below, Bitcoin remains below the 100 day MA at $8842.10. That has been the case for the last 6 or so trading days. On more downside, swing lows at $7822 and $7310 are the next targets. A trend line cuts across at $6954 SUMMARY: The sellers remain in control in Bitcoin below the 100 hour MA, but price action remains muted and up and down.

In mid-February, it was reported that crypto mining in the country of Iceland would consume more energy than households in 2018. The debate over whether Bitcoin mining is overly harmful for the environment is seen by some as a non-issue, due to the real need for Bitcoin in underbanked countries.\nDe Vries told the Independent, however, that “half a percent is already quite shocking:”\n“It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.” The scientific study goes into detail about the different types of Bitcoin miners and their individual energy usage, noting that “trying to measure the electricity consumed by the Bitcoin mining machines producing all those hash calculations remains a challenge to date.” De Vries uses Bitmain’s Antminers as his main example to show how much energy each machine uses in its lifetime. As De Vries’s study is the first time data on Bitcoin energy consumption has been peer-reviewed, he hopes his paper will “get the conversation started,” as he believes that the world needs “more scientific discussion on where this network is headed” as opposed to “back-of-the-envelope calculations,” he told the Independent.\nConversely, the technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain , is being used to alleviate environmental impact in some cases. This week, IBM announced a partnership with Veridium Labs with the aim of tokenizing carbon credits to allow companies to better track their carbon footprint through blockchain, potentially allowing them to reduce their carbon impact.

I’m particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed. I don’t think we are ready. So I’m still paying attention to Alipay … to the US dollar, and the euro. We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don’t care about Bitcoin.”\nLast year, Jack Ma became the richest man in Asia, according to Bloomberg, with his net worth surging to $41.8 bln. The overwhelmingly popular mobile payment app Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, reportedly has 450 mln users.\nAs early as summer 2016, Ant Financial, introduced blockchain technology to improve accountability in its work with the Chinese charity industry, going on to recruit blockchain experts in the company at large the following year.\nHowever, in line with Ma’s position, Alibaba Group has stopped short of embracing cryptocurrencies, with Alibaba Cloud recently denying rumours its newly launched ‘P2P Nodes’ network was a cryptocurrency mining platform. Later, in April, Alibaba subsidiary Taobao banned all ICO-related advertising from its platform.

However, he also points out a few things that need to happen before that.\nIn an interview for CNBC, the chairman of the popular investment company, CoinShares, stood firm that Bitcoin’s price will surge once again in a manner similar to the one in 2017. Yet, he outlines that there are two things that need to happen before that – better structuring as well as a comprehensive life cycle after Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Enhanced Structure – What Does it Mean?\nAs for the first premise for a potential Bitcoin price surge, Masters outlines that the structure of cryptocurrencies has to continue to build. In his words:\nWe need to see this [cryptocurrency] structure continue to build, […] We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we’re talking about and measure our performance.\nWith this, Masters hints that there are plenty of ways for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to go prior to reaching a state of maturity. In other words, the field is still in a rather early stage of its life cycle. To build on to that point, the Chairman of CoinShares says:\nWe’re not even at the part yet where I’d say institutional investors even started in commodities. Because these things — indexation, custody and so on — aren’t there to bring in those bigger people just yet.\nA lot of things have to come together to solidify the structure of cryptocurrencies. For one, clear regulations have to be laid down. Cryptocurrencies need to be defined. Governments across the world seem to be torn in the way they see them. While some countries like Thailand have already stepped forward to regulate cryptocurrencies as digital assets, others are still to take serious legislative actions. ICOs – An Important Part\nMasters also stressed the importance of ICOs, and, most importantly, the way they turn out after the fundraising event is finished:\nWe need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle, […] And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.\nThe statements do have a lot of merit behind them. As it turns out, almost half of the ICOs didn’t have any development work done before the ICO itself. What is more, it also seems that the post ICO performance is also poor due to the lack of value of the assets which are being sold. In other words, the tokens people are investing in are not really needed for the system, as noted by a study from ICORating .\nWith such improvements in the cryptocurrency sphere showing that the space is maturing, Masters believes that a rally in the price of Bitcoin will happen.\nDo you think that we’ll see a surge in Bitcoin price like we did in late 2017?

One day you’re going to pay in bitcoin or Ether.”\nDavis, who says he was a day trader in the 90s, bought his first digital currency in February, after the crash. He’d been tracking it since last summer.\nHis interest was piqued after a friend offered to pay him for some mechanical work in Ethereum. Now Davis also holds Litecoin and bitcoin, and says that although his portfolio is up about 10 percent, watching his cryptocurrency rise brings other rewards.\n“I put skin in the game to increase my interest and involvement,” Davis explains. “Now that I’m invested in it, the learning means something.”\nThe blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrency is also creating other ways to invest.\nOne couple at the Meetup talked about their plan to build a real estate portfolio by issuing blockchain-enabled security tokens through a crowd sale. Each security token will give the investor a share in an LLC, and proceeds will be used to purchase properties like a $16 million apartment building on Herman Street in Nashville and others in Tennessee cities like Memphis and Chattanooga.\nThe couple, Luis A. del Mazo, Jr. and Tanya Rodriguez, who both work for Benchmark Realty, hopes to raise $10 million to $50 million for their project from individuals both inside and outside the United States. They must be “accredited investors,” with a minimum net worth of $1 million, excluding primary residence, and $200,000 income for each of the past two years.\n“It is a gamble, and that’s why it’s for accredited investors,” del Mazo acknowledges.\n“I think in the future a lot of people are going to do this to raise money for their businesses.”\nCurrently there are some 1,500 digital currencies out there. The best known are bitcoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. New currencies are being issued all the time as “tokens” through initial coin offerings (ICOs), often by startup businesses as a way to raise money. Many trade for pennies.\nAs with the real estate token project, ICOs give early investors the possibility of being in on the ground floor of a project that could take off in the future. But ICOs that promise high rates of return could violate Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The SEC is closely monitoring ICOs to protect consumers from fraud and abuse.\nThat’s as it should be, says Gray Sasser, attorney with Frost Brown Todd in Nashville, who advises companies in the area of blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n“There are some truly bad actors in this space … people trying to stand up a token that does absolutely nothing, marketed in a get-rich-quick scheme. Any token that is marketed as something that is going to go up in value very quickly I would steer away from,” Sasser adds.\n“These things should be considered long-term investments because they are usually at an early stage in the project’s lifetime, so to ever receive a return would be a long time in the future, and you should really only be investing in a project that you understand.” Follow us on Facebook, Twitter & RSS: Sign-Up For Our FREE email edition Get the news first with our free weekly email Name", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eddie davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "third world", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T19:31:52.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fdacdc1cf35b9b4c4cd5b8f6d94f6a3661623d47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg87QClJIy4ce_f7._0N1DcbSks_WFyalw2NsfHUDIOKPUp_UggdZskShJepnDXKF.eysS5xaWRlgbImbxPLCkKykyGqXijpLmqkM3QrO2wVcNfIDTwSNJn_2WpAlmeL4NU37u8zaSX.gh9QQfo327Ge", "site_full": "www.zerohedge.com", "site": "zerohedge.com", "site_section": "https://www.zerohedge.com/archive/all", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Archive | Zero Hedge", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin And Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential In A Decade", "title_full": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin And Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential In A Decade | Zero Hedge", "published": "2018-05-17T19:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 31, "participants_count": 27, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/2018-05/725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80ZWU2MTIyODI5OGYzNWRiOWQwOGExYjE3MGNkNGZmZS5qcGc%3D.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2435, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fdacdc1cf35b9b4c4cd5b8f6d94f6a3661623d47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg87QClJIy4ce_f7._0N1DcbSks_WFyalw2NsfHUDIOKPUp_UggdZskShJepnDXKF.eysS5xaWRlgbImbxPLCkKykyGqXijpLmqkM3QrO2wVcNfIDTwSNJn_2WpAlmeL4NU37u8zaSX.gh9QQfo327Ge", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tyler Durden", "published": "2018-05-17T19:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin And Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential In A Decade", "text": "Authored by Veronika Rinecker via CoinTelegraph.com,\nApple’s co-founder Steve \"Woz\" Wozniak has commented positively about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in his opening speech at the WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\nimage courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nAccording to a report by Cointelegraph auf Deutsch Wednesday, May 16, Wozniak considers blockchain to be a “great idea.” He further said:\n“[Blockchain] is the next major IT revolution that is about to happen.”\nWozniak explained his positive outlook on blockchain by the fact that there are many useful applications for the technology in a number of areas.\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrencies will achieve their full potential in a decade, according to Wozniak.

However, he also points out a few things that need to happen before that.\nIn an interview for CNBC, the chairman of the popular investment company, CoinShares, stood firm that Bitcoin’s price will surge once again in a manner similar to the one in 2017. Yet, he outlines that there are two things that need to happen before that – better structuring as well as a comprehensive life cycle after Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Enhanced Structure – What Does it Mean?\nAs for the first premise for a potential Bitcoin price surge, Masters outlines that the structure of cryptocurrencies has to continue to build. In his words:\nWe need to see this [cryptocurrency] structure continue to build, […] We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we’re talking about and measure our performance.\nWith this, Masters hints that there are plenty of ways for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to go prior to reaching a state of maturity. In other words, the field is still in a rather early stage of its life cycle. To build on to that point, the Chairman of CoinShares says:\nWe’re not even at the part yet where I’d say institutional investors even started in commodities. Because these things — indexation, custody and so on — aren’t there to bring in those bigger people just yet.\nA lot of things have to come together to solidify the structure of cryptocurrencies. For one, clear regulations have to be laid down. Cryptocurrencies need to be defined. Governments across the world seem to be torn in the way they see them. While some countries like Thailand have already stepped forward to regulate cryptocurrencies as digital assets, others are still to take serious legislative actions. ICOs – An Important Part\nMasters also stressed the importance of ICOs, and, most importantly, the way they turn out after the fundraising event is finished:\nWe need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle, […] And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.\nThe statements do have a lot of merit behind them. As it turns out, almost half of the ICOs didn’t have any development work done before the ICO itself. What is more, it also seems that the post ICO performance is also poor due to the lack of value of the assets which are being sold. In other words, the tokens people are investing in are not really needed for the system, as noted by a study from ICORating .\nWith such improvements in the cryptocurrency sphere showing that the space is maturing, Masters believes that a rally in the price of Bitcoin will happen.\nDo you think that we’ll see a surge in Bitcoin price like we did in late 2017?

Intolab , che ha accolto &nd Project , collettivo partenopeo composto da Fabrizio Monsellato , Nicola Piscopo , Salvatore Ricci e Federica Romano . In un gioco di reciproca ospitalitŕ, a partire dallo spazio di Intolab, situato allinterno dellEx Lanificio Militare, grande complesso industriale su via Carbonara, &project ci prova a modo suo. Qui si svolge Imbasciata, un progetto di residenze dedicato agli artisti e collettivi invitati, da diverse zone dell'Italia, a presentare il proprio lavoro e il proprio modus operandi. Current project di Milano, per il secondo appuntamento sono stati invitati i bolognesi dellartist run space Tripla ( Paolo Bufalini e Filippo Cecconi ). Il video in esposizione per \"Nugget\", č dedicato allandamento del bitcoin, la moneta virtuale ormai divenuta una realtŕ, e chiarisce non solo il sostrato teorico del collettivo ma anche la modalitŕ di reperimento delle risorse per la produzione. Ad accompagnare il video, un testo di Leonardo Fabbri che sembra ricucire il rapporto tra la moneta virtuale, simbolo di questi anni, e lantica propensione alla smaterializzazione che affonda le sue radici nella genesi della cultura occidentale. Tra spazi, artisti e collettivi, occorre, perň, fare attenzione alluso del termine \"indipendente, avverte Monsellato, per il quale Imbasciata č un pretesto di incontro. nd project, infatti, si avvale inevitabilmente di rapporti di dipendenza tra i suoi stessi membri, oltre che tra il gruppo e gli interlocutori esterni. In questottica, la relazione cercata con realtŕ parallele e localizzate in altre cittŕ si rivela una ricerca di confronto sul campo per conoscere modi differenti di declinare una stessa urgenza di produzione, esposizione e rappresentazione. Prossimo impegno in agenda, dal 13 al 17 giugno, con il collettivo, di Polignano a Mare.

Ltd, the Chinese company behind the Avalon lineup of hardware equipment which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs, has officially submitted a listing application to Asia’s third-largest equities market – the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nAlso Read: HTC to Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency-Focused Smartphone, Exodus $1 Billion IPO\nCanaan posted a preliminary prospectus on Tuesday revealing it brought in a revenue of 1.3 billion yuan in 2017 and that its net income jumped over 600% to 361 million yuan. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd. are named as joint sponsors of the proposed offering in the preliminary prospectus. The filing did not specify the amount Canaan will try to raise in the public offering but it is widely expected to be around $1 billion.\nThe Chinese ASIC cryptocurrency hardware market grew to 7.3 billion yuan in 2017 from just 50 million yuan in 2013, Canaan revealed in the filing, and consultant Frost & Sullivan extrapolates, that it will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020. The exact target date for the stock listing Canaan has in mind was not made public, and might change along with other details as the matter is evolving, but a person with knowledge of the situation told Bloomberg the company aims to start trading as soon as July 2018, just about two months from now. Canaan to HK\nThe Hong Kong market wasn’t the company’s only possible avenue for listing. Last year Canaan was known to be looking to list on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market, and earlier this year it was reportedly examining its options for a US-based IPO. The company didn’t explain why it eventually picked Hong Kong but it is safe to assume that the less hostile regulatory approach on the island, compared to both mainland China and the US, played a part in the decision.\nBack in April, we reported that the company employs around 200 people in Beijing and Hangzhou, mostly in R&D, and is looking to hire more. Canaan might use its chip development know-how and capabilities to create an unexpected new lineup of products. These can include home appliances such as television sets that mine cryptocurrencies “while you sleep.” Other developments include chips to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications and of course new hardware for mining additional cryptocurrencies.\nShould all stock investors add an ASIC producer to their portfolio to get exposure to the bitcoin market?

Ltd, the Chinese company behind the Avalon lineup of hardware equipment which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs, has officially submitted a listing application to Asia's third-largest equities market – the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nAlso Read: HTC to Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency-Focused Smartphone, Exodus\n$1 Billion IPO\nCanaan posted a preliminary prospectus on Tuesday revealing it brought in a revenue of 1.3 billion yuan in 2017 and that its net income jumped over 600% to 361 million yuan. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd. are named as joint sponsors of the proposed offering in the preliminary prospectus. The filing did not specify the amount Canaan will try to raise in the public offering but it is widely expected to be around $1 billion.\nThe Chinese ASIC cryptocurrency hardware market grew to 7.3 billion yuan in 2017 from just 50 million yuan in 2013, Canaan revealed in the filing, and consultant Frost & Sullivan extrapolates, that it will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020. The exact target date for the stock listing Canaan has in mind was not made public, and might change along with other details as the matter is evolving, but a person with knowledge of the situation told Bloomberg the company aims to start trading as soon as July 2018, just about two months from now.\nCanaan to HK The Hong Kong market wasn't the company's only possible avenue for listing. Last year Canaan was known to be looking to list on China's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market, and earlier this year it was reportedly examining its options for a US-based IPO. The company didn't explain why it eventually picked Hong Kong but it is safe to assume that the less hostile regulatory approach on the island, compared to both mainland China and the US, played a part in the decision.\nBack in April, we reported that the company employs around 200 people in Beijing and Hangzhou, mostly in R&D, and is looking to hire more. Canaan might use its chip development know-how and capabilities to create an unexpected new lineup of products. These can include home appliances such as television sets that mine cryptocurrencies \"while you sleep.\" Other developments include chips to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications and of course new hardware for mining additional cryptocurrencies.\nShould all stock investors add an ASIC producer to their portfolio to get exposure to the bitcoin market?

March 25, 2018 WSP\nIn a recent interview with The Times , the chief executive officer and chairman of payment platform Square, Inc., (and CEO of Twitter) Jack Dorsey predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) has a real shot at replacing the mighty dollar and become the single global currency of the internet in the near future.\n“The world ultimately will have a single currency, the internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin,” Dorsey said, adding that the timeline would play out “probably over ten years, but it could go faster.” In spite of acknowledging that bitcoin “does not have the capabilities right now to become an effective currency,” Dorsey thinks that since its official launch in 2009, the digital currency – which needless to say, has rapidly evolved into a major global currency, store of value, and safe haven asset – will continue to develop over time as improvements of the cryptographically enhanced digital ledger that underpins bitcoin and most cryptos roll out.\n“It’s slow and it’s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable,” Dorsey told The Times about the world’s number one currency which has seen massive growth rates in major regions such as Japan, the U.S., South Korea, and Hong Kong. Dorsey has become increasingly involved in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. In fact, in late January, Square’s peer-to-peer payment app called Square Cash began offering bitcoin buying and selling in most US states, excluding the State of New York, Georgia, Hawaii and Wyoming.\nDorsey also participated earlier this month in a seed financing round of $2.5 million for Lightning Labs , a blockchain startup that specializes in a technology that can potentially make bitcoin transactions cheaper, faster and more efficient. Dorsey’s comments come even as Bitcoin’s price remains below its peak of nearly $20,000 printed in December 2017.\nThe crypto has plunged in value over the past three months and is now close to sinking back below the $8.500 level. The $146 billion market cap cryptocurrency skyrocketed from a little under $1,000 in January of last year, ending 2017 more than 1,400 percent higher. It should be noted that all of the major digital currencies, including Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH), have seen the same nosedive, with many dropping even more dramatically than BTC.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bitcoin-will-become-the-worlds-single-currency-tech-chief-says-66slm0p6b"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T19:34:42.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74721cc2406d7878f6e1d5e476d5823f2b2fa106", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSa4IlOUDHI9NLmvuAGN1BQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What Caused the Boom in Bitcoin", "title_full": "What Caused the Boom in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-17T18:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74721cc2406d7878f6e1d5e476d5823f2b2fa106", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSa4IlOUDHI9NLmvuAGN1BQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cybil", "published": "2018-05-17T18:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Caused the Boom in Bitcoin", "text": "Well maybe because of gaining users of bitcoin.

Jack Dorsey: Cryptocurrency Evangelist\nTwitter has long been a platform that has been centric for cryptocurrency users and organizations. It quickly became a way in which crypto-related entities could convey announcements and talk about cryptocurrencies with members of the community.\nThis may have been no accident as Twitter’s CEO, who also runs the mobile payment processor, Square , has come out in full support of cryptocurrencies at this year’s Consensus conference.\nWhile Jack Dorsey was on stage at Consensus, the CEO of Twitter and Square stated :\nThe internet is going to have a native currency so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.\nDorsey also added that he is a “huge fan” of the growing industry and supports the technologies which help to assist cryptocurrencies and related developments. Square CEO Jack Dorsey wants his company to be at the forefront of getting cryptocurrency accepted as legitimate means of global payment. https://t.co/xfIYMAgNak\n— CNBC (@CNBC) May 16, 2018 Tech Giants vs ICO Advertisements\nDespite the CEO’s positive outlook on the cryptocurrency space, Twitter has shown a negative attitude toward the release of cryptocurrency-related ads on their service, banning ICO and cryptocurrency crowd sale advertisements in March.\nA Twitter spokesperson gave CNBC a statement on the matter, saying:\nWe are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally.\nThis announcement came after similar announcements from Google and Facebook, who also banned ads related to cryptocurrency crowd sales from their respective platforms.\nAlthough it may be a bit late, Microsoft’s Bing platform has joined the ranks of those banning cryptocurrency advertisements, announcing that they would do the same just the other day.\nIn direct contradiction of Twitter’s ban of ICO advertisements, Dorsey’s other venture, Square, has come out in full support of cryptocurrencies, launching Bitcoin trading on one of its apps in January.\nThe launch of Bitcoin trading on their Cash platform was the first move which Square made into the cryptocurrency space. As of yet, Square has yet to accept cryptocurrencies as a way in which consumers can pay merchants for products, who have traditionally used high-fee credit cards.\nBut it seems that Square does have plans to accept a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in the future, as Dorsey noted:\nIf we were able to use it (Bitcoin) as a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in.\nThe possibility of an addition of cryptocurrencies to the Square platform may be promising for the industry as Square has been growing faster than Paypal’s subsidiary, Venmo, another upcoming payment processing platform.\nThe aforementioned addition of cryptocurrency trading to Square’s Cash platform was an unbridled success, as millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin were quickly sold on the platform. At the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2018, Square reported that they had sold $34.1 million worth of Bitcoin in their first quarter, spending $33.9 million to acquire the same Bitcoin.\nDespite the success of the arrival of cryptocurrency trading on Square, it was still a controversial topic within the internal structure of the company. In Dorsey’s speech at Consensus, he mentioned, “We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology.” He even mentioned how the debate over the addition of cryptocurrencies was prevalent “all the way at the board level.”\nEven with the presence of “healthy discussion” about cryptos at Square, with Jack Dorsey at the helm, it can be assured that Square will continue to make moves to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies in the near future.\nWhat do you think of Jack Dorsey’s statements? Do you like them, hate them, or are indifferent? What moves do you think Twitter and Square should make to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies and related technologies?

The built-in reward for this process is fixed, so it motivates participants to constantly add new machines to the network to get a bigger slice of the pie—the more computational power the more you win.”\nThe demand for electricity increases as bitcoin mining becomes more popular.\n“Mining power is high and getting higher, thanks to a computational arms race, Roberto Frota Decourt, a cryptocurrency expert at the Unisinos Business School in Brazil who wasn’t involved in the new study, told Gizmodo. “The required number of zeros at the beginning of a hash is tweaked biweekly to adjust the difficulty of creating a block—and more zeros means more difficulty. The bitcoin algorithm adds these zeros in order to keep the rate at which blocks are added constant, at one new block every 10 minutes. The idea is to compensate for the mining hardware becoming more and more powerful.”\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://gizmodo.com/alarming-study-suggests-bitcoin-consumes-an-astonishing-1826075745"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gizmodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T07:22:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "97fba6c603cd217219c85a6e8448521b66c419d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__35vSvVIpbi1Bf2lsp0YEHOx5bub_GucdyKI1_FrsuvT2jt6MAcS10sqdOBpxCq0zJw--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Manufacturer Canaan Files for Hong Kong Stock Exchange IPO", "title_full": "Bitcoin Mining Manufacturer Canaan Files for Hong Kong Stock Exchange IPO", "published": "2018-05-17T18:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "97fba6c603cd217219c85a6e8448521b66c419d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__35vSvVIpbi1Bf2lsp0YEHOx5bub_GucdyKI1_FrsuvT2jt6MAcS10sqdOBpxCq0zJw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T18:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Manufacturer Canaan Files for Hong Kong Stock Exchange IPO", "text": "Home » bitcoin news » crypto coin » crypto news » Bitcoin Mining Manufacturer Canaan Files for Hong Kong Stock Exchange IPO Bitcoin Mining Manufacturer Canaan Files for Hong Kong Stock Exchange IPO bitcoin news , crypto coin , crypto news #bitcoin #news # invest #money\nCanaan Creative Co. Ltd, the Chinese company behind the Avalon lineup of hardware equipment which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs, has officially submitted a listing application to Asia’s third-largest equities market – the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nAlso Read: HTC to Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency-Focused Smartphone, Exodus $1 Billion IPO\nCanaan posted a preliminary prospectus on Tuesday revealing it brought in a revenue of 1.3 billion yuan in 2017 and that its net income jumped over 600% to 361 million yuan. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd. are named as joint sponsors of the proposed offering in the preliminary prospectus. The filing did not specify the amount Canaan will try to raise in the public offering but it is widely expected to be around $1 billion.\nThe Chinese ASIC cryptocurrency hardware market grew to 7.3 billion yuan in 2017 from just 50 million yuan in 2013, Canaan revealed in the filing, and consultant Frost & Sullivan extrapolates, that it will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020. The exact target date for the stock listing Canaan has in mind was not made public, and might change along with other details as the matter is evolving, but a person with knowledge of the situation told Bloomberg the company aims to start trading as soon as July 2018, just about two months from now. Canaan to HK\nThe Hong Kong market wasn’t the company’s only possible avenue for listing. Last year Canaan was known to be looking to list on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market, and earlier this year it was reportedly examining its options for a US-based IPO. The company didn’t explain why it eventually picked Hong Kong but it is safe to assume that the less hostile regulatory approach on the island, compared to both mainland China and the US, played a part in the decision.\nBack in April, we reported that the company employs around 200 people in Beijing and Hangzhou, mostly in R&D, and is looking to hire more. Canaan might use its chip development know-how and capabilities to create an unexpected new lineup of products. These can include home appliances such as television sets that mine cryptocurrencies “while you sleep.” Other developments include chips to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications and of course new hardware for mining additional cryptocurrencies.\nShould all stock investors add an ASIC producer to their portfolio to get exposure to the bitcoin market?

Sponsored Links\n“The internet is going to have a native currency so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen,” he said.\nDorsey was speaking during what has been dubbed “Blockchain Week,” a partnership with city authorities that is feting blockchain technology and altcoins and positioning New York as an attractive blockchain destination.\nTwitter and Square CEO, Jack Dorsey . Source: YouTube Global Transactions Made Easy\nDorsey pointed out that the employment of digital currency – bitcoin or otherwise – would facilitate many things, among them his company’s entrance into new markets. Dorsey wants Square to lead the pack in establishing cryptocurrency as a globally accepted means of payment.\nAdamant that the internet will one day have a “native currency,” Dorsey is active in legitimizing virtual currency payments heading into the future. He also said that while he couldn’t predict whether bitcoin will fill the role of default internet currency, he hoped that it should become so. “I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be,” Dorsey said.\nDorsey is eyeing the benefits to his business of a future realm in which digital currencies are the default payment methodology, especially when transacting online. He is on record as a “huge fan” of bitcoin and as enamored of the underlying technology as millions of others. Speaking on the possibilities, he said that “If we were able to use it a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in.”\nThe Twitter chief outlined the now unnecessary issues faced when a company approached any new market on the back of fiat currencies. Local currency issues have to be factored into the approach at the outset, even before a local banking partner, compliance with local regulatory dictates and other necessities are resolved. In spite of jeering from some quarters, Square began offering users cryptocurrency trading via its Cash app in January 2018.\nIn the first quarter post-launch, Dorsey’s payments processing company sold $34.1 million in bitcoin. Such was Dorsey’s enthusiasm that he initially bought $33.9 million on bitcoin so that users found a fluid marketplace of trading when Square opened. Hence, the real net of the first quarter was around $200,000. That said, according to Nomura Instinet, Square’s mobile app is beating PayPal’s Venmo offer, growing faster because of its acceptance of bitcoin. Dorsey The Bitcoin Bull\nDorsey said in March 2018 that he felt confident that bitcoin would become a single, global currency over the coming decade. Dorsey is a bitcoin investor, trader, and enthusiast, carrying the original ethos of the cryptocurrency paying for life on a daily basis. When making his prediction in March, he added that the advent of a global bitcoin as default payment “could go faster” than ten years.\nStanley Druckenmiller, the celebrity investor, has along with some other commentators expressed skepticism over bitcoin.\nSpeaking to CNBC in December 2017, he said that bitcoin was a failed project because “you can’t do transactions, particularly retail transactions, with this kind of volatility.”\nTrue as that might be, Druckenmiller may also have vested interests at play in rubbishing bitcoin, which is trading at $8,280.60 at the time of writing.

The filing did not specify the amount Canaan will try to raise in the public offering but it is widely expected to be around $1 billion.\nThe Chinese ASIC cryptocurrency hardware market grew to 7.3 billion yuan in 2017 from just 50 million yuan in 2013, Canaan revealed in the filing, and consultant Frost & Sullivan extrapolates, that it will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020. The exact target date for the stock listing Canaan has in mind was not made public, and might change along with other details as the matter is evolving, but a person with knowledge of the situation told Bloomberg the company aims to start trading as soon as July 2018, just about two months from now. Canaan to HK\nThe Hong Kong market wasn’t the company’s only possible avenue for listing. Last year Canaan was known to be looking to list on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market, and earlier this year it was reportedly examining its options for a US-based IPO. The company didn’t explain why it eventually picked Hong Kong but it is safe to assume that the less hostile regulatory approach on the island, compared to both mainland China and the US, played a part in the decision.\nBack in April, we reported that the company employs around 200 people in Beijing and Hangzhou, mostly in R&D, and is looking to hire more. Canaan might use its chip development know-how and capabilities to create an unexpected new lineup of products. These can include home appliances such as television sets that mine cryptocurrencies “while you sleep.” Other developments include chips to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications and of course new hardware for mining additional cryptocurrencies.\nShould all stock investors add an ASIC producer to their portfolio to get exposure to the bitcoin market?

I'm particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed. I don't think we are ready. So I'm still paying attention to Alipay... to the US dollar, and the euro. We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don't care about Bitcoin.\"\nLast year, Jack Ma became the richest man in Asia, according to Bloomberg, with his net worth surging to $41.8 bln. The overwhelmingly popular mobile payment app Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, reportedly has 450 mln users.\nAs early as summer 2016, Ant Financial, introduced blockchain technology to improve accountability in its work with the Chinese charity industry, going on to recruit blockchain experts in the company at large the following year.\nHowever, in line with Ma’s position, Alibaba Group has stopped short of embracing cryptocurrencies, with Alibaba Cloud recently denying rumours its newly launched ‘P2P Nodes’ network was a cryptocurrency mining platform.

This individual used U.S. dollars to buy Bitcoins. He proceeded to trade in and out of other cryptocurrencies (“altcoins”) on a major trading exchange. When he first called my office, Bitcoin had recently reached its peak exchange rate of about $19,000 USD per Bitcoin unit on December 17, 2017. My client had multiplied his money tenfold. Unfortunately, the volatility in the cryptocurrency market wiped out more than half of his unrealized gains in just over a month. Eventually he decided that he was not ready to come into tax compliance, and we parted ways with mutual best wishes.\nIRS Enforcement Efforts\nMy former client had planned to come forward voluntarily to comply with the IRS reporting requirements under IRS Notice 2014-21 , which states that the IRS will treat Bitcoin as property for recognition of gains and losses. However, the IRS faces a significant challenge in its quest to encourage voluntary compliance. Many taxpayers will only comply voluntarily if they reasonably expect that noncompliance could lead to adverse consequences. The IRS has assigned a team of 10 investigators to begin enforcement action against tax cheats who use the anonymity of cryptocurrency to hide income and assets from the government. See: “IRS Cops Are Scouring Crypto Accounts to Build Tax Evasion Cases” by David Voreacos, Bloomberg News, February 8, 2018. For a current analytical perspective on the difficulty IRS may have in enforcing tax laws on cryptocurrency investors, see: “Tax Compliance in a Decentralizing Economy” by Manoj Viswanathan, The Georgia State Law Review (February 21, 2018).\nFour Suggestions for Cryptocurrency Investors\nI offer four key suggestions to cryptocurrency investors and their professional advisers:\nFirst , I predict that the IRS and other government regulatory agencies will catch up to the enforcement challenges posed by the anonymity of cryptocurrency ownership. Just as the IRS managed to obtain information on U.S. account holders at foreign banks such as UBS, so too the IRS will obtain records from major Bitcoin trading platforms. Already in November 2017, the IRS won a significant victory when a U.S. District Court judge in San Francisco upheld an IRS subpoena seeking records of selected U.S. account holders in Coinbase.\nSecond , it is possible that when IRS enforcement catches up with non-compliant Bitcoin investors, the IRS may offer a voluntary disclosure program similar to the one currently available for holders of offshore bank accounts. Under the current OVDP program, taxpayers who come forward voluntarily are not criminally prosecuted. The penalty rates, however, differ significantly. The penalty for intentional tax violators varies between 27.5 and 50 percent of the value of undisclosed assets. The penalty for unintentional violators is reduced to 5 percent of the value of undisclosed assets. Thus, Bitcoin investors cannot expect that they can participate in a possible voluntary disclosure program without experiencing some financial pain.\nThird , Bitcoin investors and traders should keep good records for tax accounting purposes. My former client (see above) used a trading platform that kept records of his transactions readily available only for the preceding six months or so. My tax accounting work was made more complicated by the lack of complete records.\nIf IRS offers a voluntary disclosure program, it will provide a limited look-back period—for example, the filing of tax returns for three to six years preceding the disclosure date. Since some Bitcoin exchanges do not retain customer data going back that far in a readily accessible format, those customers should diligently retain their own records. The retention of full records, however, may suggest that the failure to comply was intentional, thereby preventing taxpayers from enjoying the lower penalty rates discussed above.\nFinally , I urge all Bitcoin investors to comply with the law. Many taxpayers with offshore accounts lived to regret their non-compliance with the bank disclosure laws. Over 56,000 taxpayers paid more than $11 billion in penalties, according to an IRS press release dated March 13, 2018 . Many individuals also suffered intense anxiety, and some paid significant legal fees. A few people went to jail for criminal tax evasion. Therefore, tax honesty remains the best policy.\nFor more information on IRS taxation of Bitcoin, please see our prior blog post: “The United States Taxation of Bitcoins and Transactions Denominated in Bitcoins” by Attorney Morris N.

For an obvious reason: It will help address multiple barriers to investing in major cryptocurrencies.\"\n“Investing in cryptocurrency is complicated for the majority of investors,” explains Jonathan Benassaya, CEO and Founder of IronChain. “The four main barriers to invest are custody, liquidity, diversification and fees. IronChain’s solution addresses those four issues by allowing daily liquidity to all investors without any lockup, with an annual fee of 1% (the most economical of the market). There are no performance nor loading or redemption fees, an index-based portfolio of 10 of the largest protocols with a market cap weighting, and an institutional grade custody through xapo, kingdom and ledger.

Money that is obtained at someone else’s expense as opposed to genuinely creating wealth.” GETTY Bitcoin rose to over $19k in January but has since fallen to $8k A number of people have made a great deal of money. Money that is obtained at someone else’s expense as opposed to genuinely creating wealth. Martin Walker, director of the Centre for Evidence Based Management\nThis money-making triggered a so-called ‘hype period’ that pushed crypto into the national limelight, and saw Bitcoin’s value multiply more than 13 times during 2017 following a mass rush of speculators putting cash into what looked like a simple get-rich-quick scheme. However, cryptos fell 50 percent in the first three months of 2018 and with the prices now at $8,289 bitcoin the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has dropped $11,494 since Jan.\nHowever, Mr Walker says that the seeds for the Bitcoin and blockchain boom were sowed in March 2014. He said: “A webpage started circulating on social media listing how Blockchain - Bitcoin version or otherwise - could solve a long list of problems.\n“No explanation of how or why it would be better.”\nThis list included suggestions to “store nuclear launch codes on the blockchain” and although some of the claims were edited out, “the list ended up in the reports of serious consultancies, the media and governments”.\nThe “fad” then developed for talking up bitcoin and blockchain at every finance conference or keynote address and Mr Walker says that senior figures in the banking world are guilty of believing in an idea “without checking whether there is good evidence it works.” He argues that blockchain was being applied as the potential solution regardless of whether or not it actually “fit the problem”.\nSo how in 2018 should the UK government treat bitcoin and blockchain?\nMr Walker says that blockchain as a family of technologies should be treated by UK lawmakers like any other technology “ie ‘Is it a good solution to the problem?’ as opposed to a belief system”.\nHe adds that, in six months, we will see more slow progress on the enterprise side for real applications but expect people to question why some of those applications need to use Blockchain type features.\nOn the move towards regulation from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, he adds that there are “very good public interest grounds for putting in place the most restrictive regulatory regime possible around cryptocurrencies, banning where necessary and possible”.\nHowever he warns: “If cryptocurrency prices bounce back, we will probably get another cycle of hype. If they go sideways or the downwards trend continues there will be more out of pocket investors complaining that ‘regulators should have done something’.”\nFinally, on the recent moves by Goldman Sachs and the New York Stock Exchange towards Bitcoin futures and swap trades, he warns, “I think it should be obvious to anyone that has paid any attention to the conventional financial sector over the last two decades that if there is money to be made - no matter how dangerous the financial product - someone will plunge in.” Related articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martin walker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hm treasury select committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:44:41.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c9fc14e0a7d5a0d749f4f72dc88dc92ec3c855b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.VsgKwyosq.qA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-17T18:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c9fc14e0a7d5a0d749f4f72dc88dc92ec3c855b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.VsgKwyosq.qA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "drlederman", "published": "2018-05-17T18:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "text": "I doubt banks fear BTC as its as tiny as a flea on a large dogs back.

Investors can then use their newly-acquired Ethereum or Bitcoin to buy Bitcoin Scrypt using one of the aforementioned exchanges.\nnew TradingView.widget({ “height”: 400, “width”: 650, “symbol”: “BTCSUSD”, “interval”: “D”, “timezone”: “Etc/UTC”, “theme”: “White”, “style”: “1”, “locale”: “en”, “toolbar_bg”: “#f1f3f6”, “enable_publishing”: false, “hideideas”: true, “referral_id”: “2588”}); Receive News & Updates for Bitcoin Scrypt updates for Bitcoin Scrypt and related cryptocurrencies CryptoBeat newsletter .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.marketbeat.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-scrypt/", "https://www.marketbeat.com/cryptocurrencies/newsletter/?symbol=CURRENCY:BTCS&utm_source=MarketBeatPopup&utm_medium=MarketBeatPopup", "https://www.facebook.com/646343962092684", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://www.coinbase.com/join/52afc5ac562b15091600001d", "https://www.marketbeat.com/newsletter/default.aspx", "https://www.twitter.com/theotherbitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "goldcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anoncoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T18:33:29.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "994bdd423dfdcfd5bd2d3236c8b5f2bb05be76f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOr4aw7nW2Z0eS6a1CxW1E2QnPEEWV7tZ_ARL43kudVg3DjYPowCgbStnUUNR9QaVQfLjh0.Jl3uIO.G.qI01RnmIRLg7T3mkWXAaVyKq4lOhX71bEeTV1WiClRFRVzeUPNXs87eaLZMknwDG5AnaLk0", "site_full": "silveristhenew.com", "site": "silveristhenew.com", "site_section": "http://silveristhenew.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "silveristhenew", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin And Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential In A Decade", "title_full": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin And Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential In A Decade", "published": "2018-05-17T18:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80ZWU2MTIyODI5OGYzNWRiOWQwOGExYjE3MGNkNGZmZS5qcGc%3D.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "994bdd423dfdcfd5bd2d3236c8b5f2bb05be76f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOr4aw7nW2Z0eS6a1CxW1E2QnPEEWV7tZ_ARL43kudVg3DjYPowCgbStnUUNR9QaVQfLjh0.Jl3uIO.G.qI01RnmIRLg7T3mkWXAaVyKq4lOhX71bEeTV1WiClRFRVzeUPNXs87eaLZMknwDG5AnaLk0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "silveristhenew", "published": "2018-05-17T18:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin And Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential In A Decade", "text": "According to a report by Cointelegraph auf Deutsch Wednesday, May 16, Wozniak considers blockchain to be a “great idea.” He further said: “[Blockchain] is the next major IT revolution that is about to happen.”\nWozniak explained his positive outlook on blockchain by the fact that there are many useful applications for the technology in a number of areas.\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrencies will achieve their full potential in a decade, according to Wozniak. Apple’s co-founder quoted CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey, who had said in March that Bitcoin will become the world’s “single currency.”\nThis is not the first time that Steve Wozniak has made positive comments about cryptocurrencies and blockchain. At the “Money 20/20” conference in Las Vegas, back in October last year, he said that Bitcoin is better than gold and the US dollar.\nAccording to Wozniak, Bitcoin’s big advantage is that there is only a limited amount of coins, while fiat money, like the US dollar or euro, can simply be printed by banks.\nNonetheless, Wozniak sold all his bitcoins except one, as he said at the WeAreDevelopers Conference in Vienna, because “[he] does not want to be an investor and constantly watch the prices.” This article was posted in Uncategorized.

Mining versus Validation", "text": "More...\nThis introduction to Bitcoin Nodes was originally published at Bruno’s Bitfalls website , and is reproduced here with permission.\nYou’ll often hear the word node thrown around in blockchain and cryptocurrency circles. If you’ve read our intro to blockchain (and we highly recommend you do that), one of the characters in the comic there that’s writing down transactions on a piece of paper is actually a node . That introduction is quite simplified, however — so let’s explain the concept of nodes in a bit more detail now. Validation Nodes\nOne node is a computer running specific software. In the case of Bitcoin, one node is a Bitcoin program which connects to other Bitcoin nodes, i.e. other Bitcoin programs on the same machine, or on other machines which can be across the street or on the other side of the planet. There are several types and several versions of Bitcoin software. By picking a specific version of a specific Bitcoin program, a user “votes” for certain changes in the Bitcoin protocol. For example, if a bunch of users suggest the increase of 21 million total BTC to 42 million , the majority of the network is required to vote “yes” by installing the software implementing this change. Code changes are, thus, democratic.\nWhere this idea falls apart is in the fact that there are very few Bitcoin nodes out there — a mere 10000 currently.\nIn contrast, Ethereum — a cryptocurrency five years younger — already has twice as many:\nNeither number is very impressive from a global perspective. According to some calculations , running a Bitcoin node on AWS (Amazon’s cloud service) costs around $10 per month. This means that taking over 10000 brand new nodes takes $100,000 per month, or only $1.2m per year — which is pocket change to any Bitcoin early adopter .\nA list of node software you can install, along with their pros, cons, and special features, can be found here .\nIt’s important to note that validation nodes are purely an expense for the users running them. They give their users nothing. Bitcoin Core, for example, needs around 150GB of disk space, 2GB of RAM, and a fast and uncapped internet connection with at least 50KB of constant upload speed available just to run. It’s not uncommon to need to upload over 200GB of traffic per month when running a single node. Validation nodes are volunteer nodes and are useful for the system’s decentralization, but as they become ever more expensive to run, so too does the number of nodes drop. Add to that the mounting disillusion with Bitcoin’s theoretical decentralization due to the fact that bankers seem to have taken over the protocol’s development , and the fact that Bitcoin’s price is being pumped by crime syndicates , and it’s no surprise that the number of nodes dropped by 20% in a single month — from 12000 to 10000. As more nodes disappear, so does centralization. A hostile takeover becomes more and more probable. Mining Nodes\nA mining node is a validation node which also uses the hardware of your own or a rented machine to guess the combinations of numbers and letters needed to validate and verify a block . A mining node can team up with other nodes and send guesses to a common pool ( pool mining ) to increase chances of guessing, but then counts as only one node.\nBecause most new miners opt to join a powerful pool to maximize their chances of mining a block and getting rewards, we’re seeing a very serious technological centralization happening in which 20 of the most powerful pools are mining almost all the Bitcoin.\nHere’s a list of the biggest mining pools. Notice that the first one mines 25% of all the Bitcoin in existence.\nA mining node is the only bit of software which can “produce” new Bitcoin, and running one in a way that makes it worth your while requires either a very strong computer or free electricity. If you’d like to give mining a go, the list of BTC mining software can be found here . Conclusion\nA mining node is a node which contributes to the network by guessing the combinations needed to “seal” the blocks of transactions and thus confirm them, producing new Bitcoins in the process. A validation node is a node which validates this information, makes sure it’s true, and passes the information along to other nodes, thus enabling the transfer of monetary value from location A to location B. Mining nodes are a subset of validation nodes, because every mining node is also a validation node.\nThis difference is only manifested in the PoW consensus system and becomes technically unnecessary in PoS. With PoS, every node can be a validation node, and mining nodes as such no longer exist: new tokens are created based on another principle. For more about this, please read our PoW vs PoS article .

The cryptocurrency’s recent slide has it in the vicinity of some key price levels, that if violated, could trigger a wave of selling pressure.\nAt this writing Wednesday, bitcoin resides around $8,300 with a market value of $141.40 billion. That is a stark decline in a short amount of time. Less than two weeks ago, bitcoin was trading over $9,300, prompting speculation a return to $10,000 was in the cards.\nSome cryptocurrency market observers believe that if bitcoin can make it back to $10,000, rallies fromt there could be significant. Recently, the Bitcoin Dominance Index has been rising, confirming the dominant perch of the cryptocurrency. After bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrencies are Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Other Views\n“Bitcoin rise started in mid-April pauses, the pair is decreasing, trading below 8500 and heading along the 8100 range,” reports FXStreet . “Bitcoin bearish pattern started in March 2018 strengthens. The pair is contained between hourly support and resistance given at 6306 (13/11/2017 low) and 10232 (01/02/2018 high). The technical structure suggests further short-term decrease.”\nConversely, some bitcoin bulls believe the cryptocurrency can return to $20,000 or even move to $25,000 as soon as later this year.\nSome market observers are concerned that declines for the cryptocurrency could reinvigorate bearish traders, particularly if bitcoin posts several closes below the $8,000 area. After bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrencies are Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and EOS.\n“In the long-term, the digital currency has had an exponential growth but also presented important downturns. There is decent likelihood that the currency could stabilize between 7’000 – 12’000 in 2018.

The only difference is that the price of Bitcoin changes on a much greater scale than local currencies.\nBitcoins value is based on how valuable the market (the people buying and selling Bitcoin) thinks it is. Think about some of the more physical things you can currently invest in, such as Gold. The price of Gold depends on its supply and demand. For example, when a new Goldmine is discovered, the price drops. This is because more Gold becomes available and so it is no longer as rare. So the rarer Bitcoin is, the higher Bitcoin price predictions are.\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin usually changes because of the news that is published about it. Heres how it works:\nWhen there is bad news published about Bitcoin, there are a lot more people selling Bitcoin than buying Bitcoin. These people sell their Bitcoin for lower prices than the current value so that they can sell it quicklThis causes the price to drop.\nWhen there is good news about Bitcoin, there are more people buying Bitcoin than there are people selling it. These people buy Bitcoin for higher prices than the current values so that they can buy it quickly.
