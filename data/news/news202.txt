The paper is below. I'm looking for others interested in the idea, who want to work on the implementation, and on further research.\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04654\nhttps://jotasapiens.com/hblocks\nHere's a short overview:\nThe block size problem is well known. If blocks are small there is not enough room for transactions, and fees rise. As blocks get increasingly larger fewer nodes are capable of processing them and hashing power gets more concentrated, increasing the success probability of an attack. The block size set a trade-off between decentralization and transactions throughput.\nHeterogeneous blocks is a proposal to solve this with a generalization of Bitcoin. Instead of imposing a single size, a block is redefined as a series of sub-blocks of increasing sizes, each doubling the total size up to that point: 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... The sub-blocks in the series exist as different compromises between decentralization and throughput.\nEach miner decides a cutoff in the series, and processes sub-blocks up to that point. For example, a miner that choses a to process 4 sub-blocks, will generate blocks containing the first 4 sub-blocks (with sizes 1, 1, 2, 4), and will process the first 4 sub-blocks at most from blocks generated by others. On the other hand, users choose the sub-block size to use individually for each address and transaction.\nThe construction has these properties:\n- The network reaches consensus despite that not all miners observe the blocks completely.\n- Big blocks don't affect the security of small blocks, and bigger sub-blocks don't affect the security of smaller sub-blocks.\n- It is possible to move coins between the different sub-blocks.\nHeterogeneous blocks can be seen as a having Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in a same chain, each serving different use cases. The smallest sub-blocks are the most secure to store savings. The biggest sub-blocks are better for small everyday payments, at the risk of more centralization. And in between there is a whole range of trade-offs between the two.\nBitcoin With Heterogeneous Block Sizes: A Scaling Proposal\nAbstract: We propose a bitcoin generalization as a solution to the problem of scalability. The block is redefined as a sequence of sub-blocks of increasing sizes that coexist as different levels of compromise between decentralization and transactions throughput. Miners and users can decide individually the sizes they use without affecting others in the network.\nsha256: 057706103ea953b08e67bcc6230d479445480346c2453da58183213aa99bda45", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04654", "https://jotasapiens.com/hblocks"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T02:32:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e8cd0feed09597ed1fb6567968fc517c9d600fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdGA2XZgLpCxQ8MGs.t90Gk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will bitcoin Die because of global Regulations?", "title_full": "Will bitcoin Die because of global Regulations?", "published": "2018-05-21T00:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e8cd0feed09597ed1fb6567968fc517c9d600fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdGA2XZgLpCxQ8MGs.t90Gk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jjacob", "published": "2018-05-21T00:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin Die because of global Regulations?", "text": "Quote: from: napi on May 20, 2018, 04:10:49 PM it seems that it will not happen, it's possible with the regulation of bitcoin the first price will falter but after that I believe the price of bitcoin will increase very expensive.\nWhy would the price falter with regulation?

Think about it, £1.8bn is taken away from the people sending money to support their families in Nigeria. Imagine what £1.8bn a year could do in the pockets of families depending on money sent to them from abroad? This is where blockchain technology comes in. It solves a problem like this by making it easier and cheaper to transfer and remit payments internationally.”\nNigeria has had a difficult cryptocurrency history. Early last year it was reported that the Central Bank of Nigeria was considering implementing its own cryptocurrency, but later the same year, it was advising banks to distance themselves from virtual currency, warning them, “not to use, hold or transact in any way with the technology.”\nThe remarks came at a time when Nigeria’s interest in cryptocurrencies was flourishing. According to data from Coindance , weekly trading volume on Localbitcoins in Nigeria surged 500 percent in 2017. Nigeria then, was among top countries using Google to search for ‘bitcoin’, alongside South Africa, Slovenia, Holland, and Austria. Although, it was reported at this time that a Ponzi scheme may have been partly responsible for the clicking figures. The scheme reportedly cost investors UD$50 million in early March of that year.\nIn a press release issued in March of this year, the CBN is now reiterating its warnings of last year, suggesting that due to crypto investments being unprotected, investors will be at risk. Lady Walker maintains that it is lack of knowledge which holds back the tide of progress in the African crypto space, which in turn creates institutional and public skepticism such as the CBN’s.\n“People are skeptical because that is human nature. We are natural cynics and skeptics and rarely trust what we don’t understand. This is why I urge people to truly understand the nature of the industry, asset and also yourself”\nLady Walker believes that there will come a time when all Nigerian banks will have to adopt cryptocurrencies of their own, but due to the current volatility of the crypto market, it remains a future goal of those who see cryptocurrency as the financial future. She maintains:\n“Bitcoin is a reality. We have all major world governments scrambling to make sense of it and world leaders sharing their views on the currency. For the past 700 years, our world has relied on the European legacy banking system for means of payments and transactions. Bitcoin is definitely challenging the traditional way when it comes to transfer of value. Just like the internet changed how we shop, bank, date and find information.”\nAbout 40% of Nigeria’s population is unbanked, which blocks nearly half of the population from the financial economy. To this, the fintech CEO argues “All you require is a smartphone and internet to start sending and receiving payments. No I.D required, filling out paperwork, etc… Do you know how much this could change things for the people of Nigeria?”\n @BitcoinNewsCom\nThe post Nigeria Can Be Empowered By Bitcoin Says Foundation CEO appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

In a 2013 episode , when Krusty is asked by Lisa whether he is broke, he responds by saying that “all it takes is bad luck at the ponies, worse luck in the bitcoin markets…”\nIn a 2014 episode, bully Jimbo Jones is pictured on a billboard saying that he accepts bitcoin payments.\nBeing mentioned on the Simpsons represents a degree of mass media attention and a step towards mass adoption, which many investors and proponents of bitcoin believe to be critical to its long term success.\nOther shows have started to mention bitcoin more often, too. It was mentioned in Family Guy in 2014 and Supernatural in the same year. It has also been mentioned in Almost Human, House of Cards, Person of Interest, and the Good Wife. Tapped Out\nThe Simpsons: Tapped Out is a mobile game available for iOS, Android, and Kindle Fire. It was launched in 2012 and is published by gaming giant EA Mobile.

[duplicate]", "text": "up vote 22 down vote accepted\nThere are several major differences. Bitcoin is a currency with a built in payment system for its currency. The XRP Ledger is a payment system for arbitrary currencies with support for cross-currency transactions.\nOne big difference is that currencies (other than XRP) are represented as debts (IOUs) on the ledger. This is much the way currencies are represented in the conventional banking system. When you say, \"I have $5,000 in my bank account\", what you mean is that the bank owes you $5,000. When you write someone a check, you are transferring debt so that their bank owes them more money and thus they consider you to have paid them. Ripple works this same way -- payments occur by a transfer of debt (IOU).\nYou can generally get a Bitcoin transaction through for free if you're patient. XRP Ledger transactions always have an XRP cost. In practice, this cost should remain very low. Transaction fees are destroyed on the XRP Ledger, they aren't paid to anyone.\nXRP Ledger payments that use assets other than XRP can incur fees other than transaction fees. It is hoped that competition will keep these costs low. If your payment requires using someone else's liquidity, they can impose a fee for that liquidity. IOU issuers can impose fees on transfers of IOUs.\nXRP Ledger transactions should confirm more quickly, typically in under 10 seconds.\nWhile the XRP Ledger is designed to operate without a central authority, currently almost all validating servers are operated or managed by Ripple Labs. So it's not fully distributed yet in that sense, but it will be. Currently, most XRP (the units used to pay transaction fees) are held by Ripple Labs.\nIt is also important to understand that using the XRP Ledger as a store of value for fiat currencies imposes a counter-party risk. If you hold dollars on the ledger, someone you have chosen to trust owes you those dollars. If you misplace trust, you can wind up with uncollectable IOUs.\nThe ledger can uss gateways, companies that make it their business to make \"settle on demand\" agreements with people, to hold IOUs. The ledger is much less useful for payments of fiat currencies if there aren't reliable gateways you can trust to hold your money.\nIn function, the XRP Ledger's way of handling assets other than XRP is more like PayPal or Visa than Bitcoin. But its internal implementation is based on the same technologies Bitcoin uses -- public transactions, no central authorities, cryptographically secured transactions, peer-to-peer transaction propagation, and so on. One key difference is that people who choose to use assets issued by different counterparties can seamlessly exchange value with each other through a distributed exchange. So there's a huge interoperability benefit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T00:44:59.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b446d9aef49e10d71b1e598867e5a4d77beb816", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7uwZzsQZpLcUIH1u8m53ti1BqOEYyeaP9jWbaJbcXcdZbJ8dh3nyu.3OpzqcO1_jeBypl4_QByr4XpzJVORLOUeI.CKf6yDme", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "Bitpay Enables Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) for Tax Payments : CryptoCurrencies", "title_full": "Bitpay Enables Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) for Tax Payments : CryptoCurrencies", "published": "2018-05-20T23:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.43, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b446d9aef49e10d71b1e598867e5a4d77beb816", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7uwZzsQZpLcUIH1u8m53ti1BqOEYyeaP9jWbaJbcXcdZbJ8dh3nyu.3OpzqcO1_jeBypl4_QByr4XpzJVORLOUeI.CKf6yDme", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CryptoCoinCache", "published": "2018-05-20T23:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitpay Enables Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) for Tax Payments : CryptoCurrencies", "text": "submitted by /u/CryptoCoinCache\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cryptocoincache.com/bitpay-enables-bitcoin-cash-bch-and-bitcoin-core-btc-for-tax-payments-2/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T20:43:21.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad6f2eabab99a8360ad8dd363f0e50dab91bcee2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRHYC08RnqbqFm3Amug1cZJ50AE4aFwlxBTfdrstqrufLg0UCjDM5c.IhvikjJ3FKWId9dl1jBEMg--", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Uses as Much Electricity as Ireland", "title_full": "Bitcoin Mining Uses as Much Electricity as Ireland", "published": "2018-05-20T23:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad6f2eabab99a8360ad8dd363f0e50dab91bcee2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRHYC08RnqbqFm3Amug1cZJ50AE4aFwlxBTfdrstqrufLg0UCjDM5c.IhvikjJ3FKWId9dl1jBEMg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-20T23:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Uses as Much Electricity as Ireland", "text": "Home / Bitcoin News Wire / Bitcoin Mining Uses as Much Electricity as Ireland Bitcoin Mining Uses as Much Electricity as Ireland Posted by: Bitcoin News Editor in Bitcoin News Wire 1 min ago\nLet’s check out the latest developments in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, which is growing increasingly popular among sports bettors.

Surprising. Anyone knows what he was doing before?\nI think he worked at google right?\nThat would make for it yeah. Also probably he is older than he looks like (in fact in recent pictures he does).\nIf you read that twitter stream, to this day Charlie doesn't consider Litecoin a scam.\nBut often we need to reconsider what the definition of a scam truly is.\nI mean, to make Litecoin he literally took a snapshot of the Bitcoin source code, changed like 2 easily-found config parameters, and launched it. And he admitted that it took him all of like a long Saturday to change and test it. He put almost zero effort into creating Litecoin. He created an altcoin of Bitcoin with a few clicks of a mouse. What he did, anyone could literally do with enough knowledge of the code.\nSo what part about that process and goal isn't scammy? Today when people do that with the Bitcoin source, we say that they're doing it for scammy or selfish purposes.

Other featured articles offer consumer staples stocks that may be bargains and drone stocks hitting turbulence. Also, the prospects for cryptocurrency, a home superstore operator and a streaming platform provider.\n\" Jack Bogle's Battle \" by Leslie P. Norton suggests that if one man can be held responsible for today's market — for better or worse — it is Vanguard founder Jack Bogle. See how the inventor of the index fund responds to a growing chorus of critics, and he also weighs in on the future of the fund industry. In a companion article, Bogle answers lightning round questions.\nLawrence C. Strauss's \" Why Coke, PepsiCo, and P&G Look Like Bargains \" examines why investors are ignoring the comeback prospects of consumer-staples giants such as Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG ). See why, despite weak top-line growth, less brand loyalty, rising costs and other headwinds, one bull sees the best opportunities since 2001.\nIn \" Bitcoin's Price Drop Doesn't Scare the Big Money ,\" Avi Salzman points out that Coindesk's annual conference showed that the financial industry is still drawn to blockchain and bitcoin, even though the latter has plunged 58 percent from its December highs, Warren Buffett has compared it to rat poison, few people use it for everyday purchases and the regulatory outlook is uncertain.\nShares of big-box store operator Lowe's Companies, Inc.

Other featured articles offer consumer staples stocks that may be bargains and drone stocks hitting turbulence. Also, the prospects for cryptocurrency, a home superstore operator and a streaming platform provider. \" Jack Bogle's Battle \" by Leslie P. Norton suggests that if one man can be held responsible for today's market — for better or worse — it is Vanguard founder Jack Bogle. See how the inventor of the index fund responds to a growing chorus of critics, and he also weighs in on the future of the fund industry. In a companion article, Bogle answers lightning round questions. Lawrence C. Strauss's \" Why Coke, PepsiCo, and P&G Look Like Bargains \" examines why investors are ignoring the comeback prospects of consumer-staples giants such as Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG ). See why, despite weak top-line growth, less brand loyalty, rising costs and other headwinds, one bull sees the best opportunities since 2001. In \" Bitcoin's Price Drop Doesn't Scare the Big Money ,\" Avi Salzman points out that Coindesk's annual conference showed that the financial industry is still drawn to blockchain and bitcoin, even though the latter has plunged 58 percent from its December highs, Warren Buffett has compared it to rat poison, few people use it for everyday purchases and the regulatory outlook is uncertain.

This is so great to hear news like that, Im so glad to be an early adopter right now I see the real potential for young students who can learn bitcoin and earn money .\nIf bitcoin will become one of the subject in the school, in what particular level is it for Elementary, High School, or college level? Perhaps Bitcoin will\nbecome a subject in college categories I think. Or there is also a possibility that it could be a course too.\nThe most appropriate level seems to be high school. Because in high school there are usually majors according to the talents and interests of the students concerned. Another factor is in terms of age, high school students are usually better at making decisions. So, if they are taught about bitcoin, then they can be wiser in implementing it in real life.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

On May 19, 2018, a person posted an image which contains a bitcoin puzzle that rewards the solver 1 BTC.\nAlso read: A Brief History of Hidden Messages in the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin Puzzles: Hiding Cryptocurrencies in Plain Sight\nSince the inception of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, visual puzzles that contain digital asset rewards have been very popular. This week a Reddit user named ‘u/cryptogreetings’ posted a cryptic picture online that contained a puzzle with a 1 BTC prize. Since the image was published online no one has been able to crack it so far as the public address can be seen here . The picture is black and orange and white with a bitcoin symbol and many words, and numbers strewed across the image. The creator says if no one can crack it in a week they will publish some hints to help people out.\n“This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry,” explains the Reddit user u/cryptogreetings.\nThe work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life, and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work. This picture was published yesterday, it contains 1 BTC hidden within the image. It has not been solved yet. The Infamous Coin Artist 5 BTC Puzzle Solved This Year\nJust recently news.Bitcoin.com reported on a famous bitcoin puzzle that contained 5 BTC for years before the puzzle was decrypted. The painting called ‘The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto’ was designed by @coin_artist , who had hidden clues that revealed a private key to the tethered wallet . The puzzle was solved by a 30-year old programmer named ‘Isaac’ who solved the puzzle in less than two months. Isaac just happened upon the puzzle while searching for cryptocurrency related riddles online. This painting held 5 BTC at one time, it was solved this year. Cryptocurrency Puzzles and Riddles Strewn Across the Web\nThere have been tons of bitcoin puzzles over the years and there even is a Reddit forum dedicated to these riddles called r/bitcoinpuzzles . The Reddit forum has lots of puzzles with large funds hidden and smaller mBTC fractions. News.Bitcoin.com reported on another bitcoin puzzle series that is tied to an Enigma game on Steam. Montecrypto is a game specifically designed for armchair detectives as this past February the game made headlines worldwide. During the first week of February, a gamer solved the Montecrypto puzzles and accumulated $50K worth of BTC, BCH, and other coins.

Ken Shirriff is well-known in the bitcoin network for his work on getting the Bitcoin image added to Unicode. Shirriff also has a popular weblog wherein writes approximately his initiatives and how he has mined bitcoins the use of popular gadgets from the past. Just these days Shirriff has been operating on a Xerox Alto recovery and managed to get the seventies constructed pc to mine bitcoins at 1.5 hashes/2nd. The Xerox Alto is a famous computer traditional that changed into the first tool to support a graphical user interface (GUI) in 1973. “I’ve been restoring a Xerox Alto minicomputer from the Seventies and figured it would be interesting to see if it could mine bitcoins,” explains Shirriff. I coded up the essential hash set of rules in BCPL (the old programming language utilized by the Alto) and determined that although the mining algorithm ran, the Alto was so gradual that it might often take the life of the universe to successfully mine bitcoins.The laptop’s 1.5 blocks per second are extensively slower than the chips used nowadays. Shirriff details the Xerox Alto’s speed might take “5000 times the age of the universe” to mine one block. For demonstration purposes, Shirriff used the center of a successfully extracted block to see if the set of rules succeeded. Shirriff’s code is to be had on Github for folks who would like to attempt out Xerox Alto mining. An Old IBM Mainframe From the Sixties Would Take Roughly 40,000 Times the Current Age of the Universe to Find a Block Another task Shirriff labored on back in 2015 changed into mining with a 55-year-antique IBM 1401 mainframe at 80 seconds in keeping with hash. This pc turned into the first-class-promoting laptop of the mid-1960s and mainly used for commercial enterprise purposes.\n“While modern hardware can compute billions of hashes in step with 2nd, 1401 takes eighty seconds to compute a single hash,” information Shirriff. “This illustrates the development of overall computer performance inside the past a long time, maximum famously described with the aid of Moore’s Law — To summarize, to mine a block at modern-day difficulty, the IBM 1401 might take about five×10^14 years (about forty,000 instances the cutting-edge age of the universe).” Mining Bitcoin Using Old Computers and Retro Gaming ConsolesThe card deck Shirriff used to compute SHA-256 hashes at the IBM 1401 mainframe.Mining Bitcoin With a 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System Mining Bitcoin Using Old Computers and Retro Gaming ConsolesRetro Miner created a Bitcoin miner with a 1985 NES and a Raspberry Pi.Lastly, another neat undertaking is another pretty sluggish miner constructed in 2013 out of a 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The author of the NES mining device became joking around with his pal approximately mining bitcoins with an 8-bit game console. Well, he took that as a task and constructed a Nintendo that communicated with the network and executed SHA256 hashing. For different quantities of the project, he did need a Raspberry Pi for computing that did now not take location at the NES. “SHA256 hashing uses many 32-bit operations, and the 6502 within the NES is an 8-bit CPU,” explains the retro miner creator. “Initially I concept this would be a significant challenge, however with some adjustments, I got an open implementation of SHA256 to bring together to a 6502 goal the use of the cc65 compiler.” ASIC Producers Don’t Need to Worry About Retro Miners Obviously, these kinds of tasks won’t be mass followed to mine immoderate quantities of bitcoins like ASICs due to the fact it would take many lifetimes to locate one block the usage of an unfashionable tool. However even though looking an older laptop or gaming console mine bitcoins is remarkable slow it’s fascinating to peer that those devices are like minded with the Bitcoin network.Areas Of Misuse Of Computers And The Internet – Computer Misuse ActYou should already be acquainted with statistics [data: information without context, for instance, a list of students with serial numbers, is data.

TrakInvest has been focused on providing online certifications, upskilling programs, and job opportunities through its partnerships with universities, corporations and governments. One of the key projects TrakInvest will leverage Hedera hashgraph for is the Digital Certifications Program (“DCP”), which will create the processes and infrastructure to bring academic certifications for Asian institutions on a public distributed ledger.\nBobby Bhatia, Founder & CEO of TrakInvest commented:\n“We are very proud to be working with Hedera hashgraph on a number of initiatives. We believe Hedera will provide the best in class platform and technology solution for TrakInvest to execute its current and planned product offerings including certifications, Trak AI prediction tools, and financial products,”\nLearn, Share and Earn\nTrakInvest’s “learn, share, earn” business model is based on empowering the retail investor by bringing the concept of track records and transparency to the investment model and providing institutional grade analytical and AI tools to enable better decision making. One of the key features in the TrakInvest Platform is the “TRAK” feature, which allows users to follow / share their real-time trading data with fellow users for a fee. Hedera hashgraph’s ability to process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second makes it an ideal choice for platforms dealing with micropayments and other high-volume transactions.\nA.I Engine\nTrakInvest’s AI Engine tool is set to launch in August 2018 and focuses on unlocking crypto market insights from heterogeneous market data. The three key initiatives in the TrakInvest AI Engine include TrakInvest Knowledge Graph, Sentiment Engine and Continuous Learning. The diversity, volume, speed, and veracity related challenges make it impossible for a retail investor to derive useful trading insights out of heterogeneous datasets in a timely manner. Using TRAK tokens, users will be able to access TrakInvest AI Engine to gain superior insights and make more informed investment decisions.\nSolving pain points and continuous delivery of value to customer is key to scaling any business.\nMigrating the TrakInvest platform to Hedera hashgraph is expected to provide never-before-seen benefits for existing users and our partner institutions including significant improvements in throughput, security, and transaction costs. The Hedera hashgraph public ledger will address a number of the existing DLT constraints related to speed, fairness, cost and security.\nEdgar Seah, Head of Asia Pacific for Hedera\n“TrakInvest’s idea to become a global trading resource built on distributed ledger technology is innovative,”\nAlso noted\n“Increasingly, organizations and applications want to use Hedera because of its speed, fairness and security. We will enable developers to build a new class of distributed applications never before possible, and are excited that TrakInvest has selected Hedera as its platform of choice.\nAbout TrakInvest\nTrakInvest is world’s 1st virtual social trading platform powered by a proprietary AI engine. TrakInvest is headquartered in Singapore with operations across Thailand, Hong Kong and India. It has been operating since 2014 with 100,000+ users across Asia.

Shirriff details the Xerox Alto’s velocity might take “5000 times the age of the universe” to mine one block. For demonstration purposes, Shirriff used the center of an efficiently mined block to peer if the set of rules succeeded. Shirriff’s code is available on Github for those who would love to try out Xerox Alto mining.\nAn Old IBM Mainframe From the Sixties Would Take Roughly 40,000 Times the Current Age of the Universe to Find a Block\nAnother assignment Shirriff labored on back in 2015 turned into mining with a fifty five-12 months-old IBM 1401 mainframe at 80 seconds in line with cash. This pc turned into the pleasant-selling laptop of the mid-1960s and particularly used for enterprise functions.\n“While modern-day hardware can compute billions of hashes in step with 2nd, 1401 takes 80 seconds to compute an unmarried hash,” details Shirriff. “This illustrates the improvement of laptop performance in the beyond decades, most famously described with the aid of Moore’s Law — To summarize, to mine a block at present day problem, the IBM 1401 would take approximately 5×10^14 years (approximately forty,000 times the contemporary age of the universe).”\nLastly, some other neat undertaking is every other tremendously gradual miner built in 2013 out of a 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The writer of the NES mining device turned into joking around with his friend about mining bitcoins with an eight-bit game console. Well, he took that as a project and built a Nintendo that communicated with the network and carried out SHA256 hashing. For different quantities of the mission, he did need a Raspberry Pi for computing that did now not take place on the NES.\n“SHA256 hashing makes use of many 32-bit operations, and the 6502 in the NES is an eight-bit CPU,” explains the unfashionable miner author. “Initially I idea this would be a great mission, but with some changes, I got an open implementation of SHA256 to collect to a 6502 target the usage of the cc65 compiler.”\nIn the give up, the NES miner worked and started out searching for blocks with Slush’s pool, however, the creator said there were masses of room for construct enhancements. “What I’m doing now could be very sluggish, and I admit, quite lame,” explains the unfashionable miner’s web blog publish. Additionally, bitcoins have had high-quality discussions regarding mining Bitcoin with different gaming consoles like the PlayStation 3.\nASIC Producers Don’t Need to Worry About Retro Miners\nObviously, these forms of initiatives gained be mass followed to mine excessive amounts of bitcoins like ASICs due to the fact it might take many lifetimes to find one block the use of a retro tool. However, despite the fact that watching an older laptop or gaming console mine bitcoins is terrific gradual, it’s very exciting to peer that those devices are well suited to the Bitcoin community.

The billionaire e-commerce guru said bitcoin is the bubble and not blockchain. He made these comments at the recently concluded World Intelligence Congress in Tianjin.\nBlockchain not Bitcoin Narrative Lives On During his address at the conference, Ma revealed that Alibaba focuses solely on blockchain implementation. According to Ma:\nBlockchain is now a hot word. First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era.\nThe Alibaba executive also went to say that blockchain was the true technological breakthrough that would drive the coming digital revolution . He identified the technology behind cryptos as having immense potential for all kinds of business processes. Ma also revealed that his company was exploring several blockchain applications. Alibaba is investing in data security and privacy solutions built on the blockchain. Such is the extent of the company's activities in the arena that it presently holds the most number of blockchain-related patents in the world.\nMa is, however, dissatisfied with the current extent people are exploring the technology. According to Ma, too much emphasis is placed on blockchain as a money-making tool when it ought to be used as a value creation technology. He reiterated the need for the focus to be on improving the global business process rather than treating blockchain as a \"gold mine.\"\nBitcoin is a Bubble On the subject of bitcoin, Ma ironically called the world's most popular and secure blockchain, i.e. Bitcoin, a bubble. In the past, the Alibaba founder had shown a lack of interest in Bitcoin. Has even previously said that he knows little about the crypto preferring only to focus on the blockchain. Most of the company's efforts in the blockchain realm focus on e-commerce and public welfare protocols. In 2016, Alibaba launched a blockchain email repository , and in 2017, the company signed a partnership with PwC to develop a food traceability architecture based on the technology.\nWhile previously noncommittal to the Bitcoin argument, Ma's recent comments put him with the likes of Warren Buffett , Charlie Munger, Bill Gates and many others. These notable business figures all have negative things to say about the world's first cryptocurrency much to the chagrin of the Bitcoin enthusiasts.\nDo you agree with Jack Ma's comments?

This currency is not printed currency like dollars or euros. Running computer all around the world are producing it. Owing to this reason they are different from other currencies.\nBitcoin is different from other currencies. Very different. Bitcoin is just on the internet and is not physically intangible like any other currency. Although Bitcoin is not physical Bitcoin value is very high and different from other currencies in the world.
