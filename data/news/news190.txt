Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling for gains above $8,500 following concerns over increased regulation according to Naeem Aslam , chief market analyst at Think Markets: “The recent selloff has come from the news out of China that the ICO [ initial coin offering ] market is still very active and there are fears that China will further increase the strict regulation.” In a report issued by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the government reiterated its position against “certain risks that cannot be ignored” in regards to ICOs, pyramid schemes, and fraudulent behavior. The report compares the current climate to the early days of the internet, advising the public against “excessive speculation” and “false propaganda.” In addition to regulatory fears, hype surrounding a possible rally following Blockchain Week and the Consensus conference in New York was proven to be a dud. Co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee, who is famous for his bullish predictions on BTC price, admitted that his prediction of a post-conference rally was wrong. While gains above $8,500 are difficult to maintain, $8,000 support is still holding. According to Market Watch , as a the range tightens, the probability of a breakout is growing. For almost six weeks, BTC has traded between $7,800 and $10,000. At press time BTC is trading at $8,095 and has decreased by 4.25 percent over a 24 hour period. Ethereum (ETH) is is also down, trading at $653.79 down 6 percent over a 24 hour period at press time. Last week, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak compared Ethereum to Apple, saying it, “interests [him] because it can do things and because it's a platform.”\nAltcoins are also all trading in the red. Litecoin (LTC) is down by 3.74 percent over 24 hour period at $129.78, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has lost 7.48 percent to $1,145. Also over a 24 hour period, both EOS and Ripple (XRP) are down 6.42 and 3.24 percent and are trading at $12.60 and $0.65, respectively.\nPublished at Tue, 22 May 2018 21:09:45 +0000\nBitcoin ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "naeem aslam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "possible new regulatory pressure  bitcoin price struggles after blockchain week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:09:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8db9a47bea2cf7bfbe450ef8c6a38cdd15f009ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UPR85JRev6d7VwfMii90pAx", "site_full": "helpscoin.cryptograbber.com", "site": "cryptograbber.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Fintech firm Plaid expands into Canada – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "title_full": "Fintech firm Plaid expands into Canada – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.152, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/helpscoin.cryptograbber.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fintech-firm-plaid-expands-into-canada.jpg?fit=600%2C600", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8db9a47bea2cf7bfbe450ef8c6a38cdd15f009ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UPR85JRev6d7VwfMii90pAx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fintech firm Plaid expands into Canada – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "text": "by HELPSCOINADMIN · May 22, 2018\nPlaid is getting some northern exposure.

PLACE YOUR ADS HERE- CLICK FOR DETAILS Views: 289\nToday is shaping up to be another terrible day for the cryptocurrency industry. All of the top currencies are in the deep red right now, with some of them suffering bigger setbacks compared to others. The Bitcoin Cash price, for example, has dropped below $1,200 once again, yet it remains to be seen how long this negative trend will remain in place. The Bitcoin Cash Price Decline With all major cryptocurrencies on the decline, it is only normal Bitcoin and other altcoins will suffer from this pressure. In the case of BCH , the value has declined in the past few hours, and it seems the Bitcoin Cash price will face a big struggle to remain close to the $1,200 level first and foremost. So far, the value has dipped below $1,200 already, but it seems things may improve moving forward. Over the past seven days, the Bitcoin Cash price has dropped for over $1,400 all the way down to $1,150. Ever since that time, the value bounced back to nearly $1,300, but holding on to that momentum has proven to be far more difficult than speculators imagined at first. With the Bitcoin Cash price now dropping below $1,200, an interesting trend is forming, which may push the value down to $1,150 once again. Due to this 5.61% decline in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash is one of the bigger “losers” of the day so far. There is also a 3.13% decline in the BCH/ BTC ration over the past 24… ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T05:18:10.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e40e9992a2faf080df202f9d4423b22e0f2ab93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTWv.eIeocHQSgh2JJZc0Y8XJ3rcjmnU9jOiq.En1o6a8BMJWXjLnElKe3gL5rVWU-", "site_full": "coinninja.com", "site": "coinninja.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: 2018 - Coin Ninja News", "title_full": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: 2018 - Coin Ninja News", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://coinninja.com/news/app/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Pizza-Day-2018-1024x563.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e40e9992a2faf080df202f9d4423b22e0f2ab93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTWv.eIeocHQSgh2JJZc0Y8XJ3rcjmnU9jOiq.En1o6a8BMJWXjLnElKe3gL5rVWU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: 2018 - Coin Ninja News", "text": "Today marks the 8th anniversary of Laszlo Hanyecz's famous purchase of 2 pizzas for 10,000BTC. Bitcoin Pizza Day: 2018 CoinNinja | May 22nd, 2018\n“Bitcoin Pizza Day” falls on May 22, and is a lighthearted, symbolic holiday for those in the Bitcoin community. This day reminds us of a very early time in the Bitcoin world, on May 22, 2010, when maybe the most famous Bitcoin transaction of all time took place. What was this momentous event?, …well, it was merely the purchase of two pizzas, paid for in Bitcoin.\nOn May 18, 2010, Florida-based programmer and early adopter of Bitcoin, Laszlo Hanyecz authored a famous request on bitcointalk.org :\nI’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!\nI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.\nIf you’re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.\nThanks, Laszlo\nAs Laszlo learned, ask and you shall receive! Four days after making the post, someone took him up on his offer. A user by the name of “jercos” sent Laszlo just what he wanted, two large Papa John’s pizzas, with all the fixings and no “weird fish topping”. As was promised, Laszlo paid jercos 10,000 BTC, which at the time was valued at about $41 USD, or about $.004 USD per Bitcoin!; which was still a generous Bitcoin offer at the time of the request. This transaction went down in history as the first documented purchase using Bitcoin as the currency. As we certainly now know, this would go down in history for more than being just the first purchase using Bitcoin, it would undoubtedly be the most expensive pizzas ever purchased!\nAs time rolled along, Laszlo’s thread on bitcointalk.org stayed put, and grew at a rate only mirrored by the value of Bitcoin itself. As Bitcoin’s value began its exponential rise, fellow forum members began to poke a bit of fun at Laszlo and his pioneering pizza purchase:\nThe answer to the latter question, well yes, it sure as hell has! As we know, Bitcoin is now worth about $8,239 each, meaning the cost of Laszlo’s insurmountable craving for a 10,000BTC pair of pizzas would be worth over $82 MILLION, today! Laszlo has taken the ribbing well, and doesn’t regret his decision, stating in an interview with the New York Times in 2013:\n“It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool (…) No one knew it was going to get so big.”\nThanks to Laszlo getting the ball rolling for the use of Bitcoin, the hilarity of his situation, and his good-natured attitude, this day has now become a major holiday for hodlers and industry professionals around the world. We at CoinNinja certainly wanted to show our support, and ordered 2 large, Papa John’s pizzas by way of an online gift card purchase at Gyft.com , and you can bet your pizza-loving butts that we used Bitcoin to make the purchase.

Some see them simply as new investments and payment methods, while others worry they provide potential vehicles for illegal activities, from money laundering to drug-dealing.\nIt’s a debate that matters for the sprawling U.S. national security apparatus, which has to keep track of more than 4 million people with some form of security clearance. That includes workers who, at least in theory, could sell secrets to America’s enemies with the aid of anonymous transactions facilitated by cryptocurrencies.\nTerrorists, Cybercriminals\nTerrorists and cybercriminals use cryptocurrencies to shield their transactions from investigators and often demand payment in Bitcoins and other digital assets, according to international law-enforcement groups including the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre.\nAt the same time, young investors have decamped from the halls of prominent financial institutions for the evolving world of cryptocurrency investing, and entire states have pegged their futures to its popularity. The instrument is going mainstream as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. moves forward with Bitcoin trading operations.\nNevertheless, Bitcoin has fallen about 50 percent from its December high to about $8,400 as regulators around the world continue to evaluate how to manage digital assets and some Wall Street pros dismiss the market. Warren Buffett, for example, has likened Bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”\nIf the U.S. government were to decide that owning cryptocurrencies is a security risk, it could have a “huge negative impact” on the growing market, according to Singh.\nAny move to more closely investigate job applicants who own cryptocurrencies also could hamper the Pentagon’s efforts to expand its operations in cyberspace, a goal that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has made a priority.\n“If we’re going to say that if you’ve got a Bitcoin or another digital currency account that could be a signal or shoot up a red flag for a security clearance, guess what? Those people aren’t going to sit around waiting to try to onboard for a government job,” Greg Touhill, a retired Air Force general who was the first Federal Chief Information Security Officer, said in an interview. “It would grow the backlog considerably, in my view.”\nConflicting Messages\nThe Pentagon has sent conflicting messages about how it’s handling the matter.\nAfter a Defense Security Service employee suggested in an email that Bitcoin be considered a foreign currency and reported on the lengthy SF-86 security form filled out by clearance applicants, DSS quickly countered by issuing official guidance saying...there is no official Department of Defense guidance, according to ETHNews, an online cryptocurrency news site.\n“There is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies,” according to a statement posted to the DSS website. “DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry.”\nThe equivocation has been cited by law firms and job search sites. ClearanceJobs.com put it bluntly: “Should you report your Bitcoin to your security officer? It depends upon who you ask.”\nHuge Backlog\nThe lack of clear direction from the Pentagon only adds to the headaches already faced by government contractors that need to hire workers with security clearances.\nTheir top priority is overhauling a clearance system with a backlog of more than 700,000 background investigations and billions of dollars in associated costs.\nRaytheon Co. Vice President Jane Chappell told the Senate Intelligence Committee in March that fixing the clearance system should be a priority for the country and that the backlog was hurting “programs that provide critical warfighter capabilities.”\nFor now, it appears the Pentagon needs further information from the country’s financial regulators. Without a clear policy from the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission or other agencies, it will be very difficult for the Pentagon to issue guidance, according to Singh.\nIn the U.S., Bitcoin isn’t treated as a foreign currency for tax purposes, according to a Treasury Department spokeswoman, but Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network monitors virtual currency exchanges to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.\nIf the U.S. government were to assess that BitCoin is a form of foreign currency, “such activities could have an impact on a security clearance determination,” Major Audricia Harris, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.\nBad Intent\nThe government should keep in mind that owning cryptocurrencies may not indicate bad intent, said Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.\n“I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk,” Aftergood said. “Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk.”\nBut Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, said the Pentagon is right to scrutinize clearance applicants who own cryptocurrencies, even those who are buying and holding them as investments, known as \"HODL’ers.\"\n“Since Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,” he said. “As for the HODL’ers, eh, they will pass through the clearance process OK because its clear they are just little speculators. Or outright delusional speculators, in which case, do you really want that type in government?”\n--With assistance from Saleha Mohsin.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Daniel Flatley in Washington at dflatley1@bloomberg.net\n Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Larry Liebert\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "param vir singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carnegie mellon university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pnc center for financial services innovation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:17:21.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0833397f727a282c0bbbc72b81aa4c70cd048995", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KY0Be08UbvkSbfk7ueJAEvu.UTHKAqNOFmf6XBndFl_qrQwbHJWHQlYvGslOBMq5V7.hTNLaUdCKUpfq8A13kKKBefW8ekkX4Tyuc0TMx9_cOLfnQMuV_CwBTXO7gPrB4CTeKohluYY_MO8VWZoJff", "site_full": "electronicblockchain.com", "site": "electronicblockchain.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Coinbase: A bitcoin start-up spreading its bets to dominate cryptocurrency economy - ElectronicBlockchain", "title_full": "Coinbase: A bitcoin start-up spreading its bets to dominate cryptocurrency economy - ElectronicBlockchain", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "BG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0833397f727a282c0bbbc72b81aa4c70cd048995", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KY0Be08UbvkSbfk7ueJAEvu.UTHKAqNOFmf6XBndFl_qrQwbHJWHQlYvGslOBMq5V7.hTNLaUdCKUpfq8A13kKKBefW8ekkX4Tyuc0TMx9_cOLfnQMuV_CwBTXO7gPrB4CTeKohluYY_MO8VWZoJff", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Published Electronicblockchain On", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coinbase: A bitcoin start-up spreading its bets to dominate cryptocurrency economy - ElectronicBlockchain", "text": "\n[16] like some other global cryptocurrency exchanges, yet institutional investors are concerned about security. Lack of a trusted custodia to safeguard their crypto assets was the impetus to launch Coinbase Custody last November, Coinbase president and COO Hirji said.\n“They tell us that the No. 1 thing preventing them from getting started is the existence of a digital asset custodian that they can trust to store client funds securely,” the company wrote in a blog post.\nWall Street’s interest in cryptocurrency seems to be increasing. There are now 287 crypto hedge funds, up from 175 a year earlier, according to the latest data from Autonomous Next. Only 20 hedge funds for cryptocurrency existed in 2016. Goldman Sachs [17] is reportedly looking to open a cryptocurrency trading desk, and White said others will be quick to follow.\nThe company noted at the launch that more than 100 hedge funds have been created in the past year exclusively to trade digital currency.\nCoinbase Ventures, an incubator fund for early-stage start-ups working in cryptocurrencies and blockchain, launched one month after the index fund and has $15 million geared up for investments. It announced its first investment in a start-up called Compound, which lets you lend or borrow cryptocurrency and earn an interest rate. Coinbase joined Andreessen Horowitz, crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital and Bain Capital Ventures in the investment round.\n“We’ve looked at and invested in things that could be competitive to us,” Hirji said.\nEarlier this year it launched Coinbase Commerce, which lets merchants accept major cryptocurrencies for payment, an area of the crypto economy that Square is positioned to exploit. Another early-into-the-sector bitcoin start-up was BitPay, which recently raised another $40 million in venture money. BitPay processed more than $1 billion in bitcoin payments last year.\nCryptocurrency, if you buy its believers thesis, has the power to upend the entire financial system. Proponents of blockchain technology, which underpins bitcoin [19] , say it could eliminate the need for central authorities like banks, while lowering costs and even creating financial solutions for the unbanked. Earn.com, for example, can compensate users in any country for replying to an email or completing a simple task, even if they don’t have a bank account.\nThe Coinbase decision to keep access limited to four types of crypto has drawn criticism.

The operation has triggered over 70 investigations so far, with 35 cases completed or pending.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Mass Crackdown\nThe North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) said Monday that US and Canadian securities regulators have launched nationwide investigations on suspicious cryptocurrency investment schemes, the Washington Post reported. This is “the largest coordinated crackdown to date by state and provincial officials on bitcoin scams,” the news outlet wrote. CNBC elaborated:\nMore than 40 state and provincial watchdogs are participating in ‘Operation Crypto-Sweep,’ which has triggered at least 70 investigations so far.\nNASAA is a voluntary association whose members are securities administrators from states, provinces, and territories in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, and Mexico. According to its website, the association is the oldest international organization devoted to investor protection.\nThe association, which helps coordinate Operation Crypto-Sweep, confirmed that “as many as 70 investigations have been opened in the sweep, with more expected in the coming weeks.” Furthermore, the Washington Post detailed, “As many as 35 cases are pending or already completed, with some resulting in cease-and-desist letters warning the alleged schemes that their unregistered activity violates state securities law.”\nThe efforts focus on “unregistered securities offerings that promise lucrative returns without adequately informing investors of the risks” as well as initial coin offerings (ICOs), the regulators explained. Fighting Fraud\nBy posing as members of the public, the NASAA task force found roughly 30,000 crypto-related domain name registrations, the news outlet described, adding that “Many of the alleged scams use fake addresses, slick marketing materials and promises of over 4 percent daily interest,” the news outlet described. “A few have even used unauthorized photos of high-profile individuals, such as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to portray themselves as aboveboard.”\nThe director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board, Joseph Rotunda, was quoted saying, “Although the international task force’s work is far from complete, my suspicions have already been confirmed: The market for cryptocurrency investments is saturated with fraud, and our work is only revealing the tip of the iceberg.”\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal published a study showing that out of 1,470 ICOs, 271 were found to contain “red flags that include plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns and missing or fake executive teams.” Investors have poured more than $1 billion into these 271 ICOs, the publication added. In addition, a Chinese government-backed industry organization also published its fake crypto analysis last week, claiming that its monitoring system has detected 421 fake cryptocurrencies.\nMassachusetts’ Secretary of the Commonwealth, William Francis Galvin, emphasized on Monday:\nNot every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution.\nNASAA president and the director of the Alabama Securities Commission, Joseph Borg, explained that “consumers face higher risks of being misled at a time when the intense demand for bitcoin has prompted many retail investors to take extreme steps to gain exposure to the currency, such as taking out a bigger mortgage.”\nWhat do you think of Operation Crypto-Sweep?

The results reveal that the cryptocurrency has experienced a total of 44 forks since August last year.\nAmong the first on the list is the ever-famous Bitcoin Cash, which has gained popularity on its own and attracted the attention of companies like BitPay. Despite its shaky reputation, it continues to have a solid influence on the cryptocurrency market.\nThen came Bitcoin Gold, a version of Bitcoin created with the intention of decentralizing mining through an ASIC-resistant algorithm whose difficulty adjusts at every block.\nAfter all of that came some variants of the cryptocurrency that attempted to ride Bitcoin’s coattails by attaching its name to a fork without doing quite as much in the way of innovation.\nOnly four forks (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, and Bitcoin Private) have managed to actually generate any sort of significant trading volume. The rest haven’t done much more than create slightly-modified clones of the original.\nThe list includes coins that attached words to the “Bitcoin” name like Candy, Hot, Platinum, File, Faith, God, Pizza, Hush, Rhodium, Lunar, Green, and Clean.\nThe last is a fork of Bitcoin that supposedly can only be mined with renewable energy.\n“Every node must undergo a peer review to participate in the network,” according to a notice on its website.\nOur previous analysis of Bitcoin forks shows that very few of them have gained any traction at all, with some of them failing to achieve any measurable performance even after being listed on major exchanges like Binance.\nBitcoin Diamond, for example, has only experienced a couple of pumps here and there, eventually gaining it a listing in KuCoin and Binance.\nStill, despite an immense surge in market capitalization to almost half a billion dollars, the cryptocurrency’s value fails to break any significant price growth barriers.\nIts value sat at almost $100 at the end of last year and fell to mere single digits as it has hovered between $2 and $5 since February. × Stay up to date with market trends and exclusive crypto news!

The hard fork happened following the controversy over the integration of SegWit feature with Bitcoin’s blockchain.\nA host of forks have since followed — christened by adding any random word you can imagine next to Bitcoin: Candy, Pizza, God, Faith, Diamond, Gold, Atom, etc.\nMost of the forked cryptocurrencies, however, don’t seem to have had any luck when it comes to adoption or trading volumes.\nAs per Coinmarketcap data, only four of the forks (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Private) see trading volumes of more than $100,000 per 24 hours.\nBitcoin’s software is open-sourced, and a hard fork happens when a developer clones the Bitcoin’s blockchain to make a new blockchain and cryptocurrency by modifying the original code.\nIdeally, the purpose of a hard fork is to make technical advancements in the existing blockchain, when some people still want to keep using the consensus protocol of the older blockchain.\nBut it seems that most of the hard forks are only aimed at minting quick money using Bitcoin’s name rather than bringing any significant advancements in blockchain technology.\n“Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab,” George Kimionis, CEO of Coinomi told Bloomberg at the beginning of this year predicting that 2018 will see the launch of at least 50 Bitcoin hard forks. “Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases — rather than honest attempts to contribute to the blockchain ecosystem.”\nWith services such as Forkgen, which allow even rookie programmers to create Bitcoin hard forks, it is likely that the number will end up being a lot higher.\nLet’s see what names they’ll come up with — I am rooting for Bitcoin Butter Chicken Masala.

The allegations point to various points in the past and connections between CNBC and Bitcoin Cash executives. Many Twitter users saw the need to bring this to the SEC’s attention, frequently tagging the SEC and SEC Enforcement Twitter accounts.\nFirst on the timeline is the eponymous Brian Kelly’s failed altcoin. In July 2015, CNBC’s Brian Kelly claimed to have created a coin that reduced volatility. The coin in question was called NautilusCoin. In an article promoting it on CNBC, which itself is self-promotion using a trusted outlet, Kelly said:\n“Bitcoin, the elegant elixir for our fractured financial system, is actually flawed. It’s vulnerable to attacks. There is, however, a fix — something I had installed on my own coin experiment. Here’s how it works…”\nThe coin in question was created using the now-down website coingen.io, which allowed users to automatically create an altcoin based on parameters entered into a form. It was also clarified that the “stability fund” will hold majority ownership stake in the coin.\nTwitter user Samson Mow said on this:\n“A little birdie tipped me off on this gem. @BKBrianKelly was pumping & dumping NautilusCoin back in 2015. Makes perfect sense that he got the crew back together to do the same on @CNBCFastMoney.”\nThere were added allegations of CNBC Fast Money conducting a shill campaign for Bitcoin Cash, assumed from their constant posts on Twitter promoting Bitcoin Cash. This comes after Brian Kelly covered developments on Bitcoin Cash yet again this morning, saying it was a buy. He says:\n“#BitcoinCash has rallied over the past month while other cryptos, including $BTC, have fallen during that time. Can $BCH keep the crypto crown?”\nHe continues to say:\n“@BKBrianKelly reveals why he thinks the #BitcoinCash rally is far from over and takes some tweets to answer questions about the cryptocurrency $BCH”\nThis series of tweets by Samson Mow speaks up on this issue, saying:\n“Gotta love @CNBCFastMoney shilling $BCH at every opportunity. Watch how they highlight it here, but when it’s the worst performing of a particular day, there’s no mention.”\n“Convenient that @CNBCFastMoney doesn’t mention $BCH in the red.”\n“Nice selective timeframe to pump the $BCH altcoin to your viewers. May as well make a graphic putting it on a throne for dramatic effect right? Seriously, if these guys at @CNBC aren’t in jail by year end, someone isn’t doing their job. @SEC_Enforcement”\nA potential conflict of interest was also brought up as an issue, with user whalepanda bringing out a connection between Gaby Wasensteiner and Paul Wasensteiner. They are married, with Gaby working at CNBC as a marketing manager, while Paul is an Executive Director of the Bitcoin Cash fund. This brings about an alleged conflict of interest between the two companies, which, when coupled with the pro-Bitcoin Cash posts on the Twitter profile of CNBC Fast Money.\nUser Pier agreed saying:\n“Holy conflict of interest Batman.

Thus, prices could drop below the immediate support of $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) seen in the daily chart below.\nDaily chart\nA break below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would bolster the bearish setup seen in the hourly chart and would allow a drop to $8,000.\nNote, though, that the 5-day and 10-day moving averages are beginning to curl upwards, so if the price moves above $8,408 (daily high), the bulls could make a comeback.\nView BTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and drop to $8,000 in the next 24 hours. A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,000 would signal a revival of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990. In such a case, bitcoin could suffer a deeper sell-off towards $7,500. On the higher side, a move above $8,408 would open the doors to $8,858 (100-day moving average). A daily close above that level would signal a bullish trend reversal and could yield rally to $10,000.\nBitcoins and USD image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T16:13:22.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef7556c8ee866f37ccadb6998ebb97a316181c1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54IodXbhbCBxpKDHY1MK4wwfxTBVgbEfYqwYbJybz4g5o9yBwQ2jFXouxrIAH8naVUZ.6BA6PQhp88ZqBMgmSMndjdg2OgRns7A--", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Argentina: Bank Ditches SWIFT For Bitcoin In World Payments First - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "Argentina: Bank Ditches SWIFT For Bitcoin In World Payments First - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_446725087-Argentina-flag.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef7556c8ee866f37ccadb6998ebb97a316181c1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54IodXbhbCBxpKDHY1MK4wwfxTBVgbEfYqwYbJybz4g5o9yBwQ2jFXouxrIAH8naVUZ.6BA6PQhp88ZqBMgmSMndjdg2OgRns7A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wilma Woo", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Argentina: Bank Ditches SWIFT For Bitcoin In World Payments First - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "Argentina: Bank Ditches SWIFT For Bitcoin In World Payments First May 22, 2018 23 Views Wilma Woo · May 22, 2018 · 12:00 pm\nA bank in Argentina could soon become the first in the world to begin using Bitcoin for customers’ international remittances. Service Highlights ‘No Intermediaries’\nThe initiative, which Banco Masventas (BMV) launched May 22nd, is the result of a partnership with local blockchain financial services startup Bitex.\nOnce payments begin being sent, BMV will likely become the world’s first banking institution to actively leverage Bitcoin as an international payments standard.\nThe move is a conspicuous move away from extant options such as the SWIFT clearing network, which has seen multiple failures and security problems in recent years.\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” a dedicated information page on the bank’s website states.\nThe service will initially roll out to 50 countries, with payment timeframes reduced to 24 hours. Outpacing the Rest\nIf it proves to be successful, Argentina would significantly outstep progress with cryptocurrencies by its neighbors, while the country’s domestic banking sector has been preparing for closer integration for some time.\nIn April, an event dubbed ‘ Bitcoin Day ’ in the capital, Buenos Aires, saw participants approve the supportive environment around Bitcoin, contrasting it with the prohibitive stance taken by authorities in countries such as Chile .\nChanges in legislation have also resulted in operators pledging to install thousands of Bitcoin ATMs throughout Argentina this year.\nEarlier this month meanwhile, Brazil’s largest asset management company moved to launch an over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading platform, highlighting a wish to target institutional investor money.\nBlockchain-based payments are also gaining traction with banks, with Santander becoming the first to launch the facility for customers in several jurisdictions, including Brazil, in April via a partnership with Ripple.\n“Transfers to Europe can be made on the same day and we are aiming to deliver instant transfers across several markets by the summer,” the bank said in a statement .\nWhat do you think about Banco Masventas’ Bitcoin payments?

If you stacked the pizza boxes you can get for that many Bitcoins today, they’d rise to outer space.\nAt today’s price near $8,200 per Bitcoin, you could get about 6.5 million $12.50 pizzas. If you stacked those pizza boxes, they’d climb almost 200 miles (300 kilometers) into the air, according to data from Forex Time, a foreign exchange broker. Its animated infographic marks the landmarks crossed by the boxes -- Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, Mount Everest, a passenger airplane -- before shooting into space. Bitcoin isn’t quite getting to the moon, but close.\nAs Bitcoin’s value soared over the years, the developer who made the initial purchase, Laszlo Hanyecz, became a legend in the crypto space and beyond. He’ll forever be known as the guy who forked over assets now valued at $82 million, for pizza. Earlier this year Hanyecz replicated his move using the Lightning Network, a technology that runs parallel to Bitcoin’s blockchain and aims to speed up transactions.\nBitcoin Pizza Day has become a reminder of how much the coin’s price has skyrocketed even after the slump from the record of almost $20,000 last year. The largest cryptocurrency was worth pennies at the time of the first pizza purchase.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Camila Russo in New York at crusso15@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors Michael P.

Laszlo Hanyecz\nOn the forum, still online , Hanyecz added: “I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire. If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.”\nAfter a few days one man under the alias “Jercos,” real-name Jeremy Sturdivant, came through with the food order. And On May 22, Hanyecz confirmed: “I just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.” The transaction was orchestrated using IRC (Internet Relay Chat). See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\nLazlo later posted images of the two pizzas, which were seemingly from Papa Johns. One commenter, “Ribuck,” quipped: “Will this eventually become the world's first million-dollar pizza?” Well, yes.\nSturdivant later said that he believed the pizzas sent were from Dominos , leading to some confusion. “I’m starting to really regret not keeping chat logs of the event, as I clearly remember Domino's pizza (right down to their particular web interface), but the pictures show Papa John’s,” he noted. Still, the transaction happened. Thanks to the blockchain records, it can still be viewed online today .\nA Twitter bot set up to track bitcoin values on a daily basis—using the handle @bitcoin_pizza— wrote today : “The #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day!”\nHanyecz told the New York Times in 2013 that he didn’t regret the exchange. He said that he later sold his bitcoin, worth around $4,000, to get a new computer and a couple of new video cards. “So I’d say I ended up on top,” he noted. Sturdivant, meanwhile, told a dedicated crypto website in 2015 that he was aware that the transaction—if successful—had the potential to make cryptocurrency history.\n“I just happened to take a visible step as a part of the whole community's growing trust in bitcoin, it didn't feel unique in the sense that if I hadn't accepted that offer, someone else surely would have...but at the same time I was certainly somewhat aware that this was setting a precedent for casual trade with bitcoin,” he told bitcoinwhoswho.com . Looking back, he stated: “Retrospectively, simply having that much bitcoin in one place is quite a crazy thought. Of course that wasn't notable at the time, as bitcoin was just getting started, and it otherwise felt much like later [smaller] transactions.”\nAt the time of writing, a single bitcoin is valued at $8,300.

Previous lawsuits filed in relation to the ICO also contained allegations of securities law violations, as well as investor fraud.\nIn its motion, Bitcoin Suisse further distanced itself from Tezos, stating that the plaintiff failed to connect the two organizations in the lawsuit. As such, it claims that the court does not have jurisdiction over Bitcoin Suisse AG and therefore it should not be involved in the action.\nBitcoin Suisse also claims that MacDonald did not even specify a particular grievance against it, writing, \"To assert a claim under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act, a plaintiff must allege that defendant offered or sold a security in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 77e to the plaintiff.\"\nHowever, it continues, \"Here, Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege: that Bitcoin Suisse offered or sold a security in connection with the Tezos ICO; and that Plaintiff purchased a security from Bitcoin Suisse in connection with the Tezos ICO.\"\nIn supporting this argument, Bitcoin Suisse states that it did not offer or sell securities. A hearing about the filing will likely not be held until July 19, according to the document.\nTezos completed its initial coin offering in July of last year, bringing in a record-breaking $232 million-worth (at the time) of bitcoin and ether.\nLaw image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Charles Reveal the Future of Cash CNBC Predicts Bitcoin Cash to Moon, and Soon\nWednesday in the US is known colloquially as Hump Day, the point at which the weekend seems closer. It’s also the day more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tuning in to CNBC’s Fast Money program, a self described “post-market show,” hosted by Melissa Lee with contributions from well regarded traders.\nTrader Brian Kelly , founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, was asked to detail just why it is he’s so bullish on bitcoin cash. In introducing his plasma-fronted segment, Ms. Lee read what appears to be a month-long trend, describing bitcoin cash as having “vanquished” the likes of bitcoin core (BTC), down 5%, litecoin down 9%, and ripple down 21% while BCH remained positive at 6% price growth.\nMr. Kelly asked viewers to simply look at what he refers to as catalyst factors, aspects of a digital asset, no matter what the asset, that might have caused it to gain traction in price going forward. In the case of bitcoin cash, Mr. Kelly cheered the latest development among its mining community to pool portions of rewards toward building a fund for future development. He compared it to an app store where devs pile on uses for a smartphone previously unthought of or dreamed of but not implemented. BCH, he insisted, wasn’t the only project to do something like this, and he even managed to sandwich in the word “potentially” when describing price prospects.\nHe also equated more on-chain development with potential use cases, and use cases, then, with, well, usability and appeal to more people in the eventual hope of more adoption. Curiously he described the mining community’s latest move as a kind of cartelization, though benevolent, words and phrases that immediately rile most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He acknowledged it, however, as a potential negative. Let the Market Decide\nUltimately it all comes down to the market, Mr. Kelly noted. He turned to charting, where over the past year or so BCH has followed the broader crypto market with incredible highs back in late 2017, a precipitous drop in 2018, and a recent stabilization if not slight uptick. Drawing a horizontal line across the screen, Mr. Kelly described bitcoin cash as mostly holding support levels for the moment, a good sign. He called his squibbles and markings “a good looking chart” and a “place I want to buy.”\nMs. Lee then peppered Mr. Kelly with questions from viewers. Asked if he was in to bitcoin cash for the long term, he turned diplomatic. He reminded viewers he was a trader, moving in and out of positions quickly. He wants to invest in the coin that eventually becomes the global currency, living up to crypto hype. For now, Mr. Kelly said, bitcoin core (BTC) has a massive network effect advantage, but that could change.\nYet another viewer asked if Mr. Kelly had ever actually used BCH to buy something, and if not then what is its use? Mr. Kelly said he had not used bitcoin cash, but that his interest is only in its speculative value. He did say he’d used bitcoin core to buy things and to send money, and so he understands its ultimate power. The final question in the segment got Mr. Kelly laughing, as a person asked if he was indeed Roger Ver. When Ms. Lee effectively ended the spot, she was keen to emphasize CNBC and her program take exactly no money to promote anything on the show, and how no one has any connection to BCH beyond an investment.\nThe strangest reaction by far came from BTC ambassador Samson Mow. Mr. Mow’s personality in the debate between BTC and BCH is often dismissive, above-it-all. He knows, you don’t, and you simply need to get in line. Humorless. Uncharitable. Superior. That’s all excusable, and there’s always been such an element in tech (the more obnoxious sort tend to come from Silicon Valley), but his reaction to the CNBC segment described above places him in rarified air. With a picture of a shadowy figure behind bars, Chairman Mow typed, “Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment.” That’s right, a lower-level crypto spokesperson is advocating use of jail to punish opinions different from his. Yikes.\nAre you excited about BCH adoption and innovation?

They aim to utilise Bitcoin as a low-fee cryptocurrency which can be transferred across borders and easily exchanged for fiat currencies. Bank Moves from SWIFT to Bitcoin\nBMV said in a statement : “The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries. The logistics solution allows for a reduction in the time it takes to send or receive transfers up to a maximum of 24 hours. Bitex has a wide network of partners that enables international transfers to more than 50 countries.”\nBitcoin enables transfers to be made without using third parties and does not rely on any trusted parties. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that validate transactions and uses incentives to ensure that the network operates accurately. It also uses cryptography, such as hash functions, to ensure that only the person who holds their Bitcoin can spend it as well as providing a public ledger to ensure accountability.\nBitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider for both individuals and institutions. They help to create logistics solutions which allow for payments to be made between multiple countries. Bitex are self-regulated, but follow compliance and KYC rules. They have also hired Deloitte services to fulfil audits on the company’s operations and holding of funds.\nU.K. bank Santander has continued their move into the blockchain ecosystem by announcing their new app One Pay FX which uses Ripple technology in April. The app was launched in Spain, the U.K., Brazil, and Poland and is designed to make cross-border payments in a matter of minutes. It runs on xCurrent, a payment solution provided by Ripple Net but does not exclusively use XRP which is associated with Ripple. XRP is used by xRapid, another solution, and has been successfully trialled by Mercury FX.\nRipple have targeted banks and, specifically, cross-border payment providers and argue that XRP can save costs and deliver faster transactions than using SWIFT or Bitcoin. This move by BMV shows a preference for the number one ranked cryptocurrency by market cap instead of XRP which is aimed at being used by banks. In Q1, along with other xRapid pilots customers, we have proved that #xRapid can lower liquidity costs & increase payment speed and transparency using #XRP . We are looking forward to continued successful testing and going into production. https://t.co/hlYDcFyG7o\n— Mercury-fx Ltd (@mercury_fx_ltd) April 26, 2018 Should Bitcoin Be Used by Banks?\nMany token holders will welcome real-world integration as an increase in use of a coin usually leads to an increase in price. However, Bitcoin was initially set up in a libertarian environment which was hostile to banks. In fact, the Bitcoin’s genesis block contains an extract from the Times which references the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin is also pseudonymous which makes it harder for governments to keep track of payments and users.\nIn this partnership, we have an example of a low-fee cryptocurrency being used by a bank which is then charging 3% plus VAT for the service. This means that the bank is profiting from the low fees that Bitcoin offers. On the other hand, BMV did suggest it has passed some of the savings on to the customer.

If you haven’t noticed, he takes time, often, to announce Tron’s inclusion in the top ten and how long it remains there at any given moment in time.\nAs we hear it, there is a reason for this ‘pump’ talk that is based in reality and giving Justin Sun even more confidence than usual. An Alibaba announcement is coming, and sooner than many think.\nWe are mere days away from Mainnet going online and an entirely new set of fundamentals kicking in for $TRX. It is exactly what $TRX bag holders have been clamouring for throughout 2018.\nBut the bigger news is what has been passed to us by someone on the $TRX team.\nOur source took a moment to explain the timing and who, what, where and why of a close to ‘dual announcement’ that is on its way:\n“Anybody who is reading the tea leaves connected to Justin and Jack’s (Ma) relationship doesn’t have to build a bridge too far to figure it out. It is the internal timing that is what makes this interesting. As soon as Mainnet goes online we expect Justin to further step into the limelight and go public with the already agreed upon partnership with Alibaba. And let me make that clear…the agreement is already in place, but Alibaba has been waiting on Mainnet to be able to fortify their crypto execution concerns. And that has happened.”\n“Another facet of this announcement is that we think that Jack (Ma) is going to put some effort into $TRX being added to some high profile exchange once the announcement is made public. Adding institutional capabilities and acceptance of a currency that Alibaba is tying itself to will ensure deeper price stability. So the word you guys got last week is actually tied to this news as well.”\n“A tremendous amount of planning has been done for all of this to make the second half of 2018 a huge jumping off point for the longer term viability of Tron and their place in the market. An Alibaba partnership will lead to hundreds more that are downstream and part of the Alibaba network. For example, Alibaba has a mobile payment system, similar to the Cash app or PayPal. Justin wants all of it to occur this year…and for Tron to no longer pop in and out of the top ten by market cap territory; but firmly in the top five or six. If/when these developments occur and are announced you can bet that is where $TRX goes.”\nEvery word of that will make Tron fans giddy. Every. Single. Word.\nIt was a fascinating discussion with someone on the inside and hearing them describe the pace at which Tron, and by extension cryptos, have to move. It is a market cap race, a use case race, a partnerships race – all in an attempt to ensure their long-term viability.\nOne last comment from our source:\n“Anybody with a few brain cells can deduct that when the dust settles there won’t be thousands or even hundreds of cryptocurrencies. There may be 10-15 that exist now, and a few others that are either government contrived or have yet to be launched. This is precisely why Justin is pressing as hard as he is right now.”\nPressing or not pressing, it is a startling thing to consider the largest online retailer in the world is about to go crypto. How quickly ideas morph into action within crypto. Watch this one as it unfolds. If Justin Sun and the Tron team pull it off, kudos to them.

The $8 million dollars was stored in the form of bitcoin, and the state seized at least 1,071 BTC — funds that will be confiscated pending conviction.\nGit’s alleged operation spanned 10 years and many different forums and websites which the State Prosecutor claims he set up to launder money, facilitate credit card fraud through a wide network of criminals, instruct others how to remotely access computers to rob funds, and defraud unwitting visitors to his sites.\nThrough one scam he apparently pretended to sell cheap mobile phones but would block users from the website after receiving payment and cut off contact with them. He would then take over the user’s profile and post messages in their name seeming to confirm receipt of their goods, luring in more victims. TEL AVIV, ISRAEL – 2017 DECEMBER 10 : The first Bitcoin Bank Change Shop in the main street of the center of the city of Tel Aviv\nEven more serious was the credit card fraud operation through which Git allegedly offered free and premium memberships to clients buying access to credit cards from Git to commit fraud. The report also claims that he published guides on his site instructing users on how to hack and rob people online as well as offering tools enabling them to do so. Local media outlet Calcalist reports that Git’s indictment contained a quote from him saying:\n“We are thieves. Anywhere we can take money, we’ll take it, whether it’s from Israel, the US, or even the moon.”\nThe state will file to continue holding Git in custody to prevent him from regaining control of his online crime empire, stating that internet access will “enable him to continue carrying out the criminal enterprise he established over the past decade,” saying Git will “not hesitate to commit fraudulent offenses against innocent victims.”\nThe wallet seizure marks the first time in Israeli history that bitcoin funds have been seized by police, and upon conviction a legal precedent may be set for the state confiscation of cryptocurrency assets.\nOther countries have already handled illicit bitcoins in the same way, with the US government seizing 512 BTC and 512 BCH in January from a drug dealer on the dark web and auctioning off the currency and other assets. A similar incident took place in Finland in February where 2000 bitcoins were seized from an alleged drug dealer.\nImages from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hilmi git", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hebron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T01:39:03.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "49d457ede8e352e39d12f1812ab2c42f3c1d518c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVCz5x3iRo.W.i9kyH0inoZhawb1sTf4Tbjb_F3oWQEcmxHyjn.a95JdW4OJGBoGh5sNk7yCIoNRGm8H8kVIQX7heLz0J7SFy5abcIN9XjSMA-", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Owning Contractors With U.S. Security Clearance May be Flagged 'Risky' - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Bitcoin Owning Contractors With U.S. Security Clearance May be Flagged 'Risky' - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penta.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49d457ede8e352e39d12f1812ab2c42f3c1d518c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVCz5x3iRo.W.i9kyH0inoZhawb1sTf4Tbjb_F3oWQEcmxHyjn.a95JdW4OJGBoGh5sNk7yCIoNRGm8H8kVIQX7heLz0J7SFy5abcIN9XjSMA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Redman", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Owning Contractors With U.S. Security Clearance May be Flagged 'Risky' - Bitcoin News", "text": "2696 Bitcoin Owning Contractors With U.S. Security Clearance May be Flagged ‘Risky’\nAccording to multiple reports, the Pentagon and the Defense Department are debating on whether or not cryptocurrency ownership is a problem for those who have U.S. security clearances and those applying for these privileges. The U.S. agencies may define digital currency owners as a ‘security risk’ in order to protect foreign and domestic classified information.\nAlso read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards If You Own Bitcoin and Have U.S. Security Clearance Then You Might Have a Problem\nAmerican bureaucrats are deliberating on whether or not they should flag cryptocurrency investors who have special security clearances to classified government information. An individual who owns a cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum, may be considered “risky” in the eyes of the Pentagon. This past February the Defense Security Service (DSS) and the Pentagon revealed they were working on guidelines for reporting cryptocurrency ownership. According to another report published on May 22, the debate is currently being argued and government contractors are already upset about the backlog of other security clearance issues.\nA director for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, Param Vir Singh, believes cryptocurrencies do have security risks.\n“There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,” explained Param Vir Singh this week.\nThink about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well. DSS Recommends Cryptocurrency Owners With Security Clearance Should Report Their Virtual Currency Holdings\nFurther, the columnist Adam Reese recently reviewed an email by a DSS employee named Chad M. Campbell — which indicates that the security specialist recommends individuals who apply for U.S. security clearance need to report their cryptocurrency holdings on the agency’s Standard Form 86 (SF86). Additionally, the reporter received a reply from Defense Security Service Public Affairs which stated:\n“DSS has fielded a number of questions from industry as to whether ownership of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be reported by cleared persons or security clearance applicants,” explains the Defense Department.\nThere is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies. DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry. Additionally, the email [Campbell’s email] was an internal discussion document which was not intended to serve as policy guidance. University of California Researcher: ‘Bitcoin Owners Deserve Suspicion’\nIndividuals and organizations see the security clearance/cryptocurrency discussion as a controversial subject as opinions differ depending on who is discussing the matter. Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists believes holding cryptocurrencies or other behaviors don’t necessarily make a person risky. “I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk — Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk,” Aftergood explains.\nHowever, a researcher at the University of California, Nicholas Weaver, disagrees and thinks digital currency holders should be suspects. “Since Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,” Weaver said this week. It’s also worth noting that some of these DSS and Pentagon officials who firmly believe cryptocurrencies are a ‘security risk’ have no problem with defense contractors who shill centralized blockchains. The DSS is not calling blockchain projects sponsored by Booze Hamilton Allen or the company’s employees suspicious — Nope just bitcoin and public blockchains seem to be a threat at the moment.\nWhat do you think about the DSS and Pentagon’s discussion about bitcoin classification and raising suspicion against cryptocurrency owners?

The circulating supply levels are presently 17048275 with a market capitalization of 1.40624E+11. Recent volume has been seen at 5093230000. Since the last day’s settlement price, the currency has seen a change of -2.10%.\nAbout Bitcoin (BTC):Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency that can be sent through the internet globally without using financial institutions like banks. The network is controlled by many of its users, instead of a few entities.\nFollowing all the happenings in the fast paced crypto markets can be a challenge. Cryptocurrency may be in a remarkable position to transform financial systems that have been in place for a long period of time. Technologies that are transformative typically evolve from a need to solve a certain problem. The peer to peer systems have the ability to make transactions easier and quicker. Although there are plenty of naysayers opining about the current crypto scene, it remains to be seen what will transpire over the next six months. The vast number of marketplaces across the Internet may be welcoming to these new technologies as the fast changing conditions evolve.\nCryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, but they may function a bit differently. There are various factors to look at when examining a specific digital currency. Some of these include processing speed, available currency supply, and total amount of currency. Investors will most likely want to dig deeper and see who is behind a certain coin. Currencies that seem too good to be true might be just exactly that. There should be plenty of information available from the creators that can be researched. Understanding how different cryptocurrencies work may help the investor decide which ones are worth purchasing and which ones should be left alone.\nThese days, it is hard to read about new technology without hearing about the latest developments with blockchain. Blockchain is an open sourced computer protocol that lets users conduct peer-to-peer transactions. Blockchain technology is designed to confirm the validity of transactions in real time. Using cryptography, blocks are created by a “mining” process in which computers solve highly complex and random cryptography.

This way, no one is linked to any activity on casino platforms.\nEthereum , on the other hand, could do what Bitcoin did, but even more. Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency but has a platform on which casinos could implement complex systems, moving funds from one end to another even without any human interference or validation with the help of smart contracts. This future has made many ask if this (the Ethereum) isn’t the future for online payments.\nThough these two cryptocurrencies are usually grouped, the difference between them is quite clear from what purposes they serve. Bitcoin was introduced to replace the current physical currency while Ethereum is to host tons of applications which can function on their own without any administration at the backend. Before You Make Your Decision\nAs discussed earlier, cryptocurrencies have been integrated into the system based on various advantages if offered and have seen gained massive popularity among different payment methods, physically and digitally. Now, casinos will allow you deposit and earn cryptocurrencies with ease. There are a ton of platforms which offer these methods, to know which one people rank the most based on different criteria, click here .\nNot having to disclose any form of information about oneself is also a significant factor people would prefer to settle for cryptocurrency casinos than the conventional ones. And since no country has recognized these virtual currencies as legal tenders, they are therefore not subject to being taxed, and casino users don’t need to pay any transaction fee to any financial organization either.\nWhat Bitcoin lacks is the ability to run decentralized applications like Ethereum platform. This technology has undoubtedly been of immense benefit to online platforms. Ethereum, on the other hand, isn’t as easy to purchase with fiat like the Bitcoin, depending on what country you reside. Sometimes, on some exchanges, you might need to buy bitcoin and exchange for Ethereum. Thankfully, more cryptocurrency exchanges are springing up with the feature of purchasing all cryptocurrency with fiat.\nIt is clear that both cryptocurrencies have their good and bad sides and the two should be adequately weighted when considering which is best.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n[WASHINGTON] As the Pentagon struggles to recruit a more tech-savvy workforce, it’s facing the confusion of many an old-timer: What to make of people who invest or trade in Bitcoin.\nThe question is whether owning Bitcoins or lesser-known cryptocurrencies such as Ripple and Ethereum is an indicator of risky personal behaviour -- one that should flag extra scrutiny in security clearances -- or just another investment choice.\n“There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,” said Param Vir Singh, director of the PNC Center for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. “Think about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well.”\nThe debate is playing out across the government, as the Defense Department and other agencies struggle to define the currencies. Some see them simply as new investments and payment methods, while others worry they provide potential vehicles for illegal activities, from money laundering to drug-dealing. sentifi.com Market voices on:\nIt’s a debate that matters for the sprawling US national security apparatus, which has to keep track of more than 4 million people with some form of security clearance. That includes workers who, at least in theory, could sell secrets to America’s enemies with the aid of anonymous transactions facilitated by cryptocurrencies. SEE ALSO: As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans US$2b IPO\nTerrorists and cybercriminals use cryptocurrencies to shield their transactions from investigators and often demand payment in Bitcoins and other digital assets, according to international law-enforcement groups including the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre.\nAt the same time, young investors have decamped from the halls of prominent financial institutions for the evolving world of cryptocurrency investing, and entire states have pegged their futures to its popularity. The instrument is going mainstream as Goldman Sachs Group Inc moves forward with Bitcoin trading operations.\nNevertheless, Bitcoin has fallen about 50 per cent from its December high to about US$8,400 as regulators around the world continue to evaluate how to manage digital assets and some Wall Street pros dismiss the market. Warren Buffett, for example, has likened Bitcoin to “rat poison squared”.\nIf the US government were to decide that owning cryptocurrencies is a security risk, it could have a “huge negative impact” on the growing market, according to Mr Singh.\nAny move to more closely investigate job applicants who own cryptocurrencies also could hamper the Pentagon’s efforts to expand its operations in cyberspace, a goal that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has made a priority.\n“If we’re going to say that if you’ve got a Bitcoin or another digital currency account that could be a signal or shoot up a red flag for a security clearance, guess what? Those people aren’t going to sit around waiting to try to onboard for a government job,” Greg Touhill, a retired Air Force general who was the first Federal Chief Information Security Officer, said in an interview. “It would grow the backlog considerably, in my view.”\nThe Pentagon has sent conflicting messages about how it’s handling the matter.\nAfter a Defense Security Service employee suggested in an email that Bitcoin be considered a foreign currency and reported on the lengthy SF-86 security form filled out by clearance applicants, DSS quickly countered by issuing official guidance saying...there is no official Department of Defense guidance, according to ETHNews, an online cryptocurrency news site.\n“There is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies,” according to a statement posted to the DSS website. “DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry.”\nThe equivocation has been cited by law firms and job search sites. ClearanceJobs.com put it bluntly: “Should you report your Bitcoin to your security officer? It depends upon who you ask.”\nThe lack of clear direction from the Pentagon only adds to the headaches already faced by government contractors that need to hire workers with security clearances.\nTheir top priority is overhauling a clearance system with a backlog of more than 700,000 background investigations and billions of dollars in associated costs.\nRaytheon Co vice-president Jane Chappell told the Senate Intelligence Committee in March that fixing the clearance system should be a priority for the country and that the backlog was hurting “programs that provide critical warfighter capabilities.”\nFor now, it appears the Pentagon needs further information from the country’s financial regulators. Without a clear policy from the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission or other agencies, it will be very difficult for the Pentagon to issue guidance, according to Singh.\nIn the US, Bitcoin isn’t treated as a foreign currency for tax purposes, according to a Treasury Department spokeswoman, but Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network monitors virtual currency exchanges to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.\nIf the US government were to assess that BitCoin is a form of foreign currency, “such activities could have an impact on a security clearance determination,” Major Audricia Harris, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.\nThe government should keep in mind that owning cryptocurrencies may not indicate bad intent, said Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.\n“I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk,” Mr Aftergood said. “Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk.”\nBut Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, said the Pentagon is right to scrutinise clearance applicants who own cryptocurrencies, even those who are buying and holding them as investments, known as \"HODL’ers.\"\n“Since Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc, it deserves suspicion,” he said. “As for the HODL’ers, eh, they will pass through the clearance process OK because its clear they are just little speculators. Or outright delusional speculators, in which case, do you really want that type in government?”\nBLOOMBERG Sign up for BT Newsletters Please wait ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "param vir singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banking & finance - the business times bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carnegie mellon university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pnc center for financial services innovation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T20:56:26.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6589efdea159cddaecef8c9e40b252e699c6a709", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdNw8Pv8MuSanPx5sE6r2acmVaRhix6lWlqka7kswK.x12Mk_YtYII_r_gnW8hnBwc4ZXwzMl.4PbPEF3GSy372ZEUIHxP6yMABsPDZ.TyN2Q--", "site_full": "digitalgoldmine.com", "site": "digitalgoldmine.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Failed Bull Breakout Leaves Bitcoin Eyeing Drop to $8K – Digital Gold Mine", "title_full": "Failed Bull Breakout Leaves Bitcoin Eyeing Drop to $8K – Digital Gold Mine", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6589efdea159cddaecef8c9e40b252e699c6a709", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdNw8Pv8MuSanPx5sE6r2acmVaRhix6lWlqka7kswK.x12Mk_YtYII_r_gnW8hnBwc4ZXwzMl.4PbPEF3GSy372ZEUIHxP6yMABsPDZ.TyN2Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Failed Bull Breakout Leaves Bitcoin Eyeing Drop to $8K – Digital Gold Mine", "text": "Beginner's Guide , Bitcoin , News No comments\nBitcoin’s failed bull move on Sunday has left the doors open for the bears to make a comeback.\nThe inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on May 20 signaled a short-term bullish reversal that could have seen bitcoin rise to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method).\nHowever, the bulls ran out of steam at a high of $8,644 yesterday and prices had fallen back to $8,240 at time of writing – a drop of 2.8 percent over the last 24 hours, according to Bitfinex.\nThe decline did not come as a surprise, though, given the breakout lacked volume support, and a drop to $8,000 could now be on the cards. 1-hour chart\nAs seen in the chart above, BTC fell back below the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline yesterday, weakening the bulls and has established a lower-high and lower-low pattern (bearish setup).

Having began 2017 at a mere value of $four, Litecoin surged to its all-time excessive of $346 with a whopping over 80,000% returns within the final yr. Litecoin has established its foothold within the crypto markets as one of many favorite decide of traders and is at present the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Litecoin was created in 2011 by one of many former Google workers Charlie Lee and was the result of one of many first forks within the Bitcoin blockchain. In a current set of growth, founder Charlie Lee introduced on his Twitter account saying that he’s planning to launch two new Litecoin-based funds processing providers forward this yr. One of many providers shall be known as as LitePal that shall be introduced later this yr. The official web site states that this service shall be having a charge which is “bone chilling low” and customers will be capable of use the service with Western Union, PayPal, Bitcoin and Litecoin. Nevertheless, no more particulars can be found concerning this service in the mean time however a tandem announcement mentioned: “LitePal is a Litecoin-first fee processor. We envision a cryptocurrency world the place Litecoin is utilised by retailers from all around the world; one streamlined, easy, much less complicated course of. Thanks @SatoshiLite for creating the LTC all of us love!” However, the Litecoin group is sort of excited in regards to the launch of LitePay that may make Litecoin usable anyplace and in every single place Visa is getting used. The service will immediately convert all funds to/from U.S Greenback instantly and the deposits will incur a flat 1% transaction cost towards three% incurred by bank cards in the mean time. A analysis analyst at Lombardi Monetary, Palwasha Saaim whereas explaining the deserves of LitePay mentioned: “ It will permit companies to just accept Litecoin with out worrying about value volatility. Funds could be processed by LitePay instantaneously and settled straight with their banks. Take be aware that BitPay is at present charging about $5.00 transaction charges for processing Bitcoin transactions that take ages to verify. One of the best half is that Litecoin customers will be capable of convert litecoins to and vice versa via their Visa-compatible LitePay playing cards, which shall be usable in any respect ATMs or companies that help Visa funds. ” One of many key causes traders are interested in Litecoin is that it’s fairly equivalent to Bitcoin however addresses lots of the shortcomings of Bitcoin.

We are hoping this will bridge this gap,” said Rachael Mayer, senior product manager at Circle.\nUsers can invest as little as $1 using the new feature, and will mark cryptocurrencies by 1%, but won’t charge any fixed fees.\nAltcoins under pressure again It was a rough Tuesday for the smaller coins. Ether ETHUSD, -0.76% which runs on the Ethereum network, is down 5.3% to $660.95, Bitcoin Cash BCHUSD, -1.42% has lost 7% to $1,152.00, Litecoin LTCUSD, -0.16% is off 3.2% at $130.87 and Ripple’s XRP coin XRPUSD, -0.47% is down 2.6%, last trading at 66 cents.\nFutures closed the day in the red.

The currency rose to the $8,500 mark 48 hours ago, but has incurred subsequent drops ever since. In addition, bitcoin has also failed to sustain previous support levels at $8,300, thus leading to the most recent drop.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat (whom we’ve discussed in our last two price articles) is again in the news . He’s sticking to his guns and insists bitcoin will reach $25,000 by the end of 2018. However, he is clarifying his words by saying that bitcoin does not need to experience price hikes “every day” to reach this goal.\nIn an interview with CNBC , Lee explained:\n“We have to keep in mind that Bitcoin at $8,000 and Bitcoin, let’s say we think it can reach $25,000. It does not require Bitcoin to go up every day until the end of the year. Remember – the ten best days account for all the return of Bitcoin. If you didn’t own Bitcoin for ten days each year, you lost 25 percent a year since 2010.”\nAt press time, support levels for the currency have fallen to roughly $8,150, and more bear trends are expected in the coming days. Should things move further in this direction, bitcoin could fall to $8,000 even, though a reversal might see it swinging towards $9,300. However, worst case scenario would see bitcoin dropping to as low as $7,969, with a mid-point average of $8,300. In other words, the currency could wind up staying as it is for some time.\nToday is Bitcoin Pizza Day , and this could potentially push the currency’s publicity a little further. Approximately eight years ago, a computer programmer allegedly paid around 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas. Today, those coins would be worth more than $80 million. Hence, May 22 has since become a “national holiday” for bitcoin and pizza enthusiasts alike.\nIn an interview with The New York Times , Laszlo Hanyecz – the programmer who purchased the pies with crypto – says he has no regrets about the situation.\n“It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” he stated.\nA Twitter account is providing 24-hour updates regarding how much the pizzas would have cost today based on the latest bitcoin prices. Cryptocurrency news platform Coindesk has also released its own Bitcoin Pizza Day price tracker.\nThe event is likely to give bitcoin a few pushes along the way, though the big move enthusiasts need to witness is further acceptance amongst retail clients, which has been relatively slow. Many merchants refuse to accept bitcoin due its ongoing volatility. According to one Morgan Stanley analyst:\n“The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is striking.”\nThe good news, however, is that we are continuing to witness stronger institutional capital entering the crypto-space via Wall Street and major brokers. Perhaps this is the doorway bitcoin needs to solidify its presence in the retail world.\nFull details at themerkle.com/bitcoin-price-watch-currency-falls-to-8200/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee of fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:20:44.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a21a546efffe2d94ceb8ee031b3b34638687339", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrvqxpYSj0qRVqy7jhkaZYuDcnwp8JYod34zXK4S9OYna2DZ49Df2ScwotjZ7dlwUIUeG.QftFHOW73XHZRIOXBHJEdfRxgTt8-", "site_full": "stocksmasters.com", "site": "stocksmasters.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "CNBC Shows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Love, Predicts Mooning - Stocks Masters", "title_full": "CNBC Shows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Love, Predicts Mooning - Stocks Masters", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://stocksmasters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cnbc-bk-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a21a546efffe2d94ceb8ee031b3b34638687339", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrvqxpYSj0qRVqy7jhkaZYuDcnwp8JYod34zXK4S9OYna2DZ49Df2ScwotjZ7dlwUIUeG.QftFHOW73XHZRIOXBHJEdfRxgTt8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "CNBC Shows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Love, Predicts Mooning - Stocks Masters", "text": "CNBC Shows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Love, Predicts Mooning CNBC Shows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Love, Predicts Mooning On May 22, 2018 Share\nCNBC’s Fast Money hosts and panel were on the defensive during a recent broadcast, as some viewers accused the network of shilling for bitcoin cash (BCH). And, truth be told, CNBC has been showing the decentralized cryptocurrency an inordinate amount of love lately. A segment by a popular analyst, where he forecasts even bigger things for BCH, only added fuel to some trolls’ fire. Chairman Mow is not amused.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash CNBC Predicts Bitcoin Cash to Moon, and Soon\nWednesday in the US is known colloquially as Hump Day, the point at which the weekend seems closer. It’s also the day more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tuning in to CNBC’s Fast Money program, a self described “post-market show,” hosted by Melissa Lee with contributions from well regarded traders.\nTrader Brian Kelly , founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, was asked to detail just why it is he’s so bullish on bitcoin cash. In introducing his plasma-fronted segment, Ms. Lee read what appears to be a month-long trend, describing bitcoin cash as having “vanquished” the likes of bitcoin core (BTC), down 5%, litecoin down 9%, and ripple down 21% while BCH remained positive at 6% price growth.\nMr. Kelly asked viewers to simply look at what he refers to as catalyst factors, aspects of a digital asset, no matter what the asset, that might have caused it to gain traction in price going forward. In the case of bitcoin cash, Mr. Kelly cheered the latest development among its mining community to pool portions of rewards toward building a fund for future development. He compared it to an app store where devs pile on uses for a smartphone previously unthought of or dreamed of but not implemented. BCH, he insisted, wasn’t the only project to do something like this, and he even managed to sandwich in the word “potentially” when describing price prospects.\nHe also equated more on-chain development with potential use cases, and use cases, then, with, well, usability and appeal to more people in the eventual hope of more adoption. Curiously he described the mining community’s latest move as a kind of cartelization, though benevolent, words and phrases that immediately rile most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He acknowledged it, however, as a potential negative. Let the Market Decide\nUltimately it all comes down to the market, Mr. Kelly noted. He turned to charting, where over the past year or so BCH has followed the broader crypto market with incredible highs back in late 2017, a precipitous drop in 2018, and a recent stabilization if not slight uptick. Drawing a horizontal line across the screen, Mr. Kelly described bitcoin cash as mostly holding support levels for the moment, a good sign. He called his squibbles and markings “a good looking chart” and a “place I want to buy.”\nMs. Lee then peppered Mr. Kelly with questions from viewers. Asked if he was in to bitcoin cash for the long term, he turned diplomatic. He reminded viewers he was a trader, moving in and out of positions quickly. He wants to invest in the coin that eventually becomes the global currency, living up to crypto hype. For now, Mr. Kelly said, bitcoin core (BTC) has a massive network effect advantage, but that could change.\nYet another viewer asked if Mr. Kelly had ever actually used BCH to buy something, and if not then what is its use? Mr. Kelly said he had not used bitcoin cash, but that his interest is only in its speculative value. He did say he’d used bitcoin core to buy things and to send money, and so he understands its ultimate power. The final question in the segment got Mr. Kelly laughing, as a person asked if he was indeed Roger Ver. When Ms. Lee effectively ended the spot, she was keen to emphasize CNBC and her program take exactly no money to promote anything on the show, and how no one has any connection to BCH beyond an investment.\nThe strangest reaction by far came from BTC ambassador Samson Mow. Mr. Mow’s personality in the debate between BTC and BCH is often dismissive, above-it-all. He knows, you don’t, and you simply need to get in line. Humorless. Uncharitable. Superior. That’s all excusable, and there’s always been such an element in tech (the more obnoxious sort tend to come from Silicon Valley), but his reaction to the CNBC segment described above places him in rarified air. With a picture of a shadowy figure behind bars, Chairman Mow typed, “Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment.” That’s right, a lower-level crypto spokesperson is advocating use of jail to punish opinions different from his. Yikes.\nAre you excited about BCH adoption and innovation?

Mavani was an administrator and Savaliya an office boy at Bit Connect, a cryptocurrency investment company based in Surat. Police said 2,256 Bitcoins, 11,000 Litecoins and Rs 14.50 crore in cash — worth about Rs 155 crore in total — were extorted from the firm on February 1, 2018, through the kidnappings of Mavani and Savaliya.\n“Mavani was made to send Rs 14.50 crore, in cash, by angadia (courier) from Surat to Mumbai, where it was received by Shailesh Bhatt, under the fictitious name “P D Jadeja”.\n“Jadeja was the name assumed by one of the persons who had identified themselves as I-T officials when kidnapping Savaliya and as Surat crime branch sleuths when kidnapping Mavani,” a senior CID crime official said.\nDGP CID (crime), Ashish Bhatia , said the agency has lodged a case for kidnapping under sections 364(A), 365, 384, 387,343, 323, 504, 506(2), 170, 193, 201, 120(B) of the IPC and under sections of the Arms Act, as the accused used a firearm to extort the money.\n“When police first came across the Surat kidnappings, Bhatt made Savaliya file an affidavit saying he had not been kidnapped. Bhatt also paid him Rs 60 lakh to keep his mouth shut. We have recovered Rs 20 lakh of that money,” said DIG Deepankar Trivedi.\nTrivedi said section 364(A) provides for punishment including the death penalty. “We have arrested two accused, Dilip Kanani, who phoned Savaliya on the pretext of needing laptop repairs and Shailesh Bhatt’s nephew, Nikunj Bhatt, who transferred the Bitcoins and Litecoins to Bhatt’s e-wallets using Mavani’s laptop. Eight persons, including Bhatt, are absconding,” added Trivedi.\nWhile Nalin Kotadiya — the BJP ex-MLA from Dhari in Amreli — is still wanted in this case, the investigation has come full circle. CID crime now knows how Bhatt got hold of the money that was later allegedly extorted from him by Amreli SP Jagdish Patel, LCB inspector Anant Patel, an advocate called Ketan Patel and Kotadiya.\n“The web of complaints and counter-complaints have blown the lid off a major scam, which police believe was triggered by demonetization in November 2016. Those with illicit cash were offered the chance to invest it in Bit Connect and Nexa Coin, entities reportedly owned by Satish Kumbhani, a native of Amreli who has an office in Surat. Kumbhani, who later fled the country, mainly stayed in Goa,” said Bhatia.\nOfficials said the scam could be worth as much as Rs 1,000 crore, as several Surat businessmen invested illicit cash in Bit Connect and Nexa Coin.\n“This aspect is not limited to Bit Connect and Nexa Coin. We are also probing five or six more virtual currency investment companies, which received crores from Surat-based investors after demonetization,” added Bhatia.\nCID crime officials said Bhatt had invested Rs 2 crore in Kumbhani’s company but was given back only Rs 1.80 crore. “To recover the remainder, he planned the kidnappings of Savaliya and Mavani.

Mavani was an administrator and Savaliya an office boy at Bit Connect, a cryptocurrency investment company based in Surat. Police said 2,256 Bitcoins, 11,000 Litecoins and Rs 14.50 crore in cash — worth about Rs 155 crore in total — were extorted from the firm on February 1, 2018, through the kidnappings of Mavani and Savaliya.\n“Mavani was made to send Rs 14.50 crore, in cash, by angadia (courier) from Surat to Mumbai, where it was received by Shailesh Bhatt, under the fictitious name “P D Jadeja”.\n“Jadeja was the name assumed by one of the persons who had identified themselves as I-T officials when kidnapping Savaliya and as Surat crime branch sleuths when kidnapping Mavani,” a senior CID crime official said.\nDGP CID (crime), Ashish Bhatia , said the agency has lodged a case for kidnapping under sections 364(A), 365, 384, 387,343, 323, 504, 506(2), 170, 193, 201, 120(B) of the IPC and under sections of the Arms Act, as the accused used a firearm to extort the money.\n“When police first came across the Surat kidnappings, Bhatt made Savaliya file an affidavit saying he had not been kidnapped. Bhatt also paid him Rs 60 lakh to keep his mouth shut. We have recovered Rs 20 lakh of that money,” said DIG Deepankar Trivedi.\nTrivedi said section 364(A) provides for punishment including the death penalty. “We have arrested two accused, Dilip Kanani, who phoned Savaliya on the pretext of needing laptop repairs and Shailesh Bhatt’s nephew, Nikunj Bhatt, who transferred the Bitcoins and Litecoins to Bhatt’s e-wallets using Mavani’s laptop. Eight persons, including Bhatt, are absconding,” added Trivedi.\nWhile Nalin Kotadiya — the BJP ex-MLA from Dhari in Amreli — is still wanted in this case, the investigation has come full circle. CID crime now knows how Bhatt got hold of the money that was later allegedly extorted from him by Amreli SP Jagdish Patel, LCB inspector Anant Patel, an advocate called Ketan Patel and Kotadiya.\n“The web of complaints and counter-complaints have blown the lid off a major scam, which police believe was triggered by demonetization in November 2016. Those with illicit cash were offered the chance to invest it in Bit Connect and Nexa Coin, entities reportedly owned by Satish Kumbhani, a native of Amreli who has an office in Surat. Kumbhani, who later fled the country, mainly stayed in Goa,” said Bhatia.\nOfficials said the scam could be worth as much as Rs 1,000 crore, as several Surat businessmen invested illicit cash in Bit Connect and Nexa Coin.\n“This aspect is not limited to Bit Connect and Nexa Coin. We are also probing five or six more virtual currency investment companies, which received crores from Surat-based investors after demonetization,” added Bhatia.\nCID crime officials said Bhatt had invested Rs 2 crore in Kumbhani’s company but was given back only Rs 1.80 crore. “To recover the remainder, he planned the kidnappings of Savaliya and Mavani. He then proceeded to extort Rs 155 crore from Mavani,” Bhatia added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The next leg of the bull run will be sparked by the gush of institutional money waiting to enter the crypto markets. Existing operators realize this and are exploring options to improve their products to suit the institutional players. Coinbase is rumored to be eyeing a federal banking license , which will help it attract larger customers. Realizing the vast potential, venture capital firms are laying the groundwork to increase their investments in cryptocurrencies. The firm behind Snapchat, Lightspeed is the latest to join the others like Comcast Ventures and the Rockefeller family’s venture capital arm Venrock who are looking to build their crypto exposure. We have been pointing to the various news related to institutional investors because this shows the kind of interest they have even after the decline in prices. The retail investors should take this in consideration and might think about investing for the long-term purposes on any decline due to negative news. But also think about keeping money to trade on the peaks and the valleys because the digital currencies are volatile and may offer many opportunities. Let’s see if we find any buy setups today. BTC/USD We shall look at the chart of the oldest cryptocurrency from a slightly long-term perspective today. After last year’s massive rally, Bitcoin is currently consolidating the gains inside a large range of $6,075.04-$12,172.43. Since March of this year, the moving averages have been criss-crossing each other, which also confirms that there is no trend currently in play. Inside the large range, another smaller range is developing, which has resistance at $10,000 and support at $7,941.68. This offers the traders an opportunity to lock in about $2,000 in profits if the range-bound trading persists. Therefore, traders can buy the BTC/USD pair on any decline close to the support of $7,941.68 with a suitable stop loss. The target objective of this trade is a move back to $10,000. This trade suggestion will be invalidated if prices sink below $7941.68 and fail to recover quickly. In such a condition, the positions should be closed because the next support on the downside is at $7,000. ETH/USD Ethereum ended its correction by a sharp ‘V’ shaped bottom formation. We had anticipated the start of a new trend once prices broke out of $745, however, the higher levels attracted selling and prices fell to $637 levels where buying emerged. Though the digital currency has formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern, the bears have failed to achieve a close below the neckline of the pattern. The ETH/USD pair is looking strong because it has been consolidating close to the overhead resistance for the past few days. We believe that a breakout above $745 will start a new uptrend that can carry it to $1,000 levels, with a minor resistance at $838. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears force a breakdown below the 50-day SMA. In such a circumstance, we anticipate a decline to $418 with minor support at $544 and $464 levels. XRP/USD Since February of this year, Ripple has been trading in a broad range. The attempt to break down of the range in end-March did not find sellers at lower levels and prices climbed back into the range. The subsequent rally failed to reach the upper end of the range at $1.22961, which shows lack of buying at higher levels. Currently, prices are again trending down and are trading below both the moving averages. The RSI is also close to 40 levels, which is a negative sign. A fall to the critical support level of $0.56 is probable. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the XRP/USD pair rallies and sustains above $0.75 levels. We shall wait for prices to find support before suggesting any trade on it. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash broke out of the overhead resistance at $1,600 on May 05 but could not sustain the higher levels. It again fell back into the range on May 10 and subsequently declined to the 50-day SMA. In doing so, it has formed a head and shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $650. Usually, in a range, after failing to break out of the overhead resistance, prices decline to the support of the range. Hence, we expect the BCH/USD pair to slide lower once it breaks below the 50-day SMA. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls break out of the 20-day EMA and sustain above it. We shall buy the cryptocurrency again after it breaks out of $1,600. At the present levels, we don’t find any buy setups that can be traded. EOS/USD EOS has held the 50-day SMA support, which is close to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally. On the upside, the bears are defending the 20-day EMA. We will either get a break out above the 20-day EMA and the descending channel or a breakdown below the 50-day SMA, within the next couple of days. If the EOS/USD pair breaks out and sustains above $14.5, traders can enter long positions, which can be held with an initial stop below the recent lows. The target objective is a rally to $18.67 and higher. However, if prices re-enter the channel after breaking out, it will signal weakness and the trades should be closed. In case of a breakdown of the 50-day SMA, the fall can extend to $10 levels with minor support at the May 16 lows of $11.821. Hence, no trade should be attempted inside the channel. LTC/USD Litecoin has continued to make lower peaks since topping out on December 19. This shows that the bulls are unwilling to support prices at higher levels. The only small consolation is that the support of $107 has held in 2018. The LTC/USD pair has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown below the critical support of $107. The bulls are currently defending the $127 levels. A break below $127 can sink the digital currency to $115 levels. Price is quoting below both the moving averages and the RSI is also below 50, which shows that the path of least resistance is to the downside. Our bearish view will be invalidated if price turns around and sustains above the moving averages. ADA/USD There was a request to provide analysis of ADAUSD like the other top currencies, instead of ADABTC, hence, the change today. Cardano is also in a bottom formation. It has major resistance at $0.436956 from where it has returned twice, as shown in the chart. Once this level is crossed, we can expect a new uptrend to begin. Until then, the cryptocurrency will remain range bound. Currently, the ADA/USD pair is trying to find support at the $0.23 levels. If this level holds, traders can buy closer to $0.30 for a target objective of $0.4. The stops can be kept just below the recent lows. If the bears break below the $0.23 levels, a fall to the lower end of the range is likely. XLM/USD Stellar bounced off the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern but is currently facing resistance at the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA. The bearish setup will complete only on a breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below the neckline, which will sink the digital currency to $0.2 levels. We shall change our negative view once the XLM/USD pair sustains above the 20-day EMA. That will indicate strength and a probable move towards the overhead resistance of $0.47766719. The digital currency will start a new uptrend once it breaks out of this resistance. Currently, there are no buy setups, hence, we shall remain on the sidelines. TRX/USD TRX is showing strength while the other altcoins are struggling to move up. It is trading above both its moving averages, which is a bullish sign. It is the ninth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, hence, has secured a place in our analysis. Since mid-January of this year, it has been in a bottom formation, which will complete on a breakout and close above the overhead resistance at $0.09229053, from where prices had turned down in mid-January and in early-May. A breakout has a minimum price target of $0.1607 levels, though we expect higher levels. If the TRX/USD pair fails to break out and sustain above the overhead resistance, it will correct to the 20-day EMA. We suggest waiting for the breakout or a retracement to initiate long positions.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

His forums have allegedly involved about 1,300,000 users from around the world, leading to massive fraud.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture Stealing Even From the Moon\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant established the forums in 2008 and managed them until his arrest at the beginning of the month. The entrance to the forums was free of charge, but users could purchase a VIP status to receive stolen details of “fresh” credit cards, which are more likely to be still working. Additionally he published manuals and guides that provided information and tools on how to commit various computer offenses, remotely hacking computers and taking over remote computers or servers.\nHalmi also allegedly committed crimes of fraud against users of his own forums. The defendant would offer selling cell phones at discounted prices, but once a user transferred him money he would block the user from the site and take his money without providing compensation. He would then publish a message, supposedly in the name of the deceived user, in which he thanked the defendant for providing the cheap mobile phone.\nApparently trying to convince investigators his actions were not motivated by specific malice towards Israelis, many of which were his alleged victims, Halmi is quoted as saying: “We are thieves, from wherever we can take money, we will take it – it does not matter where, from Israel, the US or even the moon, we will reach it and use it.” 1,071 BTC Seized\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant demanded that all payments to him be made through Bitcoin, to make it more difficult to locate him. In addition, Halmi acted consistently to disguise his identity by technological means, made many money transfers between different Bitcoin wallets for the purpose of covering his tracks, used online masking services to distance himself from his various accounts, and recorded parts of his property in the name of his relatives.\nThe Israeli State Prosecutor’s Office attributes to the defendant money laundering of at least 1,071 BTC, estimated at NIS 31,000,000. During the interrogation, in a precedent-setting move, the defendant’s Bitcoin wallet was seized and the amount found in it was transferred to a police wallet. The State Prosecutor’s Office intends to confiscate all the contents of the defendant’s Bitcoin wallets, if and when he is convicted. The case was investigated by investigators of the Israeli national cyber unit at Lahav 433.\nThe offenses with which Halmi is charged are: credit card fraud under aggravated circumstances (multiple offenses), receiving a thing fraudulently under aggravated circumstances, providing means for committing a crime, violating the Computers Law and money laundering.\nWhat should be the punishment for such an alleged crime?

Ya tidak apa-apa juga saya tidak rugi kok nulis postingan ini he he\nIslam adalah agama yang kompabilitasnya tidak terlekang oleh waktu dan zaman, tidak terbatas oleh cakupan wilayah, tidak terbagi menjadi beberapa golongan. Islam mengajarkan banyak hal yang dapat membuat kualitas hidup pemeluknya menjadi lebih baik. Sebagai muslim yang baik, tentunya harus juga mencerminkan perilaku yang benar-benar muslim, yakni orang yang menjalankan dengan benar segala tindakannya berdasarkan Alquran dan Sunnah Nabi Muhammad SAW. Salah satu aspek kehidupan yang diatur oleh Islam adalah ekonomi (muamalah).\nPada saat ini, muncul sebuah fenomena mata uang digital (Crypto-Currency) yang dapat dijadikan sebagai alat pembayaran, walaupun di Indonesia keberadaannya belum diakui sebagai mata uang. Salah satu crypto-currency yang merupakan penggagas serta nilai tukarnya tertinggi saat ini adalah Bitcoin yang pada forum ini juga agan-agan pasti sering bersentuhan dengannya . Proses mendapatkan Bitcoin tersebut bisa didapatkan dengan berbagai cara diantaranya investasi, trading, mining, dsb.\nDiantara berbagai hukum tentang bitcoin memang masih perdebatan diantara berbagai ulama. Namun, pada beberapa bulan silam, MUI mengeluarkan fatwa bahwa Bitcoin hukumnya mubah jika digunakan sebagai alat tukar bagi yang berkenan untuk menggunakannya dan mengakuinya, tetapi hukumnya haram jika dijadikan untuk investasi . Sementara itu, menurut Syekh Muhammad Al-Unbaby dan Habib Abdullah bin Abu bakar, uang digital serupa dengan fulus yang dicetak sehingga hukum bermuamalah dengannya adalah sah secara total. Oleh karena itu, mata uang digital wajib dikenakan zakat.\nBerdasarkan sumber di atas, kita meyakini bahwasannya Bitcoin dapat kita gunakan untuk jual beli. Kalau bisa sih, emang iya, jangan dijadikan sebagai investasi. #cmiiw. Dengan demikian, mari kita sama-sama untuk saling mengingatkan bahwasannya Bitcoin ini perlu dikeluarkan zakat. Agar harta dalam bentuk Bitcoin (crypto-currency) yang kita miliki dibersihkan. Mengenai perhitungan zakatnya saya belum tahu persis, belum sempet baca sumber yang kuat. Maklum saya masih awam yang hanya bisa saling sharing satu sama lain. Mudah-mudahan jika nanti sempat, saya akan membuat tulisan lagi mengenai perhitunngan zakatnya.\nKalau ada yang salah mohon koreksi gan, kita sama-sama belajar.\nRamadhannya semoga diberkahi, puasanya lancar.\nSekian dan terimakasih. Semoga bermanfaat.\nWassalamualaikum Wr Wb.\nsumber:\nhttp://www.nu.or.id/post/read/86225/hukum-transaksi-dengan-bitcoin\nhttp://khazanah.republika.co.id/berita/dunia-islam/islam-nusantara/18/01/14/p2iwco396-ini-pandangan-komisi-dakwah-mui-terkait-bitcoin\nwaalaikumsalam Wr Wb..\niya gan di bulan suci ini kita sebagai umat islam di anjurkan untuk berzakat karna itu sudah kewajiban umat islam\ndengan adanya informasi seperti i ni saya jadi ingat karna saya belm berzakat gan\ntidak ada salahnya gan kita sisikan rezeki kita utk berzakat apa lgi kita udh dapat banyak penghasilan dari sini gan\nsiap gan saya akan menunggu perhitungan zakat kalo di bitcoin\nterimakasi gan", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://khazanah.republika.co.id/berita/dunia-islam/islam-nusantara/18/01/14/p2iwco396-ini-pandangan-komisi-dakwah-mui-terkait-bitcoin", "http://www.nu.or.id/post/read/86225/hukum-transaksi-dengan-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T01:12:58.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a7476607591f348a533b5c20422704c6ee538cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS7QckQncnd5tFXxyOPsVBP61mSz7t1kScQFQwX4QffndQBLFYeRxfnKzZEJTj5V6IsLcOWANFzv7o4rv9g6GaSrxK7VVxILcHITmoBJ9cOGSo9GcukklhS6E67ZSngB2s-", "site_full": "theenterpriseleader.com", "site": "theenterpriseleader.com", "site_section": "https://theenterpriseleader.com/feed/atom", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Enterprise Leader", "title": "Bitcoin Planet Trading 0.2% Higher This Week (BTPL)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Planet Trading 0.2% Higher This Week (BTPL)", "published": "2018-05-22T01:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1748.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a7476607591f348a533b5c20422704c6ee538cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS7QckQncnd5tFXxyOPsVBP61mSz7t1kScQFQwX4QffndQBLFYeRxfnKzZEJTj5V6IsLcOWANFzv7o4rv9g6GaSrxK7VVxILcHITmoBJ9cOGSo9GcukklhS6E67ZSngB2s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joseph McCarthy", "published": "2018-05-22T01:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Planet Trading 0.2% Higher This Week (BTPL)", "text": "Posted by Joseph McCarthy on May 21st, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin Planet (CURRENCY:BTPL) traded 22.2% higher against the dollar during the 1 day period ending at 18:00 PM Eastern on May 21st.

Experts are unsure", "text": "How much energy does crypto mining really use? One recently released study conducted by Alex de Vries says that Bitcoin mining consumes 24 THw of energy or as much as Ireland. To make matters worse, the study estimates that Bitcoin’s energy use is doubling every six months. By the end of 2018, Bitcoin could use as much as 67 THw or the annual energy consumption of the Czech Republic.\nWhile those numbers might seem high, things may not be as bad as they sound. For starters, one of the main issues with Bitcoin mining is that it was originally powered in large part by coal plants in China. In recent years, however, China has worked to rein in its pollution problem, and many Bitcoin mining operations have moved to countries which make use of cleaner energy.\nAnother issue is the matter of distribution. Comparing Bitcoin’s energy usage to countries such as Ireland or the Czech Republic is useful to help visualize the scope of their operations, but that doesn’t tell the full story. Bitcoin mining can happen from anywhere in the world so no one country’s infrastructure is bearing the brunt of the cost.\nBeyond that, there are numerous experts who dispute this study’s findings. Jonathan Koomey, a professor at Stanford who, in the 1990s, disproved similar fears about the internet, says there simply isn’t enough data available to draw conclusions.\n“For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing,” Koomey told NBC News. “My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.”\nOne of the issues Koomey points out is that it is difficult to determine how the value of the energy used in Bitcoin mining and the price paid for that energy. He is unsure of where de Vries is getting the two numbers he uses for those values.\n“The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,” said Koomey. “There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.”\nThe other issue is the accessibility of Bitcoin data. Many Bitcoin miners are concerned about their privacy which can make it difficult to accurately determine how much energy is used.\nThe mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies does consume a fair amount of energy, but it’s unclear as to exactly how much.\nEditors’ Recommendations\nBitcoin’s profitability called into question as energy consumption rises\nWind and solar could supply 80 percent of U.S. energy needs\nOwner survey suggests Tesla’s batteries see only limited degradation\nTesla uses Powerwalls and solar panels to bring AC to Hawaii schools\nGoogle makes good on promise to offset 100 percent of its electricity use\nHow much energy does Bitcoin mining require?

His forums have allegedly involved about 1,300,000 users from around the world, leading to massive fraud.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture Stealing Even From the Moon\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant established the forums in 2008 and managed them until his arrest at the beginning of the month. The entrance to the forums was free of charge, but users could purchase a VIP status to receive stolen details of “fresh” credit cards, which are more likely to be still working. Additionally he published manuals and guides that provided information and tools on how to commit various computer offenses, remotely hacking computers and taking over remote computers or servers.\nHalmi also allegedly committed crimes of fraud against users of his own forums. The defendant would offer selling cell phones at discounted prices, but once a user transferred him money he would block the user from the site and take his money without providing compensation. He would then publish a message, supposedly in the name of the deceived user, in which he thanked the defendant for providing the cheap mobile phone.\nApparently trying to convince investigators his actions were not motivated by specific malice towards Israelis, many of which were his alleged victims, Halmi is quoted as saying: “We are thieves, from wherever we can take money, we will take it – it does not matter where, from Israel, the US or even the moon, we will reach it and use it.” 1,071 BTC Seized\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant demanded that all payments to him be made through Bitcoin, to make it more difficult to locate him. In addition, Halmi acted consistently to disguise his identity by technological means, made many money transfers between different Bitcoin wallets for the purpose of covering his tracks, used online masking services to distance himself from his various accounts, and recorded parts of his property in the name of his relatives.\nThe Israeli State Prosecutor’s Office attributes to the defendant money laundering of at least 1,071 BTC, estimated at NIS 31,000,000. During the interrogation, in a precedent-setting move, the defendant’s Bitcoin wallet was seized and the amount found in it was transferred to a police wallet. The State Prosecutor’s Office intends to confiscate all the contents of the defendant’s Bitcoin wallets, if and when he is convicted.
