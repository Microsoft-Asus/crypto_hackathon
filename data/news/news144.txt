Brian Brassaw No Comments Shares\nIn 2009, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper about bitcoin. Shortly thereafter, the first bitcoin transaction took place. At the time, there was no estimated dollar value of a bitcoin. Fast-forward to December 2017, and bitcoin was trading at over $18,000 per coin.\nWhile the bitcoin price has dropped substantially since that all-time high, the rapid ascent in value brought bitcoin into headlines around the world. In addition to bitcoin, thousands of other cryptocurrencies fit into a variety of niches, from the meme-based dogecoin to the anonymous verge.\nAll of these crytocurrencies have one major requirement in common: powerful computers to mine for new coins. Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption\nTo begin to understand why bitcoin consumes so much energy, you need to know a few very basic concepts about how it works. Each time a bitcoin transaction takes place, all the computers on the network talk to each other to confirm that the transaction is valid. Once the transaction is confirmed as valid, it can proceed.\nSome of the computers on the network are miners. They are responsible for grouping these transactions into blocks and adding them to the ledger . They do this by solving a complex mathematical problem. Once they’ve solved it, they are rewarded with mined bitcoin.\nThese math problems require computers with substantial processing power, which require a huge amount of energy to run. The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index was created to track just how much energy bitcoin mining requires. According to their numbers, one bitcoin transaction consumes enough energy to power 31.75 U.S. households for a day (at the time of publication).\nCurrently, bitcoin’s estimated annual electricity consumption is 61.56 terawatt hours. That’s enough energy to power approximately 5.7 million U.S. households. That’s almost enough energy to power the entire country of Switzerland for a year. Bitcoin’s estimated annual carbon footprint is 30,162 kilotons.\nUnfortunately, a high percentage of bitcoin mining operations are located in China and other locations where cheap electricity is produced by coal-burning power plants — thus worsening bitcoin’s overall carbon footprint. And while bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by far, thousands of other types of cryptocurrencies also need powerful computers, creating their own carbon footprints.\nMost crypto experts agree that as cryptocurrency grows in popularity and usage, the energy needed for mining will only increase. As the math problems required to complete a transaction become more complex, miners will need faster computers with more processing power and a corresponding increase in energy consumption. Can Bitcoin’s Carbon Footprint Shrink?\nDespite some technical proposals to lower the processing power needed to keep the decentralized network running, the mathematical problems being solved must remain complex and resource-intensive to stay secure. However, some individual mining operations are trying to reduce their carbon footprint, or at least use renewable energy to power their computers.\nOne company, Qarnot , builds crypto-mining equipment that uses the heat generated by the computers to heat apartments and offices. Qarnot won the CES Eureka Park Climate Change Innovator Award in January 2018. Unfortunately, this technology is beneficial only in locations where it’s cold for a significant portion of the year. In hot climates, the heat generated would only necessitate additional energy to cool the building.\nWhile bitcoin’s carbon footprint can be reduced, the big questions are how and by how much? In the short term, we can expect bitcoin’s carbon footprint to increase as more people join the bitcoin mining community. With time, however, we’ll likely see more advancements made to reduce the amount of power necessary to run a bitcoin mining operation.

The new members from Bitcoin.com are its CEO, Roger Keith Ver who is known by many as Bitcoin Jesus, and the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the site, Mate Tokay.\nIn the new startup known as Moneytoken , Bitcoin Cash will be used as collateral for users borrowing from the platform. The main idea behind the platform is to offer crypto-backed loans, a stable coin known as MTC and a decentralized exchange service. The project is still in its ICO phase with the buying of tokens available through Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC).\nThe amazing thing about the project is that you can still apply for a loan on the platform as the token sale is ongoing.\nIn the press release announcing the new partnership, the co-founder of Moneytoken, Jerome MacGillivray, had this to say:\n“The Bitcoin Cash community is a unique and powerful force in cryptocurrency; adding our support to Bitcoin Cash and allowing our potential token buyers and future lenders and borrowers to operate in BCH, only adds to our portfolio and strengthens the value of MoneyToken as a product for all our users”\nRoger Ver, also known as ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ for being an early investor in the coin, has been predicting that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will flippen, or dethrone, both Ethereum and Bitcoin by the year 2020. This partnership shows his commitment to this prediction . He had this to say about the announcement through the press release:\n“We are happy to be a part of this project since we can clearly see the strong team, disruptive and self-sustaining business model and, what is more important, the real value it can bring to the crypto community”\nCurrent market analysis of BCH indicates that it is in the lower levels of $1,181 at the moment of writing this. The coin that is being predicted to overtaking BTC and ETH has had better times in the markets as was seen on the day BCH was added on Coinbase. The coin managed to reach levels of $4,000. This shows that BCH does have the potential of orchestrating the said flippening.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 percent per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent in a month, the police said. A search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended. The website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response. “Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement. “Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.” Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global. “This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said. The investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy. On Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations. - REUTERS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T15:05:50.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "425eb5635880a79e77a133875eedf39a1d83509b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRpAOnBf60O5BROrfuD9ZZRn4SJSkNucWJ5Nstu0DQMSHm6._yAXTojXZsd8FVsHHWoUzAxaIPqITXAkLIBZtGV4aEJwpR_E0fC.8E5cF6MEPwyypWaAloVSXkLe9uM2FtzA4GjDRM6NQ--", "site_full": "www.360news.co.za", "site": "360news.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.360news.co.za/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "360News", "title": "South African authorities investigates $80m bitcoin scam", "title_full": "South African authorities investigates $80m bitcoin scam", "published": "2018-05-25T13:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "425eb5635880a79e77a133875eedf39a1d83509b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRpAOnBf60O5BROrfuD9ZZRn4SJSkNucWJ5Nstu0DQMSHm6._yAXTojXZsd8FVsHHWoUzAxaIPqITXAkLIBZtGV4aEJwpR_E0fC.8E5cF6MEPwyypWaAloVSXkLe9uM2FtzA4GjDRM6NQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T13:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "South African authorities investigates $80m bitcoin scam", "text": "South African authorities investigates $80m bitcoin scam Via IOL Business | 25 May 2018 - 12:51:00 South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of R1bn.

A proactive step has been taken by regulators for shaping the stratospheric increase of Bitcoin. According to President Xi Jinping, there’s been booms and busts in the economy for a decade. As a result, the role of China in the cryptocurrency’s world is going down. Is it allowed to trade Bitcoin in China?\nBitcoin can be traded only in over-the-counter markets. According to some analysts, it is a slower process that increases the credit risk. Is China anti-cryptocurrency?\nNot really. A bank named “The People’s Bank of China” has run trials of its own prototype cryptocurrency, as it is a prime step to being the very first central bank, that is going to issue digital money. What is China doing exactly?\nWell, China banned initial coin offerings (ICOs), that are equal to initial public offerings for new virtual currencies. Later, it stopped local exchanges from trading cryptocurrencies and also delineated proposals to dampen bitcoin mining. Then it moved to Chinese companies that were listed in abroad skirting to stop its domestic ban on ICOs. Now it’s intended by the officials to block the domestic access to mobile apps and other online platforms that offer such services for cryptocurrencies.\nCompanies that promote themselves as blockchains, to boost their shares are also being targeted by domestic stock exchanges. It’s a part of an effort by agencies like China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, central bank and the cyberspace administration.\nWhat is the reason behind the crackdown in China?\nCleaning risks from financial markets have been government’s statement for almost two years, but there’s been no clear explanation yet. The thriving shadow banking sector is also among the main concerns of the government, although digital currencies also provide a way to move money out of China.\nWhere else are officials clamping down?\nSouth Korean is known as the home of most of the frantic cryptocurrency trading. Some banks are being inspected because of the allegation of money laundering and the country is considering to close such cryptocurrency exchanges. Also, in the past year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started to work fast on digital token sales. What’s the effect of China’s actions?\nBecause of inexpensive power and cheap labour, miners gathered to China, but now they may have to look somewhere else. Bitmain is running China’s two major Bitcoin-mining collectives and is setting up district HQs in Singapore. The #3 mining pool, also known as “BTC. Top” is also opening a facility in Canada. Wallet services and bitcoin exchanges in the country are also leaving. Also, they’re setting up over-the-counter shops in Hong Kong and in other areas of Singapore/South Korea. What about cryptocurrency prices?\nThe prices appeared to shrug off the news of increased regulations in China. However, according to analysts, the growing tide of regulation has a hefty impact on digital currencies and it’s also helping in explaining the hefty losses since the starting of 2018.\nStory credit: fortune.com Did you find apk for android?

Find Free WordPress Themes and plugins.\nOn 13 th March, an annual Joint Economic Report was published by the US Congress in which the Congress dedicated a whole section to the Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, for the very first time. Joint Economic Report\nThe Joint Economic Report (2018) contains a whole chapter that provides the insight of the effect of Blockchain and cryptocurrency on today’s US economy and includes scrutiny and recommendations for the rest of the year. According to the report, 2017 was the year of cryptocurrencies, and highlighted the extensive concern over Bitcoin.\nThe combined value of all Bitcoins in distribution equalled to approximately $15.5 billion, by the starting of 2017; however, it boosted almost 14-fold to over $216 billion by the end of the year. Cryptocurrency market cap was certainly influenced by high prices and such cryptocurrencies like Ripple , Ethereum, and Litecoin also experienced the same gains.\nBut at the same time, the report also stated that leading economists, like Chair Janet Yellen (former Federal Reserve), still don’t think that cryptocurrencies meet the standard definition of money, and for him, Bitcoin is a highly-speculative-asset.\nA stirring surge has been shown in the price of crypto and Blockchain assets, which leaves few crucial economic indexes behind such as; Dow Jones Industrial Average S&P 500\nThe report says;\n“…If digital currencies become less volatile in the future, valuing items in those denominations could become easier and individuals might begin using them more frequently as a medium of exchange” Recommendations\nThere are few recommendations in the document, showing certain concern, as all of the authors advise government agencies are about to consider and analyze new customs for the technology. They specifically distinguish Blockchain’s potential to enhance agency competence and guarantee security against cyber-attacks.\nThe report also says;\n“Policymakers, regulators, and entrepreneurs should continue to work together to ensure developers can deploy these new Blockchain technologies quickly and in a manner that protects Americans from fraud, theft, and abuse while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations”\nThe analysis also highlighted that Blockchain has demonstrated largely resistant to hacking and has a lot of potential applications. Even though Blockchain and cryptocurrencies still stir up clash, the analysis that was shown in the report proves that administrative associations cannot avoid the innovative technology of Blockchain.\nThe report also noted that the technology can be used in other fields like; Healthcare Securing critical financial Energy infrastructure.\nThe Subcommittee on Securities, Investment and Capital Markets assembled for a hearing that was dedicated to ICO (Initial Coin Offerings), Blockchain development and cryptocurrencies in the US, making it quite simple understand that more regulatory clarification would be necessary from the US government.

The future of bitcoin\nThe world today has reached at fairly modern-day monetary practice by now. Making its way through the barter system, and from coins to paper. So, where are at today? What is the next step? The answer is – Bitcoin.\nChallenging and confronting all the monetary compulsions of the world, Bitcoin came into flow around 2009. Introduced by a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto this peer-to-peer system started making the news by 2013. Its distinctive architecture makes it ‘mining’ more resource intensive gradually during the time. The main unique feature linked to this cryptocurrency is that the total production of bitcoin will be limited to 21 million. This number can not be exceeded at any time. The value of Bitcoin has been behaving volatile since ever, but the extreme volatility has been seen since 2015-2016. After a China-led spree, there was again a sudden up thrust in the value of the currency, making headlines of another outbreak, reaching its highest value. But this vertigo doesn’t seem to stay steady at any margin. Backbone of Bitcoin\nBlockchain technology- the most hyped one, is the backbone of the system. It is a foundational technology which has the legitimate potential to change the world. And without a doubt, it can create new foundations for our systems in social and economic circles. This may seem like the ‘tulip fever’ in the 17 th century to a lot of onlookers, but the bubble doesn’t seem to burst anytime soon.\nBitcoins are only generated by the process called ‘mining’. These transactions are compiled into blocks and participants are given mathematical puzzles to solve. The one who solves the problem first, is awarded with Bitcoins in exchange for services. Sounds easy? Not really!\nThese bitcoins are stored in a digital wallet that is somewhat our bank accounts. These wallets can be installed on our computers or cell phones. All the transactions performed are stored in the blockchain. It works as a public ledger. The transactions must be verified by the network in order to work. This network is architected substantially in an algorithm that generates the high level of security, so no other user can spend your funds.\nThe Blockchain is like digitized, secure ledger which stores every information and runs this disintegrated system. Bitcoin relies on Blockchain to perform and conduct every transaction. What does the future hold for bitcoin?\nSo, what’s next it has in store for us? As unpredictable as these nine years, the future of these Bitcoins will remain the in same vertigo. It has been tied to nothing but algorithms and falls under no influence.\nBitcoin has so many advantages to being just wiped off or not to be accounted for by any time in near future. It has already made itself interlinked with some big economies and is here to stay with the same fluctuating nature.\nThese cryptocurrencies may have possibly bypassed the rules of traditional monetary and financial systems but there still are many limitations in the system.\nIn order to reduce these, there has been made an e-shop where you can spend your digital currency. The portal allows consumers to buy products using bitcoins.\nThe financial system legacy has served us long without giving much room to more. A mere chance given to the cryptocurrency revolution without government interfering will harm no one. Except there will be less power resting with the government that they are used to of practicing.\nCountries that have weak currencies oppose greatly of this system and are planning to ban the digital money completely. But it’s not stopping the consumers adopting and accepting this new change and development. It definitely has the ability to change the financial pipping of the world. But whatever the argument may sit or face, despite the fluctuating price of this system nothing is certain for sure. Did you find apk for android? You can find new Free Android Games and apps.

According to this agenda the future of crypto in china has come under discussion again. China had to take this step to protect the national currency of China which is no doubt Yuan. Furthermore, according to a statement dated March 29 on the PBoC website, China will continue to apply strict measures against all kinds of virtual currencies to protect Yuan. Background of Cryptocurrencies in China\nWe would have to go a couple of years back to properly understand the situation cryptocurrencies are facing right now in China. According to the initial coin offering news few years back, Bitcoin had gained great popularity among the Chinese Citizens, prices were also going up steadily.\nConcerned with the progress of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,in December 2013 the People’s Bank of China along with some other ministries of China, published an official notice regarding Bitcoin. Originally this notice was meant to reduce or control the financial risk of Bitcoin. Several points were highlighted in that notice pertaining to the risks involved in the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies. Salient Features of Notice Against Cryptocurrencies\nAccording to the above mentioned notice the People’s Bank of China strictly ordered that: All companies offering Crypto-related services especially Bitcoins, must be registered with the relative government ministries. Organizations dealing specially in Bitcoin-related services should implement necessary measures to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. Any kind of criminal activity such as fraud, money laundering and gambling etc should be reported instantly to the authorities. Companies behind the deals of Bitcoin and all such services should educate the public about Bitcoin and the technology behind it. This measure will save the majority of laymen from frauds, and fake companies would not be able to mislead the public with misinformation. Bitcoin can only be bought or sold in its original form and not to be exchanged with traditional currency at any cost. Rather than money, cryptocurrency can be best defined as something that serves as a medium of exchange or a store of value. China’s Latest Approach Against Cryptocurrency\nThe deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China Fan Yifei outlined objectives in protecting the yuan at the 2018 national video conference. It was a serious effort dedicated to the major challenges faced by the Chinese monetary system in terms of Yuan.\nIn his statement Fan supported the development of a government based digital currency in order to protect the yuan against unofficial virtual currencies. However, as was done in the past, no specific policies against crypto currencies were offered this time.\nDid you find apk for android? You can find new Free Android Games and apps.

Albstadt, Germany: TE-FOOD partnered with HALAL TRAIL™, a UK based company, to track livestock and fresh food from farm to table, through the halal food chain.\nFrom the 7.6 billion people in the world, almost 2 billion are Muslims. The halal method in the food industry refers to the permissible or lawful way of preparing food and drinks according to Islamic law.\nAccording to industry estimates, the global halal food market will reach USD 2.55 trillion by 2024.\nDue to religious reasons, this enormous market of Muslims consciously seeks trusted, halal certified sources when they buy food. Their motivation to check the source of the food is very strong.\nThe Solution\nHALAL TRAIL will be the first solution to expand to all global halal food markets, and provide food traceability and quality verification services for the sector.\nThe solution, with processes specifically developed for HALAL TRAIL will provide a top-to-bottom solution for the supply chain companies from physical identification materials, B2B mobile app, and a mobile app for consumers to check the history of the food they intend to buy. To provide verification on data credibility, all traceability data will be stored on blockchain.\nFood traceability combined with blockchain technology is the solution which can give Muslims peace of mind that their food was prepared according to Islamic law.\nTwo Pilots in June\nHALAL TRAIL will utilize TE-FOOD’s technology on two pilot projects in June 2018 track chickens and lambs in Lancaster, Tunbridge Wells & Manchester, U.K. as a reference to be implemented globally.\nLeading Food Companies Trust TE-FOOD\nThis collaboration is the next step in the deliberate global expansion of TE-FOOD. With live operation since 2016 in Vietnam, and over 6000 business customers (including food companies like Auchan , AEON , LOTTE Mart , CP Group, and Big C ), TE-FOOD is a stable and results-driven player of the blockchain based supply chain solution providers.\nVisit the Website: https://www.te-food.com/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TE_FOOD/status/961187412079792128", "https://twitter.com/TE_FOOD/status/955745031704535040", "https://www.te-food.com/", "https://twitter.com/TE_FOOD/status/964403001409470464", "https://twitter.com/TE_FOOD/status/957898375067787264"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "albstadt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "halal trail bringing halal food companies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "blockchain bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T15:51:54.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6f5795192858c72aa9a771e009a59d70d1d3720", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQJ0SB7VIbnBVbcgDkG7YVZPqRNB0kwKzrafBxiOpFnLYXTYIno9f6pl7o_8Rssf30Ht6UAfllPZA--", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam", "title_full": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam", "published": "2018-05-25T13:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6f5795192858c72aa9a771e009a59d70d1d3720", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQJ0SB7VIbnBVbcgDkG7YVZPqRNB0kwKzrafBxiOpFnLYXTYIno9f6pl7o_8Rssf30Ht6UAfllPZA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-25T13:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam", "text": "Home / Bitcoin News Wire / South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam Posted by: Bitcoin News Editor in Bitcoin News Wire 1 min ago\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) – South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of 1 billion rand ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialized, police said on Friday.

The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. The third largest market share of cryptocurrency, XRP, is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012.\nHere are all three cryptocurrency prices over time along with their trading volume. Data for all three is sourced from Coinbase.com and by request, we have shortened the time frame for a more recent picture.\nWe have also created an index in order to chart these together given their very different pricing history. Notice that Ether tops the chart – the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\nCheck back next week for another update.\nThis article is brought to you courtesy of Advisor Perspectives .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ethereum.org/ether", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "https://ripple.com/xrp/", "https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2018/05/23/the-three-largest-cryptocurrencies"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jill mislinski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikipedia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T15:31:55.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2fa3ad07733dd55de33d6cbbcce7f0d8a31dcb7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va71exIVmVZGlKzM.RmDazt7UDRRPZ7e8RrhheyJX0JFpBmX_amci6xLUylOCS9nCIhpQc8kOV11TAnKhbljrQLYnSBFVmgUDbqg--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "ECDSA Input When Transferring Bitcoin From Owner A to Owner B", "title_full": "ECDSA Input When Transferring Bitcoin From Owner A to Owner B", "published": "2018-05-25T13:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2fa3ad07733dd55de33d6cbbcce7f0d8a31dcb7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va71exIVmVZGlKzM.RmDazt7UDRRPZ7e8RrhheyJX0JFpBmX_amci6xLUylOCS9nCIhpQc8kOV11TAnKhbljrQLYnSBFVmgUDbqg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jazimov", "published": "2018-05-25T13:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "ECDSA Input When Transferring Bitcoin From Owner A to Owner B", "text": "Mike D 123 5 Although I marked your answer, I do not understand how the recipient's public key gets stored in the new transaction record if it is hashed. If hashed, how can it later be used to verify a sig when that user spends BTC? – Jazimov 15 hours ago 1 @Mike D scriptpubkey contains the hash160 of the public key. that's just a few steps removed from the address. the scriptsig contains the public key. – Abdussamad 15 hours ago I am approaching this from a different angle. Scripts don't mean anything to me (sorry). All I want to know is whether the recipient's public key ultimately is stored in the transaction record (or can somehow be derived). If that answer is yes, then I can take it from there. I need to know that the recipient's public key is available to validating nodes so that sigs for transactions can be validated using that public key... Isn't that the way it ultimately works in Bitcoin? – Jazimov 15 hours ago 1 @Jazimov the public key is available to the nodes when someone tries to redeem the input because he is sending it as a part of his scriptSig. Until then all that others can see is the hash of the public key. – Mike D 15 hours ago up vote 1 down vote\nbased on the anser/comments before, I'd like to help a bit deeper: Looking at a standard P2PKH transaction, there is a locking and unlocking mechanism. The locking mechanism is in the pubkey script (in the output section) of the previous transaction (some refer to it also as the spending condition). The unlocking is in the sigscript part of the transaction (you would find \"your\" sig and pubkey here). In the pubkey script the author of a previous tx defines the target (to whom the tx shall go), which is represented as the pubkey hash. When then the receiver of the tx wants to spend the tx, (s)he needs to fulfill the condition (by showing the non-hashed pubkey) and also signs the tx with his/her private key.\nThe link between the two is this:\nThe P2PKH script in the previous transaction's pubkey script section says s.th. like: \"if your pubkey hashes to the same value as I have presented here, you have met the condition to process the tx further\"\nNow as this hashing is a one way function, only people who have the \"original\" public key in hex format can create the requested hash (if you try to brute force or reverse engineer, that's as per today practically impossible). And where do you present your public key? In the sigscript section! You provide signature and public key. All in all this ends up in a stack, where in the first step the hash is compared, and if equal, also the signature is checked. Only when both conditions are met, the transaction is processed further.\nMore to it on script validation in the developers pages of bitcoin , and in Andreas' book \"Mastering Bitcoin\" in section 6 \"Transactions\". Highly recommended. It can be found online, also here .\nHope this helps to better understand.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecdsa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:45:38.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb2d42d76a3cc8ecda233cc5ee7e46f19ebdf98a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdlOUxsy_TNN2.e9N.l8oaAa8P8pnjrij0C2PgE9d3E78kOyyuMm1yoik.kKLBEdKtPeZp3u74QQS3g8q5XB9c60d_2WQ6nHCuLmJmJyPH3O704WIayCsIZdXjHx7go5W6fykr0cElc9ZbILJMS5oA", "site_full": "bitcoingamblingreviews.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoingamblingreviews.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "South Africa Investigates $80 Million Bitcoin Scam – Bitcoin News – Bitcoin Gambling Reviews", "title": "South Africa Investigates $80 Million Bitcoin Scam – Bitcoin News", "title_full": "South Africa Investigates $80 Million Bitcoin Scam – Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-25T13:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb2d42d76a3cc8ecda233cc5ee7e46f19ebdf98a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdlOUxsy_TNN2.e9N.l8oaAa8P8pnjrij0C2PgE9d3E78kOyyuMm1yoik.kKLBEdKtPeZp3u74QQS3g8q5XB9c60d_2WQ6nHCuLmJmJyPH3O704WIayCsIZdXjHx7go5W6fykr0cElc9ZbILJMS5oA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoingamblingreviews", "published": "2018-05-25T13:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa Investigates $80 Million Bitcoin Scam – Bitcoin News", "text": "\nSouth Africa Investigates $80 Million Bitcoin Scam\nSouth African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of 1 billion rand ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialized, police said on Friday.\nMore bitcoin news:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/25/technology/25reuters-safrica-crime-bitcoin.html?partner=IFTTT\nBitcoin Gambling Sites ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T13:20:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "702e609939ee5ba5d2879c1b6492e548407cb5a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS99qQBXA1ahRg9Xmq7aDfvvtnyjLaTTdqkm51vBOHYpY8O6Fa.nl7hq99N2CSxUwUDFEo12.0o3RbUy4jFlh1ppr6x5DI6NshYseRT_jyMdhO9c6hpubMG", "site_full": "www.moneyweb.co.za", "site": "moneyweb.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.moneyweb.co.za/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Moneyweb - Business, Financial and Investment news and tools", "title": "South Africa investigates R1bn bitcoin Ponzi scam", "title_full": "South Africa investigates R1bn bitcoin Ponzi scam - Moneyweb", "published": "2018-05-25T13:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.moneyweb.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/317253969_1-9-555x369.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17146, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "702e609939ee5ba5d2879c1b6492e548407cb5a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS99qQBXA1ahRg9Xmq7aDfvvtnyjLaTTdqkm51vBOHYpY8O6Fa.nl7hq99N2CSxUwUDFEo12.0o3RbUy4jFlh1ppr6x5DI6NshYseRT_jyMdhO9c6hpubMG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mfuneko Toyana, Reuters", "published": "2018-05-25T13:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa investigates R1bn bitcoin Ponzi scam", "text": "South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of R1 billion ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialised, police said on Friday.\nThe fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2% per day, 14% a week and 50% in a month, the police said.\nA search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended.\nThe website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120 000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies

A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.\n(Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by Joe Brock/Keith Weir)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T13:10:11.068+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e0cfd57cd8ff4b188353f41889d9dee8896d888", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS.iIB7LblVMCkLdT1dibVzo_aitLwSluwACwcl5OkuZXjHomhJ8wEYw9X6ZHe1HecmoZkxoM7SWP7gcnPPOGngD", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Bitcoin Gold suffers double spend attacks, $17.5 million lost", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gold suffers double spend attacks, $17.5 million lost", "published": "2018-05-25T13:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e0cfd57cd8ff4b188353f41889d9dee8896d888", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS.iIB7LblVMCkLdT1dibVzo_aitLwSluwACwcl5OkuZXjHomhJ8wEYw9X6ZHe1HecmoZkxoM7SWP7gcnPPOGngD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-25T13:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gold suffers double spend attacks, $17.5 million lost", "text": "File Photo Bitcoin Gold (BTG) appears to be the target of a 51 percent attack, leading to the theft of approximately $17.5 million from cryptocurrency exchanges.

How to Use a Bitcoin Prepaid Card?\nThere are a few bitcoin prepaid cards in the market but finding the best one can be very difficult at first.

Most card providers will allow you to spend your bitcoins immediately while others make users wait at least 4 days.\nBitcoin prepaid cards have different levels of anonymity . It depends on how much Bitcoin you’re planning to spend and how often you use it. For example, if you want to spend more than $2500 on the card, you have to register with legal identification (passport, utility bill, or identity card). With this level of verification, you’re exposed to other features such as ATM withdrawals and how much you can place on the card. Monthly Fees\nEvery card has fees that occur each month. This can range from $1 or higher. But, you can be charged another fee if you’re not active – if you like a taxes for not generating and spending money for your card provider.\nRemember, these prepaid cards can hide some details in their terms and conditions, so make sure you research thoroughly! ATM Fees\nJust like every prepaid card, there are some processing fees applied . These fees will vary depending on how the currency is used and its current value. If the card is used for domestic purposes, then it will have a $2.5 fee. For international purchases, the fees are about $3.5.\nSome cards will have an ATM limit which is determined based on the level of anonymity. Basically, the more anonymity, the less you can use the card at an ATM. Conclusion\nIf you’re going to try to use Bitcoin for real-life purchases , then a Bitcoin Prepaid Card is your best option. Not only does it help you quickly convert your crypto into fiat money, but it’s also a great tool in purchasing goods and services.

It is being noticed that McAfee’s short-term predictions about cryptocurrencies have caught a lot of attention on Twitter and other social media platforms. These predictions have certainly influenced a lot of virtual currency investors and traders over a period of time.\nFollowing is a snippet of his recent cryptocurrency prediction. John McAfee’s cryptocurrency prediction\nAccording to his recent tweet, after this bearish Bitcoin period, with BTC prices dropping below $7500, the prices are expected to rise up to $15,000 in July, after which, it will dip again. Golem, which is currently priced at $0.46 is expected to rise up to $5, gaining more than 4 times its value by the end of the next two months.\nDocademic, ranked #297 is currently priced at $0.144. McAfee believes that the prices will rise up to $0.73 by mid-July. Another altcoin, Bezop, currently ranked at #660 is, at the time of writing, priced at $0.106. He expects the price of Bezop to hit $0.52 by mid-July.\nRandy Dubay, a Twitterati commented:\n“I try to make my investments long term, but appreciate the short term predictions since if we hit these milestones it reassures me (and I assume others) that we are on the right track. After withstanding five months of chop it can be difficult to see light at end of the tunnel.”\nShawnster, a Cryptocurrency enthusiast says:\n“Mr. McAfee you just made my day. Real world deals are always done behind closed doors and media manipulate the “agenda.”@bitcoinprivate is a gem and I’m glad you have their vote of confidence. Bitcoin Private it’s time to shine!”\nMcAfee’s recent posts regarding his interest in Bitcoin Private [BTCP] is also trending these days. He believes that the prices will rise more than $200 by the end of July. It is currently priced at a mere $21.\nMcAfee goes ahead to predict the prices of another top 5 coin, EOS. It is currently trading at $12. According to his predictions, he expects the prices to rise up to $32 by the end of July.\nA day trader commented on Twitter:\n“ Thanks for #BitcoinPrivate prediction! This project will be a top 10 coin Fast and private transactions ”\nEarlier today, John McAfee tweeted again affirming that there are high chances of the market trading to be same as his predictions:\n“My short term price predictions: in a major dip, with nearly everything dropping, the price of Docademic doubled since my prediction. The market will turn before June 12th and my predictions will hit. My algorithms predicted Trump’s June 12th date. They have never been wrong.”\nDocademic [MTC] has shown a significant hike in the past 7 days with 108.53%. While all the other coins are showing a strong bearish trend since the past 24 hours, MTC is trading at $0.144 with a market cap of $26 million with an increase of 11.47% in the past 24 hours.

More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency has not traded below the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended.\nAs of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,449 on Bitfinex, having dropped below the 50-week MA on May 23. Weekly chart (2015–2018)\nAs seen on the chart above, the long-term moving average had acted as a strong support in the first quarter. BTC found strong bids in mid April following the repeated failure (marked by a circle) on the part of the bears to penetrate the 50-week MA.\nSubsequently, the rally from the 50-week MA to $9,990 (May 5 high) reinforced the moving average as a strong long-term support. Hence, a downside break would raise the odds of a slide to fresh 2017 lows below $6,000.\nLooking ahead, price chart analysis suggests that bitcoin is likely to end the week below the key $7,611 level.\nTo start with, the weekly relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory) and trending south in favor of the bears. The RSI has also found acceptance below the key support zone of 53.55–55.00, which only strengthens the bear case.\nMeanwhile, the daily chart below also shows scope for a drop below $7,000. Daily chart\nThe bears currently have the upper hand, as indicated by the lower highs and lower lows pattern, downside break of the channel, downward sloping (bearish) 5-day and 10-day MAs.\nThe RSI is holding below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but well above 30.00 (oversold region), indicating room for sell-off to $6,870 (triangle support). Hourly chart\nDespite the bullish price RSI divergence on the hourly chart, BTC failed to cross the falling trendline hurdle, underscoring the strong bearish sentiment in the market. View BTC looks set to close below the 50-week MA (at $7,611) for the first time since October 2015, signaling a major bearish breakdown and opening the doors for a re-test of $6,000 (2018 low).

A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.

Stupid me. Bitcoin will eat the world and we all gonna die.\nThe reality is that Bitcoin miners consume about 3 megawatts (1000x less than claimed) which is 1/10000th of a percent of world electricity consumption. To put this into perspective, the solar panels of Apple Park in California produce 17 megawatts. In other words, Apple Park consumes 6x more electricity than the entire Bitcoin mining.\nIt is rather easy to estimate the energy cost of Bitcoin proof-of-work computation:\n1. Take the modern miner, assuming that most miners are using the latest hardware (as less efficient one is quickly outcompeted due to neverending race to produce more efficient machines). E.g. AntMiner S9 produces 14 terahashes per second consuming 1.3 watts. Slightly older AntMiner T9 produces 12.5 TH/s at 1.5 watts. These specs are public and Alex de Vries uses them too in his paper. 2. Look at the actual bitcoin network with recent difficulty. It’s pretty easy to calculate the expected number of hashes that must be computed on average in order to solve the block. Today it is 33 399 541 TH/s. Note that this is not some back-of-the-napkin calculation, but a very precise average based on precise difficulty parameter. 3. Divide total network hashrate (33 million TH/s) by individual miner’s output (14 TH/s) and multiply by the required power (1.3 watts). You’ll get 3-4 megawatts. 4. It’s a lower bound, but it’s a reasonable one, as much more inefficient miners could not be the majority, and the major miners are more likely to be running more efficient machines that they produce themselves, that people do not know about yet. No way you can stretch this into 2.55 gigawatts as Alex de Vries claimed.\nGlobal electricity consumption is over 2200 gigawatts which makes Bitcoin mining with 0.003 gigawatts consume 1/10000th of a percent of world electricity. And the world consumes 8x more energy than just electricity overall. For instance, Ireland consumes 3 gigawatts of electricity, but total energy consumption is 17 gigawatts.

The first revolves around the South African Reserve Bank’s latest stance on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. To me, it looks as if SARB is becoming more hawkish about the space as it says it views cryptocurrencies as being digital tokens rather than currencies. SARB says it thinks cryptocurrencies don’t offer a “stable means of exchange, a unit of measure and a stable unit of value”. It’s fair for SARB to highlight that cryptocurrency prices haven’t been stable (especially in recent times) – that’s a fact. But SARB may be putting itself at risk of completely sidelining a technology which can still seriously become a future global means of exchange, unit of measure and unit of value, especially if big institutions get involved and liquidity improves. (Who knows, maybe one day the Rand will sit on the blockchain and be a cryptocurrency itself?) In the meantime, Magda Wierzycka’s Sygnia seems to think that cryptocurrencies do have a future in South Africa and across the globe as the company outlined plans in its results statement today about plans to launch its own cryptocurrency exchange. – Gareth van Zyl\nBy Amogelang Mbatha, Ntando Thukwana and Odwa Mjo\n(Bloomberg) – South Africa’s central bank chooses to call digital currencies such as Bitcoin “cyber-tokens” because they don’t meet the requirements to be classified as money.\n“We don’t use the term ‘cryptocurrency’ because it doesn’t meet the requirements of money in the economic sense of the stable means of exchange, a unit of measure and a stable unit of value,” Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Francois Groepe told reporters in Pretoria on Thursday. “We prefer to use the word ‘cyber-token’.”\nDigital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are becoming increasingly popular, with regulators in some countries struggling to move fast enough to manage them. The Reserve Bank has established a financial-technology, or fintech, unit to review its position on private cryptocurrencies and to help draw up an appropriate policy framework and regulatory regime.\n“We want to ensure or establish whether there is still compliance with the relevant financial surveillance or exchange-control regulations,” Groepe said.\nThe South African Reserve Bank isn’t the first to voice reservations about digital currencies. In January, Nigerian Governor Godwin Emefiele said investing in Bitcoin is a “ gamble,” while Lesotho’s central bank said a month later that it won’t offer any recourse to investors who lose money on them. Bank for International Settlements General Manager Agustin Carstens said in an interview with the German newspaper Boersen-Zeitung this week he prefers to call these currencies “cryptoassets.”\nFrom Sygnia’s results statement for the six months ended March 2018 Strategy for 2018/19 We have spent the past six months actively researching a number of new strategic initiatives that will position\nSygnia for the evolving digital future, as well as help its new business development and distribution efforts.\nThe key initiatives planned for 2018 and 2019 are: We are in the process of rolling out a revolutionary new retail distribution model which should result in\nsignificant asset flows into Sygnia’s retail products. This model will be expanded offshore in 2019.\nSygnia Group CEO Magda Wierzycka We aim to launch SygniaCoin, a cryptocurrency exchange, in the third quarter of 2018. The cryptocurrency\nmarket is evolving at a rapid pace internationally and domestically, and is attracting both domestic and\ninternational flows. With its fintech focus, Sygnia is well-positioned to become the first major financial services\ninstitution to embrace cryptocurrencies and to offer investors a secure trading and execution platform backed\nby an international infrastructure, well-designed custody and integration with standard savings products. The\nregulation around cryptocurrency exchanges is likely to evolve. The 2018/19 Budget defined cryptocurrencies\nas “digital assets that may be used as a medium of exchange”. The South African Revenue Service (SARS)\nhas already indicated that trading and investing in cryptocurrencies are subject to tax.\nWe expect further regulatory frameworks to follow. To ensure the highest levels of integrity and security for clients, we are basing our policies, protocols and processes on existing regulatory framework applicable to cryptocurrency exchanges registered in New York State, USA. We will also be able to offer investors the option of holding cryptocurrencies on the Sygnia Alchemy administration portal, alongside their investments through the Sygnia LISP and in SURF.\nWe intend to significantly upgrade our retail infrastructure which, although capital intensive, will, over the next three years, result in a significant reduction in costs, enhance scalability and provide us with opportunities to expand our operations offshore. We have also embarked on extensive upgrades to the infrastructure of Sygnia Securities and expanding its range of activities to take advantage of stock lending, market-making and third-party execution opportunities. We believe that this has the potential to significantly enhance our profitability going forward.\nA range of new products has also been designed to cater to the growing needs of our retail and institutional\ninvestors. This includes a range of Shari’ah investment funds, a Sygnia Cryptocurrency Fund that invests in a\nrange of cryptocurrencies on behalf of investors, and a Sygnia Activist Fund that will capitalise on Sygnia’s\nactivist stance. We believe that South African asset managers have become too complacent about the\ncorporate activities of JSE-listed companies. We intend to invest in companies that provide opportunities to\nunlock significant value by positive engagement with management.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magda wierzycka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sarb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T12:57:07.143+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd3b6762d3cc1176b0d5a3f1020fef8457c4487b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYJq1LAshY.oGR8k_HimA5E-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "[ANN] Litecoin - a lite version of Bitcoin.

Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions , moderated a panel of experts that spoke about the energy issue as part of a discussion on the topic of proof of work (PoW) vs. proof of stake (PoS).\nScott told Bitcoin Magazine that there was a lot of discussion at the conference about the new energy report in part due to the attention it's currently receiving in the press.\n\"This is an area where there is a spectacular amount of FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt],\" she noted. \"This is in part because it's a nuanced issue that can't be summed up in simple statements about net energy consumption.\n\"I think that part of the reason that Bitcoin has been a 'target' in this respect is that there are relatively straightforward calculations in terms of power consumption in conjunction with the underlying value not being well understood or widely accepted. For instance, few people question the utility costs of a bank or ATM, and the energy consumption cannot be calculated in a straightforward way,\" she added.\nScott Howard, CEO and co-founder of Toronto-based ePIC Blockchain Technologies , told the conference audience what many there were already saying: that the energy consumption issue is \"fake news\" and has been oversimplified to suit Bitcoin opponents.\nHigh Energy and Environmental Costs of Traditional Fiat and Banking Traditional banking and fiat creation have their own high energy costs, noted a number of conference panelists, including Alex Petrov, CIO of Bitfury ; Jan Čapek, CEO of Slush Pool ; Samson Mow, CSO of Blockstream ; and Howard.\nThey talked about the high infrastructure costs, in terms of both energy and the environment, associated with traditional banking systems, including ATMs, security and servers.\n\"There are 3.6 million ATMs deployed in the U.S. Each of them are using 7 to 800 watts just in standby mode,\" said Petrov. \"This alone generates huge numbers of electricity usage, slightly higher than the Bitcoin network.\n\"If you add … internal banking systems, CTVs, communicating with other banks, additional protection … you get higher costs than the cost of Bitcoin,\" he added.\n\"Gold mining consumes enormous energy. Portions of the electricity crypto mining consumes come from power generation and distribution originally built to supply ore and precious metals extraction or processing,\" said Howard.\n\"Where traditional energy consumers like gold mines really fall down is all the other negative externalities of the 'wealth' they create. Gold mining during and after is one of the most toxic and destructive operations on the planet.\"\nHoward talked about the use of abandoned industrial sites for Bitcoin mining, like pulp and paper mills that had been closed due to dwindling forestry supplies and increased concerns about energy use and toxic waste pollution.\n\"Lots of crypto mines are sitting in old industrial sites with a 100-megawatt transformer sitting next to them,\" he said.\nBy way of example, in the Q&A session that followed the panel, one conference participant talked about his mining operation in British Columbia in a partly abandoned manufacturing site where water is pumped through his mine for cooling and then recycled into a warm-water fish farm.\nMining Doesn't Create New Hydro Infrastructure: Power Is Produced Even If Unused After the panel, Howard reiterated to Bitcoin Magazine what other conference panelists had said: that large energy mega-projects like hydro dams produce electricity whether they're used or not.\n\"To my knowledge, no one has built out any net-new power generation to supply a crypto mine. Power generation stations are major pieces of infrastructure that take years to put in place and in the range of a decade to pay off. Most power generation is done, certainly in the western world, by publicly owned and/or regulated utilities. Those stations run 24/7, 365 for decades. The energy goes onto the grid no matter what and, until we figure out storage, is a perishable commodity.\n\"Crypto mining takes full advantage of this, typically sucking up energy at very low prices. The prices are low because the energy can't find more productive use, often taking over abandoned industrial sites far away from urban centers,\" he added.\nČapek told the conference that \"China has been overinvesting in hydro power and has large amounts of power that is not being used\" as a result of overbuilding hydro dams in anticipation of industrial needs (principally aluminum manufacturing) that never materialized.\n\"Cheap hydro power has helped China dominate the world's Bitcoin mining business, and this power would be generated with or without Bitcoin mining,\" said Čapek, who recommended a recently released study on the energy costs of mining in China.\nČapek said a rough estimate of global Bitcoin mining energy use is 25 terawatt hours per year, only a fraction of the amount of energy used in manufacturing aluminum globally.\nPoW vs. PoS The panelists mostly agreed that proof of work's higher energy use is necessary for real security and that proof of stake is not likely to happen soon. They noted that PoS would not give the Bitcoin network the security it needs, even if it was more energy efficient.\n\"The more energy that's expended, the more security you have,\" noted Mow. \"The system has to be nuclear-proof.\"\nPetrov defended the possibility of a hybrid model of both PoW and PoS, saying, \"Proof of stake may work for some specific purposes, not necessarily in the financial area but inside private blockchains.\"\nMow responded that using both PoS and PoW \"brings out the worst of both worlds,\" while Howard noted that Dash is using a hybrid model with some success, though it's very expensive to use.\nHoward concluded: \"It [Bitcoin mining] is a positive economic activity, typically in places where it is needed, as well as meaningful revenue to the utilities which are major employers and usually profit centers for governments. The 'waste of energy' argument, like most establishment arguments against blockchains, does not pass the test of science.\" The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://slushpool.com/home/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/want-learn-more-about-mining-theres-new-summit/", "https://blog.bitmex.com/mining-incentives-part-2-why-is-china-dominant-in-bitcoin-mining/", "https://bitfury.com/", "https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6", "https://www.outliercanada.com/", "https://www.epicblockchain.io/", "https://blockstream.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amber d. scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "high cost of energy shutterstock", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "outlier solutions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T00:03:32.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "963d49fbd3e10cf51d41bd2394a31cb11bf16771", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tck18DxqLmlD8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "title_full": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "published": "2018-05-25T12:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "963d49fbd3e10cf51d41bd2394a31cb11bf16771", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tck18DxqLmlD8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bowly88", "published": "2018-05-25T12:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "text": "Quote: from: Saddam Bin Delowar on May 24, 2018, 08:02:34 PM Yes! of course.

Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the report by Bloomberg said that the Justice Department was working with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to investigate illegal practices such as spoofing and was trading, and that Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) were among the digital coins examined by the prosecutors.\nThe Bitcoin price experienced a steep decline in yesterday’s late morning trading, falling to a near six-week low of $7,331.14. However, the cryptocurrency saw a strong rebound in the afternoon, which allowed to fully-recover its earlier losses. The digital currency finished the day at $7,587.34, slightly up from its opening price of $7,561.12.\nFollowing up on yesterday’s positive finish, Bitcoin continued to rise in the early hours of today’s trading. The advance was far from steady, however, with the digital currency experiencing multiple price swings while approaching $7,659.14, its highest price level so far today. At that point the cryptocurrency saw another sharp drop, promptly sending its price to an intraday low of $7,426.63.

Initial Coin Choices (ICO), ICOs, or sometimes known as token gross sales, are when a company gives traders some models of a brand new cryptocurrency or crypto-token in exchange towards cryptocurrencies corresponding to Bitcoin or Ethereum. There are a couple of noticeable variations, starters, as a result of the ICOs occur on blockchains, they benefit from the advantages of this digital ledger.

back above $7,400 against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair is currently attempting a close above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart (data feed from Kraken). A successful close above the trend line and $7,700 may perhaps open the doors for more gains. Bitcoin price is showing positive signs above $7,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must break the $7,650 and $7,700 resistance levels to recover further.\nBitcoin Price Analysis There were further bearish moves below $7,500 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded close to the $7,200 support level before buyers appeared. A low was formed at $7,258 from where the price started an upside correction. Buyers succeeded in pushing the price back above the $7,400 resistance, which is a positive sign.\nDuring the recent upside move, the price also crawled above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,593 high to $7,258 low. More important, there was a break above a key connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $7,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. However, the pair is currently struggling to move above another bearish trend line with resistance near $7,650 on the same chart. A close above $7,650 and $7,700 is required for buyers to gain control. The next major hurdle is near $8,000 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,593 high to $7,258 low.\nLooking at the chart , the price is forming a bullish pattern, but it won't be easy the bulls to clear the $7,700 resistance. Should they fail to move the price above $7,700, BTC/USD could drop back towards the $7,300 and $7,200 in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now well above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,200\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,700\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Break This? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T12:21:08.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07ee7ac376b4f9f59678b37eaf098e5dccbfbf22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlMZXQJsgoaGMTUjptl0EHonb3rUR.qCnfmIazSKJHd73AFcrS9uD7HLNmgmn6IdD4iYblAUvtNn3n8RKvHkV6qdzavN25VjZxzHV9HZ8Cn_Ktc6PyOmkGVWlm5.Zl2AFlkYMEBlKsoOEFNXdq.FoQvzNypDIAn64-", "site_full": "www.timeslive.co.za", "site": "timeslive.co.za", "site_section": "https://www.timeslive.co.za/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Times LIVE", "title": "Bitcoin kidnapping: Katlego Marite given a jubilant welcome home", "title_full": "Bitcoin kidnapping: Katlego Marite given a jubilant welcome home", "published": "2018-05-25T12:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UH6VRgY5TZncZG2uSZ92gpcaHWK4_H_SBzzzO7LQTAA5SLthzwaXzuUX1Aibzk3sY0neeEKtgnZ_UvGBiHlJ-A=s1000", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7481, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07ee7ac376b4f9f59678b37eaf098e5dccbfbf22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlMZXQJsgoaGMTUjptl0EHonb3rUR.qCnfmIazSKJHd73AFcrS9uD7HLNmgmn6IdD4iYblAUvtNn3n8RKvHkV6qdzavN25VjZxzHV9HZ8Cn_Ktc6PyOmkGVWlm5.Zl2AFlkYMEBlKsoOEFNXdq.FoQvzNypDIAn64-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Naledi Shange", "published": "2018-05-25T12:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin kidnapping: Katlego Marite given a jubilant welcome home", "text": "If a picture circulating on social media is anything to go by‚ the abducted Katlego Marite was given a hero's welcome when he returned home on Thursday.\nThe 12-year-old was snatched in broad daylight just metres away from his house on Sunday while he walked back home with his friends.\nIn the image shared on Twitter‚ Katlego is dressed in red shorts‚ a baseball jacket and sandals and he is seen standing on a ledge outside his home in Tasbet Park‚ Witbank.\nYoung Katlego Marite from Witbank has been returned home safe and sound. pic.twitter.com/lX4hYP0MSA\n— #JCole TheMixTape (@ryu_winston) May 24, 2018 The driveway to the house‚ which is a grand mansion nicknamed Nkandla by community members‚ was visited by scores of community members who gathered around Katlego‚ snapping pictures and smiling at him.\nKatlego himself is seen smiling at the crowd.\nHis sister Masego‚ who celebrates her birthday on Friday (today) is seen standing behind him‚ her hands raised to her face in apparent jubilation.\nWhile police has refused to divulge how and where Katlego was found‚ TimesLIVE has learnt that he was dropped off by his kidnappers in Kromdraai near Witbank on Thursday.\nBitcoin kidnapping: Three taken into custody Three people have been taken into police custody in connection with the disappearance of 12-year-old Katlego Marite.

The image was posted earlier this week on the Bitcoin subreddit by new user cryptogreetings, who informed excited readers that one whole Bitcoin (currently worth $8300) was up for grabs for whoever could figure it out. At face value, the image is a word cloud of words and numbers taken from Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakomoto’s whitepaper, all different sizes and overlapping each other. The words “blocks”, “transaction,” “attacker” can be seen among dozens of others, with the Bitcoin symbol superimposed on top, creating a white area. The poster, whose Reddit account has no history beyond this post, had this to say about their puzzle:\n“This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry. The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life, and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work.” While Redditors will have to depend on the good faith of cryptogreetings upon winning, the poster did link a Bitcoin address containing poster linked a Bitcoin address with 1.00152389 BTC in it, with the extra amount of roughly $12 likely aimed to cover fees. Redditors have come together to voice their theories and lament the difficulty of the task, with the top comment in the thread being “I’m better equipped to sell a kidney or $9k.” Another user trying to solve the puzzle with math agreed that this was a sobering thought, and a third chimed in saying “I started the same thing. Then I realized there is millions of possible permutations in the key. It’s actually just as difficult to brute force the encryption.” Many other users admitted they had no idea where to start with the puzzle. Not everyone gave up so easily, however, with other users banding together to figure it out. Reddit user Zyntra posted: “Some stuff I noticed so far: Some words start with a capital, when other words dont. Many words and math, but some letters just stand alone. You can find a C, W, M. Some digits are single as well There’s a number crossed out by some icon on the bottom right of the big Bitcoin B. I don’t know if or what that icon means though. There’s quite a bit of open space in the top right corner, given how filled the rest of the image is. Some numbers make sense as a part of math or whitepaper references. But the longer numbers make no sense to me, theyre not dates or references to the whitepaper, like 19981101″ u/AnotherSmegHead figured out the numbe of times different words were used in the Bitcoin whitepaper and worked with that. “Here are the most frequently used words in the Whitepaper: transaction 69 block 67 hash 33 nod 31 chain 27 attacker 23 network 21 proof-of-work 18 owner 17 work 16 coin 16 one 15 honest 15 public 14 timestamp 14 trust 14 key 13 without 12 new 12 system 11 party 11 ne 11 probable 11 accept 10 value 9 cpu 9 z 9 k 9 longest 8 merkle 8 next 8 catch 8 p 8 header 8 nonce 8 problem 8 time 8 power 7 signature 7 proof 7 verify 7 prev 7 make 7 long 7 node 7 link 7 sender 7 majority 7 payment 7 q 6 If you save the image you get the image name as NdLEoUJCqNLlZFQBKEr7lxTK-PKQjqi5FtBM8k5lqs8 Remember me if you crack this code ;-)” An important clue came from u/cryptogreetings themselves. When u/mishax1 stated that “there are 239 BIP39 seed words in that picture,” the original poster said “you can throw at least half of those out. This is clue #1.” When asked for more clues, u/cryptogreetings was cryptic, saying that perhaps hints could be dropped in the future if the task proved difficult. They also revealed that 1 BTC was the first prize, but not the only one. Story Continues “There’s also some consolation prizes scattered in there, but let’s not even talk about those for now ;)” This isn’t the first time Bitcoin has been hidden in puzzles to be solved. Artist Marguerite Driscoll collaborated with three others in 2015 to conceal 4.87 Bitcoin in her art, which at the time amounted to about $1150. Her paintings acted as puzzles to be solved by the community, bringing forum users on Reddit and BitcoinTalk together to figure it out.

expected to lead to further downward momentum in the coming days. Bitcoin has been sold off for weeks. The price was expected to retrace along the way to continue the bullish trend. Though there was a certain hype about Bitcoin after Consensus 2018 event which was the largest attended version of block chain events, Bitcoin failed to impress the bulls. As for the current scenario, the price is expected to proceed much lower towards $6,500 area without any strong intervention of the bulls along the way as current H4 candle has already engulfed the previous bullish price actions. As the price remains below $8,000 area, the bearish bias is expected to continue further.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

Electrum is not a miner.\nElectrum is a light wallet, it does not perform proof-of-work hashing to create blocks, instead it just checks to ensure that relevant transactions are valid. Rather than download the entire blockchain, it will just download the block headers (much less data), and then it can perform cryptographic checks to ensure that everything is legit.\nFor transactions in particular, the wallet will ensure that the relevant transaction hashes are present in the merkle root of a block (the merkle root is part of the block header). The wallet can request the relevant transactions, and then hash them to verify that the correct merkle root is reached (ie, the same merkle root that is present in the longest valid proof-of-work chain). Due to the one-way nature of hash functions, a node could not serve an invalid transaction hash to a wallet, or else the root would change entirely and the wallet would know it is invalid.\nIn this way, light wallets allow you to verify the blockchain's history with a low level of trust, and low resource intensity (less data, and less verification computation).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "– jeannie", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "electrum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:46:23.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c26aa389aa300b737e780f3028fae1a2993d7bb5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXzXYfM_y82fuW35xPjTo8I-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Central of the Philippines Recognizes Bitcoin", "title_full": "Central of the Philippines Recognizes Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-25T11:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.703, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c26aa389aa300b737e780f3028fae1a2993d7bb5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXzXYfM_y82fuW35xPjTo8I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kalawang", "published": "2018-05-25T11:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Central of the Philippines Recognizes Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: Xester on February 10, 2017, 07:11:50 AM http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/02/08/philippines-bangko-sentral-recognizes-bitcoin-payment-system/\nAccording to this article the Philippines Bangko Sentral Recognizes Bitcoin as Payment System. The article also added that Bangko Sentral states sees the virtual currencys potential to revolutionize the delivery of financial services. Additionally, they also mention how bitcoin provides financial inclusion, which is something traditional financial solutions have been unable to provide. This statements coming from the Central Banks of the Philippines will give a potential impact on the rise of bitcoins value on the market. And not only that, the Philippine Central Bank is not the only bank that sees the merits of bitcoin but also the the Central Bank of Nigeria.\nyes that was so true. Philippines are already accepting cryptocurrencies. especially bitcoin cause philippine government knows and sees a lot of good changes will be if their accept crptocurrencies in our country

theft of approximately $17.5 million from cryptocurrency exchanges.\nMore security news Fitness app PumpUp leaked health data, private messages Over 115,000 Drupal sites still vulnerable to critical flaw A hacker claims to be selling access to Apple internal tools Blockchain: The 2 most important things to understand Your iPhone is tracking your movements and storing your favorite locations all the time Traders of the coin, established in 2017 through a hard fork of the main Bitcoin (BTC) network, have been tracing the attack since last week.\nScrutiny of unusual activity on the network has revealed the scheme, in which \"double spending\" attacks have been launched against cryptocurrency exchanges trading the virtual currency.\nAccording to the Bitcoin Gold team , exchanges rather than individual users have been targeted.\nThe first attack was recorded on 16 May and have now appeared to have ceased.\n\"An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use \"51 percent attacks\" to perform \"double spend\" attacks to steal money from exchanges,\" the team says. \"We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits. There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held.\"\n51 percent attacks force reorganization in the blockchain. While not the result of a security flaw or vulnerabilities, the attack can -- theoretically -- be launched against any blockchain.\nIf a threat actor manages to wrestle control of over 50 percent of a network's computing power, they are able to both modify and exclude transactions of their own coins from blocks.\nAttackers are then able to double spend, in which transactions are reversed after being confirmed, as well as prevent all other miners on a network from mining valid blocks.\nLaunching these types of attacks can be expensive and due to the vast computing power required, the only way they are made profitable is to attempt large double spend transactions -- and this, in turn, pivots attacks towards cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe wallet address connected to the 51 percent scheme has received 388,201 BTG, which is worth approximately $17.5 million at the time of writing.\nThe majority of the funds have been moved to other addresses and only roughly 12,000 BTG remains in the account.\n\"One of the targeted exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past,\" the Bitcoin Gold team says. \"In their words, \"we are 100 percent sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.\"\nIn response to the threat actor's attacks, a number of cryptocurrency exchanges have ramped up the number of confirmations they require to accept large transactions.\nThe Bitcoin Gold team says that a major upgrade planned for the end of June -- now being pushed to take place as soon as possible -- will eradicate the use of ASIC hardware to mine BTG.\nASIC systems are expected to ship at approximately the same time and have the potential to cause an imbalance to existing miners, and therefore, the team is tampering with the BTG algorithm to prevent this from occurring.\nThe organization says that the change in algorithm and a new fork will also reduce the risk of 51 percent attacks in the future.\nSee also: Brutal cryptocurrency mining malware crashes your PC when discovered\n\"We've been working at an incredible pace the past days to put the plan and pieces together, and we expect to upgrade our mainnet approximately seven days after the necessary software is up and running on our testnet,\" the team says. \"[...] While it would be better to give all our partners more than seven days to test and deploy to avoid disruption, these attacks have already forced disruption on us all, so we feel it's best to get the upgrade completed as soon as we possibly can.\"\nAccording to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, recent estimates suggest that since 2017, cyberattackers have managed to steal $1.2 billion in cryptocurrencies from exchanges, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), wallets, and more.\nA similar attack method has recently been employed against Verge, a cryptocurrency offering which claims to bring back the anonymity once associated with cryptocurrency as a whole.\nEarlier this week , reports surfaced which claimed that a threat actor has been able to successfully launch a 51 percent attack on the Verge blockchain, leading to the theft of approximately 35 million Verge coins (XVG), worth over $1.7 million.\nHow Blockchain technologies are transforming...
