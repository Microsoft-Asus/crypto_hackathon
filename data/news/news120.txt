In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification. The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks. It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself.\nThe lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed. For now, everyone just runs a full network node.\nI anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.\nAt equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.\nSource\n submitted by /u/fruitsofknowledge\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://archive.is/GrLQJ"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T22:34:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63aa75700998b7d2d195bcd2a677ae8d3b8918b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaOt0k7ud4Dge_aLHBeVCaw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin down, what will happen?", "title_full": "bitcoin down, what will happen?", "published": "2018-05-28T02:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63aa75700998b7d2d195bcd2a677ae8d3b8918b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaOt0k7ud4Dge_aLHBeVCaw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PelevaVika", "published": "2018-05-28T02:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin down, what will happen?", "text": "Bitcoin will fall slightly, stabilize, then by the end of the year again a sharp increase.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T22:36:04.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22022a0249c29e0a64ad5a6c4a4bf459cd020613", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMNF6p0BWYjcGYlxgm9lIQalAun_QNiHg7HEzUnwxoXGf9CXUq_JgHLDLJyJilp59k1y8xPMTHGidym2Dzzo0nM83QHuF_n3iXg--", "site_full": "www.thelincolnianonline.com", "site": "thelincolnianonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thelincolnianonline.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Lincolnian Online", "title": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Price Reaches $0.13 on Top Exchanges", "title_full": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Price Reaches $0.13 on Top Exchanges", "published": "2018-05-28T02:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1248.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22022a0249c29e0a64ad5a6c4a4bf459cd020613", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMNF6p0BWYjcGYlxgm9lIQalAun_QNiHg7HEzUnwxoXGf9CXUq_JgHLDLJyJilp59k1y8xPMTHGidym2Dzzo0nM83QHuF_n3iXg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stephan Jacobs", "published": "2018-05-28T02:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Price Reaches $0.13 on Top Exchanges", "text": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Price Reaches $0.13 on Top Exchanges Posted by Stephan Jacobs | May 27th, 2018\nBitcoin 21 (CURRENCY:XBTC21) traded flat against the US dollar during the twenty-four hour period ending at 19:00 PM Eastern on May 27th.

Sponsored Links Ever since the fateful first-ever recorded transaction of Bitcoin for a physical good, the use case for the currency has taken off, with customers now able to use Bitcoin for real estate deals, online shopping, airplane bookings and, of course, pizza. Cointelegraph got the chance to speak to both Laszlo and Jeremy this week about their views on Bitcoin, how they feel about the legacy of the “Bitcoin Pizza” and their favorite type of pizza.\nCointelegraph: You probably get asked this question a lot, but I have to ask. Since 10,000 Bitcoin is worth around 80 million dollars today, do you ever regret paying 10,000 BTC for two pizzas?\nLH: You know, I don’t regret it. I think that it’s great that I got to be part of the early history of Bitcoin in that way, and people know about the pizza and it’s an interesting story because everybody can kind of relate to that and be [like] –“Oh my God, you spent all of that money!” I was also kind of giving people tech support on the forums and I ported Bitcoin to MacOS, and you know, some other things – fix bugs and whatnot, and I’ve always kind of just wanted people to use Bitcoin and buying the pizza was one way to do that. I didn’t think it would get as popular as it has, but it’s gotten to be a really catchy story for people.\nCT: So do you use Bitcoin in everyday life?\nLH: Yeah, I do, I try to whenever I can. I’ve bought many things over the years with it, I play around with the Bitcoin software and things like that, but I try to kind of keep it as a hobby.\nBut I haven’t really used Bitcoin much in face-to-face payments. I’ve done it mostly online. It’s one of those things where I like to keep an eye on it and I like to participate in online, but as far as face-to-face stuff, I just feel like it’s not really the best. It tends to be more frustrating, and the goal is that Bitcoin should become better than the status quo, right?\nCT: What’s your favorite cryptocurrency?\nLH: Bitcoin! [Laughs]\nCT: What’s your favorite pizza?\nLH: Pizza? I like Supreme.\nCT: In your original post from the first Pizza Day, you compared your desire to buy a pizza with buying a hotel breakfast platter. What is your ideal hotel breakfast platter?\nLH: Oh, I don’t know. I like eggs, bacon, pancakes – you know, standard stuff.\nJust to expand on that – the reason that I compared it that way – I was thinking of the experience of me picking up the phone and saying “Hey, I’d like breakfast in room 123”, and I just get charged on my account and I get the food delivered to me – I don’t care how they did it. Whether it’s a contractor, or Papa John’s, or whoever brings it. What I was trying to do was make it clear that I didn’t want somebody to send me a Papa John’s gift card, or a Domino’s credit or anything like that – I wanted food and I wanted to pay Bitcoins for food. Because if I can buy food with it, then it’s it’s as real as any other money, right? Food is a basic necessity — if I can eat from Bitcoin, I can live off of Bitcoin.\nCT: Does your current job involve working with cryptocurrency?\nLH: I don’t really like engaging in it as a primary business, it’s sort of a side project for me. I know that’s kind of weird to explain to people, but I feel like that keeps it more fun for me – than if it was like a nine-to-five kind of thing of “Oh, you know, let’s do some crypto business.” I don’t want to be one of those guys with like a scam ICO or something like that.\nJust recently at my job, I kind of convinced people here to accept Bitcoin, and, being a developer, I integrated it on our website. We are trying to see how that goes now. People here are excited about it, they’re excited about about what I’d done and everything. And so we’re trying it out. I’m kind of applying my hobby at work now, so that’s pretty cool when you can do that.\nCT: Have you ever thought about buying a pizza with any other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin?\nLH : I like Bitcoin. I was around early, when it was just Bitcoin, and to me, the copycat coins or whatever you want to call them – you know 90% of these things are simply a copy-paste of Bitcoin, and they changed the logo, or they changed something. I’m not that interested in those, I am interested in Bitcoin.\nCT: Do you think that your original Bitcoin pizza purchase directly influenced the fact that you can now buy pizza and other food with Bitcoin?\nLH : I’d like to think that what I did helped. But I think if it wasn’t me, somebody else would have come along. And maybe it wouldn’t have been pizza. But I think Bitcoin was kind of destined to get big, and I didn’t know everything about Bitcoin back then – I mean, I had only been playing with it a couple months, and I figured out how to mine, I actually wrote the first GPU miner – and that’s how I got all those Bitcoins that I was kind of giving away.\nCT: Do you think it makes sense for people to use Bitcoin for kind of pizza-type purchases now?\nLH : If everybody wanted to pay for pizza with Bitcoin right now – it wouldn’t work — they would try it, they’d realize that their transactions aren’t confirming, and they’d lose interest. And that’s kind of where we’re at today, right?\nIn December, everybody was like “Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin,” and then “Oh my god, my transaction has been sitting there for 12 hours, what’s going on, this thing sucks!” People learned how it works and we actually saw the fee market working and all that, so I think it’s really exciting, but I have no idea on how it’s gonna go, I think it’s really interesting to watch.\nCT: What would it take for Bitcoin to become more widely used?\nLH: I know you guys covered it when I did the Lightning pizza thing. I feel like when something like that – the Lightning Network or something similar to it – ends up becoming mainstream, usable for people. I think that’s where it’ll become more interesting to actually spend bitcoins face-to-face.\nCT: How do you think the Lightning Network will make Bitcoin more mainstream?\nLH: The Lighting Network is not perfect either, it has issues, it can be in abused in various ways, but it’s a step in that direction, and to me, if something like Lightning Network takes off, I think you’re gonna see every online retailer just switch to it because nobody wants to use MasterCard, and Visa, and PayPal.\nI think the Lightning Network is definitely the goal there, to bring more usability to people, because it really does enable instant payments, and Bitcoin payments are not instant. If you’re accepting with zero confirmation of payment, you’re not really doing it correctly. And that’s okay to do if you’re gonna extend trust to people – because same thing happens with a credit card – all you have is the promise today, you haven’t actually gotten paid. So in some businesses that’s perfectly fine, but that’s not really the spirit of Bitcoin, you shouldn’t have to trust anybody, you should be able to say “Hey, I have this Bitcoin, and here’s the cryptographic proof.” The Lightning Network can also give us back some of the privacy that people originally mistakenly thought they had. CT: In the photo of your family eating the “Lightning Network Pizza”, your children are wearing “I <3 Bitcoin” t-shirts. Do you educate your children about Bitcoin? Image source: Laszlo Hanyecz’s Feb. 25 post on Lightning-dev mailing list\nLH: Liam is my son, he’s seven and Amy, my daughter, is nine. They actually have their own paper wallets, they own like a thousandth of a Bitcoin or something like that. I showed them how to go on GDAX and things like that. I just made them a bookmark on their computer so that they could check the price. I showed them how to multiply their little thousandth of a Bitcoin by the price and things like that.\nI spent time explaining it to them, they were like:\n– Daddy, what are you doing? – Bitcoin. – Oh, what’s the Bitcoin?\nMy kids are fairly young, I can’t really explain market forces and things like that to them yet, but they understand that more is good, and Bitcoin is good, and that I’m involved with Bitcoin somehow. I try to get them to learn, and I think when they get older, I’ll try to teach them more technical stuff. Jasco – the man who earned 10,000 BTC by selling two pizzas\nCointelegraph also had the chance to speak with Jeremy Sturdivant, also known as Jasco, who participated in the original Bitcoin pizza deal as the recipient of those 10,000 BTC that he turned into two pizzas. Sturdivant, who told CT that he turned Hanyecz’s BTC into fiat for a trip when they were worth a couple of hundred dollars, noted that he still uses Bitcoin in his everyday life “to some extent:”\n“Doing independent contract work brings money in a variety of forms, and I’ve been paid in Bitcoin, Litecoin, even Dogecoin. My local grocery stores don’t take it though, so I most often find myself trading it away to put it to use, aside from online services […] Steam, Humble store, and other video game retailers accepted Bitcoin during a lot of the times I had free time for video games. Certainly the bulk of my Steam library was paid for with Bitcoin.”\nWhen asked about the most amount of Bitcoin he has ever had, Sturdivant estimated it to be close to 40,000 due to both mining and trading early on:\n“I’ve never seen Bitcoin as an investment, and while it’s easy to look back and say ‘I could have been a millionaire,’ I think it’s more important to look at the mindset I had during the pizza transaction, not being that of acquiring an investment, but of making use of a form of currency. If I was looking to hoard coins, I very likely wouldn’t have been in the right place at the right time.”\nSturdivant also noted that he’s also continued to buy and sell pizza in cryptocurrency using Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH), and that he prefers pizza with meat and red onions, although “for a little controversy, I like ‘Hawaiian’ pizza quite a lot.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeremy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laszlo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy sturdivant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jasco", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T08:40:32.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3b1fd3fd05c7e24ef8cbeef40c887a1495d45f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2eRCTFln.i_ZKYUln37JOIYwDV_Vxfsd4hAi_5M4LaK466YXpvcI8OJIck99oFe1ClGzLmM11A--", "site_full": "www.godlikeproductions.com", "site": "godlikeproductions.com", "site_section": "http://www.godlikeproductions.com/feeds/forums/1", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Godlike Productions - General Discussion", "title": "A Conspiracy to KEEP YOU POOR.

The question is whether owning bitcoins or lesser-known cryptocurrencies such as Ripple and Ethereum is an indicator of risky personal behavior — one that should flag extra scrutiny in security clearances — or just another investment choice.\n“There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,” said Param Vir Singh, director of the PNC Center for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. “Think about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well.”\nThe debate is playing out across the government, as the Defense Department and other agencies struggle to define the currencies. Some see them simply as new investments and payment methods, while others worry they provide potential vehicles for illegal activities, from money laundering to drug-dealing.\nBitcoin Prices Plunge Below $12,000 After Hitting $19,000 Last Week In less than 24 hours, Bitcoin dropped more than $3000, over a 20 percent decrease. Bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency to crash, with Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin all dropping upwards of 20 percent as well.\nIt is the cryptocurrency’s first major drop since rising over 1,300 percent since the beginning of 2017. Many investment experts have been cautioning people for weeks against buying Bitcoin because they believe it to be a massive bubble.

Ever since the fateful first-ever recorded transaction of Bitcoin for a physical good, the use case for the currency has taken off, with customers now able to use Bitcoin for real estate deals, online shopping , airplane bookings and, of course, pizza . Cointelegraph got the chance to speak to both Laszlo and Jeremy this week about their views on Bitcoin, how they feel about the legacy of the “Bitcoin Pizza” and their favorite type of pizza.\nCointelegraph: You probably get asked this question a lot, but I have to ask. Since 10,000 Bitcoin is worth around 80 million dollars today, do you ever regret paying 10,000 BTC for two pizzas?\nLH: You know, I don’t regret it. I think that it’s great that I got to be part of the early history of Bitcoin in that way, and people know about the pizza and it’s an interesting story because everybody can kind of relate to that and be [like] –“Oh my God, you spent all of that money!” I was also kind of giving people tech support on the forums and I ported Bitcoin to MacOS, and you know, some other things – fix bugs and whatnot, and I’ve always kind of just wanted people to use Bitcoin and buying the pizza was one way to do that. I didn’t think it would get as popular as it has, but it’s gotten to be a really catchy story for people.\nCT: So do you use Bitcoin in everyday life?\nLH: Yeah, I do, I try to whenever I can. I’ve bought many things over the years with it, I play around with the Bitcoin software and things like that, but I try to kind of keep it as a hobby.\nBut I haven’t really used Bitcoin much in face-to-face payments. I’ve done it mostly online. It’s one of those things where I like to keep an eye on it and I like to participate in online, but as far as face-to-face stuff, I just feel like it’s not really the best. It tends to be more frustrating, and the goal is that Bitcoin should become better than the status quo, right?\nCT: What’s your favorite cryptocurrency?\nLH: Bitcoin! [Laughs]\nCT: What’s your favorite pizza?\nLH: Pizza? I like Supreme.\nCT: In your original post from the first Pizza Day , you compared your desire to buy a pizza with buying a hotel breakfast platter. What is your ideal hotel breakfast platter?\nLH: Oh, I don’t know. I like eggs, bacon, pancakes – you know, standard stuff.\nJust to expand on that – the reason that I compared it that way – I was thinking of the experience of me picking up the phone and saying “Hey, I’d like breakfast in room 123”, and I just get charged on my account and I get the food delivered to me – I don’t care how they did it. Whether it’s a contractor, or Papa John’s, or whoever brings it. What I was trying to do was make it clear that I didn’t want somebody to send me a Papa John’s gift card, or a Domino’s credit or anything like that – I wanted food and I wanted to pay Bitcoins for food. Because if I can buy food with it, then it’s it’s as real as any other money, right? Food is a basic necessity — if I can eat from Bitcoin, I can live off of Bitcoin.\nCT: Does your current job involve working with cryptocurrency?\nLH: I don’t really like engaging in it as a primary business, it’s sort of a side project for me. I know that’s kind of weird to explain to people, but I feel like that keeps it more fun for me – than if it was like a nine-to-five kind of thing of “Oh, you know, let’s do some crypto business.” I don’t want to be one of those guys with like a scam ICO or something like that.\nJust recently at my job, I kind of convinced people here to accept Bitcoin, and, being a developer, I integrated it on our website. We are trying to see how that goes now. People here are excited about it, they’re excited about about what I’d done and everything. And so we’re trying it out. I’m kind of applying my hobby at work now, so that’s pretty cool when you can do that.\nCT: Have you ever thought about buying a pizza with any other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin?\nLH : I like Bitcoin. I was around early, when it was just Bitcoin, and to me, the copycat coins or whatever you want to call them – you know 90% of these things are simply a copy-paste of Bitcoin, and they changed the logo, or they changed something. I’m not that interested in those, I am interested in Bitcoin.\nCT: Do you think that your original Bitcoin pizza purchase directly influenced the fact that you can now buy pizza and other food with Bitcoin?\nLH : I’d like to think that what I did helped. But I think if it wasn’t me, somebody else would have come along. And maybe it wouldn’t have been pizza. But I think Bitcoin was kind of destined to get big, and I didn’t know everything about Bitcoin back then – I mean, I had only been playing with it a couple months, and I figured out how to mine, I actually wrote the first GPU miner – and that’s how I got all those Bitcoins that I was kind of giving away.\nCT: Do you think it makes sense for people to use Bitcoin for kind of pizza-type purchases now?\nLH : If everybody wanted to pay for pizza with Bitcoin right now – it wouldn’t work — they would try it, they’d realize that their transactions aren’t confirming, and they’d lose interest. And that’s kind of where we’re at today, right?\nIn December, everybody was like “Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin,” and then “Oh my god, my transaction has been sitting there for 12 hours, what’s going on, this thing sucks!” People learned how it works and we actually saw the fee market working and all that, so I think it’s really exciting, but I have no idea on how it’s gonna go, I think it’s really interesting to watch.\nCT: What would it take for Bitcoin to become more widely used?\nLH: I know you guys covered it when I did the Lightning pizza thing . I feel like when something like that – the Lightning Network or something similar to it – ends up becoming mainstream, usable for people. I think that’s where it’ll become more interesting to actually spend bitcoins face-to-face.\nCT: How do you think the Lightning Network will make Bitcoin more mainstream?\nLH: The Lighting Network is not perfect either, it has issues, it can be in abused in various ways, but it’s a step in that direction, and to me, if something like Lightning Network takes off, I think you’re gonna see every online retailer just switch to it because nobody wants to use MasterCard , and Visa , and PayPal .\nI think the Lightning Network is definitely the goal there, to bring more usability to people, because it really does enable instant payments, and Bitcoin payments are not instant. If you’re accepting with zero confirmation of payment, you’re not really doing it correctly. And that’s okay to do if you’re gonna extend trust to people – because same thing happens with a credit card – all you have is the promise today, you haven’t actually gotten paid. So in some businesses that’s perfectly fine, but that’s not really the spirit of Bitcoin, you shouldn’t have to trust anybody, you should be able to say “Hey, I have this Bitcoin, and here’s the cryptographic proof.” The Lightning Network can also give us back some of the privacy that people originally mistakenly thought they had. CT: In the photo of your family eating the “Lightning Network Pizza”, your children are wearing “I 3 Bitcoin” t-shirts. Do you educate your children about Bitcoin? Image source: Laszlo Hanyecz’s Feb. 25 post on Lightning-dev mailing list\nLH: Liam is my son, he’s seven and Amy, my daughter, is nine. They actually have their own paper wallets, they own like a thousandth of a Bitcoin or something like that. I showed them how to go on GDAX and things like that. I just made them a bookmark on their computer so that they could check the price. I showed them how to multiply their little thousandth of a Bitcoin by the price and things like that.\nI spent time explaining it to them, they were like:\n– Daddy, what are you doing? – Bitcoin. – Oh, what’s the Bitcoin?\nMy kids are fairly young, I can’t really explain market forces and things like that to them yet, but they understand that more is good, and Bitcoin is good, and that I’m involved with Bitcoin somehow. I try to get them to learn, and I think when they get older, I’ll try to teach them more technical stuff. Jasco – the man who earned 10,000 BTC by selling two pizzas\nCointelegraph also had the chance to speak with Jeremy Sturdivant, also known as Jasco, who participated in the original Bitcoin pizza deal as the recipient of those 10,000 BTC that he turned into two pizzas. Sturdivant, who told CT that he turned Hanyecz’s BTC into fiat for a trip when they were worth a couple of hundred dollars, noted that he still uses Bitcoin in his everyday life “to some extent:”\n“Doing independent contract work brings money in a variety of forms, and I’ve been paid in Bitcoin, Litecoin, even Dogecoin. My local grocery stores don’t take it though, so I most often find myself trading it away to put it to use, aside from online services […] Steam, Humble store, and other video game retailers accepted Bitcoin during a lot of the times I had free time for video games. Certainly the bulk of my Steam library was paid for with Bitcoin.”\nWhen asked about the most amount of Bitcoin he has ever had, Sturdivant estimated it to be close to 40,000 due to both mining and trading early on:\n“I’ve never seen Bitcoin as an investment, and while it’s easy to look back and say ‘I could have been a millionaire,’ I think it’s more important to look at the mindset I had during the pizza transaction, not being that of acquiring an investment, but of making use of a form of currency. If I was looking to hoard coins, I very likely wouldn’t have been in the right place at the right time.”\nSturdivant also noted that he’s also continued to buy and sell pizza in cryptocurrency using Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH), and that he prefers pizza with meat and red onions, although “for a little controversy, I like ‘Hawaiian’ pizza quite a lot.” Related Articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/mastercard", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/lightning-network", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/northern-ireland-property-developer-to-accept-bitcoin-as-payment-option", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-history-of-overstock-e-commerce-bitcoin-pioneer-facing-unclear-future", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/001044.html", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/private-airline-surf-air-accepts-bitcoin-and-ethereum", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/litecoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/paypal", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/original-pizza-day-purchaser-does-it-again-with-bitcoin-lightning-network", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/visa", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/gdax", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-2018-community-celebrates-a-takeout-order-now-worth-82-mln", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-8-years-later-where-can-you-buy-pizza-with-bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-mining"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T05:46:18.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a060c68162db65f01b676e000adefdd0fcc739af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd1D1NVlMr5U90ldos4fciA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "Is this right time to re-enter into Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Is this right time to re-enter into Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-28T01:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a060c68162db65f01b676e000adefdd0fcc739af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd1D1NVlMr5U90ldos4fciA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "oceantiger", "published": "2018-05-28T01:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is this right time to re-enter into Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: ritikasimi on May 22, 2018, 09:53:29 PM Hey everyone,\nToday we saw sudden fall on btc.so I was thinking is this right time to buy some btc or wait for more dip..what do you think..\nPlease reply in comment\nYou can buy now that there is a dip in price and wait to follow the trend back to the top after reversal.

(Representational Image) Lucknow: In perhaps the first-of-its-kind case in Uttar Pradesh, probe agencies on Sunday said they have detected transactions of over Rs 8 lakh in a crypto-currency (bitcoin) account, that was mentioned in the alleged extortion messages received by 22 MLAs of the state recently.\nThe state lawmakers, most of them from the ruling BJP, recently claimed to have received text or WhatsApp messages asking them to pay Rs 10 lakh in bitcoin otherwise their families will be eliminated.\n\"During the probe, a crypto-currency (bitcoin) account, mentioned in the threat messages to legislators, has been detected. Transactions of 1.60368338 bitcoins (Rs 8.16 lakh) were done in this account. And the entire amount was later transferred to some other account,\" STF sources said.\n\"A total of six transactions, between 6.46 PM on May 2 and 4 AM on May 18, were done in the crypto-currency e-wallet during which bitcoin was received and sent through different e-wallets. One transaction each was done on May 2, 3, 4, and 18 and two transactions on May 17,\" they said.\nThe matter came to the fore when the MLAs complained about receiving threat messages asking them to pay Rs 10 lakh through bitcoins, they said. The sources said probe agencies are investigating as to who did all these transactions.\nAfter Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took note, an SIT was constituted on May 23 to probe the high-profile matter. The state police is suspecting the handiwork of \"professional hackers\" behind this to create panic and has issued an advisory to the people not to be scared.\n\"An advisory has been issued across the state asking all not to get panicked over such messages,\" DIG (Law and Order) Pravin Kumar said.\n\"Prima facie, it appears to be the handiwork of some mischief makers,\" he said, adding that the SIT constituted to go into the matter was already working on it.\nIn all the messages, the sender has given out his name as Ali Budesh Bhai from Dubai, a reference to a gangster once linked to the now Pakistan-based Dawood Ibrahim.\nThe MLAs who got the messages include Veer Vikram Singh (Meeranpur Katra in Shahjahanpur), Manvendra Singh (Dadraul in Shahjahanpur), Prem Prakash Pandey (Tarabganj in Gonda), Vinay Kumar Dwivedi (Mehnam in Gonda), Vinod Katiyar (Bhognipur in Kanpur), Shahshank Trivedi (Mahauli in Sitapur) and Anita Rajput (Debai in Bulandshahr), Dhirendra Bahadur Singh (Sareni-Raebareli).\nThe opposition had also attacked the Adityanath government over the issue. \"No one is secure under the present regime. The MLAs are being threatened of dire consequences,\" Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had said.\n\"There is no law and order in the state.\" Congress spokesman Arun Prakash levelled similar charges, saying the threats to legislators \"expose the tall claims of the BJP government\".", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-vkij8cihhds8glvivq9m2qutb5-20170310034734.Medi.jpeg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "mla", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttar pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:54:53.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ffe127830eb1a8f763f00e811b736772027d5192", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXqDfU_YZvXoAvUojI.hJbo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Does any bank accept Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Does any bank accept Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-28T01:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ffe127830eb1a8f763f00e811b736772027d5192", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXqDfU_YZvXoAvUojI.hJbo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aneuk paloh kambuek", "published": "2018-05-28T01:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Does any bank accept Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: bstewart on Today at 05:38:20 PM Quote: from: ngacengan on Today at 05:04:25 PM I do not think bitcoin will be accepted at any bank because I think bitcoin has a very limited supply so it makes bitcoin unsuitable for banks, maybe banks will only use bitcoin technology.\nYeah I think blockchain tech will be advantageous for the banking industry but I have my doubts that banks would actually bother with bitcoin as a currency.\nI agree with you, chances are banks create their own digital currency to compete with bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T22:33:15.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aba5cacb1fd9f6b5706a75a729c3f540509ac157", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfRqNXZwtzgM9LvJDgg43xw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=74.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Legal", "title": "Are Bitcoin private property", "title_full": "Are Bitcoin private property", "published": "2018-05-28T01:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aba5cacb1fd9f6b5706a75a729c3f540509ac157", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfRqNXZwtzgM9LvJDgg43xw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JRDuran", "published": "2018-05-28T01:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Are Bitcoin private property", "text": "No. Bitcoin will never be a private property but only an asset to many.

According to CCN reports, the BTC coin actually uses the trademark of a UK based company.\nBitcoin is assumed to be public domain, hence no action had been taken. When a small enterprise was selling Bitcoin-themed shirts on Esty, the UK based company to whom the Bitcoin trademark actually belongs to has filed a lawsuit against it for trademark infringement.\nThe small business who traded Bitcoin shirts received a letter from the UK based company who claims to have the trademark of Bitcoin filed under their name in the UK. While not many know this, anyone in the UK who puts the word “Bitcoin” on any type of clothing or even a drink can be sued by the owner of the trademark of Bitcoin.\nThrough research, it has been found that a company called A.B.C. IPHoldings South West LLC successfully obtained the trademark for “Bitcoin” in 2017. It is registered under their name and using their trademark without their permission can lead to trademark infringement lawsuit.\nA.B.C. IPHoldings South West LLC has also applied for one other trademark, “Westworld,” due to its association with the HBO show “Westworld” of the same name. The application for this trademark has been published but has not been examined by the IP office.\nThe company was able to achieve the entitlement of the trademark and still stays unclear and mysterious as many companies have previously filed ownership of the trademark and have failed in different countries.\nIt is uncanny how the company managed to successfully trademark the term “Bitcoin”, despite the recognition BTC has gained over the past few years.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "a.b.c. ipholdings south west llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T08:23:21.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4747cf70f9465b1d547fb2327f0db293bb57c581", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYZG7J_puPbWWA7t0RRzu.Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "title_full": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-28T01:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4747cf70f9465b1d547fb2327f0db293bb57c581", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYZG7J_puPbWWA7t0RRzu.Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Moana", "published": "2018-05-28T01:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "text": "In the early days of the birth of Bitcoin, no one could have thought that Bitcoin is now worth more than 8,000 US dollars, so at that time they did not properly keep their wallets.

In total there will be 21 million Bitcoins after all mining is completed, which should occur around 2140 . The relatively low rate of Bitcoin mining from here on out will be conducive to Bitcoin’s price rising.\nA major benefit of Bitcoin is that its rate of production and total supply are hard-coded into its underlying program. This prevents inflationary money printing that is so often seen with fiat currencies. There have been recent examples of out of control money printing destroying fiat currencies and the economy of entire nations, such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela , where everyone who held their money in the national fiat currency lost their life savings.\nWith Bitcoin, such a crisis is not possible. In fact, part of the reason for Bitcoin’s long-term price rise is that the inflation rate from government’s printing fiat currency is far more than the inflation rate from Bitcoin mining, causing the price of Bitcoin to rise relative to fiat.\nA fixed amount of bitcoins are minted for each new block discovery which occurs on average every 10 minutes. At the beginning, there were 50 bitcoins minted per block, and these were rewarded to miners who maintain and secure the network by cryptographically hashing transactions and organizing them into blocks. After every 210,000 blocks, the block reward halves, and with the block time of 10 minutes this is roughly every 4 years. The block reward has halved twice since Bitcoin was launched, and currently sits at 12.5 Bitcoins .\nIt is estimated that the block reward will halve again in late May 2020 , at which point there will be 6.25 bitcoins minted per block. Block halvings will continue until there is 1 Satoshi (0. 1 Bitcoin) minted per block, the smallest possible unit of Bitcoin. This will occur at the 33rd halving, at block 6.72 million. At the 34th halving at block 6.93 million, the block reward will drop to zero since a Satoshi cannot be divided in the Bitcoin protocol. At that point, the total bitcoin supply will be 21 million and no more bitcoins will ever be created.\nMiners will continue to receive transaction fees even after the last Satoshi is mined, which will provide the needed incentive to maintain and secure the Bitcoin network. Considering the long-term rise in bitcoin’s price the transaction fees alone may be enough profit to maintain a healthy mining community by the time 2140 rolls around. Bitcoin may be compromised by attacks from quantum computers as early as 2027 though, so there is no way to know for sure if Bitcoin will still be used in 2140. A quantum cryptocurrency may very well succeed Bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency in the world out of necessity.\nEven though 21 million bitcoins will be mined in total, the amount in circulation is less due to people losing private keys, willfully sending Bitcoins to burn addresses like 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE, or sending Bitcoins to the wrong address. Theoretically, the supply of Bitcoin will decrease throughout time due to accidents, resulting in deflation.\nOnce again, quantum computers are a fly in the ointment when it comes to this if they arise like experts expect then they will be able to obtain private keys from public keys. If that happens all lost and burned bitcoins could be put back into circulation, but the cryptocurrency will be obsolete and worthless at that point anyways.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews Image Source: Pixabay", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "https://ambcrypto.com/87-5-bitcoins-btc-mined-2020-heres-why-matters/", "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://bitcoinnews.com/quantum-computing-will-drastically-alter-cryptocurrency-paradigm/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_in_Bolivarian_Venezuela"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:38:14.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bb543508b94fe93ceeea94db4c026d74d69a866", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XkRpdyQF9p1OKUFBJi2dvEfPtY.58YZxe6T5n12DRYeLPhSKtzTVx36y55ua6LEysB6Biqhwpl2jpNETNBMTt8WcVw7tTv0g0WamenL5FlxsfM3r.Op40tO63Pj5ksxqAic4zAWjXHXbXxkF7YAOcV5Swegr5WIU-", "site_full": "www.bitinvestors.club", "site": "bitinvestors.club", "site_section": "http://www.bitinvestors.club/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BitInvestors.Club | Invest Securely On BitCoins, Altcoins, Forex And More", "title": "Cryptocurrency Market Continues to Fall as Bitcoin Price Seeks Support at $6,700 - CCN", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency Market Continues to Fall as Bitcoin Price Seeks Support at $6,700 - CCN", "published": "2018-05-28T01:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bb543508b94fe93ceeea94db4c026d74d69a866", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XkRpdyQF9p1OKUFBJi2dvEfPtY.58YZxe6T5n12DRYeLPhSKtzTVx36y55ua6LEysB6Biqhwpl2jpNETNBMTt8WcVw7tTv0g0WamenL5FlxsfM3r.Op40tO63Pj5ksxqAic4zAWjXHXbXxkF7YAOcV5Swegr5WIU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Samuel Asingba (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-28T01:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency Market Continues to Fall as Bitcoin Price Seeks Support at $6,700 - CCN", "text": "On previous reports, CCN emphasized that the price of bitcoin will likely fall to the higher end of the $6,000 region in the short-term.

As such, although technical analysis points elsewhere, a fall below the $6,000 mark for bitcoin in the short-term is unlikely and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market is not expected to fall below the $300 billion region.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T09:26:14.043+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6307997ecc02b895a16018688f4e2d489b649338", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va7wTmaNGMh8VH5tcHaptvlk6EaEABGMN7UdU5vw5pUpDskkbz0iQKRXVEAYZL3JVurR0son3y6CfO", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "Bitcoin Stolen from Wallet, where do I stand?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Stolen from Wallet, where do I stand?", "published": "2018-05-28T01:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6307997ecc02b895a16018688f4e2d489b649338", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va7wTmaNGMh8VH5tcHaptvlk6EaEABGMN7UdU5vw5pUpDskkbz0iQKRXVEAYZL3JVurR0son3y6CfO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "inTheGrind", "published": "2018-05-28T01:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Stolen from Wallet, where do I stand?", "text": "I had 4 coins on an old laptop and went to move them to a new wallet only to find out they had all been removed and sent elsewhere in 2014.\nTo: 1KM6rLnwgD67wRdMx9aVLRf1gfoNyCyv7Q\nDebit: -3.93584800 BTC\nThis was to buy a house for me and my family and now my balance is at 0, i'm devastated but pretty sure there is nothing that can be done about this, just asking here in case I've overlooked something, any advice welcome, thanks", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T01:46:41.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22dd8c451dfd84d4db163174ec1481e83f836b6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGnpAHdDNcdXvFM1.7jSjtw2lLAJBHcxixKZC9P2A4uSXM07lp3.5GH4zqgM.lQly_XhrZwv1sVJeG38Dyuo4LZ0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "But ...

Everyone wanted to get a piece of these digital currencies that prices have soared to the ludicrously high prices that it still has right now. However, bitcoin mining is not that easy and it requires powerful computers in order to do so. Knowing how resourceful miners and hackers are, it no longer comes as a surprise that they were able to hack three computer servers at the University of Wisconsin to help them run their bitcoin mining malware. Cybersecurity is at an all-time high now that there have been various reports of miners hacking different sites and servers so they can anonymously mine these digital currencies while stealing computer power from these big brands and institutions.\nMining bitcoins require too much computer power in order for them to complete and verify a blockchain or transaction record and get bitcoins from it after. With the growing popularity of digital currencies such as bitcoin and other alternative currencies, we should all be wary of more hacking attacks in all forms especially when browsing the web as these miners will do what it takes to make use of your device in their mining operation. Servers are prime targets as they can provide higher computing power than individual devices and consequently help spread the malware especially if individual users connect to these servers on a daily basis.\nComputer servers at three UW System schools were accessed by bitcoin miners in December, a spokeswoman confirmed to News 3 on Thursday.\nSoftware to “mine” for the virtual currency bitcoin was found on computer servers at UW-Madison, UW-Stout and UW-Superior, according to UW System director of communications Stephanie Marquis.\nThe software requires powerful computers, and a nationwide alert was issued Jan. 5 that noted “numerous reports from university and research institutions” that attackers were attempting to run “bitcoin mining malware.”\n(Via: https://www.channel3000.com/news/bitcoin-mining-software-found-on-servers-at-uw-system-schools/684519802 )\nAnd it does not stop there even if servers remove this malware or botnets because they just look for another vulnerable server or device to hack and install more mining tools, especially on servers owned and ran by big organizations and businesses. And they’re not just mining bitcoins but relatively newer currencies such as zCash and Monero because they are more difficult to trace by law enforcement and thus more attractive to cybercriminals who makes use of these digital tenders the most than us average people.\nMecklenburg County government has been paralyzed by an unknown computer hacker after a county employee unknowingly opened an email attachment Monday that unleashed spyware and a worm into the county’s computer system.\nCounty manager Dena Diorio said Tuesday night that the hacker has essentially frozen the county’s electronic files. The hacker is seeking $23,000 for an encryption key that would release the files.\nThe hacker’s deadline: 1 p.m. Wednesday.\n(Via: http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article188227084.html )\nAny device or server is at risk now whether it is used privately or in public. Countless reports on computer and server hacking proliferate in the web these days and they do so through various ways such as phishing. If you don’t trust where an email came from, avoid opening them or risk introducing a headache-inducing malware that will make your device mine bitcoins in a frenzy from spyware and worms working its way around your computer system. You know some as ransomware where the hackers will demand a ransom often in the form of bitcoins like what the Mecklenburg County government went through after an employee opened a random email that unleashed the malware havoc that surely left everyone in the office at a standstill as their devices are now infected of these high-tech worms.\nInstances like this will often leave your device useless, hence requiring you professional services like https://www.harddriverecovery.org/server-recovery/ and https://www.harddriverecovery.org/clean_room.html in order to get your lost/stolen files back and establish a semblance of normalcy once more in your office or organization.\nThe following article Random Servers For Bitcoin Mining Found is courtesy of http://www.harddriverecovery.org\nFrom https://www.harddriverecovery.org/blog/random-servers-for-bitcoin-mining-found/\nhttps://harddriverecovrygroup.wordpress.com/2018/05/27/random-servers-for-bitcoin-mining-found/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T01:02:15.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0875dfd67bb9bb5b7aba690d074a3010dcc3cdbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlpmkFZbyEOzJnnmOyNKTn6zPIPZba5Ml8JyYVQ.yquW7ROu.Lm89rJVMt3NzcuCs-", "site_full": "www.herald.co.zw", "site": "herald.co.zw", "site_section": "http://www.herald.co.zw?cat=15&feed=rss2", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Business – The Herald", "title": "SA probes $80m bitcoin scam", "title_full": "SA probes $80m bitcoin scam", "published": "2018-05-28T01:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 43906, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0875dfd67bb9bb5b7aba690d074a3010dcc3cdbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlpmkFZbyEOzJnnmOyNKTn6zPIPZba5Ml8JyYVQ.yquW7ROu.Lm89rJVMt3NzcuCs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Herald", "published": "2018-05-28T01:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "SA probes $80m bitcoin scam", "text": "SA probes $80m bitcoin scam 28 May, 2018 - 00:05 0 Comments The Herald\nJOHANNESBURG. — South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of R1 billion ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialised, police said on Friday. The fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 percent per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent in a month, the police said.\nA search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended. The website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.” Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120 000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations. — Reuters.

His conclusion? Bitcoin is overpriced, informed investors are likely taking profits now and we may be about to enter a panic sell-off phase. #Bitcoin is overpriced, informed investors are likely taking profits now and we may be about to enter a panic sell-off phase Click To Tweet\nJoost van der Burgt began by analyzing the proposal that Bitcoin is a currency. However, because Bitcoin is not widely used for purchases at this, Bitcoin’s value cannot be determined by analyzing factors used to set exchange rates on currencies, including interest rates and currency output levels. “The only applicable monetary determinant is money supply,” writes Joost van der Burgt. “Bitcoin’s limited total supply arguably supported its high valuation.”\nLike gold, the amount of Bitcoin that will be issued is finite (though divisible). Even so, for the past few years, writes van der Burgt, Bitcoin production outpaced the production of gold by slightly more than 3-1. “Supply arguments,” therefore, writes van der Burgt, “cannot explain the recent surge of Bitcoin’s price against gold.”\nvan der Burgt then looked at purchasing power. Traditionally, two countries’ GDPs can be compared and used to establish exchange rates.\nBitcoin, however, is borderless, autonomous cryptocurrency generated by a sprawling network of computers spread across the globe. The coin cannot be associated with a single economic zone.\nAnother determinant that often influence’s a currency’s rate of exchange is confidence, writes van der Burgt. High profile hacks on Bitcoin on ramps (exchanges and hot wallets) and persistent news of government crackdowns have battered Bitcoin’s reputation as a secure investment.\nBitcoin transaction levels have also dropped precipitously since 2016, when Bitcoin traded at an average percentage of total volume of 11.7%). Today, it trades at 2.3% of total volume, says the van der Burgt. It appears that Bitcoiners are no longer spending it on frivolities like pizza; they are ‘hodl-ing’ (‘holding on for dear life’) and perhaps showing an exceptional degree of loyalty.\nNeither issuance, nor local GDP, nor confidence, nor transaction levels explain the relatively high valuation of Bitcoin, concludes van der Brugt.\nLow turnover rates then lead van der Burgt to evaluate Bitcoin as a security. “(T)he 2.3% daily turnover of Bitcoin is more aligned to turnover rates that characterize stock markets,” he wrote.\nHowever, because Bitcoin investing generates no dividends, interest payments or other payments along the way, van der Burgt suggests Bitcoin investors resemble VCs, who often buy into companies only to exit at buyouts.\n“Bitcoin’s terminal value, in this approach,” writes the researcher, “would be its expected future ‘monetary base.'”\nSnapchat investor Jeremy Liew once estimated that one Bitcoin will be worth $500,000 by 2030, writes the researcher. “This would put Bitcoin’s market value at about 1.5 times that of the world’s current total gold reserve, and on par with the current total M2 US dollar supply,” writes van der Burgt. “VCs have typically expected returns of 40-60%, but a one million dollar value on Bitcoin by 2020, as predicted by the wild software tycoon John McAfee, would bring an internal rate of return of 350% annually over the next three years. This would put Bitcoin’s market cap above that of the M2 US dollar supply in real terms,” writes van der Burgt. “Although nothing is impossible, one could wonder how realistic these assumptions really are.”\nvan der Burgt next considered whether Bitcoin should be regarded as a commodity, as an “object with use value.” The Chicago Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has defined Bitcoin as a commodity.\nThe most devoted Bitcoiners – everyone from Tone Vays to Tim Draper to Valery Vavilov- have all attributed Bitcoin’s value to its “censorship resistance” to state monetary interventions.\nVavilov, the 38-year-old CEO of Bitcoin mining conglomerate Bitfury told Forbes in February that he was deeply affected by the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\n“Money became paper. Patents became useless.”\nAn associate of mine from Russia said the entire contents of two of her bank accounts in Russia vanished during various incidents of “economic restructuring.”\nBitcoin has otherwise proven appealing to gold bugs seeking a hedge against negative economic outcomes.\nvan der Burgt writes that Bitcoin, like gold, might be considered a “hybrid” commodity for bearing the features of both a natural resource and a currency.\nBut the estimated $1800 production cost of mining a Bitcoin still indicates it’s overvalued, wrote van der Burgt.\n“Since there seem to be no convincing economic arguments for the recent developments of Bitcoin’s price, other than speculation, it begs the question whether the current Bitcoin frenzy constitutes a bubble,” he concludes.\nAlthough numerous amateur Bitcoin analysts last year on Youtube would show you a chart arguing we were only at the beginning of a bubble, this was because, van der Burgt argues, “‘The “greater fool’ theory plays out everywhere…The Euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments.” There were credible reports last year that people were refinancing their houses to buy Bitcoin.\nvan der Burgt characterizes the current phase as one of profit-taking, “in which well-informed investors cash out before the bubble really bursts.” Thereafter, says van der Burgt profit-taking will give way to “panic.”\nAlthough the price of Bitcoin nosedived in 2018 and has flatlined since, and though it may be truly ‘different’ than other items traded in human history, Bitcoin, says van der Burgt, is very likely, and for the time being, “overpriced.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvdburgt/", "https://twitter.com/share?text=%23Bitcoin+is+overpriced%2C+informed+investors+are+likely+taking+profits+now+and+we+may+be+about+to+enter+a+panic+sell-off+phase&url=https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2018/05/134009-researcher-at-san-francisco-federal-reserve-concludes-bitcoin-overpriced-possible-panic-sell-off-looming/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T01:20:40.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "796df24ebbae31b4632bd2ca477fd5a6daa31d86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYBwFfGHZRPMshsXUHL5wCPJvo9h.vuvAG0zvtcShqFqsEp2Lki3j206YgFs3rEIpBHDbupvUtkgkA--", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Personal Finance - Yahoo Finance", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors", "title_full": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors", "published": "2018-05-28T00:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.245, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PdI3F47uSQugI.UYlGDBFA--~B/aD00NDQ7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/bitcoin_magazine_673/ce51c06206094148c3fb89b938be394f", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "796df24ebbae31b4632bd2ca477fd5a6daa31d86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYBwFfGHZRPMshsXUHL5wCPJvo9h.vuvAG0zvtcShqFqsEp2Lki3j206YgFs3rEIpBHDbupvUtkgkA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Magazine", "published": "2018-05-28T00:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine’s Week in Review: Expanding Exchanges and Investors", "text": "Week in Review More Cryptocurrencies and exchanges were the focus this week. Coinbase is getting into the decentralized exchange business with its acquisition of Paradex, potentially opening up thousands of ERC-20 tokens to traders, depending on what the SEC ends up doing with regulations. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, continues work to implement a system to allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. And Germany’s Deutsche Boerse is looking at getting into the cryptocurrency game. Finally, the city of Memphis had its first blockchain conference, which included keynotes from FedEx and a hackathon for various market segments that included some great prizes.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, David Hollerith and Nick Marinoff\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here .\nCoinbase Takes Another Step Toward Trading ICO Tokens by Acquiring Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase just made an enormous play by acquiring decentralized relayer Paradex this week. Paradex bills itself as a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning no third party is involved in holding the funds. Instead, users can use the platform to trade ERC20 tokens directly wallet to wallet. Paradex is built on top of the 0x (pronounced “zero x”) protocol .\nRight now, Coinbase trades four coins: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC). Adding ERC20 tokens could significantly boost the number of digital assets it carries. Due to the ICO boom that has taken place over the last few years, thousands of different ICO tokens are now available.\nGerman Stock Exchange Eyes Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Frankfurt Stock Exchange parent company, Deutsche Boerse AG , appears to have begun work on technology that will allow them to offer their clients bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related products.\nSpeaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: \"We are deep at work with it.\"\nThe Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation As reported earlier by The New York Times (NYT) and Bitcoin Magazine , Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is developing an online trading platform that would allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future.\nWhat Happened At Graceland’s Ethereum Conference In its first year, EthMemphis distinguished its place on the blockchain conference circuit for displaying an under-the-hood glimpse at what actually moves this young industry forward, specifically on the Ethereum network. The focus was on blockchain topics and projects applied to supply chain, healthcare, tourism/hospitality, education and law.\nVerge Cryptocurrency Suffers Its Second Hack in Less Than Two Months While Verge executives are claiming a DDoS attack is responsible for the recent serious delays on their blockchain, it appears that the problem may be more serious than the company is implying. The attack lasted more than a few hours and has resulted in over 35 million XVGs (worth approximately $1.7 million) being stolen. The theft occurred when hackers exploited a specific glitch in Verge’s technology by mining multiple blocks virtually one second apart using the same algorithm. This was the same tactic used in a hack just last month that saw over 250,000 XVGs disappear into thin air, forcing Verge to prepare a subsequent hard fork .\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/verge-cryptocurrency-suffers-its-second-hack-less-two-months/", "https://paradex.io/&quot;", "https://0xproject.com/&quot;", "https://ethmemphis.com/about&quot;", "https://news.bitcoin.com/verge-is-forced-to-fork-after-suffering-a-51-attack/&quot;", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/05/22/hackers-verge-blockchain-steal-1-7m/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/heres-what-happened-gracelands-ethereum-conference/&quot;", "https://0xproject.com/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UtsIhie0aPts27dQdDrpUA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/bitcoin_magazine_673/ce51c06206094148c3fb89b938be394f", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/nyt-report-parent-company-nyse-planning-bitcoin-exchange/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/heres-what-happened-gracelands-ethereum-conference/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/verge-is-forced-to-fork-after-suffering-a-51-attack/", "https://ethmemphis.com/about", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/nyt-report-parent-company-nyse-planning-bitcoin-exchange/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/old-new-thing-ice-and-future-bitcoin-trading-and-regulation/", "http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/german-stock-exchange-eyes-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinbase-takes-another-step-toward-trading-ico-tokens-acquiring-paradex/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/coinbase-takes-another-step-toward-trading-ico-tokens-acquiring-paradex/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UtsIhie0aPts27dQdDrpUA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/bitcoin_magazine_673/ce51c06206094148c3fb89b938be394f);", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/&quot;", "http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/old-new-thing-ice-and-future-bitcoin-trading-and-regulation/&quot;", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/05/22/hackers-verge-blockchain-steal-1-7m/", "https://paradex.io/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/verge-cryptocurrency-suffers-its-second-hack-less-two-months/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/german-stock-exchange-eyes-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies/&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nick marinoff stay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy castor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david hollerith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "investors week", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paradex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paradex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T20:22:40.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5af3cb23679c5e799ad499a9e08424ed5ca6b7e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhEN9D.KYwlLcl6ug2AyU8C4AwK8dLebclk64fJYnNfd", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "The fall of Bitcoin", "title_full": "The fall of Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T00:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-fall-of-Bitcoin.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5af3cb23679c5e799ad499a9e08424ed5ca6b7e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhEN9D.KYwlLcl6ug2AyU8C4AwK8dLebclk64fJYnNfd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T00:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "The fall of Bitcoin", "text": "Published on May 27th, 2018 | by bitcoin 0 The fall of Bitcoin\nThe current sentiment is that bitcoin could fall to as low as an even $ 7,000 over the next few days.

Everyone wanted to get a piece of these digital currencies that prices have soared to the ludicrously high prices that it still has right now. However, bitcoin mining is not that easy and it requires powerful computers in order to do so. Knowing how resourceful miners and hackers are, it no longer comes as a surprise that they were able to hack three computer servers at the University of Wisconsin to help them run their bitcoin mining malware. Cybersecurity is at an all-time high now that there have been various reports of miners hacking different sites and servers so they can anonymously mine these digital currencies while stealing computer power from these big brands and institutions.\nMining bitcoins require too much computer power in order for them to complete and verify a blockchain or transaction record and get bitcoins from it after. With the growing popularity of digital currencies such as bitcoin and other alternative currencies, we should all be wary of more hacking attacks in all forms especially when browsing the web as these miners will do what it takes to make use of your device in their mining operation. Servers are prime targets as they can provide higher computing power than individual devices and consequently help spread the malware especially if individual users connect to these servers on a daily basis.\nComputer servers at three UW System schools were accessed by bitcoin miners in December, a spokeswoman confirmed to News 3 on Thursday.\nSoftware to “mine” for the virtual currency bitcoin was found on computer servers at UW-Madison, UW-Stout and UW-Superior, according to UW System director of communications Stephanie Marquis.\nThe software requires powerful computers, and a nationwide alert was issued Jan. 5 that noted “numerous reports from university and research institutions” that attackers were attempting to run “bitcoin mining malware.”\n(Via: https://www.channel3000.com/news/bitcoin-mining-software-found-on-servers-at-uw-system-schools/684519802 )\nAnd it does not stop there even if servers remove this malware or botnets because they just look for another vulnerable server or device to hack and install more mining tools, especially on servers owned and ran by big organizations and businesses. And they’re not just mining bitcoins but relatively newer currencies such as zCash and Monero because they are more difficult to trace by law enforcement and thus more attractive to cybercriminals who makes use of these digital tenders the most than us average people.\nMecklenburg County government has been paralyzed by an unknown computer hacker after a county employee unknowingly opened an email attachment Monday that unleashed spyware and a worm into the county’s computer system.\nCounty manager Dena Diorio said Tuesday night that the hacker has essentially frozen the county’s electronic files. The hacker is seeking $23,000 for an encryption key that would release the files.\nThe hacker’s deadline: 1 p.m. Wednesday.\n(Via: http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article188227084.html )\nAny device or server is at risk now whether it is used privately or in public. Countless reports on computer and server hacking proliferate in the web these days and they do so through various ways such as phishing. If you don’t trust where an email came from, avoid opening them or risk introducing a headache-inducing malware that will make your device mine bitcoins in a frenzy from spyware and worms working its way around your computer system.

They were the protectors of the national currencies that were moving between the central banks and the general public. And they were rewarded for this role – commissions that cover employees ‘wages and allowances and their shareholders’ dividends.\nIn recent years, the big banks have been playing another role: they are the guards of money flowing between the national currencies and Bitcoin.\nThat’s why big banks have the power to take off or demolish Bitcoin. Which one will they do? The answer depends on whether or not large banks develop their own blockchain technology and whether Bitcoin will be used as a substitute or as a supplement to national currencies.\nSome experts in the cryptosphere industry believe big banks can not stop Bitcoin even if they develop their own blockchain. Joe Onyero, CEO and founder of Bebuzee, is one of them.\n> 3 alternative cryptos that beat bitcoin in profits\n“Big banks can not drop Bitcoin, even if they create their own blockchain, which I guess will be centralized and this will run counter to its principles,” says Onyero. “Blockchain is considered a technological revolution because it is decentralized. That’s why banks have no choice but to adopt Bitcoin. And that will help the digital currency, since it will make it widely accepted. “", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T04:44:40.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13f555dd7e0ac35cc87e37b5c67c93b2362dd4a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRE8l6tXhiMVWJRaNFkcA40-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-28T00:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13f555dd7e0ac35cc87e37b5c67c93b2362dd4a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRE8l6tXhiMVWJRaNFkcA40-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sitwac", "published": "2018-05-28T00:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: audaciousbeing on May 20, 2018, 02:16:30 PM Quote: from: duongthutrang247 on May 20, 2018, 09:47:13 AM Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?\nWhenever a government announces to regulate bitcoin or cryptocurrency or whenever BTC price is in downfall, most of the media start to warn everyone not purchase or invest in Bitcoins.\nDo you see that, dont you?\nI would appreciate if you would have supported this your conclusion is facts based on historical happenings and the statistics that backs it up.

I started to wonder, should I buy like 10 bucks worth just in case??\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/segwit2x/\nWhat if there is a movement to actually come out with Segwit2x again?\nWe already know that it was manipulated to start with, they released the Segwit2x futures and you could buy on some exchanges. The price was something like 2,000 USD at the highest point and then crashed to 70 cents(why its even worth anything is odd, but hey Bitconnect is 74 cents lol).\nBut it got me thinking... Since we know that a lot of things are manipulated in the crypto space across a bunch of coins/projects, would it be THAT UNREASONABLE to think that blockstream/core is going to bring Segwit2x coin back to life?\nThink about how much profit they could make if they have been buying up these Segwit2x future tokens for 70 cents over the last few months. Think about how much money these exchanges would stand to gain from it(specifically the ones who use tether which we know is shady as all hell). If Segwit2x was announced tomorrow and they were able to use the same future token it would moon to thousands of dollars again(very likely).\nI theorize, that the reason we are seeing all this backlash against the laughable Lightning Network touted as a scaling solution + Liquid(which benefits blockstream/core/some other shady people) is because they are using those projects to create the backlash in order to create a want for Segwit2x again, and that Segwit2x coin is inevitable due to people seeing it as the \"only logical conclusion for the short term/mid term\". They have a growing backlash against LN and Liquid because it isn't doing enough in the here and now and people are naturally getting angry/switching to other coins, so I see it makes a lot of sense for them to just roll out Segwit2x sometime in the next 6 months (or at least announce it) and they are FINALLY going to make that fortune they have been trying to make this whole time. Everyone loves a good \"redemption\" story, and what better redemption and revenge against the \"heretics\" who split off into Bitcoin Cash than to have Segwit2x come out and make them all instant ten/hundred millionaires.\nI think they could pull this off, what say you all?\n submitted by /u/TruthForce\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/segwit2x/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T19:47:20.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d26fded10d3286f337d652fb6b3e77dc68f5985a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSV726y8j_xeana6wz3Qct7fyuv7XSdq38y9Wsh_.Wg3OuJlMncc22OlRogTmh8IBrQ--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "How a Cryptocurrency Investor Lost $60 Million in Bitcoin and Never Got it Back", "title_full": "How a Cryptocurrency Investor Lost $60 Million in Bitcoin and Never Got it Back", "published": "2018-05-28T00:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d26fded10d3286f337d652fb6b3e77dc68f5985a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSV726y8j_xeana6wz3Qct7fyuv7XSdq38y9Wsh_.Wg3OuJlMncc22OlRogTmh8IBrQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-28T00:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "How a Cryptocurrency Investor Lost $60 Million in Bitcoin and Never Got it Back", "text": "How a Cryptocurrency Investor Lost $60 Million in Bitcoin and Never Got it Back\nJoseph Young\nJames Howells, a 32-year-old IT specialist who recently switched to a full-time cryptocurrency investor, told New York Post that he had lost more than $60 million in bitcoin in 2009 and was never able to retrieve it. 7,500 BTC In 2009, the debut year of BTC during which the price of BTC was below $1\nThe post How a Cryptocurrency Investor Lost $60 Million in Bitcoin and Never Got it Back appeared first on CCN\ncryptocoinsnews ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T00:27:46.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27962ad002ab32a72caad8405c13dd8bb6082293", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSLyX66JvMK7DdQn4alrQ4s-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Facebook Is Banning Ads for Bitcoin and ICOs", "title_full": "Facebook Is Banning Ads for Bitcoin and ICOs", "published": "2018-05-28T00:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27962ad002ab32a72caad8405c13dd8bb6082293", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSLyX66JvMK7DdQn4alrQ4s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "goribert", "published": "2018-05-28T00:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Facebook Is Banning Ads for Bitcoin and ICOs", "text": "Quote: from: btcgolong on January 31, 2018, 02:07:23 AM\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/facebook-banning-advertisements-bitcoin-icos/\n\"Social media giant Facebook has unveiled a new policy that bans advertisements involving bitcoin and initial coin offerings, among others...\"\nIt seems to me an appropriate measure, since the type of misleading advertising that has prevailed regarding investment options that often lead to blatant frauds does nothing but damage the image of Facebook and cryptocurrencies in general.

May 28, 2018\nThe block reward for Bitcoin will halve next in about two years from the time of publishing this article. The estimated time for the next half of the reward is around 732 days, but it is relevant now for a few reasons.\nThe current bear market offers opportunities for investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, as it is currently trading at a low since the past week. It has been plagued by sell-offs and FUD, along with a general bearish trend. Market sentiment is also low after the CFTC and US Justice Department declared the existence of a probe into cryptomarkets for fraudulent practices.\nAs the price is currently low, interest by institutional investors is on a high after a successful Consensus conference and general adaptive behavior. News such as Goldman Sachs beginning a cryptocurrency trading desk and JPMorgan’s high-level reshuffling to focus on cryptocurrency may as well be the tip of the adoption iceberg.\nAs the 17 millionth coin was mined sometime last month, a reality check descended on the market that the amount of Bitcoin left in existence is limited. Even as digital assets tend towards digital abundance, Satoshi’s blockchain allows for real digital scarcity with real-world parallels. The 21 millionth coin will be mined in around 2140, approximately. The time, electricity, and computing power required to mine new coins is constantly increasing, with Murphy’s law being barely able to keep up.\nAs the block reward is halved every 210,000 blocks, it constantly decreases the rate at which it is possible to create new Bitcoin tokens. The new landmark on ETA, 28th May 2020, will decrease the reward from the current 12.5 coins to 6.25 coins. The total coins mined before the next halving of the block reward will be 18,375,000, which marks 87.5% of the possible 21 million Bitcoin tokens.\nThis will then exponentially reduce the speed at which new Bitcoin come into existence, spiking up demand for the coin due to reduced supply. Analysts predict that this bear market will be the last one before 2020.\nCrypto analyst Trevor Wade says:\n“This bear market is the last chance for investors to buy into Bitcoin before the price goes up to $10000+. Reduced block rewards will result in supply cutting off and demand going up, which will cause an exponential spike. Regulators and institutional investors are moving in in a safe way, allowing for large-scale adoption of financial system disruptors.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jpmorgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T08:23:22.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5ec0ee3c31637b80abc22a71622af7539cecdff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGoFt2TwNgh79Pvd9_uTWv.3i000LGb0GMkHLFkGbbJMYDAOzAB1DnVA8P8_ZdpdOPLC4IYRSEiE6QBneSeHGcEcKDkPyYrsSjw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

Recently, British economic historian and author Niall Ferguson told the Bank of England that Bitcoin is the financial system of the future.\nAlso Read: This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee's Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car\nThe Future of Finance Niall Ferguson is a noted historian, commentator, and the author of fifteen books including The Ascent of Money and The House of Rothschild. On Tuesday he has given a seminar to the Bank of England, talking about the 2008 financial crisis and the reactions to it to this day. In his conclusion of the subject, he mentioned that bitcoin is part of the major challenges ahead for the current fiat-based system.\nFerguson said: \"The financial system of today is not fundamentally that different than the financial system of the pre-crisis period, except that big banks are better capitalized. I don't think much else is really different. The novelties, the things that will really matter ten years hence are still relatively small in scale. Whether its bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally or the massive revolution in online payments that is being achieved by the big Chinese tech companies, that's the financial system of the future, and it is still small enough not to be systemically important in 2018. In short, I am left feeling we are only a matter of time before the next crisis.\"\nBombarded by ICOs The above isn't such a surprising statement coming from Ferguson. Back in December 2017 he wrote : \"At some point, no doubt, regulatory changes in the US will deflate the current bitcoin bubble. But they will not halt, much less undo, this financial revolution. Think about it this way. The maximum number of bitcoins that can be created is 21m. The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, is 36m. Their total wealth is $128.7 trillion. If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as bitcoin, the price would be not $15,000 but north of $60,000. If they raised that to 5%, the right price for bitcoin would be above $300,000. I am not saying this is certain to happen. I'm just saying my teenage son thinks it could.\"\nSince then he has also been exposed to more sides of the cryptocurrency market, such as the endless flood of ICO offers. \"I wish I had a bitcoin for every phony white paper I've been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down,\" Ferguson reportedly said last week. \"When there's no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.\"\nFerguson isn't the only noted academic figure that looked at how bitcoin fits economic history recently. Last Monday, Professor Robert Shiller, who received the 2013 Nobel prize in economics and is famous for the Case-Shiller Index, published an article talking about the way the allure of bitcoin fits enthusiasm around previous attempts to reinvent money.\nWhat role in the economy do you see Bitcoin fulfills in ten years from now?
