It filed an indictment, alleging that Hilmi Git had managed to commit more than 20,000 fraudulent transactions using Israeli credit cards, laundering the money through the Bitcoin network.\n1,071 BTC Seized by Israeli Police Halmi Git, a resident of Hebron, has been accused of multiple offenses of credit card fraud, providing means for committing a crime, carrying out fraudulent trade activity, and laundering the proceeds through Bitcoin. It is reported that the Git managed to accumulate a total of 1,071 Bitcoin over the course of his crimes.\nAt press time, Bitcoin is trading at $7,342.21, putting the total value of Git's fraud at a little over $7.8 million.\nWeb of Crime According to the indictment, Git ran a network of forums and websites used to provide information on how to commit a range of computer offenses. One such forum provided is reported to have provided stolen credit card information. While entry to the forum was free, members could purchase a \"VIP\" membership to receive \"fresh\" credit card data. Git also published different guides in violation with the country's Computers and Money Laundering Law.\nBut wait… there's more! Reportedly, Git also ran another scam, fraudulently selling mobile phones – often members of his own forums – at substantially reduced prices.\nThe indictment describes a scheme in which Git would request that the customer transfer his money for the phone, after which point he would proceed to block the customer from the forum without ever actually having sent the customer their phone. He would go on to publish a positive feedback message on behalf of the deceived customer, expressing gratitude for the cheaper mobile phone.\nAll Payments Made in Bitcoin\nThe Israeli State Prosecutor's Office claims that Git had requested all the payments to be made in Bitcoin . As such, he has reportedly managed to accumulate more than 1,071 Bitcoin between 2008 and 2018.\nThe Bitcoin wallet of the accused has been seized and the funds in it are to be confiscated if and when he is found guilty of his crimes.\nThe prosecution also seeks an extension of Git's confinement until the end of the trial due to potential flight risk as well as concerns that having access to the internet will allow Git to \"continue carrying out the criminal enterprise he established over the past decade.\" Given the defendant's thoughts on his actions, the concern seems more than warranted.\nShowing no remorse whatsoever, Git was quoted as saying:\nWe are thieves, from wherever we can take money – we'll take it, no matter where – from Israel, The US or even the moon – we will reach it and use it.\nWhat do you think will happen to those 1,071 Bitcoin if Git is found guilty?

There is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $7,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $7,200 and $7,000 support levels to avoid a major downside break. Bitcoin price is trading well below the $7,600 pivot level against the US Dollar. If BTC/USD breaks the $7,000-7,200 support, there could be heavy declines.\nBitcoin Price Decline This past week, there were heavy losses from the $8,500 swing high in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and broke two important support levels at $8,150 and $7,900. The decline was such that the price even broke the $7,600 pivot level. It traded close to the $7,000 level and found support near $7,200. A low was formed at $7,220 before the price started consolidating in a range.\nIt traded a few points above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,220 low. However, buyers failed to gain momentum above the $7,600 pivot level. Therefore, the price is in a downtrend below $7,600. More importantly, there is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $7,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. A break above the channel resistance and $7,650 is needed for an upside push . Above $7,650, the next hurdle for buyers sits around the $7,950 and $8,000 levels.\nLooking at the chart , the price is struggling to recover above $7,600. On the downside, there is a crucial support at $7,200. A break below the stated support at $7,200 could open the doors for more declines below the $7,000 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is struggling to gain pace in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently just above the 30 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,200\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,600\nThe post Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis: Can BTC/USD Hold $7K? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T10:04:38.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68bd15703496505cd9482b7c9e8327aa584a1e67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWn9azwJ2uQ0InD7Ln9_qvMj9qysBHBQOr47bIuA12gKHDEdo1zj6vKpwtZF44xSStXSZQtuYXYlB76WXnkQxw42engtG8HrP5S.L9qKbXCbUa.52CqEf78rt4FxxrgveVzF9tHip7gq1FXfDMJPZu", "site_full": "jamieclawhorn.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://jamieclawhorn.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Why the Centrica share price still looks a far safer bet than bitcoin – Jamie Lawhorn's Blog", "title": "Why the Centrica share price still looks a far safer bet than bitcoin", "title_full": "Why the Centrica share price still looks a far safer bet than bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T09:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68bd15703496505cd9482b7c9e8327aa584a1e67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWn9azwJ2uQ0InD7Ln9_qvMj9qysBHBQOr47bIuA12gKHDEdo1zj6vKpwtZF44xSStXSZQtuYXYlB76WXnkQxw42engtG8HrP5S.L9qKbXCbUa.52CqEf78rt4FxxrgveVzF9tHip7gq1FXfDMJPZu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Lawhorn", "published": "2018-05-27T09:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why the Centrica share price still looks a far safer bet than bitcoin", "text": "\nHaving fallen by 28% in the last year, the performance of shares in Centrica (LSE: CNA) has clearly been hugely disappointing. The company has experienced challenges in parts of its business, while regulatory risk has caused investor sentiment to weaken.\nHowever, the company’s recent update suggested that it may be in the process of delivering improved performance . With a turnaround strategy in place, it could offer a better investment opportunity than the perennially volatile virtual currency bitcoin.\nImproving outlook Centrica’s recent trading update stated that performance in the year to date has been in line with expectations. Encouragingly, it has seen the rate of net consumer customer account losses fall in recent months. This is despite high levels of competition remaining in its core markets. And with it delivering growth in its Connected Home and Distributed Energy & Power businesses, it remains on track to deliver on its 2018 growth targets.\nFurthermore, the company is set to deliver its next phase of cost efficiency. It anticipates that efficiency savings of £200m will be delivered in the current year as part of the company’s increased £1.25bn per annum cost efficiency programme. And with its bottom line forecast to rise by 5% in the current year, it could become a turnaround opportunity over the medium term.\nIncome potential Of course, one of Centrica’s major attractions for investors is its dividend yield. In the current year it is expected to be 8.1%, which is more than three times the current rate of inflation. Although dividends per share are expected to see a modest fall in 2019, the stock is still expected to deliver an income return of 7.7% next year. And with dividends due to be covered 1.2 times by profit this year, the sustainability of its shareholder payouts may be higher than the market currently anticipates.\nSince Centrica trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 12, it seems to offer good value for money. Certainly, the potential for regulatory change and the uncertainty of its updated strategy delivery could mean that it is more volatile than it has been in the past. But its investment outlook still appears to be promising.\nVolatile outlook In terms of its risk/reward ratio, Centrica appears to offer greater appeal than bitcoin. The virtual currency has experienced a hugely volatile period in recent months which has seen its value more than halve since the latter part of 2017. And while there is the potential for it to make strong gains in a short period of time, there is also an equal chance of further declines over the medium term.\nWith a lack of income prospects and uncertainty regarding the potential for new regulation, bitcoin appears to be a speculative opportunity, rather than a possible investment for the long term. Due to the upside potential on offer in shares such as Centrica and a number of its FTSE 100 peers, there should be superior risk/reward ratios on offer outside of the cryptocurrency space at the present time.\nYou Really Could Make A Million\nOf course, picking the right shares and the strategy to be successful in the stock market isn’t easy. But you can get ahead of the herd by reading the Motley Fool’s FREE guide, “10 Steps To Making A Million In The Market” .\nThe Motley Fool’s experts show how a seven-figure-sum stock portfolio is within the reach of many ordinary investors in this straightforward step-by-step guide.

The company has experienced challenges in parts of its business, while regulatory risk has caused investor sentiment to weaken.\nHowever, the company’s recent update suggested that it may be in the process of delivering improved performance . With a turnaround strategy in place, it could offer a better investment opportunity than the perennially volatile virtual currency bitcoin. Improving outlook\nCentrica’s recent trading update stated that performance in the year to date has been in line with expectations. Encouragingly, it has seen the rate of net consumer customer account losses fall in recent months. This is despite high levels of competition remaining in its core markets. And with it delivering growth in its Connected Home and Distributed Energy & Power businesses, it remains on track to deliver on its 2018 growth targets.\nFurthermore, the company is set to deliver its next phase of cost efficiency. It anticipates that efficiency savings of £200m will be delivered in the current year as part of the company’s increased £1.25bn per annum cost efficiency programme. And with its bottom line forecast to rise by 5% in the current year, it could become a turnaround opportunity over the medium term. Income potential\nOf course, one of Centrica’s major attractions for investors is its dividend yield. In the current year it is expected to be 8.1%, which is more than three times the current rate of inflation. Although dividends per share are expected to see a modest fall in 2019, the stock is still expected to deliver an income return of 7.7% next year. And with dividends due to be covered 1.2 times by profit this year, the sustainability of its shareholder payouts may be higher than the market currently anticipates.\nSince Centrica trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 12, it seems to offer good value for money. Certainly, the potential for regulatory change and the uncertainty of its updated strategy delivery could mean that it is more volatile than it has been in the past. But its investment outlook still appears to be promising. Volatile outlook\nIn terms of its risk/reward ratio, Centrica appears to offer greater appeal than bitcoin. The virtual currency has experienced a hugely volatile period in recent months which has seen its value more than halve since the latter part of 2017. And while there is the potential for it to make strong gains in a short period of time, there is also an equal chance of further declines over the medium term.\nWith a lack of income prospects and uncertainty regarding the potential for new regulation, bitcoin appears to be a speculative opportunity, rather than a possible investment for the long term. Due to the upside potential on offer in shares such as Centrica and a number of its FTSE 100 peers, there should be superior risk/reward ratios on offer outside of the cryptocurrency space at the present time.\nYou Really Could Make A Million\nOf course, picking the right shares and the strategy to be successful in the stock market isn't easy.

I&s;ve connected the lows from 2015 and 2016 to indicate the uptrend — it&s;s that red dotted line below the prices.\n&l;!–nextpage–&g;\n&l;img class=&q;size-full wp-image-3483&q; src=&q;http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnnavin/files/2018/05/Bitcoin-monthly-5-25-18-1.jpg?width=960&q; alt=&q;&q; data-height=&q;928&q; data-width=&q;1240&q;&g; NYSE Bitcoin Index monthly chart.\nA close below that line might suggest that the long-term uptrend has ended. But, that&s;s a long way from here. Note that the &q;relative strength&q; indicator above the chart has come out of its&a;nbsp; &q;overbought&q; level for the first time since the index was created.\nHere&s;s the last chart — it&s;s old-school point and figure work designed to give us a close-up view of the price action. The x&s;s are for upward periods and the o&s;s are for downward periods.\n&l;img class=&q;size-full wp-image-3479&q; src=&q;http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnnavin/files/2018/05/Bitcoin-NYSE-point-and-figure-chart.-5-25-18.jpg?width=960&q; alt=&q;&q; data-height=&q;4448&q; data-width=&q;1000&q;&g; NYSE Bitcoin index, point and figure chart.\nThe knowledge we gain here is the potential support level indicated by 2 places on the chart where the previous downward movement stopped: that&s;s the 6600 index level. A close below that would suggest that the downtrend remains in place, according to the point and figure school.\nIt&s;s worthwhile to consider charts like these because it&s;s one way of removing the influence of just reading the news about bitcoin — or attempting to analyze it from a fundamental standpoint. The only thing that matters here is price which gives us trend and support and resistance levels to watch.\nIf you&s;re looking for fundamental research on bitcoin, crypto currencies and block chain, you might want to read the recent work of Forbes contributor Roger Aitkin &l;a href=&q;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2018/05/13/bitcoin-hype-aside-blockchain-for-the-public-good-comes-to-the-rescue/#5b7409154edc&q;&g;right here&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;or go to the Forbes &q;topic&q; page on the subject &l;a href=&q;http://topics.forbes.com/topic/46/How+To+Invest+In+Bitcoin/?utm_campaign=2253N7N&a;amp;utm_term=forbes%20bitcoin&a;amp;utm_medium=b&a;amp;g_ti=kwd-80814162150483:loc-190&a;amp;g_de=c&a;amp;g_ci=301114335&a;amp;g_ai=1293025768260878&a;amp;utm_content=1&a;amp;k=investing%20bitcoin&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;right here.&l;/a&g;\nI do not have positions in these investments.

Massive number-crunching computer facilities for mining Bitcoin have popped up in parts of the planet where renewable electricity comes especially cheap. And now it looks like this mining is starting to siphon green energy away from everybody else.\nBitcoin is the best known of countless “cryptocurrencies,” which promise direct, secure financial transactions that don’t require any banks. Since its birth nearly ten years ago, the virtual currency has exploded in popularity. Bitcoin used to be popular for money laundering and drug deals ; now it’s accepted at Subway restaurants .\nTo maintain security as its network grows, the math problems that Bitcoin “miners” must solve are getting ever more difficult. That requires a constant supply of additional computing power, which requires a constant supply of additional electricity. One Bitcoin transaction uses as much energy as a single U.S. household consumes in three weeks, and there are nearly 200,000 transactions around the world every day. In total, Bitcoin now consumes about as much energy as Portugal.\nAnd it’s about to get much, much worse than that. A couple of months ago, I wrote that Bitcoin mining’s rapid growth was unsustainable, because the electricity required to feed it would overtake the supply. In Iceland, that’s starting to happen.\n“We are spending tens or maybe hundreds of megawatts on producing something that has no tangible existence and no real use for humans outside the realm of financial speculation,”Smári McCarthy, an Icelandic member of parliament recently told the Associated Press . “That can’t be good.”\nIceland is home to one of the planet’s best natural sources of carbon-free power, thanks to its location: smack atop a hydropower-geothermal geographical oddity.\nCorporate giants have taken notice. About 10 years ago, Alcoa, the world’s largest aluminum company, built Iceland’s largest hydroelectricity dam in the middle of one of Europe’s largest wildernesses to capture runoff from Europe’s largest glacier. Smelting aluminum is a particularly energy intensive endeavor, and Iceland’s vast renewable energy resources makes its electricity prices among the lowest in the world.\nIt’s easy to argue that converting unspoiled wilderness into aluminum is a bad idea . But what about when that power is used to produce a virtual currency? At the end of the day, at least aluminum has real-world value.\nSome leading experts believe that the virtual currency could grow in value tenfold by the end of the year — which would, astonishingly, mark a slowdown in growth after its nearly 1,400 percent rise last year.\nSpeculative bubbles bring out the gamblers. And the promise of turning big payoffs from buying Bitcoin into real-world cash has created a technological arms race among currency miners, a shortage of computers for scientists , and that, in sum, is worse for the environment than gold mining . Worst of all, it’s squandering the world’s renewable energy resources, and not just in Iceland.\nAfter a crackdown on Bitcoin miners in China , they’re hunting for new homes in places where green energy is plentiful and cheap, such as rural Washington state , Paraguay, and Eastern Europe . In hydropower-heavy Quebec, utilities are turning down dozens of requests per day from cryptocurrency miners to set up shop, because there just isn’t enough electricity to go around.\nTo be sure, there are Bitcoin enthusiasts who argue that this cryptocurrency-imposed shortage of renewable energy could turn out to be a good thing , spurring further growth in renewables at a time when its sorely needed. There’s a small solar-powered crypto-mining operation already up and running in sunny Western Australia, and Europe’s largest utility is preparing plans to cater specifically to miners seeking cheap renewable energy. But the reality is that more dams, wind turbines, and geothermal plants simply can’t be built fast enough to keep up.\nThis time next year, Bitcoin’s worldwide operations are expected to consume about as much electricity as Sweden , more than twice what they consume today. And in the meantime, our hopes of a low carbon economy are slipping further away.

carried out by the cyber department of the State Attorney’s Office. It filed an indictment, alleging that Hilmi Git had managed to commit more than 20,000 fraudulent transactions using Israeli credit cards, laundering the money through the Bitcoin network. 1,071 BTC Seized by Israeli Police\nHalmi Git, a resident of Hebron, has been accused of multiple offenses of credit card fraud, providing means for committing a crime, carrying out fraudulent trade activity, and laundering the proceeds through Bitcoin. It is reported that the Git managed to accumulate a total of 1,071 Bitcoin over the course of his crimes.\nAt press time, Bitcoin is trading at $7,342.21, putting the total value of Git’s fraud at a little over $7.8 million. Web of Crime\nAccording to the indictment, Git ran a network of forums and websites used to provide information on how to commit a range of computer offenses. One such forum provided is reported to have provided stolen credit card information. While entry to the forum was free, members could purchase a “VIP” membership to receive “fresh” credit card data. Git also published different guides in violation with the country’s Computers and Money Laundering Law.\nBut wait… there’s more! Reportedly, Git also ran another scam, fraudulently selling mobile phones – often members of his own forums – at substantially reduced prices.\nThe indictment describes a scheme in which Git would request that the customer transfer his money for the phone, after which point he would proceed to block the customer from the forum without ever actually having sent the customer their phone. He would go on to publish a positive feedback message on behalf of the deceived customer, expressing gratitude for the cheaper mobile phone. All Payments Made in Bitcoin\nThe Israeli State Prosecutor’s Office claims that Git had requested all the payments to be made in Bitcoin . As such, he has reportedly managed to accumulate more than 1,071 Bitcoin between 2008 and 2018.\nThe Bitcoin wallet of the accused has been seized and the funds in it are to be confiscated if and when he is found guilty of his crimes.\nThe prosecution also seeks an extension of Git’s confinement until the end of the trial due to potential flight risk as well as concerns that having access to the internet will allow Git to “continue carrying out the criminal enterprise he established over the past decade.” Given the defendant’s thoughts on his actions, the concern seems more than warranted.\nShowing no remorse whatsoever, Git was quoted as saying:\nWe are thieves, from wherever we can take money – we’ll take it, no matter where – from Israel, The US or even the moon – we will reach it and use it.\nWhat do you think will happen to those 1,071 Bitcoin if Git is found guilty?

About to Buy Bitcoin? Look at These 3 Companies First\nBitcoin was a joyride for early investors, as the cryptocurrency surged from less than $100 earlier in the decade to more than $19,000 last December. However, the digital coin has fallen to around $7,500 since then as the hype and speculation around it seem to have peaked. At the same time, Google searches for “bitcoin” have also dropped sharply since December.\nWhile crypto fans may be unfazed, the majority of the market seems to have moved on. If you’re considering buying bitcoin for the high upside potential it exhibited last year, you may be better off with this group of stocks, which all have the potential to deliver big returns. Keep reading to see why our panel of Motley Fool investors recommendPayPal(NASDAQ:PYPL),Yelp(NYSE:YELP), and Trivago(NASDAQ:TRVG).\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe pioneer in online payments\nLeo Sun (PayPal): PayPal, which was spun off of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015, popularized digital payments long before bitcoin became relevant. Unlike its industry peer Square (NYSE:SQ), PayPal refuses to add bitcoin transactions to its platform, saying that volatile prices make bitcoin unsuitable for payments.\nPayPal’s core business is rapidly growing. It’s posted double-digit sales growth every quarter since its spinoff, and analysts expect revenue to rise 17% this year (despite eBay’s decision to gradually part ways with PayPal by 2023). Its earnings are expected to rise 23% this year.\nLast quarter, PayPal’s revenue rose 24% annually, while its total payments volume (TPV) rose 27% to $132 billion on a constant currency basis — supported by 30% growth in merchant services TPV, 50% growth in peer-to-peer payments (thanks to its subsidiary Venmo), and 52% growth in mobile payment volumes.\nIts total number of transactions climbed 25% to 2.2 billion, as its total number of transactions per active account rose 8% to 34.7 over the past 12 months. Its new active accounts rose 35% annually. Those robust growth figures indicate that PayPal continues to gain steam as an international digital payments platform — which is now available in 202 countries and 25 currencies. PayPal also recently acquired Square’s rival iZettle for $2.2 billion to expand its reach into mobile point-of-sale systems.\nPayPal’s stock isn’t cheap at 35 times this year’s earnings. But it’s arguably a smarter play on a cashless and cardless future than bitcoin.\nTake advantage of Yelp’s pullback\nSteve Symington (Yelp): Bitcoin investors are all too familiar with unexpected pullbacks. So if you’re considering buying some of the popular cryptocurrency, you might appreciate taking a look at Yelp instead. When Yelp announced strong quarterly resultsearlier this month — posting higher-than-expected revenue and narrowing its per-share losses — it seemed strange at first to see shares of the local business-review website fall almost 8% in response.\nBut more important to Wall Street was the underlying source of that quarterly beat. While Yelp’s impressive results were driven by accelerating advertising revenue growth — ad sales climbed 20% year over year to $214 million, comprising the vast majority of its total revenue — that acceleration came as a result of the company’s adoption of non-term advertising contracts. Put simply, Wall Street wants to see whether newer advertisers will stick around, especially those that are trying Yelp for the first time precisely because of those more flexible contracts.\nTo be fair, Yelp’s co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman admitted during this quarter’s call that the company is going “through this change with a bit of caution about what we may see in the coming months.” But Yelp management also insisted the move is a concerted effort, preceded by nearly two years of testing, followed by a broader ramp up in the new contracts that began in the third quarter of 2017.\nTo that end, Yelp was comfortable enough with the sustainability of this shift to modestly increase its full-year guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Alas, the market would have none of it.\nBut if Yelp can prove to investors that its accelerated ad growth is good for more than just a single quarter’s outperformance, I think the stock will soar.\nA promising turnaround candidate\nJeremy Bowman (Trivago):Like bitcoin, Trivago shares have also tumbled in recent months. After the stock surged following its IPO in December 2016 as it was spun off fromExpedia, it’s now given up more than 80% since last July.\nThat decline has come largely due to Booking Holdings’ decision to scale back on advertising on the platform, focusing on profitability rather than market share, which had the effect of making Trivago’s revenue decline 3% year over year in the first quarter as comps were unfavorable, with Booking still on the platform a year ago.\nThe hotel-booking specialist is now projecting flat revenue for the year. However, the company should return to growth as it laps the issues with Booking Holdings, and it expects revenue to increase in the second half of the year.\nThe online travel industry is still growing steadily, and Allied Market Research projects it will grow at a compound annual rate of 11.1% from 2016 to 2022. Trivago’s exclusive focus on hotels should give it an advantage over more-diversified platforms, and as consumer awareness of the platform improves, it should outgrow the overall industry.\nAt this point, the stock looks oversold, as the current weakness is temporary. The stock could easily double from here once revenue growth accelerates again. This entry was posted in stocks on by admin .

The businessman from Jamia Nagar told police that he was introduced to the firm by a person he met at a bank, who claimed to be a representative of the MNC. A case was registered at Vasant Vihar police station after the victim’s complaint. The man told police that he met the fraudster in 2017, who said that he was working at an exchange firm dealing in crypto-currency . “He later called me and started offering deals for buying bitcoins. I bought one for Rs 5.4 lakh. As soon as I paid the money, I received a message on my phone updating me about the purchase. I sold them a month later for Rs 6 lakh,” the businessman said. He was again asked to make a similar purchase, this time being told that he could earn a 50% profit if he holds the bitcoin for at least three months. The victim agreed and sold it for Rs 9.75 lakh after buying it for Rs 6.5 lakh. Convinced of the legitimacy of the trade, he was then given a bigger offer. “They told me that there will be a huge surge in the prices of bitcoins after 20 days and I can almost double my profit. They offered me a discount of 5% if I bought 10 bitcoins worth approximately Rs 91 lakh,” the businessman said. The victim borrowed the amount from his family and friends and said he would return the money after 20 days in January 2018. He went to the company’s office with the amount but was told that the bitcoins would be transferred to his wallet after the money was transferred to China. The crypto-currency would then be sent from Dubai after getting a confirmation on the money transfer. But later, the fraudster fled cheating the man.

The estimated time for the next half of the reward is around 732 days, but it is relevant now for a few reasons.\nThe current bear market offers opportunities for investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, as it is currently trading at a low since the past week. It has been plagued by sell-offs and FUD, along with a general bearish trend. Market sentiment is also low after the CFTC and US Justice Department declared the existence of a probe into cryptomarkets for fraudulent practices.\nAs the price is currently low, interest by institutional investors is on a high after a successful Consensus conference and general adaptive behavior. News such as Goldman Sachs beginning a cryptocurrency trading desk and JPMorgan’s high-level reshuffling to focus on cryptocurrency may as well be the tip of the adoption iceberg.\nAs the 17 millionth coin was mined sometime last month, a reality check descended on the market that the amount of Bitcoin left in existence is limited. Even as digital assets tend towards digital abundance, Satoshi’s blockchain allows for real digital scarcity with real-world parallels. The 21 millionth coin will be mined in around 2140, approximately. The time, electricity, and computing power required to mine new coins is constantly increasing, with Murphy’s law being barely able to keep up.\nAs the block reward is halved every 210,000 blocks, it constantly decreases the rate at which it is possible to create new Bitcoin tokens. The new landmark on ETA, 28th May 2020, will decrease the reward from the current 12.5 coins to 6.25 coins. The total coins mined before the next halving of the block reward will be 18,375,000, which marks 87.5% of the possible 21 million Bitcoin tokens.\nThis will then exponentially reduce the speed at which new Bitcoin come into existence, spiking up demand for the coin due to reduced supply. Analysts predict that this bear market will be the last one before 2020.\nCrypto analyst Trevor Wade says:\n“This bear market is the last chance for investors to buy into Bitcoin before the price goes up to $10000+. Reduced block rewards will result in supply cutting off and demand going up, which will cause an exponential spike. Regulators and institutional investors are moving in in a safe way, allowing for large-scale adoption of financial system disruptors.”\nAuthor Anirudh VK May 27, 2018\nPolsted by David Ogden Entrepreneur\nAlan Zibluk Markethive Founding Member bitclubnetwork bitcoin mining Post navigation Hello, my name is Alan Zibluk.

After surging last December to around $19,500, bitcoin has declined more than 50 percent since the start of the year. On Thursday, amid increased regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency space, the coin fell yet again — this time below $8,000, where bitcoin had hovered for several weeks. Late Friday, bitcoin changed hands around $7,400.\nRegardless, Bogart said it’s still a buy. In fact, he said it’s the only coin traders should be buying as the coin becomes more mainstream.\nMany of the other forms of cryptocurrency, Bogart said, are “over-promising and under-delivering. Meanwhile you have a few that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.”\nBogart recommended selling coins like Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO.\n“A lot of those tokens are overvalued,” Bogart said. “They could be go up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.”\nAlternatives like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS, however, he described as “neutral” — and he told investors to hold for now.\nBogart said he’s especially cautious with ethereum, which he said has a lot of overhang because so many initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been built on top of ethereum. He pointed out that if the ICOs don’t work out, that could be bad news for the platform its built on.\nBitcoin, however, should “at least” end above $10,000 by the end of the year, Bogart said, but he acknowledged that the even the large-cap coin could face some headwind.\n“But when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing,” he said of bitcoin increasing value.\n“Could bitcoin trade lower?

There is a monster bearish trend line in place with resistance near $1,060 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is likely to decline further and it could even break the last swing low of $948 in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is in a bearish trend below $1,080 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD remains at a risk of more declines towards the $920 and $850 levels.\nBitcoin Cash Price Decline This past week, there were sharp declines from the $1,100 swing high in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price declined and broke a few important support levels such as $1,050 and $1,000. It traded towards the $950 level before starting an upside correction. A low was formed at $948 and the price corrected above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,322 high to $948 low.\nHowever, the upside move was capped by the $1,050 resistance. It also failed to test and break the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,322 high to $948 low. BCH price is declining once again and it seems like it could retest the $948 low in the short term. A break below $948 could open the doors for a test of the $920 and $900 support levels. To the topside, there is a monster bearish trend line in place with resistance near $1,060 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is facing a tough challenge on the upside near $1,060 and the trend line. Above this, the last swing high of $1.150 is the next major hurdle for buyers.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is mostly negative in the bearish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is declining towards the 30 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,060\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis: BCH/USD's Downtrend Intact appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T07:59:37.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a60406b1d84281111c403a7dcee1ea898e68b4fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHK43qjHN384VDDk15c1uEluJvP3TXV.Rd2GMnJHj1j_Uouy7jNnNVReTvoUl8xk4dGppzs_NTBMEbkKVp2nsxX6RF1NArrHj3euIFmum75XJw--", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt", "published": "2018-05-27T07:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Bitgrail-Exchange-Ordered-Down-Indefinitely-as-Italian-Court-Upholds-Halt.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a60406b1d84281111c403a7dcee1ea898e68b4fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHK43qjHN384VDDk15c1uEluJvP3TXV.Rd2GMnJHj1j_Uouy7jNnNVReTvoUl8xk4dGppzs_NTBMEbkKVp2nsxX6RF1NArrHj3euIFmum75XJw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-27T07:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt", "text": "Bitcoin – Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt 26 May 2018 8537\nEarlier this month, Bitgrail’s principal Franceso Firano attempted to reopen the Italian cryptocurrency exchange after $170 million in losses and during their legal sorting out. An inside job or software hack, that hasn’t had an official determination, and fingers are still pointing between the exchange’s charismatic operator and crypto devs. International heavy law firm Bonelli Erede effectively petitioned to have the exchange remain offline, instituting bankruptcy proceedings, and the Court of Florence recently agreed.\nAlso read: DOJ Crypto Investigation Tanks Prices, Fundstrat Welcomes Adult Supervision Bitgrail Shuttered by Court of Florence\n“This morning,” a post on the exchange’s website read earlier this month, “following the re-opening, we were notified of a deed by the court of Florence requesting the immediate closure of Bitgrail and this situation will persist until a decision is made by the courts, about the precautionary suspension request made by the Bonelli law office on behalf of a client […] Even though we don’t agree with this decision, we are obliged to respect the law and to suspend any Bitgrail business immediately.”\nThis week the court indeed made a decision.\n“We have temporarily disabled the Bitgrail exchange pending further notice,” came what appears to be a rather final Tweet from, presumably, the embattled exchange operator Franceso Firano on May 2nd. It’s what remains of communication since an injunction was filed to prevent Mr. Firano from reopening. The exchange was halted, temporarily, and that decision was formally upheld as bankruptcy proceedings loom.\nRepresenting more than 3,000 exchange complainants is the international firm Bonelli Erede . Its team is a veritable who-is-who of Italian legal pros: Partner Monica Iacoviello , Giuseppe Sbisà , with assistance from senior associates Gianpaolo Ciervo and Alessandra Frigerio. Nano user and Foundation coordinator Espen Enger has also contributed to efforts.\nBonelli Erede is a two-decades old consortium of sorts, formed from successful firms responding to merger and acquisition pressure at the present century’s turn. The result is a legal powerhouse of over 400 lawyers, half a dozen offices scattered throughout Europe, and revenues of something like €150 million. Uphill Battle, Especially for Exchange Users\nAnd so it is Mr. Firano facing a colossal uphill battle that might very well be moot at the time of publication. Bitgrail could be relegated to so much toast, burnt … done. It doesn’t help that Mr. Firano, once known as “The Bomber” for his outbursts and ribald commentary, has been radio silent since the beginning of May.\nThe tone early that day weeks ago was one of optimism, as Mr. Firano floated ways to attempt making looted users whole. The then-latest scheme involved opening the exchange to generate the requisite revenue. And so he attempted to open, announcing he was “pleased to announce the re-open of our exchange! Given the probable overload of servers, it is possible that in the first hours there may be slowdowns in the functionality of the site.”\nMere hours later, the opening was halted pending a more definitive hearing. The Court of Florence in recently upholding that initial stoppage has frozen all assets, tipping off formal bankruptcy proceedings. Typically trustees are appointed to look over books and accounts, and then whatever remains is divvied up according to creditors, victims, etc. The process could take years and yield pennies on the dollar returns. So far, no criminal charges have been filed.\nAll this suggests Mr. Firano being pushed out, along with his proposals for a new crypto and to have devs roll back the blockchain. The Nano Foundation insists losses were the result of bugs on the exchange side of things, and the Nano project will soldier on.\nIs formal bankruptcy the correct remedy here?

It's obvious that for the time being, bears are in full control of bitcoin price but this time it's a little bit harder to discern the source of BTC's recent turmoil.\nCould it be one of the following?\nLingering effects of the Mt. Gox sell off? Simmering scandal from the Upbit and Bithumb investigations? Or perhaps it's the whales on the run phenomenon as Bitfinex requested client tax and social security information to comply with federal SEC regulations? Those partial to conspiracies might be willing to entertain theories of institutional investors and whales manipulating prices to buy near the bottom before flooding crypto markets with cash and bringing on the greatest pump 2018 will ever see.\nWhatever the reason(s), Bitcoin is currently stuck in the mud, and it appears likely to continue languishing as the expected purchasing appetite just isn't present right now.\nDaily Chart\nThe RSI has struggled to stay out of bearish territory (above 50) and a pattern of lower highs and lower lows continues as BTC slipped below the downward channel and is down nearly 15% over the last seven days. Notice that the RSI is not oversold (above 30) which supports the possibility of further price decline and in the event of a deep sell-off, BTC could drop below lower leg of the triangle. At the time of writing, the 5-day MA sits below the 10-day MA and both are sloping downward indicating further short-term decline. Last week the concern was whether BTC would dip below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level whereas this week there is the possibility of a full retrace back to the April low near $6,425. 4HR Chart\nThe 4-hour chart shows the 20-day MA well below the 50-day MA as both trend downward. At the moment, BTC is nowhere near crossing the 50-day MA at $7,969 and remains far away from the recent high (May 21) at $8,644. Notice that the Stochastic oscillator approaches overbought territory, yet BTC price continues to decline, opening the door for deep loses in BTC price as there is plenty of room for the oscillator to fall in the event of a sell-off. At the time of writing the RSI is flattening while remaining near bearish territory which is indicative of further decline (see the direction of moving averages) but it is possible that BTC could continue trading sideways for the short term until buyers, sellers or some breaking news event impacts BTC price. Alas, all is not lost in the world of cryptocurrency. In a recent Twitter post, The Crypto Fam make a strong case that this current bear reversal will end near $7,000 and purchasing appetite for BTC will return as whales, small investors and institutional investors return to purchase BTC near the bottom. Vision BTC is nearing a full retrace to the April April low near $6,425. Panic selling below $7,000 could open the doors for price decline below the lowest support at $6,000 A full retrace to $6,425 could signal the completion of the current bear reversal. BTC needs to close above the 50-day MA at $7,969 and sustained price gains above the upper descending channel ($8,050) would indicate that the current correction has ended. As highlighted by The Crypto Fam , each leg down in the bear market since December 2017 has have shown reductions in selling volume and the price drops less extreme. They have interpreted this as an indication that the bear market is running out of steam as bears, whales, and market makers have reduced their BTC holdings and will be prepared to purchase aggressively once the cryptocurrency reaches a bottom.\nTheir charts, along with the daily chart in this article show a bottom somewhere between $6,000 – $6,800.\nTraders are advised to watch from the sidelines as most technical indicators show bears having the advantage but aggressive investors could consider purchasing when the 20 and 50-day MA reverse and maintain upward momentum on the 4-hour chart.\nAt current prices, longs could take positions starting at $7,300 (and probably below) as Bitcoin has been range bound between $6,000 to $12,200 since February 2018.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

The estimated time for the next half of the reward is around 732 days, but it is relevant now for a few reasons.\nThe current bear market offers opportunities for investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, as it is currently trading at a low since the past week. It has been plagued by sell-offs and FUD, along with a general bearish trend. Market sentiment is also low after the CFTC and US Justice Department declared the existence of a probe into cryptomarkets for fraudulent practices.\nAs the price is currently low, interest by institutional investors is on a high after a successful Consensus conference and general adaptive behavior. News such as Goldman Sachs beginning a cryptocurrency trading desk and JP Morgan’s high-level reshuffling to focus on cryptocurrency may as well be the tip of the adoption iceberg.\nAs the 17 millionth coin was mined sometime last month, a reality check descended on the market that the amount of Bitcoin left in existence is limited. Even as digital assets tend towards digital abundance, Satoshi’s blockchain allows for real digital scarcity with real-world parallels. The 21 millionth coin will be mined in around 2140, approximately. The time, electricity, and computing power required to mine new coins is constantly increasing, with Moore’s law being barely able to keep up.\nAs the block reward is halved every 210,000 blocks, it constantly decreases the rate at which it is possible to create new Bitcoin tokens. The new landmark on ETA, 28th May 2020, will decrease the reward from the current 12.5 coins to 6.25 coins. The total coins mined before the next halving of the block reward will be 18,375,000, which marks 87.5% of the possible 21 million Bitcoin tokens.\nThis will then exponentially reduce the speed at which new Bitcoin come into existence, spiking up demand for the coin due to reduced supply. Analysts predict that this bear market will be the last one before 2020.\nCrypto analyst Trevor Wade says:\n“This bear market is the last chance for investors to buy into Bitcoin before the price goes up to $10000+. Reduced block rewards will result in supply cutting off and demand going up, which will cause an exponential spike. Regulators and institutional investors are moving in in a safe way, allowing for large-scale adoption of financial system disruptors.” .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bogart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T05:16:00.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e8b9a290b15f3c626e670cf0735752acb7ed2e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va72G8sn0AzcRsIkZmAIr8NuQCYcGXNQwyOO5ZqjGfumOndoY0794IQBIfvcxps3dIEes.qtdliLMGGLzrALxc0Ao-", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "What are main advantages of Bitcoin over Monero?

It is true that there are some speculative methods that may identify the originating IP of a Bitcoin transaction but , those use an educated guess method and are unreliable - particularly if a node connects to the Bitcoin network using Tor then the educated guess method is unusable in determining the originating IP.\nIn a broad sense, the issue of privacy is universal. If you purchase goods or services online you must ordinarily provide a name and often a delivery address. If you purchase in store this may not be necessary. If the merchant shares the information that they have about a transaction (or is forced to hand it over to a government) then with payment details the details can be mapped to a set of utxo's on the blockchain which funded your purchase transaction, and any change address. This is terrible for privacy.\nAs I understand it this situation is improved with Monero by the use of stealth addresses, nonetheless, the details that are retained can still be handed over.\nFor myself, I see the privacy concerns of Bitcoin as a non-issue - just use Tor . You cannot avoid informing a merchant of information necessary to complete a purchase. Pieter Wuille has a more academic view and states:\nTor does not hide account linkage or amounts. Without very proactive measures anyone you interact with can probably make a reasonable guess how much money is in your wallet (by distinguishing change from payments), what software you are using, and with further analyses what sites you interact with. All of these are terrible properties for a currency, threatening its fungibility. Note that privacy is always optional - even when using stealth addresses or confidential transactions, you can prove to anyone what your balance or transactions are. It just becomes opt-in rather than opt-out. – Pieter Wuille\nWhilst I can appreciate how such linkages are mapped, it is beyond my comprehension how such linkages are useful if Tor is utilised since without an originating IP it seems speculative to link further transactions over those immediately attached to a particular transaction into the available information set, I do not think it is useful, nonetheless, I will take Pieter at his word.\nThis answer has been edited in view of the discussion by Pieter Wuille in the comments.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "monero", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T11:21:36.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfc9e4d888d8291b79015900d2445d69e32ee236", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tcF4v6Y7xyIik-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "title_full": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "published": "2018-05-27T06:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfc9e4d888d8291b79015900d2445d69e32ee236", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tcF4v6Y7xyIik-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mybtcasset", "published": "2018-05-27T06:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "text": "saving bitcoin is one the wisest saving we do for ur children once the market bounces back our kids future will be completely secure", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T03:36:21.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1941aef0155f3e73673aa764714b21eb8eb2767a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGiE5le3jOSc3tCdNEoCi7o6bBLKIzqwogWHYjnlefgtqAZ0h_GopKa5TtOPhfecYEyxYaq42b9FW6Rfyp8vqLtM-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

As with any gold investment, Bitcoin price fluctuations far outweigh the gold. I use a slightly different way to invest in Bitcoin, that is, first I buy and second I work in Bitcoin pool.\nYou can be successful if the project has to work and can help even more, if there are already many people who invest for your project.

BTC found strong bids in mid April following the repeated failure (marked by a circle) on the part of the bears to penetrate the 50-week MA.\nSubsequently, the rally from the 50-week MA to $9,990 (May 5 high) reinforced the moving average as a strong long-term support. Hence, a downside break would raise the odds of a slide to fresh 2017 lows below $6,000.

A series of lower highs and lower lows also indicates the bears are in control.\nThe 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle moving averages (MAs) are aligned in favor of a further drop in prices.\nBTC looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000. Acceptance below that level would expose the April 1 low of $6,425. An unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800$8,000. btc 6 month chart (current price: 7,100):\nAttached Images S__6250498.jpg (43.4 KB, 36 views) Reply With Quote: Yesterday, 10:53 AM #7206 Farangrakthai Thailand Expat\nJoin Date Dec 2009 Last Online @ Posts 2,383 Originally Posted by OhOh Could you add the moving average on your graphs?

This is one of the first successful trials of a digital asset by a mainstream financial services organisation. It marks a departure from the speculative trading of cryptocurrencies that has dominated the marketplace thus far and a shift towards the intended purpose of digital assets  as a means of value transfer. The trial saw Currencies Direct conduct a number of transfers between pre-screened organisations in seconds, compared to the 3 to 5 day period that transfers currently take. The trial has served as a technological proof of concept for XRP as a means of value transfer, achieving superior speed of payment and end-to-end transparency, compared to traditional means of payment. Brian Harris, Chief Product Officer at Currencies Direct, said of the move our trial with XRP was a resounding success. Were currently assessing our next steps, but the evidence weve gathered indicates that the use of XRP is a game changer, making payments near-immediate and significantly improving service to our customers.\nOur goal is to offer the best possible service. We believe that utilising cryptocurrencies in this way  as a transfer of value, rather than as a store of value  is the next logical step for our industry. It is, after all, the intended purpose of cryptocurrencies and were proud to be leveraging new technology to deliver the most convenient and seamless experience for our customers.\nRonald McDonald never sells to children.

The ICO boom that happened in 2018 will make a comeback where the Bitcoin trades will go higher in the next year. CNBC Fast Money\nBogart was quoted as saying:\n“Every major bank is trying to do something in this space. Either they are offering Bitcoin to their clients, working on a custody platform, or opening up a trading desk.”\nThe cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Ripple are going to offer some of those crypto assets to their clients, he mentions. He also believes that Bitcoin could face some “headwinds” here and there, but it is going to get higher because of a major currency-crisis that might generate within the next few years.\nHe then spoke about Ethereum:\n“Ethereum has a lot of tokens which are over-valued and these ICO’s are built on top of Ethereum. Their token ETH is used essentially as a fuel for more people to invest into these ICOs.”\nBitcoin is currently traded at $7550.55 with a circulating supply of 17.55 million. It has had an upsurge of 1.23% in the past 24 hours.\nHe says:\n“The ICO’s are a dangerous game.

He has rejected conditions offered by US investigators, his lawyer said. Vinnik, a Russian expert in cryptocurrency technologies, is being held in a Thessaloniki jail. Washington accuses him of laundering at least $4 billion in Bitcoin through a trading platform. He is also sought for extradition by Russia for alleged fraud.\nVinnik wants go back to Russia and is ready to cooperate with investigators, his lawyer Timofey Musatov said in an interview with RIA Novosti, published on Saturday. Musatov noted that his client has “no choice” as his children and wife, who became ill as a result of overwhelming stress relating to her husband’s arrest, are in Russia.\nRead more UK bitcoin traders focus of US probe into manipulation of cryptocurrency prices “I want, in any circumstances, that my activities or my crimes are investigated in Russia. If I am guilty, I must be brought to punishment. I will cooperate with the investigation. I want to be in Russia under any circumstances,” the lawyer said , citing his client.\nVinnik can also shed light on some other crimes involving cryptocurrencies, Musatov says, adding that damning information he could provide may place his life under threat. Following reports that an attempt on his life by poisoning was being planned, Greek authorities have beefed up security, the lawyer confirmed.\nThe Thessaloniki court earlier supported Vinnik’s extradition to both Russia and the US, and the final decision is to be made by the Greek minister for justice.\nMeanwhile, the defense team is fighting the extradition to the US as Vinnik refuses to cooperate with Washington.\n“Alexander Vinnik has completely rejected all such proposals [to work with the US investigators]. He has a very clear, unequivocal position – not to agree to any conditions suggested by the Americans under any circumstances. He is ready to take the risk of coming to the Russian Federation,” Musatov said.\nVinnik was arrested in the resort area in northern Greece in July. If Washington’s request for extradition is granted, Vinnik may face up to 55 years behind bars for the charges brought against him. The suspect denies wrongdoing and says the case is a US set-up.\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!\nTrends: Cryptocurrency news Greece news Russia news Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vinnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "musatov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aleksandr vinnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timofey musatov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ria novosti", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thessaloniki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T12:50:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45fe1bb3ef5dbf37aad997bdbcdad4de3891fbf4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggmtBM8.k9UnKc4V7pJtUF8Kg72FIOUKLEmx9lYOTHV7CT7hyHVo3GQnvWV8xTw_5cLaRhGjcS9MtA--", "site_full": "sg.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business finance, stock market, quotes, news", "title": "Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses says blockchain venture capitalist", "title_full": "Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses says blockchain venture capitalist", "published": "2018-05-27T06:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JJ6zvpdDMY92Qe1npCIPFA--~B/aD00MDY7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cnbcuk/9/7/data_-z44kFfANF4amoi6Dgge9Tt5-6dxb3A3nym48glftg7tva9YFwQCb-T5nkCFnlgI1vx0KB4pF1g-~A_2_0.jpg?s=6db11dae6c3cd93ab66a49925d225472&amp;c=b1678d53ef2b18ca9b2ceda94f6727de&amp;a=cnbcuk&amp;mr=0", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45fe1bb3ef5dbf37aad997bdbcdad4de3891fbf4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggmtBM8.k9UnKc4V7pJtUF8Kg72FIOUKLEmx9lYOTHV7CT7hyHVo3GQnvWV8xTw_5cLaRhGjcS9MtA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CNBC", "published": "2018-05-27T06:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses says blockchain venture capitalist", "text": "Bitcoin is still a buy despite its continued losses, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart told CNBC.\nThe digital currency's increased number of use cases is proof that the popular form of money is being institutionalized.\n\"Every major bank is trying to do something in the space,\" Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital, told CNBC's \" Fast Money \" on Friday.\n\"Either they're going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they're working on a custody platform or they're opening up a trading desk,\" he added. \"A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive,\" he said.\nStill, the coin has seen better days. After surging last December to around $19,500, bitcoin has declined more than 50 percent since the start of the year. On Thursday, with increased regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency space, the coin fell yet again — this time below $8,000, where bitcoin had hovered for several weeks. Late Friday, bitcoin changed hands around $7,400.\nRegardless, Bogart said it's still a buy. In fact, he said it's the only coin traders should be buying as the coin becomes more mainstream.\nMany of the other forms of cryptocurrency, Bogart said, are \"over-promising and under-delivering. Meanwhile you have a few that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\"\nBogart said to sell coins like Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO.\n\"A lot of those tokens are overvalued,\" Bogart said. \"They could be go up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.\"\nAlternatives like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS, however, he described as \"neutral\" — and he told investors to hold for now.\nBogart said he's especially cautious with ethereum, which he said has a lot of overhang because so many initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been built on top of ethereum. He pointed out that if the ICOs don't work out, that could be bad news for the platform its built on.\nBitcoin, however, should \"at least\" end above $10,000 by the end of the year, Bogart said, but he acknowledged that the even the large-cap coin could face some headwinds.\n\"But when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing,\" he said of bitcoin increasing value.\n\"Could bitcoin trade lower? Certainly,\" Bogart said. \"But do I think it will be higher a year from now?
