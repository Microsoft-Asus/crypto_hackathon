We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we're talking about and measure our performance.\"\n\"We need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle,\" he continued. \"And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.\"\nBitcoin was priced around $8,300 Wednesday evening, 5:30 p.m. ET. While the coin has recovered from lows earlier this year — briefly dropping below $6,000 in February — bitcoin is still far away from its mid-December peak around $19,500.\nCoinShares, an investment firm specializing in cryptocurrency , launched the world's first publicly traded bitcoin and ethereum fund.\nInvestors were optimistic that Blockchain Week New York and Monday's Consensus event would help boost the large-cap coin. But bitcoin has under-performed, down 5 percent since Monday.\nMasters pointed out that three years ago, the market and number of people interested in cryptocurrencies was very small. This week, however, more than 8,000 people showed up for Blockchain Week New York.\nIn fact, he said, bitcoin's life cycle \"is still very early.\"\n\"In derivatives, indices, pricing models and so on that go on around [building a financial system.] We're nowhere near that part yet,\" Masters said.\n\"We're not even at the part yet where I'd say institutional investors even started in commodities.

Ireland.\nIn the future, the Bitcoin network could be using almost triple that amount, or 7.67 gigawatts, according to a letter published in the energy journal Joule by financial economist and blockchain expert Alex de Vries.\nA look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018, says Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nBitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018, the study estimates.\nThe Bitcoin development community is experimenting with solutions such as the Lightning Network to improve the throughput of the network, which may alleviate the situation. \"For now, however, Bitcoin has a big problem, and it is growing fast,\" according to Vries.\nThe electricity that is expended in the process of mining Bitcoin has become a topic of hot debate. It is a process that makes Bitcoin extremely energy-hungry by design, as the currency requires a huge amount of hash calculations for processing financial transactions without intermediaries.\nDigital currencies require a continuous flow of power to keep the network up and running round the clock. It is estimated that for crypto mining process, computers consume more than 50 terawatt-hours of electricity per year globally.\nAnd if the current growth rates of electricity consumption continues, experts predict that by 2020 the bitcoin network can consume electricity as much as the rest of the world utilize. Also, a large amount of heat is emitted due to mining, which also contributes to global warming, though marginally.\nSeveral incidents of electricity being stolen or abused for cryptocurrency mining have been reported recently.\nIn one case, a researcher misused National Science Foundation-funded supercomputers to mine $8,000-$10,000 worth of Bitcoin. The operation ended up costing an American university $150,000.\nMore recently, a mining facility in Russia with 6,000 devices was shut down after not paying for several million kilowatt-hours of electricity.\nBut in the wake of increasing interest in crypto trading worldwide, cryptocurrency mining doesn't seem likely to slow down anytime soon. Researchers need concrete answers before it becomes far too late enact institutional restrictions and regulations on the practice, writes De Vries.\nby Joji Xavier RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin power consumption almost equal to a country", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:43:20.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a22d7855a8d2ab8894c05b30134520b0f1ce1f4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3xxRBLU.1TinfZ6POrERsP_hqa3nd1FOzkBsPm3JHjB6KJcKe43JulyP0ie9duKCww--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $8300.00", "title_full": "Current price of Bitcoin is $8300.00", "published": "2018-05-17T15:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a22d7855a8d2ab8894c05b30134520b0f1ce1f4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3xxRBLU.1TinfZ6POrERsP_hqa3nd1FOzkBsPm3JHjB6KJcKe43JulyP0ie9duKCww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T15:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $8300.00", "text": "Home » bitcoin prize » bitcoin today » Current price of Bitcoin is $8300.00 Current price of Bitcoin is $8300.00 8300.00 ▷ May 17, 2018 at 07:00PM #bitcoin #invest #money", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T18:26:45.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95406ab6a5587547d65dcb229ab9b96f2af2ec2a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuayR6ajeoTrpol9mUhayiqb64Iw2chtWSrUqFd.rUkdjQfTzUYZsqz6lsEyrpSwYgQEB3JK4Uw52JgnPxXyJrQlLjc2tbm43rXj0S04Nri8CJby1jCOK.D6M-", "site_full": "www.livetradingnews.com", "site": "livetradingnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.livetradingnews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Live Trading News", "title": "The NYSE Bitcoin Index (.NYXBT) A Look Inside the Technicals", "title_full": "The NYSE Bitcoin Index (.NYXBT) A Look Inside the Technicals", "published": "2018-05-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.livetradingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin2-3.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95406ab6a5587547d65dcb229ab9b96f2af2ec2a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuayR6ajeoTrpol9mUhayiqb64Iw2chtWSrUqFd.rUkdjQfTzUYZsqz6lsEyrpSwYgQEB3JK4Uw52JgnPxXyJrQlLjc2tbm43rXj0S04Nri8CJby1jCOK.D6M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HEFFX Australia", "published": "2018-05-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The NYSE Bitcoin Index (.NYXBT) A Look Inside the Technicals", "text": "The NYSE Bitcoin Index (.NYXBT) A Look Inside the Technicals\nOverall, the bias in prices is: Downwards.\nThe projected upper bound is: 9,332.00.\nThe projected lower bound is: 7,182.43.\nThe projected closing price is: 8,257.21.\nCandlesticks\nWARNING: These prices only contain closing prices.

Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 7.9794. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a sell 6 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 44.00. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 32 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -161.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100.

Once you join, you will be set up with a free lead account and receive follow up emails detailing how you can create a Bitcoin investment account with The BitClub Network. For any answers to questions contact Clyde Thorburn at http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn .\nAuthor : Martedì Giugno\nWhen it starts, you will see a program that looks like the first picture. Set up the software by linking it to your worker created in Step 7. “Click Settings”>“Account…”. Beside “User Name:” use the username you created when creating the BitMinter account. Beside “Worker Name:” and “Worker Password:” enter the worker name and worker password you created in Step 6. If the window is small, click the button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then click the “Engine Start” button beside each of the devices you want to use. For reference, I get about 65 Mhps (million hashes per second). 1000 Khps = 1 Mhps. Test all of your devices, but you should really only bother running devices that get you 25 Mhps or above. You will also want to change a few settings regarding automation. I leave my computer on all day and all night. I normally turn off the mining as soon as I get home from work (around 6:00) and have the miner start on its own at night in case I forget to start it when I’m done with my computer. Go to Settings > Options to change these settings. Look at the fourth picture to set it up like how I have it set up. The picture has explanations.\nAutomated devices are a list of devices that you set so that you can start them on their own automatically when the software starts. I have selected one of my devices as automated so that when the software starts, only that device starts. See fourth picture for more details. Step 9: Mine. Let your computer run while it mines! Running it at night is a good idea as it will double the amount of money you make. Good luck making money. Step 10: Spend Your Bitcoins. What good is a currency if you can’t spend it? The answer is it’s not. There are lots of things you can do. Below is a list: Gamble. SatoshiDice. Bitzino. Peerbet. RoyalBitcoin. Buy various merchandise. Some online vendors are starting to accept bitcoins s a way of purchasing items. Buy Coffee at http://bitcoincoffee.com/. Trade it for PayPal money. Mt. Gox Bitcoin Exchange. The last one I want to talk about it Mt. Gox. It is the most common website used to trade (buy or sell) bitcoins for dollars or any other national currency. You can receive this money through PayPal or many other online currency transfer services. I am not going to go through the details of this, but to send bitcoins to anyone or any service, follow the instructions in the next step.\nStep 11: Send Bitcoins to Someone. To use bitcoins, you must send bitcoins to another address. To send bitcoins, the service will give you a specific address to send bitcoins to. Copy this address. Open up your bitcoin wallet. Click on the “Send coins” tab. Enter the address you want to send the coins to in the “Pay to” field. If you are going to send coins to this person or group multiple times, you can enter a label for this person so that you can find them in your address book again. Enter the amount in the next field (for easy math, remember that 1 BTC is $ 10). Click send when you are done. If you just want to practice sending bitcoins to someone, you can test sending them to me. Just send 0.01 BTC to me (approx. 10 cents). Good luck. Step 12: Done. And that is just about all the basic information about bitcoins. If you have any questions, or there is something really obvious and important that I had missed, drop me a comment. I’ll try to respond as quickly as possible. If you want to donate, send me a bitcoin or two at 16bVf7XX3dKN2zW6ut8FRSQaGZZBHAFYZt. Any donations, no matter how big or small, will be appreciated.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-2/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn\nCLICK

"Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: OECD Explores Cryptocurrencies, Central Asian Powerhouse Calls for UN Crypto Rules\nLubomir Tassev\nIn today's edition of Bitcoin in Brief we're focusing on developments in the realm of international politics and economics regarding cryptocurrencies. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development is looking into the possible uses of digital coins and the associated technologies. Kazakhstan is calling for the adoption of common crypto rules by the United Nations, while Iran and Russia are thinking about using cryptocurrency in bilateral trade.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: Coinbase Goes After Big Money as Nomura Creates Komainu\nOECD Explores Cryptos and ICOs The Committee on Digital Economy at the Organization of Economic Development and Cooperation ( OECD ) has started exploring blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The international body also wants to help governments of member-states develop and implement legislation aimed at protecting consumer rights in electronic trade.\nAccording to Elina Sidorenko, head of Russia's interdepartmental group working to assess risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrencies, the OECD will be used as a platform to discuss matters related to cryptos and token sales. These discussions will be held in the context of ensuring the safety of consumers of financial services, she said in a post on her Telegram channel .\nThe OECD and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ( FATF ) recognize the role of cryptocurrency as a means of payment and accumulation, Sidorenko emphasized. Both organizations also view ICOs as a good mechanism to attract funding, she added. \"I hope that the generally positive rhetoric on cryptocurrencies in the OECD will not change,\" the Russian official said, promising to keep her followers informed on further developments.\nAstana Calls for UN Crypto Rules Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev thinks that the time has come to adopt common, international rules on cryptocurrencies with the help of the United Nations. \"Most countries are actively exploring the possibility to adapt their regulations to the current configuration of the financial system. At the same time, the disconnected actions of different states will lead to inefficiency. It is necessary to develop general rules,\" he insisted, quoted by Zakon.kz .\nDuring the Astana Economic Forum, Nazarbayev noted that Kazakhstan's own project to issue an assets-backed cryptocurrency called G-Global has won institutional support from international organizations. The initiative \"has been mentioned on multiple occasions during the G20 summit . Last week the Council of Foreign Ministers at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which includes more than 50 nations, adopted a resolution to support it,\" the president revealed.\nKazakhstani officials have previously said that G-Global will be designed as a crypto \"backed by assets, not just trust.\" These assets have not been specified so far but the Central Asian country is rich in natural resources. Kazakhstan is the leading economy in the region , generating 60% of its GDP, primarily through the oil and natural gas industry.\nRecent reports that Kazakhstan's central bank is preparing legislation to ban the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies, as well as crypto mining, have been dismissed by representatives of the local crypto community. According to Leonid Muravjov, VP at the Blockchain and Crypto Technology Association of Kazakhstan, the government is actually spending huge amounts of money to digitize the economy, which is currently heavily reliant on the export of mineral resources.\nKazakhstan and Belarus to Cooperate on Blockchain Astana and Minsk intend to strengthen their ties in the field of blockchain implementation. Kazakhstan and Belarus have signed a memorandum of cooperation that will allow experts from the two former Soviet republics to exchange experience and improve their competitiveness on the world stage through wider adoption of new technologies. Both countries are members of the Eurasian Economic Union ( EAEU ).\n\"The bottom line is that this (blockchain) is a multinational technology, and the development of some real solutions, both at state level and in the private sector, does not make sense in the context of a single state. The memorandum aims to develop the most optimal solutions through exchange of experience and personnel, and to share already working solutions based on blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies,\" said Stanislav Baskov, Director of the Belarussian Distributed Ledger Technologies Association.\nAccording to a press release by Astana Hub , Kazakhstan's IT Park, the agreement was signed during the international expo TIBO – 2018 in Belarus. It would allow Kazakhstan to take advantage of the Belarusian experience in blockchain and cryptocurrency integration. Recently, Minsk legalized crypto-related activities for entities registered with its Hi-Tech Park with a presidential decree that came into force on March 28.\nIran and Russia to Create Crypto Alternative to SWIFT Recognizing the opportunity to minimize dependence on the US dollar, Iranian authorities have turned their attention to cryptocurrencies. Iran's central bank has commenced work on proposals to use cryptocurrency in international trade, as requested by the parliamentary Committee on Economic Affairs, Interfax reported.\n\"Cryptocurrencies offer a good opportunity to circumvent the use of the dollar, and also replace the SWIFT system,\" said Mohamad Reza Purebrahimi, who heads the commission. Teheran has established cooperation with Russia on the matter following a meeting with the chairman of the Economic Policy Committee of the upper house of Russia's parliament, Dmitriy Mezentsev. Purebrahimi said that the two countries may be the first to use cryptocurrency in bilateral trade transactions.\n\"Against the backdrop of US pressure, the expansion of settlements in national currencies, as well as the possible use of payment systems like [the Russian] Mir and the Iranian Shetab is promising,\" Mezentsev commented. According to official sources quoted in Moscow, Russia may put its version of SWIFT, the SPFS , on blockchain as early as next year.\nWhat are your thoughts on the highlights in today's Bitcoin in Brief?

Teheran has established cooperation with Russia on the matter following a meeting with the chairman of the Economic Policy Committee of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, Dmitriy Mezentsev. Purebrahimi said that the two countries may be the first to use cryptocurrency in bilateral trade transactions.\n“Against the backdrop of US pressure, the expansion of settlements in national currencies, as well as the possible use of payment systems like [the Russian] Mir and the Iranian Shetab is promising,” Mezentsev commented. According to official sources quoted in Moscow, Russia may put its version of SWIFT, the SPFS , on blockchain as early as next year.\nWhat are your thoughts on the highlights in today’s Bitcoin in Brief?

The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development is looking into the possible uses of digital coins and the associated technologies. Kazakhstan is calling for the adoption of common crypto rules by the United Nations, while Iran and Russia are thinking about using cryptocurrency in bilateral trade.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: Coinbase Goes After Big Money as Nomura Creates Komainu OECD Explores Cryptos and ICOs\nThe Committee on Digital Economy at the Organization of Economic Development and Cooperation ( OECD ) has started exploring blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The international body also wants to help governments of member-states develop and implement legislation aimed at protecting consumer rights in electronic trade.\nAccording to Elina Sidorenko, head of Russia’s interdepartmental group working to assess risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrencies, the OECD will be used as a platform to discuss matters related to cryptos and token sales. These discussions will be held in the context of ensuring the safety of consumers of financial services, she said in a post on her Telegram channel .\nThe OECD and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ( FATF ) recognize the role of cryptocurrency as a means of payment and accumulation, Sidorenko emphasized. Both organizations also view ICOs as a good mechanism to attract funding, she added. “I hope that the generally positive rhetoric on cryptocurrencies in the OECD will not change,” the Russian official said, promising to keep her followers informed on further developments. Astana Calls for UN Crypto Rules\nKazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev thinks that the time has come to adopt common, international rules on cryptocurrencies with the help of the United Nations. “Most countries are actively exploring the possibility to adapt their regulations to the current configuration of the financial system. At the same time, the disconnected actions of different states will lead to inefficiency. It is necessary to develop general rules,” he insisted, quoted by Zakon.kz .\nDuring the Astana Economic Forum, Nazarbayev noted that Kazakhstan’s own project to issue an assets-backed cryptocurrency called G-Global has won institutional support from international organizations. The initiative “has been mentioned on multiple occasions during the G20 summit . Last week the Council of Foreign Ministers at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which includes more than 50 nations, adopted a resolution to support it,” the president revealed.\nKazakhstani officials have previously said that G-Global will be designed as a crypto “backed by assets, not just trust.” These assets have not been specified so far but the Central Asian country is rich in natural resources. Kazakhstan is the leading economy in the region , generating 60% of its GDP, primarily through the oil and natural gas industry.\nRecent reports that Kazakhstan’s central bank is preparing legislation to ban the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies, as well as crypto mining, have been dismissed by representatives of the local crypto community. According to Leonid Muravjov, VP at the Blockchain and Crypto Technology Association of Kazakhstan, the government is actually spending huge amounts of money to digitize the economy, which is currently heavily reliant on the export of mineral resources. Kazakhstan and Belarus to Cooperate on Blockchain\nAstana and Minsk intend to strengthen their ties in the field of blockchain implementation. Kazakhstan and Belarus have signed a memorandum of cooperation that will allow experts from the two former Soviet republics to exchange experience and improve their competitiveness on the world stage through wider adoption of new technologies. Both countries are members of the Eurasian Economic Union ( EAEU ).\n“The bottom line is that this (blockchain) is a multinational technology, and the development of some real solutions, both at state level and in the private sector, does not make sense in the context of a single state. The memorandum aims to develop the most optimal solutions through exchange of experience and personnel, and to share already working solutions based on blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies,” said Stanislav Baskov, Director of the Belarussian Distributed Ledger Technologies Association.\nAccording to a press release by Astana Hub , Kazakhstan’s IT Park, the agreement was signed during the international expo TIBO – 2018 in Belarus. It would allow Kazakhstan to take advantage of the Belarusian experience in blockchain and cryptocurrency integration. Recently, Minsk legalized crypto-related activities for entities registered with its Hi-Tech Park with a presidential decree that came into force on March 28.

A Former Top Official Says Maybe", "text": "Should the Fed Create FedCoin to Rival Bitcoin? A Former Top Official Says Maybe Many enthusiasts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are motivated by deep skepticism of the central banks that control the worlds money supply.\nBut what if central banks themselves entered the game? What would happen if the Federal Reserve, or the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan used blockchain technology to create their own virtual currencies? Besides, that is, having some cryptocurrency fans heads explode?\nA former Fed governor  who was also a finalist to lead the central bank  thinks the idea deserves serious consideration.\nMost central banks have a view that these crypto-assets are clever, like guys in the garage did it and its kind of cool, or risky, given the potential investor losses and widespread fraud, said Kevin Warsh, who was a governor at the Fed from 2006 to 2011 and was a top contender to become its chairman late last year when President Trump instead appointed Jerome Powell.\nIf he had returned to the Fed, Mr. Warsh said, he would have appointed a team to think about the Fed creating FedCoin, where we would bring legal activities into a digital coin.\nNot that it would supplant and replace cash, he said, but it would be a pretty effective way when the next crisis happens for us to maybe conduct monetary policy.\nHe added that blockchain technology, which allows reliable, decentralized record keeping of transactions, could be useful in the payment systems operated by the Fed, which enable the transfer of trillions of dollars between banks.\nIt strikes me that a central bank digital currency might have a role to play there, Mr. Warsh, who is now a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, told several reporters Thursday evening.\nSome central banks are already doing work in this vein, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of England. And Mr. Powell acknowledged the potential applications in his confirmation hearing for the Fed chairmanship in November, saying, We actually look at blockchain as something that may have significant applications in the wholesale payments part of the economy.\nIt would be quite a twist if a technology whose most ardent fans are motivated by distrust of central banks became a key tool for those banks.\nBut it would address some of the concerns connected to Bitcoin and its many privately created rivals. To the degree that the value of existing cryptocurrencies fluctuates wildly, they are ill-suited as a medium of exchange. Central banks have spent hundreds of years learning how to keep the value of money stable .\nAnd to the degree Bitcoin and the like facilitate tax evasion, money laundering and fraud, they will be a target of global law enforcement. Central banks are used to building systems that allow enforcement of those laws.\nIts clear that central banks weighing use of blockchain technology dont share the more anarchist impulses of some of the most die-hard cryptocurrency enthusiasts. But there may be more commonality than it might seem. As Mr. Warsh argues, if people really do believe that digital currencies in some form are the future of money, it would behoove central banks to treat them as more than a novelty.\nCongress gave the Fed a monopoly over money, Mr. Warsh said. And if the next generation of cryptocurrencies look more like money and less like gold  and have less volatility associated with them so they would be not just a speculative asset but could be a reliable unit of account  as a purely defensive matter I wouldnt want somebody to take that monopoly from me.\nIn other words, if cryptocurrency enthusiasts are correct that this technology could become a better way of carrying out even routine transactions, the Fed and its counterparts are the institutions that have the most to lose.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/u...ays-maybe.html What is the lake of fire ?

Services include covering fees for identification cards and license plates.\nCitizens will also be able to pay their property tax bills with Bitcoin. Volatility concerns\nOne of the main concerns related to Bitcoin, as you know, is its volatility. For governments, the risk is very much a concern because if Bitcoin’s price slips, governments could end up not collecting the full amount of whatever they are collecting from citizens.\nThis could be detrimental to their budgets.\nTo address this issue, Seminole County is working with BitPay. To a local media outlet, BitPay’s head of compliance said the following:\n“The county tax office won’t face any volatility risk. There’s no risk to the taxpayer,” said Greenberg, who has often raised eyebrows since his 2016 election by moves including encouraging certain employees with concealed-weapons permits to carry a firearm openly as a security measure. “Blockchain technology is the future of the whole financial industry.” Governments warm to crypto\nSeminole will join at least one other government in the U.S. in allowing for Bitcoin payments.\nWe’ve reported to you about Arizona lawmakers drafting legislation that would allow citizens to cover their tax obligations with Bitcoin.\nThe bill is currently sitting on the governor’s desk, waiting to be signed into law. If he does sign it, which he is expected to do, it would make the western state the first in the U.S. to allow for such crypto-related concessions. × Stay up to date with market trends and exclusive crypto news!

The ratings , which rank an initial tranche of 28 assets by three criteria – technology, application and innovation – come courtesy of what Beijing referred to as “domestic experts” earlier this month.\nThe project is under the control of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology’s China Electronic Information Industry Development department (CCID).\nHaving only announced ratings plans at a Beijing conference May 11, the results have appeared in record time, but may be set to frustrate certain members of cryptocurrency industry as China’s experts ranked Bitcoin in thirteenth place.\nEven more curiously, below Ethereum at the number one spot, second came Steem, the crypto token used by the Steemit social network.\nThese were followed by Lisk, NEO and Komodo respectively.

estimates that by the end of 2018, bitcoin mining could consume as much as half a percent of annual worldwide electricity — enough to power Austria.\nFor perspective, that would be the power from one of every eight wind turbines on the planet, or one-third of global solar power capacity.\nIt could run more than 6 million average U.S. homes, or all of New York City for more than a year.\nBitcoin's vast power appetite is thanks to mining, where computers crunch complex math problems for a reward of more bitcoins.\nAs more miners try to solve the problems, the difficulty of the computations — and therefore the amount of power required — increases.\nAnd this great financial experiment isn't all powered with renewable energy.\nIt's responsible for more than 30 megatons of annual carbon emissions right now — equivalent to more than 7 million cars on the road, or about 1 million transatlantic flights.\nThe good news for the environment is that bitcoin is a scarce resource, and its algorithm rewards fewer coins as time goes on.\nBy 2140, there'll be no rewards left and no reason to run power-hungry mining computers.\nSEE MORE: Bitcoin Took A Wild, Volatile Ride In 2017 It's hard to say whether bitcoin will soak up energy until then or if it will start to taper off.\nIt's expensive to run mining operations, but as long as the price of bitcoin is high enough, people will keep mining. If it stays profitable, researchers say bitcoin could eventually be responsible for 5 percent of global energy usage — which could run every data center in the U.S. right now.

Ethereum ‘Typical’ Says Chinese Press\n“The results show that the typical representative of the second-generation blockchain technology is Ethereum’s technology assessment index with a smart contract function of 129.4, ranking first in the assessment list, and the evaluation index is ranked second to fifth,” local news outlet China Electronics News summarizes linked by social media resource CnLedger. 1/ Public blockchain ratings by China’s ministry is out: #Ethereum ranks top of the 28 cryptos evaluatedSource (in Chinese): https://t.co/9jStIiFKcc\n— cnLedger (@cnLedger) May 17, 2018\nThe unlikely underperformance of Bitcoin in the ratings echoes the results of the world’s first such endeavour from Weiss Ratings earlier this year.\nThe agency’s findings caused a furore when they appeared in January, Bitcoin receiving an overall score of ‘C+’ (later upgraded to a B-) while Ethereum also topped its list with a ‘B.’\nOther famous names also failed to impress China meanwhile, Litecoin attaining only twenty-first place, four places ahead of Bitcoin Cash.\nEthereum Classic was sixteenth, Ripple seventeenth and Dash eighteenth, while Bytecoin achieved twentieth.\nWhat do you think about China’s cryptocurrency ratings?

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading as high as $8880 USD on May 14, the first day of Consensus, but is today trading at about $8340 USD according to CoinMarketCap .\nThe Consensus conference attracted 8500 attendees according to Forbes . Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey gave the headline talk yesterday, in which he championed cryptocurrency without endorsing bitcoin specifically.\n\"I'm just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don't know if it will be Bitcoin.\"\nUkrainian Member of Parliament Oleksiy Mushak posted on Facebook that Ukraine is drafting legislation for cryptocurrencies. The post linked to a Google Document which people were encouraged to edit. Mushak said in a rough translation:\n\"Below drafts a bill on general regulation of this market.This is the work of many people and meetings.There are still many nuances left.The final version will be ready in two weeks.Please comment and edit.Thoughts from market practitioners are especially important.\"\nAccording to Science Daily , Bitcoin mining is estimated to consume half a percent of the world's electricity by the end of the year. The piece cites research done in the journal Joule by \"financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex De Vries:\n\"His estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts -- as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world's total consumption. \"To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world's electricity. \"That would be quite bad.\"\"\nSam Mowers, Investorideas.com\nGet the Crypto Corner News by email Get Crypto Corner News\nCrypto Corner Sponsors:\nFlip™ is the creation of Fit Pay, Inc. , a leading provider of cutting edge payment technology and a subsidiary of NXT-ID ( NASDAQ: NXTD ).

It follows that gains made from cryptocurrency transactions can be subjected to tax in a taxpayer’s hands, even if payment was received in the form of another cryptocurrency.”\nLourens added that the relative accessibility of cryptocurrency has meant that, on average, investors are younger, and while they are more tech-savvy than what would have in the past constituted the average in investors, they are generally far less informed regarding the tax and regulatory implications of their dealings.\n“Although ignorance of the law is certainly no excuse, the question must be asked whether SARS will come to the assistance of those who may now face criminal charges, interest and penalties in respect of tax defaults on their cryptocurrency dealings,” said Lourens.\nAmnesty\nLourens said that SARS has on several occasions demonstrated its willingness to adopt special disclosure measures and offer special treatment to defaulting taxpayers.\nIn such instances SARS has made use of either an amnesty programme or a Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme (SVDP) as a mechanism for those who have fallen foul of tax legislation to approach SARS to regularise their affairs on far more favourable terms than they would have received had they been pursued by SARS.\n“Since no such amnesty or SVDP programme is currently on the table, the only option available to those wishing to regularise their tax affairs is the statutory Voluntary Disclosure Programme (VDP),” he said.\n“National Treasury implemented the VDP in 2010 following the success of the 2003/4 amnesty programme and it was initially put in place for the period from November 2010 to October 2011.”\nAccording to Lourens, the VDP has since been legislated as part of the Tax Administration Act of 2011 and has formed a permanent feature of the South African tax landscape since 1 October 2012.\n“In terms of this programme, non-compliant taxpayers may voluntarily approach SARS in an effort to regularise their tax affairs. A successful VDP application will allow a taxpayer to enjoy relief from criminal prosecution, as well as understatement and administrative non-compliance penalties,” he said.\nHowever he cautioned that the unlike the 2003/4 amnesty programme or the SVDP, the statutory VDP does not offer any relief from payment of interest on unpaid taxes, or from the actual underlying tax obligations.\n“Although this programme is available to those who have thus far failed to declare their cryptocurrency transactions, the statutory VDP is far less favourable (and therefore attractive) than the 2003/4 amnesty programme and the subsequent 2016 SVDP,” he said.\nSARS must come to the table\nThe lack of guidance from both SARS and the South African government prior to the recent media statement regarding cryptocurrency transactions is at least partly to blame for the precarious tax position in which many South Africans now find themselves, said Lourens.\n“SARS should therefore give serious consideration to the creation of a further amnesty or SVDP, specifically aimed at non-compliance arising from cryptocurrency transactions,” he said.\n“With new cryptocurrencies and trading platforms being developed daily, the ever-increasing accessibility and relative anonymity that defines cryptocurrency transactions means that, for SARS to effectively investigate all cryptocurrency transactions being entered into by taxpayers, it will require extensive monetary, technological and other resources, to which it arguably does not presently have access.”\nThe legal expert said that SARS should consider implementing an amnesty or SVDP to make it more attractive for cryptocurrency traders and investors to come forward, for its own benefit as well as that of taxpayers and the fiscus.\n“Not only will such an amnesty or SVDP assist SARS in collecting potentially large sums of previously undisclosed tax money without the need for expensive and resource-intensive investigation processes, it will better prepare SARS for investigating cryptocurrency transactions going forward, as well as provide young cryptocurrency traders and investors with a clean slate, thus promoting and facilitating their long-term tax compliance.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillip lourens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hogan lovells", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "revenue service", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lategan", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:06:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "838510876241063ce6db9065fe2c8a14de2dfe99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.hMeo45nVfkv1LMgDbQGiYloWFacAq6ZSrKi3Yo.huWSAda_mXxtaXbT_rlVbmnUeD9JykltG86DCDADCBMYNMcCLEA5m1Avw-", "site_full": "www.speckygeek.com", "site": "speckygeek.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/speckygeek", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Specky Geek", "title": "Bitcoin Conferences rake up Ticket Sales in New York", "title_full": "Bitcoin Conferences rake up Ticket Sales in New York", "published": "2018-05-17T13:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.speckygeek.com/uploads/2018/03/Coins-Girl-Hand.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "838510876241063ce6db9065fe2c8a14de2dfe99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.hMeo45nVfkv1LMgDbQGiYloWFacAq6ZSrKi3Yo.huWSAda_mXxtaXbT_rlVbmnUeD9JykltG86DCDADCBMYNMcCLEA5m1Avw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pritam", "published": "2018-05-17T13:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Conferences rake up Ticket Sales in New York", "text": "Bitcoin Conferences rake up Ticket Sales in New York Home » Internet » Bitcoin Conferences rake up Ticket Sales in New York\nIn the recent years since 2015, cryptocurrency conferences have been a business of their own. The attendance has been increasing significantly since then, and this year’s Bitcoin conference is expected to be nothing less. Back in 2015, the conference had 400 attendees, in 2016, there were about 1400 attendees, and 2017 had an almost doubled attendance. This year’s conference is expected to have more than 4000 attendees. As the conference kicks off this week, the CoinDesk’s Consensus is a three-day conference where one ticket goes for over $2000. Therefore, the conference is expected to bring over $8 Million as a minimum!\nSimilar conferences are expected in coming days, with yet a high entrance fee. This week’s Bitcoin conference which started about three years ago is the centerpiece of a ‘ Blockchain Week ’ in New York. The conference is an event under a partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation. Even though Bitcoin prices have been plunging in recent months, the conference seems to draw more attention. A Move to Revamp Bitcoin Prices\nAround May last year, Bitcoin conference helped to get more attention on cryptocurrencies. The 2017 Consensus bolstered Bitcoin gains to over $2000 after the Ethereal Summit and Token Summit. Bitcoin prices increased to more than $10,000 for the first time which followed Wall Street’s interests in the crypto world. However, the prices have since then fallen to less than half of Bitcoin’s value in different Bitcoin Wallets . But still, the prices are still four times valuable than they were before the Summits in May 2017.\nAfter last year’s Bitcoin conference, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed to as much as $19,000 in December after the Consensus Invest in November 2017. Therefore, this conference might be a move for the conference to revamp Bitcoin prices to ensure BTC regains its value. Differing Opinions\nThere have been diverging opinions about this conference with many people going crazy about the high ticket sales. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin took to his twitter account where he showed disinterest in attending the conference. He said that paying for $2 – $3k to attend the conference is a high level of rent-seeking. He further accused CoinDesk of being reckless in enabling such giveaways to Scams!\nCoindesk took to defend itself showing disappointment in Vitalik’s tweet about CoinDesk’s erroneous report which they apologised for after one of their reporters shared an unverified link to an article.\nAmber Baldet , former J.P Morgan’s Blockchain head, also criticised the high ticket sales for cryptocurrency events. She expressed displeasure to the fact that the conferences do not pay speakers within cryptocurrency communities. Such speakers have to the best interest of Bitcoin to their hearts and require an appreciation for sharing their insights and sometimes new work.\nAmber Baldet is one of the speaker in two of this week’s event, the Ethereal Summit and the Bitcoin Consensus. However, she said she is not getting paid for speaking in any of those conferences since the live stream is being used as a way to democratise access.

The manufacturer, a Chinese based company, is set to partner with Bitmain, a subsidiary of Bitcoin.com to provide Huawei with a Bitcoin wallet for its users. This platform comes as a move for Huawei to upscale its operations into the world of cryptocurrency. However, the wallet will come in the form of a pre-installed app that is available for use from Huawei’s native AppGallery. Most of Huawei users can now smile with this new move to doing business the digital way.\nThe App is one of its kind compared to other apps that are installed on the devices of Huawei. The Bitcoin wallet app will be available for the new devices that will be launched by the company. However, the app will be developed to suit the older devices. This move will catapult the ability of Huawei to do business on the go. Like any other Bitcoin Wallet, this app will be used for sending, receiving and storing Bitcoins.\nPreviously, it has been a challenging endeavor for Chinese to access Bitcoin.com following a ban from the government which restricted access on Google Play and Apple’s iTunes. The first devices with which this new app will be installed include the new Huawei Honor. Amid these restrictions by the government, Bitcoin.com the main BTC miner can expect massive growth in the use of Bitcoin across the globe.\nBitcoin.com vice president Alejandro de la Torre believes that the initiative is an excellent opportunity to venture into the Chinese market. The advanced use of cashless currencies as opposed to traditional money systems is a great move to facilitate instant payments. Thus, the bitcoin wallet is expected to explore new possibilities in the growth of cryptocurrencies.\nAt the same time, Huawei’s vice president Jaime Gonzalo has high expectations, not just about the sale of their devices in China, but also a new dimension on how their customers can make payments with the new bitcoin wallet app. The adoption of this app as a mobile payment platform should bring massive growth in the use of cryptocurrencies.\nThe mobile manufacturer (Huawei) has been in the top slots of embracing digital currency as a mode of payment. There have been previous efforts from Huawei to adopt Blockchain technology. Last April, Huawei launched its own cryptocurrency platform service that was named as Blockchain-as-a-service, commonly referred to as BaaS. Therefore, this move to develop a pre-installed Bitcoin wallet app from AppGallery is undoubtedly a snippet into the future.\nAlso, this platform follows a Blockchain Consortium that Huawei joined in 2016. The Bitcoin wallet platform will be based on the Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 which was developed by Linux. This platform is a development gives companies an opportunity to control their contacts on a ledger network. Thus from this partnering, we can expect nothing but an efficient, user-friendly Bitcoin wallet app.\nThis Bitcoin Wallet will be the first cryptocurrency mobile app offered by Huawei. This new launch is expected to benefit the Chinese market predominantly where Huawei boasts the most significant market share.

Yes, you read that correctly: in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 BTC to purchase two pizzas in Jacksonville, Florida. Now, if you’re familiar with all things bitcoin, the rise and popularity of this digital currency can’t come as a surprise. But if you don’t really know all that much about BTC, you probably have a lot of questions about it, including what it is, how and where does one get bitcoin, and how in the world did someone manage to buy a pizza using it. Well, it all began back in 2009, when a person (or a group of people) using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a white paper introducing the concept of a “new electronic cash system” which would function on a decentralized, peer-to-peer technology (today called blockchain). The main goal here was for people to be able to make transactions without involving banks, governments, and other institutions, i.e. intermediaries. The biggest advantage of the bitcoin network lies in the fact that it works on the basis of consensus and, that way, keeps all your transactions as secure as possible. What does this mean? If you decide to purchase, say, pizza, all the members of the network need to verify your purchase first and only if/when it’s verified, can it go through. Done like this, the system can successfully avoid fraud and misuse—it stops a user from using the same amount of money more than once (double-spending). Once you decide to dive into the world of bitcoin, the first thing you might want to do is explore which digital currency exchange platforms exist, how they differ from one another, and which one would suit your needs the best. When you pick one, you’ll be able to easily buy and sell your bitcoin (exchange it for “real” money), and store it in your digital wallet until you decide to purchase something. The infographic below will tell you all about the process of verification, provide you with some useful stats, and let you know what types of crypto wallets exist. In no time at all, we’re sure you’ll be able to buy your very own pizza!\nSource : https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2018/05/what-is-bitcoin-and-where-can-you-buy-it.html ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T13:46:05.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c35a9011d95a28fcf39ea5678072f535f5d5b06c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVVN7zkCytPb2", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Global-Blockchain-Technologies-Corp-BLKCF-32642/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Global Blockchain Technologies Corp (BLKCF) Stock Message Board - InvestorsHub ", "title": "https://www.ccn.com/china-ranks-ethereum-as-the-worlds-best-blockchain-network-bitcoin-at-13/ - Our", "title_full": "Global Blockchain Technologies Corp (BLKCF): https://www.ccn.com/china-ranks-ethereum-as-the-worlds-best-blockchain-network-bitcoin-at-13/ - Our", "published": "2018-05-17T13:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.058, "main_image": "https://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=staticchart&amp;s=BLKCF&amp;p=3&amp;t=43&amp;showctype=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5565, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c35a9011d95a28fcf39ea5678072f535f5d5b06c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVVN7zkCytPb2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "yamasushi", "published": "2018-05-17T13:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "https://www.ccn.com/china-ranks-ethereum-as-the-worlds-best-blockchain-network-bitcoin-at-13/ - Our", "text": "https://www.ccn.com/china-ranks-ethereum-as-the-worlds-best-blockchain-network-bitcoin-at-13/ - Our Laser Network is built off off Ethereum blockchain!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/china-ranks-ethereum-as-the-worlds-best-blockchain-network-bitcoin-at-13/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:54:12.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "944a4c45c5b8bc0a77ca4e7b945a341532fb9bbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmc6fWNnO7FPvym.yASmG_EI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Altcoin vs bitcoin?", "title_full": "Altcoin vs bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-17T13:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.224, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "944a4c45c5b8bc0a77ca4e7b945a341532fb9bbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmc6fWNnO7FPvym.yASmG_EI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "hengha", "published": "2018-05-17T13:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Altcoin vs bitcoin?", "text": "First of all, I think you are not suitable for this comparison.

However, estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.\n\"We have seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need a more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I am hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based on economics, puts the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland.\nA single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of 2018, he predicts that the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts— as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world's total consumption.\n\"To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he said.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume five percent of the world's electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent the duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins—a process known as 'mining' Bitcoin. However, all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power.\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you are using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there is a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vriess estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine is equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined.\nThat information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T13:47:41.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0b61412911cfbe9311d40111bcf00b5cc1ce335", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSB3aLIJsxIisDBmH0NoAzE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "title_full": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "published": "2018-05-17T13:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.105, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0b61412911cfbe9311d40111bcf00b5cc1ce335", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSB3aLIJsxIisDBmH0NoAzE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tukang Becak", "published": "2018-05-17T13:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "text": "I think bitcoin is the type of investment so I say that bitcoin is better than any investment, of course this is because the bitcoin price increase reaches more than 100% per year while the profit share is not more than 15% per year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:58:54.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "963535386a44c6f8c2d9056abba7feee0f7d2ed5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8EKhX1l4Jf.EXXzOCEr_pMFL0vdcz7cc4FRp3n84p0CtWnf3oQyaAeHyJdaNQwfISRGf_Pvyhzdw--", "site_full": "www.forocoches.com", "site": "forocoches.com", "site_section": "https://www.forocoches.com/foro/forumdisplay.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "General -

The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. The third largest market share of cryptocurrency, XRP, is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012.\nHere are all three cryptocurrency prices over time along with their trading volume. Data for all three is sourced from Coinbase.com and by request, we have shortened the time frame for a more recent picture.\nWe have also created an index in order to chart these together given their very different pricing history.

Set up the software by linking it to your worker created in Step 7. “Click Settings”>“Account…”. Beside “User Name:” use the username you created when creating the BitMinter account. Beside “Worker Name:” and “Worker Password:” enter the worker name and worker password you created in Step 6. If the window is small, click the button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then click the “Engine Start” button beside each of the devices you want to use. For reference, I get about 65 Mhps (million hashes per second). 1000 Khps = 1 Mhps. Test all of your devices, but you should really only bother running devices that get you 25 Mhps or above. You will also want to change a few settings regarding automation. I leave my computer on all day and all night. I normally turn off the mining as soon as I get home from work (around 6:00) and have the miner start on its own at night in case I forget to start it when I’m done with my computer. Go to Settings > Options to change these settings. Look at the fourth picture to set it up like how I have it set up. The picture has explanations.\nAutomated devices are a list of devices that you set so that you can start them on their own automatically when the software starts. I have selected one of my devices as automated so that when the software starts, only that device starts. See fourth picture for more details. Step 9: Mine. Let your computer run while it mines! Running it at night is a good idea as it will double the amount of money you make. Good luck making money. Step 10: Spend Your Bitcoins. What good is a currency if you can’t spend it? The answer is it’s not. There are lots of things you can do. Below is a list: Gamble. SatoshiDice. Bitzino. Peerbet. RoyalBitcoin. Buy various merchandise. Some online vendors are starting to accept bitcoins s a way of purchasing items. Buy Coffee at http://bitcoincoffee.com/. Trade it for PayPal money. Mt. Gox Bitcoin Exchange. The last one I want to talk about it Mt. Gox. It is the most common website used to trade (buy or sell) bitcoins for dollars or any other national currency. You can receive this money through PayPal or many other online currency transfer services. I am not going to go through the details of this, but to send bitcoins to anyone or any service, follow the instructions in the next step.\nStep 11: Send Bitcoins to Someone. To use bitcoins, you must send bitcoins to another address. To send bitcoins, the service will give you a specific address to send bitcoins to. Copy this address. Open up your bitcoin wallet. Click on the “Send coins” tab. Enter the address you want to send the coins to in the “Pay to” field. If you are going to send coins to this person or group multiple times, you can enter a label for this person so that you can find them in your address book again. Enter the amount in the next field (for easy math, remember that 1 BTC is $10). Click send when you are done. If you just want to practice sending bitcoins to someone, you can test sending them to me. Just send 0.01 BTC to me (approx. 10 cents). Good luck. Step 12: Done. And that is just about all the basic information about bitcoins. If you have any questions, or there is something really obvious and important that I had missed, drop me a comment. I’ll try to respond as quickly as possible. If you want to donate, send me a bitcoin or two at 16bVf7XX3dKN2zW6ut8FRSQaGZZBHAFYZt. Any donations, no matter how big or small, will be appreciated.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-2/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bitcoincoffee.com/.", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banking and financial services / learning about bitcoin-part", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martedì giugno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:55:47.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9056a1fa10e3f4d33a7d1dd99dee2c4fa339a919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wgtgEXMmfhkTykjGohAj0unkqRrEi9mf4ahNGX_ngQN6o1OdTfrKg.4ESFxyudiQ-", "site_full": "www.ecns.cn", "site": "ecns.cn", "site_section": "http://www.ecns.cn/rss/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "ecns", "title": "Bitcoin predicted to use half a pct of world's electricity by end of 2018: study", "title_full": "Bitcoin predicted to use half a pct of world's electricity by end of 2018: study", "published": "2018-05-17T13:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11991, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9056a1fa10e3f4d33a7d1dd99dee2c4fa339a919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wgtgEXMmfhkTykjGohAj0unkqRrEi9mf4ahNGX_ngQN6o1OdTfrKg.4ESFxyudiQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T13:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin predicted to use half a pct of world's electricity by end of 2018: study", "text": "Bitcoin predicted to use half a pct of world's electricity by end of 2018: study 1 2018-05-17 10:15 Xinhua Editor: Gu Liping ECNS App Download\nA peer-reviewed article published on Wednesday in the journal Joule estimated that the bitcoin network could be using half of one percent of the world's total electric consumption.\nFinancial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries used a new method to pinpoint where Bitcoin's electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there.\nHis estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland does.\nA single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month, according to the study.\nBy the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts, as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world's total consumption.\n\"To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" said de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist, a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5 percent of the world's electricity. \"That would be quite bad.\"\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins, a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. But all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power.\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" said de Vries.

Beijing conference.\n“First-rate domestic experts and scholars” contributed to the ratings, which they calculated on the basis of three indexes: “technology,”“application” and “innovation.”\nEthereum scored highly across all three, giving it a lead rating which echoes its first place in Weiss’ cryptocurrency ratings from January this year.\nConversely, Bitcoin appeared lacking in the “technology”

$8.235. As I expected, the price tested the level of $10.353. In less than five hours, zclassic will fork to create bitcoin private, a new privacy-oriented coin that uses zk-snarks to obfuscate transactions. Holders of bitcoin and zclassic will both be eligible to receive bitcoin private (BTCP) on a 1:1 basis. There's just one problem: 93% of all zlcassic (ZCL) is on Bittrex exchange, which until today had neglected to pass comment on whether it would support the fork. As the price of ZCL has dropped sharply, bagholders have expressed their anger at Bittrex' slowness to act. The technical picture on Bitcoin looks bearish.\nTrading recommendations:\nAccording to the H1 time - frame, I found that price did successful breakout of larger bearish flag, which is sign that sellers are in control. I also found a smaller bearish flag in creation, which is sign that buying looks risky. My advice is to watch for potential selling opportunities. The downward targets are set at the price of $8.067 and at the price of $7.668.\nSupport/Resistance", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bittrex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:42:34.132+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c726fa408e5e985e762c5d83296855d4d5d59af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSR4lkStkTUfFj5612L5Q.mGotFySEeQncy9so9hOf3HPKvMguDnluoeJuU3tyReFc-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Bitcoin Price Can Hit Previous Highs After ‘Structure’ Improves: CoinShares CEO", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Can Hit Previous Highs After ‘Structure’ Improves: CoinShares CEO", "published": "2018-05-17T13:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c726fa408e5e985e762c5d83296855d4d5d59af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSR4lkStkTUfFj5612L5Q.mGotFySEeQncy9so9hOf3HPKvMguDnluoeJuU3tyReFc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T13:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Can Hit Previous Highs After ‘Structure’ Improves: CoinShares CEO", "text": "\nCoinShares says building out the Bitcoin and ICO ecosystem is key to allowing the cryptocurrency to return to previous price highs.\nUK cryptocurrency investment products and research provider CoinShares believes Bitcoin will hit previous highs after people “build” on the ecosystem, its CEO said May 16.\nSpeaking to CNBC on the network’s Fast Money segment, Danny Masters identified several changes which would need to occur in order for Bitcoin to see the $20,000 price tag once again.\n“We need to see this structure continue to build,” he told presenters.\n“We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided.

At the \"Money 20/20\" conference in Las Vegas, back in October last year, he said that Bitcoin is better than gold and the US dollar.\nAccording to Wozniak, Bitcoin’s big advantage is that there is only a limited amount of coins, while fiat money, like the US dollar or euro, can simply be printed by banks.\nNonetheless, Wozniak sold all his bitcoins except one, as he said at the WeAreDevelopers Conference in Vienna, because “[he] does not want to be an investor and constantly watch the prices.” ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://de.cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-ceo-says-bitcoin-will-become-worlds-single-currency-within-a-decad", "https://www.wearedevelopers.com/", "https://de.cointelegraph.com/news/apple-co-founder-blockchain-is-an-interesting-technology-but-not-yet-ready-for-the-market", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/money2020-wozniak-thinks-bitcoin-better-gold/", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/twitter", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T13:34:59.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22e700282162902a7206edea70ffec26c1e5cd93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQAseFkkXnyK08wZewaAr6wxeFb_O_C0v6n1.MFSbkfcA--", "site_full": "hypebeast.com", "site": "hypebeast.com", "site_section": "https://hypebeast.com/", "site_categories": ["fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "HYPEBEAST", "title": "Bitfury's Blockbox AC Is a 500sq-Ft Bitcoin Mining Station", "title_full": "Bitfury's Blockbox AC Is a 500sq-Ft Bitcoin Mining Station", "published": "2018-05-17T12:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7576, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22e700282162902a7206edea70ffec26c1e5cd93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQAseFkkXnyK08wZewaAr6wxeFb_O_C0v6n1.MFSbkfcA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HYPEBEAST (info@hypebeast.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T12:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitfury's Blockbox AC Is a 500sq-Ft Bitcoin Mining Station", "text": "\nThose looking to make a huge upgrade from their single bitcoin AntMiner can look no further.

The price of one Bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20 000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known Bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the Internet will have its own \"native currency\". He said he hoped that would be Bitcoin. \"I am a huge fan.\"\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey's Bitcoin and crypto-currency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of Bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n\"If we were able to use it as a currency today (...) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T16:09:48.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c57ca96f7c9be5f16e5c52ccd56c14d9c2910336", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7XUtNKNzLp8.UpTdFCacetp4M9CKxMUH0veRsNE20Mbqkw_T9oxvBf1IJs2O7n__rIUvH_EXVUmz6nWAbujEaUELRPhPx1i5P", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "US Government Launches Scam Crypto Site - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "US Government Launches Scam Crypto Site - Bitcoin News : CryptoCurrencies", "published": "2018-05-17T12:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.107, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c57ca96f7c9be5f16e5c52ccd56c14d9c2910336", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7XUtNKNzLp8.UpTdFCacetp4M9CKxMUH0veRsNE20Mbqkw_T9oxvBf1IJs2O7n__rIUvH_EXVUmz6nWAbujEaUELRPhPx1i5P", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stardedlee", "published": "2018-05-17T12:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "US Government Launches Scam Crypto Site - Bitcoin News", "text": "submitted by /u/Stardedlee\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-launches-scam-crypto-site/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T09:32:49.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34e9950077321e2a50d8001d925a41c52b6e6836", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBKkhqn4_rSOg3WDvQ2iCbkdnbZ0RCcD17.XmrDCXzaPhRtI95nIuyDEXQTcCE..PuzkvseXOscjsrqdVRztptmw0dFNkFWJcBoNsdUlT5cyhzW5Hg80u_wfw--", "site_full": "anynote.co", "site": "anynote.co", "site_section": "https://anynote.co/rss/?id=1", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Latest Blogs", "title": "Chat Introduces Its Cryptolike Perform To Evaluate Video Weblog Contestants Bitcoin Isle", "title_full": "Chat Introduces Its Cryptolike Perform To Evaluate Video Weblog Contestants Bitcoin Isle", "published": "2018-05-17T12:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34e9950077321e2a50d8001d925a41c52b6e6836", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBKkhqn4_rSOg3WDvQ2iCbkdnbZ0RCcD17.XmrDCXzaPhRtI95nIuyDEXQTcCE..PuzkvseXOscjsrqdVRztptmw0dFNkFWJcBoNsdUlT5cyhzW5Hg80u_wfw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gladys Wenz", "published": "2018-05-17T12:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chat Introduces Its Cryptolike Perform To Evaluate Video Weblog Contestants Bitcoin Isle", "text": "by Gladys Wenz on 11 minutes ago 3 views All people has a transparent understanding of how the following-generation messenger ought to appear like as has seen the doubtful rules of which the leaders of the sector work beneath in nowadays.

Additionally, they just started with their token sale. The public pre-sale is currently LIVE and will last for 9 days . Check more at https://ico.cherr.io/. Furthermore, the launch of their official crowdsale will be on 1st of June and last until 15th of June .\nThough under personal pressure to deliver, for the love of their project, they are keeping their minds focused on the realization of their unique vision – a fundraising platform that will improve and expand existing charitable donations processes, increase their transparency and reinforce the trust that people have in charitable organizations.\nOn the CHERR.IO platform, crafted on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures traceability and full auditability of transactions, you can already find live charity campaigns . Recently, their focus was to help two little boys with cerebral paralysis regain strength to walk. The CHERR.IO team met with them and admired their remarkable efforts, shown in this unforgettable video.\nIn the last couple of months the journey was very exciting for the very committed CHERR.IO team. Besides the fact that their project was very well received by the crypto community and wider audience, they also managed to reach some important milestones such as winning FutureHack , the first ever hackathon that took place in Davos during this year’s World Economic Forum. At this event, top developers from all over Europe created blockchain solutions to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Additionally, the Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar honorably announced CHERR.IO as “ the most inspirational project from Slovenia ”. They also continued to receive a lot of positive feedback from investors and business leaders whilst they presented their blockchain project at different conferences around the globe. Moreover, they also won the ‘ICO Demo Day’, after receiving an invitation from the ‘Business Angels of Slovenia’ to present their project to an audience consisting of local qualified investors, the CEE Region and broader. The CHERR.IO team did not stop here. They partnered with Caritas Maribor , one of the oldest and biggest charity organisations in Slovenia and also a member of Caritas Internationalis and Caritas Europe. By embracing blockchain technology and fulfilling their mission to show love and care for the people in need, they became a pioneering blockchain charity organisation.\nOn their path to disrupting the ways traditional charitable organisations work, CHERR.IO also enjoys the support from their renowned and diverse advisory board – exceptional individuals like Jacob Papageorgiou, Giovanni Lesna, Vladimir Nikitin, Melinda Woolf, Niko Slavnič, Grey Jabesi . Finally, words cannot express the gratitude they want to show towards the support they have been receiving from their community, which is more of a family – getting stronger every day.\nCHERR.IO’s co-founder, Aljaz Straser states\n“For us charity work is all about people. That is why we gave them powers to decide. Our community, chooses who and where their donations will go towards.”\nNotably, they are equally grateful for receiving very high ratings on well-known ICO listings, made by expert reviewers.\nMoreover, they are the first to utilize a gamified rewarding mechanism on a charity platform.\nThe CHERR.IO team Commented;\n“We believe these incentives will help us attract cryptocurrency users from all over the world that are willing to donate or just actively participate for rewards whilst simultaneously help others. “With the support of our community we are confident that we can improve and save many lives. This also means truly reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) .”\nTo learn more visit the Website: https://www.cherr.io/ Meet the Team – https://www.linkedin.com/company/cherrio/ Chat with us on Telegram – https://t.me/CherrioPlatform Connect on Twitter – https://twitter.com/CherrioPlatform Join the community on Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/CherrioPlatform Subscribe to our Subreddit – https://www.reddit.com/r/cherrio/ Catch up on Medium – https://medium.com/cherr-io\nMedia Contact Contact Name: Aljaz Contact Email: aljaz@cherr.io\nCHERR.IO is the source of this content.

Photo: Bloomberg Ben Kwok - May 17, 2018 5:14pm Bankers eager to meet Chinese bitcoin miners\nInvestment bankers still have a vivid recollection of that time, about a decade ago, when mainland mining bosses descended on Hong Kong to list their companies on the local stock exchange.\nThe executives looked ill at ease in their suits, and their big, blackened hands – a testament to their hard work and the long hours they spent in the coalpits – provided a stark contrast to the gold watches they were wearing.\nBut they were very friendly and carried a lot of cash, eager to foot the restaurant tab and impress the bankers.\nWell, there’s a new generation of Chinese miners who are coming to town for the same purpose: to seek capital in the local stock market.\nBut these miners don’t spend their time in coal mines, but rather in front of large computers. Their business is cryptocurrencies, and they want their companies listed in Hong Kong later this year.\nAccording to IFR, two of the world’s largest bitcoin plays plan to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as soon as this year with each seeking to raise as much as US$1 billion.\nCanaan Creative has applied to launch an initial public offering in the city, while Zhejiang Ebang Communication has started working with financial advisers for a listing.\nThe two listings would be a good test for international investors’ appetite for cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underpins them.\nDespite a 35 percent decline in the value of bitcoin this year, blockchain is a hot investor theme because many industries, including banks, are interested in using the technology in their business.\nCanaan, which claims to supply a quarter of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power, reported a 361 million yuan (US$56.7 million) profit last year, up from 52.54 million in 2016, according to its IPO prospectus. Turnover in 2017 was 1.3 billion yuan, up from 316 million yuan in the previous year.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan’s IPO.\nIn January, Ebang said it would seek a Hong Kong listing after it delisted from the mainland’s New Third Board.\nBut valuation remains a big unknown because of the highly fluctuating price of bitcoin and lack of comparison in the global market.\nIn Canada, HIVE Blockchain, formerly called Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, engaged in bitcoin mining in Iceland with a market capitalization of US$333 million. In Australia, DigitalX, which took over Macro Energy via a backdoor listing in 2014, was valued at US$82.76 million.\nInvestment bankers, of course, are eager to meet this new generation of miners, but they are not likely to be shaking hands with people with blackened hands and gold watches this time around.\nCG", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben kwok", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong stock exchan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:56:31.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de831e4d8aac8562a83d96153ab68bf34bb2d7ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywqtwuJRJa5DQkT1dKvtOf1VRJEzmI8wY2tdcpOsGJbJk3hzx1yLS6iA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Struggling Near $8,500", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Struggling Near $8,500", "published": "2018-05-17T12:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de831e4d8aac8562a83d96153ab68bf34bb2d7ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywqtwuJRJa5DQkT1dKvtOf1VRJEzmI8wY2tdcpOsGJbJk3hzx1yLS6iA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T12:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Struggling Near $8,500", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin price found support above $8,000 and recovered nicely against the US Dollar. There is a breakout pattern forming with resistance near $8,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to move above the $8,500 resistance the 100 hourly simple moving average to gain momentum. Bitcoin price is struggling to break the $8,500 resistance against the US Dollar. BTC/USD may trade in a range above $8,200 before the next move.\nBitcoin Price Analysis After forming a base around the $8,080 , bitcoin price started an upside recovery against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair managed to move above the $8,200 resistance level to post intraday gains. It also broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low. There were a few positive signs above the $8,200 level, but the price struggled to break a major barrier at $8,500.\nThe 100 hourly simple moving average at $8,500 prevented gains . There were two attempts by buyers to break the stated $8,500 resistance, but they failed. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low also acted as a resistance. It seems like there is a breakout pattern forming with resistance near $8,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is currently declining and testing the triangle support at $8,200.
