That’s about $150 less than where the currency stood yesterday. Bitcoin has been marred by ups and downs for the last 1.5 weeks, and it appears they aren’t ceasing anytime soon. Since May 5, bitcoin has been on shaky ground. The currency was originally slated to hit $10,000 after it reached a $9,800 high, but sadly, this never occurred. In fact, bitcoin has undergone steady drops ever since and is now trading for $1,500 less. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee attributes this to what he calls a lagging “trifecta of progress.” The cryptocurrency analyst states that for cryptocurrency to succeed, it requires: Institutional custody and tools; Buy-in by banks and investment managers; Regulatory clarity. At press time, it appears only the first two requirements have been satisfied. In terms of classifications, many cryptocurrencies are still trapped in the dark and unsure of where they stand or what regulations they should adhere to. Still, however, a lack of regulatory clarity isn’t getting in the way of some analysts’ predictions regarding bitcoin’s future. Rodrigo Marques, for example, is chief executive of Atlas Quantum , one of Brazil’s largest crypto-trading platforms. In a recent interview, Marques made the bold prediction that bitcoin would strike $20,000 territory within the next six months , and that $8,000 was an interim low for the father of cryptocurrencies. That means we can all expect bitcoin to more than double in value by the time Thanksgiving rolls along. In addition, the regulatory uncertainty that Tom Lee says is plaguing the cryptocurrency market could be about to diminish, as the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is set to provide “tighter guidance on the digital currency market” in the future. While speaking at the North American Securities Administrators Association Conference in Washington, CFTC chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the financial body is on the verge of publishing what he calls a “staff directory” that will ultimately provide further guidance to both clearinghouses and cryptocurrency exchanges that list derivative contracts based on digital assets. “This advisory will reflect CFTC staff’s current thinking based on our growing experience with virtual currency derivatives,” Giancarlo explained. “As new products are brought forth, staff will re-evaluate and revisit the advisory, as necessary, to address any new and emerging issues.” It is difficult to accept that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are still birthing technologies. While entitles like bitcoin have been around for some time, the systems behind them are still adapting to news, trends, forks, software changes and other elements. Thus, it’s difficult for governing financial bodies to garner the experience they need to regulate and control them. On one hand, this kind of regulation and control goes against what bitcoin and its crypto-cousins originally stood for. Then again, with threats like hackings and thefts consistently showing their ugly faces in the virtual currency space, regulation may be the one thing that could set concerns to rest, and put the values and prices of these cryptocurrencies where they deserve to be. It will be interesting, to say the least, to see if bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices do wind up benefiting from newfound regulation attempts in the coming months.

To recover his investment, Bhatt’s accomplices kidnapped a person by posing as income tax officials. india Updated: May 22, 2018 12:34 IST HT Correspondent Hindustan Times, Ahmedabad The Gujarat police have booked a Surat-based builder and eight others for allegedly extorting over Rs 155 crore in cash and bitcoins from two persons.(Reuters File Photo)\nThe Gujarat police have booked a Surat-based builder Shailesh Bhatt and eight others for allegedly extorting over Rs 155 crore in cash and bitcoins from two persons.\nBhatt had in February accused a team of Amreli crime branch police of abducting him and extorting 176 bitcoins worth Rs 7.5 crore from him.\nNine policemen, including a superintendent of police, were booked on his complaint.\nWhile investigating the case, the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) learnt about a bitcoin ponzi scheme worth Rs 1,000 crore, in which Bhatt had invested.\n“Around two years back, one Satish Kumbhani of Surat floated a company called Bit Connect and lured people like Bhatt to invest in it to get huge returns. Bhatt had invested Rs 2 crore in it. However, its promoters shut shop in January this year and went underground,” said director general of police (CID) Ashish Bhatia.\nTo recover his investment, Bhatt’s accomplices first kidnapped one Piyush Savalia by posing as income tax officials. Savalia used to work with Bit Connect and was confined in a farm house at gun point for three days in January, Bhatia said.\n“On February 1, Bhatt’s men kidnapped Dhaval Mavani at gun-point and forced him to transfer 2,256 bitcoins worth Rs 131 crore into their account. The builder and his accomplices had also transferred another set of 166 bitcoins worth Rs 9.64 crore into their account,” said Bhatia.\nTo set Mavani free, Bhatt and his accomplices also extorted Rs 14.5 crore in cash from his family, which the builder received through the Angadia service (an unofficial cash courier service), he said.\n“Bhatt and his accomplices extorted bitcoins and cash worth a total of Rs 155.14 crore. Later, they distributed the bitcoins among themselves. Bhatt had kept around 700 bitcoins,” the CID official said, adding that since Bhatt was not tech-savvy, he took the help of his nephew Nikunj Bhatt to transfer these bitcoins.\nThe entire conspiracy was unearthed when Savalia was questioned by the CID recently. Bhatia said Bhatt had even paid Rs 34.5 lakh to Savalia to give a false statement that he was never kidnapped by the builder and his men.\nWhile two persons, including Bhatt’s nephew, Nikunj Bhatt, and Dilip Kanani have been arrested on charges of kidnapping and extortion, a search is on for others, said Bhatia.\n“A fresh FIR against Bhatt and his nine aides has been registered after new details emerged during the ongoing probe in the February case,’’ Bhatia told reporters.\nAfter the arrest, the sleuths recovered 152 bitcoins (Rs 8.58 crore), which were in Kanani’s “wallet”.\nIt all started when Bhatt alleged that Amreli policemen had kidnapped him and his business partner Kirit Paladia from Gandhinagar on February 9 and extorted bitcoins.\nBhatt had alleged that former BJP MLA Nalian Kotadiya was also involved in the conspiracy to extort bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore.\nSo far, Paladia, Amreli superintendent of police Jagdish Patel, Amreli crime branch inspector Anant Patel, two constables and a middleman have been arrested in the case.\nSeven constables of Amreli district police, allegedly involved in the case, are on the run.\nRecently, a sessions court here had also issued arrest warrant against Nalin Kotadiya, who has been evading arrest ever since his involvement was surfaced during the probe.\n(With agency inputs) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satish k", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "criminal investigation department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amreli", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:08:44.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81685dc97330ef89840b4a01394cd51845929105", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C213is_uD3Ou9ijnjYsPM6XYH8WD7toPnz6O8ZTOIP76nZtuQBxQoNJNqpM6KA0A9XBmnLnEbnqCqwuXU.lJREKB_hVxOmnHEkEpZPK4S1BK8HVyllrLayYZRSOQJMNUqlq35qvdRzrJ6Q--", "site_full": "us.ibnmoney.com", "site": "ibnmoney.com", "site_section": "http://us.ibnmoney.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media", "world_soccer", "sports"], "section_title": "IBNMoney United States US", "title": "There’s a ‘decent probability’ bitcoin goes to zero, says Vanguard economist", "title_full": "There’s a ‘decent probability’ bitcoin goes to zero, says Vanguard economist", "published": "2018-05-22T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81685dc97330ef89840b4a01394cd51845929105", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C213is_uD3Ou9ijnjYsPM6XYH8WD7toPnz6O8ZTOIP76nZtuQBxQoNJNqpM6KA0A9XBmnLnEbnqCqwuXU.lJREKB_hVxOmnHEkEpZPK4S1BK8HVyllrLayYZRSOQJMNUqlq35qvdRzrJ6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "us_admin", "published": "2018-05-22T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "There’s a ‘decent probability’ bitcoin goes to zero, says Vanguard economist", "text": "You are here: US Home > News > There’s a ‘decent probability’ bitcoin goes to zero, says Vanguard economist There’s a ‘decent probability’ bitcoin goes to zero, says Vanguard economist (marketwatch.com) Tuesday, May 22nd, 2018 at 7:00 am\nTue, 22 May 2018 00:22:27 GMT – A senior economist at the Vanguard Group, the $5 trillion investment fund, is the latest market participant to pour cold water on the No. 1 digital currency.

But it’s not just homeowners that have given up everything in the pursuit of crypto glory: one man has forsaken his apartment in favor of living out of his car. It’s a life choice that even the most ardent of bitcoin maximalists would deem excessive, but then crypto has a tendency to attract extremists possessed with a fervent zeal.\nThe Canadian man, posting under the handle “Livinginmycar”, shared his sleeping arrangements on 4chan’s biz message board, where crypto traders assemble to shitpost and share portfolios. Some commenters were supportive of his cause, while others were less sympathetic, one writing: “How fucking retarded are you brainlet, when you think that crypto will make you rich?…Money was made and you missed the train. Good luck waking up with 30 and being broke.” OP (i.e the original poster who started the thread) remains undaunted however, explaining how he balks at paying $800 per month in rent because “that money belongs in my crypto stack”.\nLiving in a Garage, Working in a Warehouse\nThe man explains that he parks his car in his friend’s garage to sleep, for which he pays $40 CAD per month. Despite the cramped conditions, he hasn’t forgone all home comforts, finding space to squeeze in a memory foam mattress and comfy quilts. He’s also able to shower at a friend’s house and store some items there. As for his crypto portfolio, the unnamed Canadian is currently pinning his hopes on Collosusxt, Fundrequest, Policypal, and Dero.\nDuring the day, the man works as a forklift driver in a warehouse and in the evenings he delivers food. His own meals come in the form of takeaway, but he claims to try and eat healthily. Some biz posters who had cheered the guy in the original thread, in which he first proposed his car living scheme, have since withdrawn their support after seeing the coins he’s coveting. OP’s portfolio reportedly stands at $6,000 CAD, but he professes to be adding an additional $2,500 per month.\nWhile commenters were divided on whether OP will make it in his quest to become crypto rich, it was widely agreed that he’ll have a memorable tale to tell years from now. As high risk strategies go, giving up your apartment and going all in on altcoins is about as perilous as it gets. Win or lose, OP will be able to look back and know that he gave it his all in his one shot for glory.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T11:31:59.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "083a5f2d07690a96daf904d1f6359ec3a16c6a89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPp98cqkHqycfMs21syP3b2fIaMa5lGicXD6S74h07sGt9QW5qYoOddyf0lP6.iWMU5XqT4JXUk96YD5eoZL0kfuaMfx.vM_.Iw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Coindesk (not just anyone but the organizer of NYC Bitcoin Conference) is openly supporting an obvious scam!

Though I am open to [login to view URL] addition, I have the design specifications and mock ups ready.\nYou should also be good at: Real time location maps, Qr code and bitcoin security protocols.\nAPPLY WITH A DETAIL BUT SIMPLE DESCRIPTION ON HOW YOU WILL BUILD THIS APP AND IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE BUILDING BITCOIN APPS FROM SCARTCH\n(Note that you will be require to sign a NDA before you start the project)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T10:01:48.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c1d0da6f9e63b3ec8f6ac44a451e99327933ac4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfI8A_EzUGjT1LnqwOfszcw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin to be used as world currency?", "title_full": "Bitcoin to be used as world currency?", "published": "2018-05-22T09:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.723, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c1d0da6f9e63b3ec8f6ac44a451e99327933ac4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfI8A_EzUGjT1LnqwOfszcw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tuikindu", "published": "2018-05-22T09:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin to be used as world currency?", "text": "Bitcoin cannot become a universal currency because it is so volatile that we all know that a currency with a lot of volatility is not an exchange.

In it, Davis wrote that there’s a high likelihood that bitcoin, which currently sits around $8,200, is going to become worthless. Yep, as in zero dollars per coin. As for why, Davis says:\nadvertisement The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use. The speculation creates volatility that, ironically, undermines their value as a currency.\nBut that’s not to say Davis is a Debby Downer about everything related to bitcoin.

On Saturday, BCH miners reportedly had a meeting dedicated to funding for a BCH development fund. Miners are looking to allocate some part of the reward they receive from mining and invest it to expand the BCH ecosystem, Kelly explained. The fund development could aid the rise of the cryptocurrency’s value. He continued: That's how blockchains gain value. You're going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash. After the price surge to $1600 on May 5, BCH subsequently declined to the 50-day SMA and formed a head and shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $650. Over the last 24 hours, BCH has lost almost 5.8 percent in price, from $1290 to $1205. Still it is valued significantly higher than its April level of $760. BCH is a peer-to-peer digital currency established in mid-2017 as a result of the hard fork of Bitcoin that took place to solve the scalability problem. With upgraded consensus rules, BCH is able to grow and increase the size of blocks, allowing more transactions to be processed. Earlier this month the pro-Bitcoin community dropped its plans to level a lawsuit at the site Bitcoin.com . Members were outraged that the crypto and wallet service, which is run by BCH evangelist Roger Ver appeared to be misleading buyers by muddling the distinction between BTC and BCH.

Bitcoin Pizza Day", "text": "May 22, 2018 169 On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyec bought Bitcoin for the first time in the world. This historic moment marks Bitcoin’s second birth after the Genesis bloc: for the first time, Bitcoin fulfilled the purpose of its existence as a direct, electronic means of payment.\nThe history of Bitcoin pizzas is as amazing as it is surprising. 10,000 Bitcoin cost two pizzas eight years ago. An amount in which today many people’s jaw pops on the floor. At a Bitcoin price of around 7,000 euros, that’s over 70 million euros today! But on the other hand one could have asked oneself at the time: “Who takes 10,000 units of this ‘Internet money’, which has no real value?”\nThe finding of the first prize\nFirst, let’s take an abstract look at the market economy. As means of payment money has exchange conditions in all other goods of the economy. That is, the pretzel costs me 0.60 euros, the pudding particles 1.20 euros. Due to the high volume in the market, ie the frequent exchange of money for goods, relatively stable price levels are formed.\nWhen Laszlo Hanyec made the first purchase, there was no volume in the market. Consequently, it was unclear how much a bitcoin was worth. Quite arbitrarily, the amount of 10,000 Bitcoin was agreed, but more is not needed for a first clue.\nFor all subsequent trade, the past could now be used as a basis. The real risk came from the recipient of the Bitcoins, because you could not look into the past to get over the value of Bitcoin.\nWrite 10,000 Bitcoin = 70 million / bitcoin history = priceless\nThose who clap their hands over their heads and think it was a mistake, must remember that Laszlo Hanyec enters the face of Bitcoin. Both Laszlo and the Englishman, who ordered the pizzas from him in exchange, made the first, groundbreaking step for all further economic activities in Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Pizza Day is a day to commemorate the recent history of the cryptocurrency – and to eat a delicious slice of pizza.\nimage by shutterstock Bitcoin News\nTheBitcoinNews.com – leading Bitcoin News source since 2012\nVirtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to consumer protections.

Alex de Vries, financial and blockchain expert, reports that global power consumption for bitcoin mining will top 7.67 GW in 2018, aggravating climate change problem.\nMiners of bitcoin, the first virtual money created by blockchain technology, would utilize the computing function of computers to encrypt and record blockchain transactions. To reward miners, bitcoin network would generate a blockchain data, yielding 1.25 units of bitcoin. In addition to transaction fees, miners would be rewarded with bitcoin.\nIn an article titled \"Bitcoin's growing energy problem\" published in \"Joule\" recently, de Vries points out that power consumption of bitcoin mining now reaches 2.55 GW a year, 0.5% of global consumption, which is expected to top 7.67 GW in 2018, compared with 3.1 GW power consumption of Ireland and 8.2 GW of Austria.\n200,000 bitcoin transactions take place daily, with each consuming 300 kWh of power at least, which may exceed 900 kWh by the end of 2018. With its transaction scale becoming every larger, bitcoin may account for 5% of global power consumption in the future, according to De Vries. Miners would raise the computing capability of their computers, in order to gain more rewards, boosting costs of power equipment and machinery.\nThe reports admits that the aforementioned figures are just rough estimates, as it is impossible to calculate precisely power consumption of bitcoin with current technology. Bitcoin network now consists of 10,000 nodes, each representing one or multiple equipment.\nBitcoin communities have been endeavoring to reduce power consumption and raise network traffic, increasing the workload which computers can handle in a unit time. However, generally speaking, bitcoin power consumption will continue rising, until an ideal solution is found.\n(Written by Daisy Chuang; First photo courtesy of Pixabay)", "highlightText": "",

Colin First Reblog The BTC prices continued on their quiet consolidation and ranging over the last 24 hours as there was not much fundamentals or economic data to rock the crypto market as such. The one major development has been the decision of the large crypt exchange Coincheck to re-enter the Japanese market and also expand into the US. This is a positive sign though it is unlikely that it will impact the prices too much at this point of time. It is positive due to the fact that this shows that the market is beginning to mature. Suggested Articles How to Short Bitcoin? Prices In Range This also shows that more and more big money is entering the market as the traders and the investors become confident that the market is here to stay and that it would be wise for them to first regulate the market and pave the way for the entry of the bigger players. This is likely to be an ongoing process and this would only delay the demand for the cryptos in the coming months and years and hence the large volatility that we have been used to in this market is likely to become lesser and lesser in due course of time. Bitcoin 4H More The ETH prices have fallen below the $700 region as of this writing but there are no signals for panic as yet. The prices continue to consolidate and range as in the rest of the market and as usual, this is expected to continue for the next month or so. We do not see any danger to the bulls as yet and they continue to remain in control of the market as of now and this is likely to be only an accumulation phase in the bigger scheme of things. Forecast Looking ahead to the rest of the day, we do not see any major changes in the price with the lack of any fundamental news or data and hence we believe that the prices would continue to range. Unless the major support regions, which we have been mentioning in our prior forecasts, come under danger, there is still no chance of the trend reversing.

view of the movement of the bitcoin , from its inception until now fully aware that we face the possibility of bursting bubble price at any moment, and the reason for the lack of real value of this currency compared to currencies traded in dollars, there are assets behind the currency such as gold or minerals, material as a real estate sector in addition to the absence An organized governmental

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nStory Continues A lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.\n\"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalization of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favored for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n\"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n\"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.\n(Reporting by Alun John and Jennifer Hughes; additional reporting by Sijia Jiang and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by Gerry Doyle)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alun john", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T21:24:08.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a54ad8d8a0e6d7cc0951194f8a5cdac8fa6791da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPo3D.Caiqzyp8H.8XeXND2LI1W0o12oNhhvs6ZYJQp4w8avxtJmpMZhhIh3h70qU2A--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

The puzzle was posted with the caption “1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!”. It gathered over 1700 comments within 2 days of being posted. The puzzle in question\nThe creator of the puzzle, user cryptogreetings, appears to be the Reddit account owner of the website cryptogreetings.com. The website offers various crypto themed greeting cards priced at below $10.\nThe puzzle in question resembles a word map. The poster gave a hint towards solving it, saying:\n“This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry. The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work.”\nRedditors quickly worked out there were 239 BIP39 seed words in the picture. BIP39 is a standard for mnemonic phrases used to secure leading wallets today. The phrase is set as a backup to recover lost wallets. The words discovered in the image were discovered to be seed words to generate a private key for a Bitcoin wallet. The poster, then, mentioned that it was possible to throw “at least half of those out”, as the first clue towards solving the puzzle.\nAfter 2 days of the puzzle being posted, the collective cognitive capabilities of the r/Bitcoin subreddit found it unsolved. However, it was noticed that the poster of the puzzle had put the puzzle up on his website for sale as part of his art offerings. It is currently on sale for $299, as opposed to the $7 prices on his usual products. The puzzle was concluded to be marketing for the new artwork. The art was titled ‘Hidden in Plain Sight’.\nThe community continues to brainstorm the puzzle, with many actually figuring out the 24 words that make up the key. A brute force method of finding the wallet key was deemed impossible due to the high number of permutations possible. The number is close to six hundred twenty sextillion or 620448401733239439360000. The community is still trying to figure out the solution, with the creator giving a total of 7 clues until present.\nSome users responded to the puzzle in a joking way, with user ChipAyten saying:\n“Im better equipped to sell a kidney for $9k”\nUser Declanhx said:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T10:38:51.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b31a9b4a40890078d526414ca90f2bc57018521c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbpnls0Kp17Xmfp0cBTxUz8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What coin in the future can take the place of bitcoin?", "title_full": "What coin in the future can take the place of bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-22T08:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b31a9b4a40890078d526414ca90f2bc57018521c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbpnls0Kp17Xmfp0cBTxUz8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "btcblockchain", "published": "2018-05-22T08:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "What coin in the future can take the place of bitcoin?", "text": "after bitcoin the next coin is etherum . etherum got the same potential of bitcoin in the near future we can see equivalent growth of bitcoin to etherum in terms of market capitalisation and trading currency pair", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T23:17:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2fbc7c0cc4e0d7d62d2c7361f91347811816c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LqJR412iwSn_eiOdOzzDb7I-", "site_full": "www.instaforex.com", "site": "instaforex.com", "site_section": "http://news.instaforex.com/en/analytics/rss/?x=BAED", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex analysis review", "title": "Technical analysis of Bitcoin for May 22, 2018", "title_full": "Technical analysis of Bitcoin for May 22, 2018", "published": "2018-05-22T08:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e2fbc7c0cc4e0d7d62d2c7361f91347811816c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LqJR412iwSn_eiOdOzzDb7I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T08:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Technical analysis of Bitcoin for May 22, 2018", "text": "22.05.2018 07:23 Technical analysis of Bitcoin for May 22, 2018\nOn the 4 hour chart, I've spotted that Bitcoin has a divergence between the RSI (14) and the price.

Miners are looking to allocate some part of the reward they receive from mining and invest it to expand the BCH ecosystem, Kelly explained. The fund development could aid the rise of the cryptocurrency’s value. He continued:\n\"That's how blockchains gain value. You're going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash.\"\nAfter the price surge to $1600 on May 5, BCH subsequently declined to the 50-day SMA and formed a head and shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $650. Over the last 24 hours, BCH has lost almost 5.8 percent in price, from $1290 to $1205. Still it is valued significantly higher than its April level of $760.\nBCH is a peer-to-peer digital currency established in mid-2017 as a result of the hard fork of Bitcoin that took place to solve the scalability problem. With upgraded consensus rules, BCH is able to grow and increase the size of blocks, allowing more transactions to be processed.\nEarlier this month the pro-Bitcoin community dropped its plans to level a lawsuit at the site Bitcoin.com. Members were outraged that the crypto and wallet service, which is run by BCH evangelist Roger Ver appeared to be misleading buyers by muddling the distinction between BTC and BCH.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bkcm llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:50:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2695ad5a5b4e726cf6f6c98c3a3e7aa2cb0bc80d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.shWiFbB0wxXb0F8WS21nTU.lA7tcYCWZ_X2kdwxCoUT2QX3dO1yYiDjbwGIKZC8FwKE_R8Rua226", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Coindesk (=organizer of \"Consensus\" Bitcoin Conference in NYC this year) supports scamming people.

The police have arrested Amreli Superintendent of Police (SP) Jagdish Patel while a former BJP legislator Nalin Kotadia is on the run.\nIn his complaint, Bhatt had alleged that some Amreli policemen extorted \"bitcoins worth ₹9 crore\" from him four months back when he was abducted and beaten by the cops.\n“While probing the case, we learnt that Bhatt was an extortionist, as he had extorted bitcoins worth ₹155 crore from others before he himself became a victim, when he was kidnapped by the Amreli police,” CID (Crime) chief Ashish Bhatia told newsmen on Monday when he announced lodging a new case to book the complainant and others.\n\"Around two years back, one Satish Kumbhani of Surat floated a company called 'Bit Connect' and lured people like Bhatt to invest in it to get huge returns in short time. Bhatt had invested ₹2 crore in it. However, its promoters shut shop in January this year and went underground,\" said Mr. Bhatia.\nTo recover his investment, Bhatt's accomplices first kidnapped Piyush Savalia by posing as Income Tax officials, as Mr. Savalia used to work for that company. Mr. Savalia was confined in a farm house at gun-point for three days in January-end.\n\"On February 1, Bhatt's men kidnapped Dhaval Mavani at gun-point, as the latter was also attached with the bankrupt firm. Bhatt's accomplices forced Mavani to transfer 2,256 bitcoins worth ₹131 crore into their account. The builder and his accomplices had also transferred another 166 bitcoins worth ₹9.64 crore into their account,\" Mr. Bhatia said, sharing details of how Bhatt and his aides were running an underworld type extortion racket in Surat where people turned to virtual currencies to convert their black money during and after demonetisation.\nTo set Mr. Mavani free, Bhatt and his accomplices also extorted ₹14.50 crore cash, which the builder received through the 'Angadia' service (an unofficial cash courier service), he said.\n\"Bhatt and his accomplices extorted bitcoins and cash worth a total of ₹155.21 crore. Later, they distributed the bitcoins among themselves. Bhatt had kept around 700 bitcoins,\" the CID official said.\n“Since Shailesh Bhatt is not tech-savvy, he took help of his nephew Nikunj Bhatt to transfer these bitcoins into his victual wallet.” The CID (crime) has arrested Nikunj Bhatt.\nThe entire conspiracy was unearthed when Savalia was questioned by the CID recently after the arrest of Amreli SP and Police Inspector Anant Patel and Bhatt’s business partner Kirit Paladia.\nMr. Bhatia added that the bitcoin extortion racket is set to get bigger as more people who invested in the hope of making quick bucks became victims of organised racket.\n“When we started probe, Shailesh Bhatt even paid ₹34.50 lakh to Piyush Savalia to keep mum and give a false statement that he was never kidnapped by Bhatt and his aides,” said Mr. Bhatia.\nWhile two persons, including Bhatt's nephew, have already been arrested on charges of kidnapping and extortion, a search is on for others including Bhatt in the new case while former legislator in the original case.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jagdish patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nalin kotadia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashish bhatia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gujarat criminal investigation department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T08:20:33.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5621ed69d9465e3974d5c306e4d8492ff58dd303", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSXX9kYcejIRiTiauf8Zq2ZevtSxL7g.6Q3D8JmlVH8Dm_GW25tPXmks_VMMPFRuOYnCDrDhrfXKs", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Samourai Bitcoin Wallet Tutorial: How to restore an existing wallet by mnemonic", "title_full": "Samourai Bitcoin Wallet Tutorial: How to restore an existing wallet by mnemonic", "published": "2018-05-22T07:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5621ed69d9465e3974d5c306e4d8492ff58dd303", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSXX9kYcejIRiTiauf8Zq2ZevtSxL7g.6Q3D8JmlVH8Dm_GW25tPXmks_VMMPFRuOYnCDrDhrfXKs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T07:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Samourai Bitcoin Wallet Tutorial: How to restore an existing wallet by mnemonic", "text": "Samourai Bitcoin Wallet Tutorial: How to restore an existing wallet by mnemonic\n/u/ayanamirs\nsubmitted by /u/ayanamirs\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samourai bitcoin wallet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T07:44:29.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "660f9d07502808438de5b27bccdd4ae4c7fb7c92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywQOzX2bzhWxHQG9vTL1SAKU.WkkiCHR_ca.pwdKwvVAeKe6VK3ktc1w--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Losing Momentum", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Losing Momentum", "published": "2018-05-22T07:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "660f9d07502808438de5b27bccdd4ae4c7fb7c92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywQOzX2bzhWxHQG9vTL1SAKU.WkkiCHR_ca.pwdKwvVAeKe6VK3ktc1w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T07:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Losing Momentum", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price failed to hold gains above $1,220 and declined below $1,200 against the US Dollar. There is a declining channel forming with resistance at $1,220 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is likely to extend the current decline and it could test the $1,150 support level. Bitcoin cash price is back in a bearish zone below $1,220 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is losing momentum and it could continue to move down towards $1,150.\nBitcoin Cash Price Decline There was a rejection noted from the $1,300 resistance zone in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price formed a short-term top near $1,315 before starting a downside move. It declined and moved below the $1,250 and $1,220 support levels. The downside move was strong as the price also closed below the $1,220 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nDuring the decline, the price broke the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,165 low to $1,315 high. The current price action suggests that a close below $1,220 and the 100 hourly SMA was crucial. At the moment, there is a declining channel forming with resistance at $1,220 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair could accelerate declines below the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,165 low to $1,315 high. The next support may well be the last swing low of $1,165, followed by the all-important $1,150.\nLooking at the chart , the current downside move seems to be a bearish wave with a close below $1,210. Should the price correct higher from the current levels, the $1,220 and $1,250 levels are likely to prevent upsides.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is back gaining pace in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is now well below the 40 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,150\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,220\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Losing Momentum appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T07:39:44.092+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "373745d9b65251fc401faaf405b4b9083e7d9b7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWOqlk20C8EhRtfNYihngaw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will Bitcoin become centralized sometime in the future?", "title_full": "Will Bitcoin become centralized sometime in the future?", "published": "2018-05-22T07:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "373745d9b65251fc401faaf405b4b9083e7d9b7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWOqlk20C8EhRtfNYihngaw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Abiky", "published": "2018-05-22T07:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will Bitcoin become centralized sometime in the future?", "text": "Quote: from: coinholic on May 18, 2018, 10:46:09 PM We all know that the governments have the ultimate goal of being able to control and manipulate Bitcoin and the entirety of the crypto system. Though this may have a glimpse of possibilty, I highly doubt that this coul be done anytime in the near future. Governments do have a lot of things up their sleeves! So they will find ways. And imposing regulations and restrictions is just the start.\nYeah. One thing for sure is that there's nothing that would be impossible for governments to achieve. Given that they could give pressure against something that threatens them easily, there's nothing that could stop them from getting what they want. However, due to the decentralized nature and security of the Bitcoin ledger, it's practically impossible for any government to shutdown Bitcoin all together.\nThe real threat against the decentralization of Bitcoin comes from the way Bitcoin is currently mined. Since there's a single ASIC mining company which has the most dominance in BTC's network hashrate, it can do as it pleases to destroy the Bitcoin network. Therefore, I believe that the mining monopoly of Bitmain should be stopped or else Bitcoin would turn out to become more centralized each day. When Bitcoin finally acts against big miners, it will be such were it'll be one step closer to full decentralization.

A partnership with Latin America-focused exchange startup Bitex, founded in 2014, the news finds the regional bank using bitcoin as a payments rail in international transactions as an alternative to Swift. Bitex chief marking officer Manuel Beaudroit told CoinDesk that the startup believes this marks the first time that a domestic bank has adopted bitcoin for cross-border payments. While no real-world transactions have been launched yet (the service began today), the bank will soon use bitcoin for real customer transactions, Beaudroit said. He told CoinDesk:“The customers will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the bank uses Bitex as a provider.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beaudroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel beaudroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T08:20:54.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b018f25666d67052d09aca546085aea057ba7f7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW1Nj0SeTw8FlrAX2iBvP3sY-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-22T07:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b018f25666d67052d09aca546085aea057ba7f7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW1Nj0SeTw8FlrAX2iBvP3sY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T07:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 22.

But some influential investors and business leaders argue that investing in digital currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is a dangerous game. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a “fraud” and later said he isn’t interested in the subject .\nWarren Buffett recently told Liz Claman on FOX Business that bitcoin has “produced nothing.” His longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, has called bitcoin “rat poison” and a “turd.”\nShiller, a Nobel-winning economist known for predicting the housing crisis and dot-com bubble, said much of cryptocurrencies’ appeal is driven by the mysteriousness that surrounds them.\n“Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal,” Shiller wrote for Project Syndicate. “None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.”\nShiller compared the emergence of cryptocurrencies with past experiments such as “time money.” In the 19th century, Josiah Warner opened the “Cincinnati Time Store,” which sold goods in units of hours of work, using “labor notes” as paper money. The store closed three years after it opened. A similar effort by the “father of socialism,” Robert Owen, also failed.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels pushed for a “communistic abolition of buying and selling,” although no Communist state ever eliminated money, Shiller wrote. In the 1930s, a radical movement aimed to replace the gold-backed dollar with a measure of energy, but the Technocracy fad was short-lived. The economist John Pease Norton argued in 1932 for a dollar backed by electricity. That effort also gained little traction.\nShiller said these monetary innovations were connected to “a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.” Likewise, cryptocurrencies “are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments,” he wrote.\nRelated Articles\nStocks mixed amid US-China trade talks, Italian politics Stocks mixed amid US-China trade talks, Italian politics Kohl's reports higher quarterly profit", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-regrets-saying-bitcoin-is-a-fraud-but-still-isnt-interested-in-it&quot;", "http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cryptocurrencies-scientific-narrative-by-robert-j--shiller-2018-05", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2018/05/22/us-clings-to-health-coverage-gains-despite-political-drama.html", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-regrets-saying-bitcoin-is-a-fraud-but-still-isnt-interested-in-it", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bitcoin-is-rat-poison-berkshires-charlie-munger-says", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bitcoin-is-rat-poison-berkshires-charlie-munger-says&quot;", "http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cryptocurrencies-scientific-narrative-by-robert-j--shiller-2018-05&quot;", "https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/us-clings-to-health-coverage-gains-despite-political-drama", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2018/05/22/new-york-stock-exchange-names-first-female-leader.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert shiller bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz claman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fox business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T07:36:10.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "43a52e491197ecb565a9a3c47f5d8157eaacafbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5nhqB6eGqTPDMu9C.WWE.zikSWnTCc4mLFkHYp1Kmz.vcUyfqS1i5ifHMevHP8zlTyJQ4jyTonH7oqGnHklfO0xJiPFMaLPU-", "site_full": "www.briefingwire.com", "site": "briefingwire.com", "site_section": "http://www.briefingwire.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["marketing", "financial_news", "finance", "business"], "section_title": "BriefingWire.com", "title": "Anonymous Bitcoin Available September 2018", "title_full": "Anonymous Bitcoin Available September 2018", "published": "2018-05-22T07:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19966, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "43a52e491197ecb565a9a3c47f5d8157eaacafbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5nhqB6eGqTPDMu9C.WWE.zikSWnTCc4mLFkHYp1Kmz.vcUyfqS1i5ifHMevHP8zlTyJQ4jyTonH7oqGnHklfO0xJiPFMaLPU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T07:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Anonymous Bitcoin Available September 2018", "text": "Anonymous Bitcoin Available September 2018 ANON coin features anonymous transactions, increased block size, and masternodes The Anonymous Bitcoin (ANON) team will debut their cryptocurrency, ANON, in September 2018. ANON coin was developed to address the demand for a cryptocurrency that provides truly anonymous transactions. A list of participating exchanges is expected by August 15, 2018, and the remainder of the BTCA testnet will take place up to the snapshot on September 9, 2018. ANON will officially be available on September 10, 2018 at a 1:1 ratio to holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and ZClassic (ZCL).\nAs it is a co-fork of BTC and ZCL, one must hold BTC or ZCL prior to the fork to acquire ANON. The maximum amount of ANON will be 31.5 million, with 24 million ANON available when the fork occurs. BTCA intends to set ANON apart from other forks by succeeding where previous forks did not. The team cites lack of anonymous transactions, high transactions fees, and lengthy transaction times as some of the failures their coin will circumvent.\nThe ability to anonymously transact draws many to cryptocurrency. BTC, the most prominent cryptocurrency, does not facilitate anonymous transactions. ANON draws from the privacy protocol of ZCL to provide anonymous transactions by using the same MIT-developed zkSNARKs privacy protocol. The zkSNARKs protocol allows for verifiable transactions without requiring interaction between the prover and verifier. As such, transactions are both secure and completely anonymous.\nWhile previous forks, like ZCL, have succeeded in providing anonymous transactions, they have fallen short in other ways that deterred widespread market adoption of the currency. The BTCA team includes several crypto and Fintech veterans who have observed other forks and what the crypto community wants to see. Increased block size and incorporation of masternodes are two features the BTCA team integrated into ANON in response to crypto market demand. Developers increased block size to support faster transaction times. Masternodes provide an opportunity for return on investment for holders of a minimum required amount of a particular coin. Through masternodes, holders of ANON can stake the currency. Staking incentivizes holding the coin for extended periods of time.\nThe BTCA team intends that ANON is accessible and appealing to both those who have never used crypto and existing crypto users. As such, a community presence and transparent development are core principles for BTCA. BTCA has a social media presence, through which they communicate with their public. Videos of the forking process, frequent updates, and Q&A events allow anyone to follow the forking process. The team wants to tell their forking story in such a way that those unfamiliar with crypto are interested and informed, thus overcoming what was a challenge for previous forks in terms of effectively connecting with those new to crypto.\nMedia Contact", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:00:52.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d155c796f3e6c35ea016abe319c6073dbf015f06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVUrqLJ2B1YhqVdkm.e6JtU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Should You Still Invest in Bitcoin in 2018?", "title_full": "Should You Still Invest in Bitcoin in 2018?", "published": "2018-05-22T07:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d155c796f3e6c35ea016abe319c6073dbf015f06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVUrqLJ2B1YhqVdkm.e6JtU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hairpin", "published": "2018-05-22T07:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should You Still Invest in Bitcoin in 2018?", "text": "Yes, investing is still a good idea.
