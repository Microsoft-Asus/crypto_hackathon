There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might dip a few points, but the overall bias is positive above the $1,100 support level.\nBitcoin cash price remains in an uptrend above $1,100 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past $1,160 and $1,180 to gain upside momentum. Bitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThere were mostly ranging moves above the $1,100 support area in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price traded towards the $1,170 level, but it failed to move further higher. A high was formed near $1,168 before the price started a downside correction. At the moment, it seems like there is a strong resistance area forming near $1,160, which may act as a pivot zone.\nA downward correction is underway, and the price recently broke the 23.6% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high. However, the decline is finding bids near the $1,130 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Further below the 100 hourly SMA, there is a key support around the $1,100 level. Moreover, the 50% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high is also around the stated support. On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the pair has to settle above the $1,160 resistance area to gain upside momentum. The next hurdles above $1,160 are seen near $1,180 and $1,200.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently just above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,100\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,160 Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Eyeing Upside Break was last modified: June 8th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BCHUSD/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T07:42:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e206abd8b86341dfcb89c49f96ef8534442c298", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfhqqVDoTN.VsiabYBXeIhY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=39.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Beginners &amp; Help", "title": "is there any easy way to buy and store bitcoin?", "title_full": "is there any easy way to buy and store bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-08T07:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e206abd8b86341dfcb89c49f96ef8534442c298", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfhqqVDoTN.VsiabYBXeIhY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Oliveir", "published": "2018-06-08T07:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "is there any easy way to buy and store bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: emuLOAD on September 19, 2017, 03:56:51 PM Quote: from: willmsnow on September 19, 2017, 03:54:03 PM There are some kind of crypto wallet I read about.

Hannah Murphy Financial Times Chesnot | Getty Images A man walks past a Bitcoin symbol on a window of the offices of the bank 'La Maison du Bitcoin' in Paris.\nOn the final day in his insurance job last week after 14 years in the sector, Donnie wore a T-shirt emblazoned with a rocket logo, the symbol for bitcoin, and the slogan \"to the moon\".\nThe phrase, one that characterises the fervour espoused by bitcoin enthusiasts who say its price knows no bounds, was fitting.\nOver five years, the 39-year-old has made enough money from trading digital currencies to pay off his mortgage, buy a Mercedes, and now swap office life for managing his remaining crypto investments full-time.\nReceive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1 .\n\"It was very euphoric . . . It's been life-changing for me at this point,\" says the California-based father of two, who has a cult-like Twitter following under the pen name bitcoin Dad.\nDonnie is just one member of a clubby community of early investors in bitcoin who have been able to reap the benefits of its dramatic bull run, cashing out some holdings as its value more than doubled in the space of a month to peak at around $20,000 in mid-December.\nHe will not reveal his exact returns because his new-found wealth has already left him the victim of hacking and extortion — part and parcel of the freewheeling digital currency marketplace. Tweet\nSix months after its peak, bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, though its price has sunk to about $7,500 at the time of publication. It follows that for each of the bitcoin millionaires, there have been numerous casualties; the \"get rich quick\" punters who entered the market a little too late.\n\"These are people that see something moving up and start buying — they jump on the bandwagon,\" says Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University and an investment strategy adviser for Man Group.\n\"Initially in the crypto space, you had people who really understood the technology. Then there was a typical bandwagon investor situation and you know how it ends — and it did.\"\nBut how many have gained — and lost — from the bitcoin bubble? Exclusive data from blockchain research company Chainalysis seen by the FT provides some tantalising answers. Coin exchange\nThe Chainalysis data quantifies this distinct shift in the make-up of bitcoin owners from longer-term investors — those who held the asset for more than a year — to short-term investors who have traded more recently, by analysing how regularly coins have changed hands.\nLast November — before December's pricing peak — the amount of bitcoin held for investment was roughly three times that held by traders.\nHowever, by April 2018, the data show the amount held by investors — about 6m bitcoin — was much closer to the amount held by short-term speculators, with 5.1m bitcoin.\nIndeed, Chainalysis estimates that longer-term holders sold at least $30bn worth of bitcoin to new speculators over the December to April period, with half of this movement taking place in December alone.\n\"This was an exceptional transfer of wealth,\" says Philip Gradwell, Chainalysis' chief economist, who dubs the past six months as bitcoin's \"liquidity event\".\nMr. Gradwell argues that this sudden injection of liquidity — the amount of bitcoin available for trading rose by close to 60 per cent over that period — has been a \"fundamental driver\" behind the recent price decline. At the same time, bitcoin trading volumes have now fallen in tandem with the prices, from close to $4bn daily in December to $1bn today.\nSo will the price of bitcoin ever surpass December's peak? Part of the answer lies in who holds bitcoin now that the hype has died down.\nBorn in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, bitcoin is rooted in a libertarian quest for a means of exchange that is unshackled from the central banking system. Proponents — among them, computer experts and political activists — heralded the arrival of an alternative monetary system that could replace fiat currency.\nBut despite the recent crypto boom, there are few signs that this is happening. According to research published this month by Morgan Stanley, only four of the top 500 US e-commerce merchants accepted cryptocurrencies in the first quarter of 2018, compared with three at the beginning of 2017.\nChainalysis notes that the \"vast majority\" of transactions it analysed showed bitcoin being received from exchanges and rarely sent to merchant services to pay for goods or services.\nOnly a finite number of coin — 21m — can be created. Of this, about 4m are yet to be mined. Just as physical coins can be lost down the back of a sofa, so can bitcoins if users lose or forget the passwords needed to access their online wallets. The Chainalysis data separates out coins it deems to be lost or unused for years — which total 3.7m bitcoin, worth about $28bn.\nThe proportion of bitcoin it estimates to be held by groups such as exchanges or merchant services held steady between December and April at about 2.2m bitcoin.\nCritics argue that bitcoin's volatility and a lack of fundamental underpinnings disqualifies it as a reliable store of value, and that this is unlikely to change. This leaves droves of new opportunists dabbling in what has been dubbed a \"Wild West\" marketplace, with regulators still weighing up how best to tackle the space.\n\"Speculation remains the primary use case for these digital assets; merchant or institutional adoption does not appear to be a primary driver of price,\" says Preston Byrne, an English structured finance lawyer and cryptocurrency observer.\nGiven this breakdown in bitcoin owners, most market watchers do not rule out another rapid price run-up. However, they say this would likely be the random movement of pure speculation or market manipulation rather than anything else.\n\"It's very important to stress, this is not in any sense a rational market,\" says David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain .\n\"It's very thinly traded, very badly structured . . . and it's stupendously manipulated,\" he adds. \"Anyone who goes in not realising just how manipulated the crypto markets are will get skinned.\"\nSome argue there is an art to trading bitcoin regardless — but it is a stressful business that takes nerves and can be addictive. Donnie, a.k.a bitcoin Dad, puts his successes down to careful research, \"patience\" and avoiding the trap of obsessive, leveraged day trading.\nBut others are unconvinced that bitcoin millionaires actually show investment nous, drawing parallels with gambling.\n\"It's the luck of the draw, where everyone who won the draw seems to feel like they deserved it for being smarter,\" Vitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian programmer who invented the smart-contract blockchain Ethereum, told the Financial Times recently. Whale watching\nThe Chainalysis data also show that the bitcoin marketplace is skewed in terms of wealth distribution. A small cluster of investors — known colloquially as \"whales\" — capture a hefty proportion of the market, which stands at odds with bitcoin's mission to democratise finance. This brings its own risks.\nOverall, some 1,600 bitcoin wallets — managed by both speculators and investors — contained at least 1,000 bitcoin each in April, according to Chainalysis, collectively holding nearly 5m bitcoin, or close to a third of the available total.\nOf those, just under 100 wallets owned by longer-term investors contained between 10,000 and 100,000 bitcoin — so between $75m and $750m at today's prices.\n\"This concentration of wealth means that bitcoin is at risk of volatility, as the moves of a small number of people will have a large effect,\" says Chainalysis' Mr. Gradwell.\nHowever, the situation suggests bitcoin's volatility is \"of low risk to the wider financial system\", he adds, as \"only a small number of people will face large changes in crypto wealth\".\nStill, there are opportunities particularly for the larger players to engage in market manipulation, due to the dearth of regulation and existence of informal over-the-counter markets — and this leaves smaller players at a disadvantage.\n\"When you build up a big enough position in any asset you can move the price,\" says Dr Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain and co-founder of Mosaic.io, a platform for market intelligence on crypto. \"A number of these larger holders do communicate with each other, they know [each other], they take stock of market activity.\"\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley echoed this concern in a note this month, saying that it was \"noteworthy\" that the more sophisticated investors were \"willing to give up traditional investor rights for potentially faster liquidity\".\nNevertheless, some point out that the excitement and influx of fresh funds into the market has allowed its infrastructure to mature — albeit gradually — which could be a boon for those looking to trade bitcoin more safely in future. Trading places\nBuying and selling bitcoin had traditionally been challenging for all but the most tech-savvy. As last year's cryptocurrency frenzy heated up however, some consumer finance businesses rushed to capitalise on the zeitgeist and offer their customers access to digital coins through apps they were already familiar with using.\nMany exchanges have strengthened their due diligence processes in response to customer concerns and invested in bigger customer services teams. Transaction fees have come down as technology has improved — but hacks are still commonplace.\nInstitutions have also been making inroads. These include prominent US futures exchanges, such as the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets, which now offer bitcoin futures. Meanwhile, Nasdaq's chief executive, Adena Friedman, said this year that the group would consider offering cryptocurrency exchange services in future.\nAlternative funds are also muscling in. Morgan Stanley data show there is now more than $3.5bn in estimated assets under management across 250 dedicated crypto-funds, although the pace of the creation of new funds has slowed recently.\nA more formalised over-the-counter market has started to develop, with players such as Cumberland, an arm of Chicago-based DRW, and Goldman Sachs-backed Circle growing rapidly.\nMuch of the future of bitcoin trading will depend on the approach that regulators take, experts say. There are stirrings across the world, though to date, little coherence. Asian financial centres such as Tokyo are now regulating crypto exchanges, while China has banned them outright. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission last month announced a criminal probe into potential bitcoin price manipulation.\nBanks in particular have been reticent to engage with cryptocurrencies and the companies that handle them, partly due to the difficulty of conducting anti-money laundering checks on transactions.\n\"Bank compliance officers really, really hate cryptos . . . be prepared to demonstrate the provenance of every penny from every crypto,\" says Mr. Gerard.\nMr. Hileman predicts that one day there will be a \"legitimate regulated retail investment market\" in bitcoin, although not anytime soon. \"We're talking years,\" he predicts.\nAny more widespread adoption of bitcoin would need regulators, central banks and tax regulators to allow the transfer of wealth movement from the current financial system into the new one, says Gavin Brown, senior lecturer in financial economics at Manchester Metropolitan University and director of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital.\nNevertheless, there are those who still hold unwavering faith in bitcoin.\nSunnie, who has been investing in bitcoin since she started working for a crypto exchange back in 2014, did not cash out in December, burnt by a previous experience in 2016 when she sold thinking the price was high.\nWith 50 per cent of her assets currently in 10 bitcoin — bought initially at $3,000 a piece — she believes in its potential as the first project that uses burgeoning blockchain technology.\n\"If bitcoin can survive under such a high rollercoaster period, I have faith in it,\" she adds. \"When I reach six figures I'm probably going to cash out what I have and completely retire. The price will go to the moon again — maybe higher.\"\nAdditional reporting by Chloe Cornish\nMore from the Financial Times:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T09:00:55.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27ef6efe320fe53b36d1c698d25ebe15be5ecce6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.cRxZE.p3laWrqUsXlsR8d19KNPpZZxfQ9PwOLVa6WG2iHSbnsFQyXll.Trz..u5VkDqM7Jz84OrU.ukYFKQcLrfUnkDSvstI-", "site_full": "www.gistpunch.com", "site": "gistpunch.com", "site_section": "http://www.gistpunch.com/", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "For Best Entertainment, Sport, and Music", "title": "Buy or Sell Bitcoin Now Best Rate in Nigeria Register and Trade", "title_full": "Buy or Sell Bitcoin Now Best Rate in Nigeria Register and Trade", "published": "2018-06-08T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27ef6efe320fe53b36d1c698d25ebe15be5ecce6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.cRxZE.p3laWrqUsXlsR8d19KNPpZZxfQ9PwOLVa6WG2iHSbnsFQyXll.Trz..u5VkDqM7Jz84OrU.ukYFKQcLrfUnkDSvstI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gistpunch (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Buy or Sell Bitcoin Now Best Rate in Nigeria Register and Trade", "text": "DO YOU NEED BITCOIN or Ethereum and also Perfect Money or Other Kind of E-Currency\nDo you want to Sell your Bitcoin or Etherium\nall available at Pufftech Exchange With Instant Funding And Payment of Both E-currency\n Available to buy and also you can sell Visit our Website www.pufftechexchange.com and register afterward you can submit you buy/sell order form if u have any problem or Difficulties kindly send us an email at info@pufftechexchange.com or whats app 08026116103\nWe Do Large Quantities 5,000 - 50,000$ upward\nYou Can Now Sell Your Gift Card To Us and you will be Paid instantly as your card been verified We Buy any Gift Card from USA, ETC iTunes Gift Card.

I don't actually read any post over one sentence long so I wouldn't know. Regulation may be a long way off. That's one complicated equation. And will it legitimize cryptos or will it stifle volatility? I mean who do think the \"robber\" banks sleep with at night. Yea, exactly, governments, politicians, reserve banks, other banks. And do you think collectively they want the crypto crowd to cut into their action? Of course not. My simple point was Bitcoin has been stuck in range for 6 months and suddenly it's... Ignored My wild guess on this crypto price may be anywhere for the time being but to the point of governments claiming what their actual crypto reserves are this is rating agencies job I think, of course you can not produce more than 21 million bitcoins but the main point is the sanctions disputes in the open and regulated market will be gone for the most part so that's half the problem gone for at least one group point of view.

Chainfeed listens and aggregates updates from multiple BCH-blockchain utilizing social applications, such as http://memo.cash and http://blockpress.com . It's like a live feed of activity on these multiple networks. What we found really interesting (and useful) was that it can create filter pages, so we decided to use it for our project at http://bitfund.cash . These filter pages let you type anything and see if anyone posted recently about that, kind of like a Twitter search, but for multiple Bitcoin Cash social networks. Nice! It's already a very useful tool and we look forward to what comes next for this project. Example: https://chainfeed.org/filter/cash -- it also comes with an API called the chainfeed firehose API. https://chainfeed.org/api/\nRead.Cash Also on /r/btc this week, we found another great tool by the same author, it is called http://read.cash - It seemed to good to be true, but sometimes there are apps that really are good and true and this is one of them. If you're on memo.cash, blockpress.com, yours.org and others, (including your mobile wallet I think), you can add your address to watch (read-only) your app-wallet balances really easily. Yes, it polls the latest info from public blockchain API's. It is client-side, open-source. As the author states, the \"entire app is purely frontend based HTML. There is no backend that stores your data. In fact, you can even run it on your own local machine if you want. The source code is 100% open source and designed to be as transparent as possible.\" - Very nice.\nOne example use, you can load up http://read.cash in your mobile browser and keep track of your wallet balances on-the-go, on Android for example, you can choose \"Add to homescreen\" and it will appear as an App icon on your home screen.\nThis has already made using these new Bitcoin Cash social apps more fun, and we are looking forward to what comes next for http://read.cash\n submitted by /u/Akari_bit\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://chainfeed.org/filter/cash"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T01:47:25.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "280515e98be9071af8f05588bc5582780c9b3722", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQmLHTSs4pxU2XDnDennHuY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Good times with bitcoin", "title_full": "Good times with bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-08T06:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "280515e98be9071af8f05588bc5582780c9b3722", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQmLHTSs4pxU2XDnDennHuY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Boov", "published": "2018-06-08T06:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Good times with bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: jademacoy on May 21, 2018, 12:52:25 AM There is a big difference comparing bitcoin market price from the past few years up to the present.

bitcoin probe: Raj Kundra Mumbai, June 6 : Mumbai businessman Raj Kundra on Wednesday claimed that he had gone to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) as a witness for the ongoing investigations in the Rs 2,000 crore bitcoin scam.Kundra -- the husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty -- had appeared before the ED office in Mumbai on Tuesday.According to some media reports (not by IANS), he was reportedly grilled for several hours by the ED investigators.\"I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness.An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,\" Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement.A businessman with interest in sports, this is not Kundra's first brush with law.In the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team.Some members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal.In his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: \"I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media.Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.\"\"The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,\" said Kundra.He added that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same.\"However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection.While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments,\" he said.\"Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical.We remain excited about the company's future and strive to keep adding shareholder value,\" he said.It may be recalled, the ED, sometime back, had

Economics correspondent Paul Solman reports on the impacts of bitcoin mining.\nYou have probably heard about the rise and fall of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But what you may not have about is the incredible amount of energy computers need to get Bitcoin and other currencies in the first place.\nThat demand, in turn, is affecting the prices of electricity in some places.

She faces a maximum of 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious offense.\nJudge George Bakalis also modified her bail Thursday to allow Jones, who currently lives with her parents in Grayson, Georgia, to attend a friend's wedding in Chatanooga, Tennessee, on Aug. 4.\nBakalis also allowed Jones to stay in Illinois for 27 hours, rather than the previously ordered 24 hours, to allow her time to meet with attorneys in Chicago on another matter.\nProsecutors say Jones paid $10,000 in bitcoin to the company in January to kill a Woodridge woman who works as a clinical social worker in Naperville.\nThe Cosa Nostra International Network, however, was deemed to be a scam. The CBS program \"48 Hours\" discovered the contract between Jones and the website while researching another story and alerted Woodridge police, authorities said.\nJones, a registered nurse at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, has been suspended pending an investigation.\nThe victim's husband is a practicing anesthesiologist who completed his residency at Loyola and is still based in Maywood.\nJones's next court date is scheduled for Aug. 16.\nRelated Article\nWoman charged in bitcoin murder-for-hire case to live with parents while waiting for trial Related Article\nCharge: Woman used bitcoin, dark web in murder-for-hire case Related Article\nProsecutors: Des Plaines woman used bitcoin to hire dark web company to kill lover's wife Get articles sent to your inbox.

Need for Bitcoin", "text": "Allowing Insurance Companies to Deny People Coverage for Preexisting Conditions Highlights the Need for Bitcoin Jun 8, 2018\nThis morning when I scanned the headlines, I was once again reminded why it is that I got into Bitcoin in the first place.\nOne of the headlines proclaimed that the Trump administration is siding with Texas and insurance companies to once more make denying people insurance because of preexisting conditions OK.\nDamn.\nNow, I don’t have any preexisting conditions except Gilbert’s Syndrome (a malady which oddly is good for heart health), but I do know the number of people who are struggling to make ends meet and are thrown onto the streets because of a sudden health issue. These may be poor people, but often they are middleclass people who are just scraping by when they get some bad news. Now they find they can’t pay the bills, they can’t take time off from work, they can’t find people to take care of the kids … And if things go wrong, their credit cards get declined and their car and house gets repossessed.\nThe Republicans and insurance companies want you to believe that this happens because these people didn’t live right, or prepare properly, or take care of themselves. And for sure, there may be a bit of truth to those claims. But it’s also because the deck is stacked against anyone who doesn’t just have a ton of money. Often enough, even the people who thought they were prepared are shocked to find that no preparation would have been enough to protect them.\nIn a just society, systems are put into place to make sure that the weakest and the unluckiest get the help they need it when they need it. If we don’t want the government to do this job, fine – insurance companies can opt to take on that responsibility. But then it becomes a responsibility, higher than the profit motive. Our society has been high jacked by an oligarchy who prize their own profit above all else and who view any who don’t exist at their own exalted heights to be disposable. We are merely the natural resource to be used up in their unrelenting profit-making machines. And I am not talking about the poor, or the factory worker, or the teacher, or the mid-level manager. I’m talking about all of us.\nWe need a change of government, of system, of thinking. We need a realignment of ethics that puts the health and happiness of the people back in the center of what we are trying to achieve.\nBitcoin is not that panacea.\nNo.\nBut it is a start. It is the start of taking power out of the hands of the oligarchs, giving them one less tool to use against us.\nWe are at the start of a decentralized revolution – one where information, money, education, government, and work will all slowly devolve to the people. And we will all be better for it.

Users can now send, receive and exchange between 30 ERC-20 tokens on any KeepKey. Now, with its native ERC-20 support, users can create and view raw transactions directly on device without connecting to a third party. Usually, hardware wallets must be connected to a PC to view these details.\nERC-20 is a technical standard used by Ethereum for smart contracts that work on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment. Most of the tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain comply with ERC-20. Sponsored Links\nKeepKey was founded in 2014. It allows users to hold Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash and Dogecoin. KeepKey will expect to include many of the other popular tokens whose market cap is close to the summit following its addition of ERC-20 tokens.\nKen Hodler, KeepKey’s CTO, said:\n“KeepKey’s large screen was designed to display transaction details in a clear and legible manner. We utilized our screen size for users to see every aspect of their ERC-20 token transactions prior to signing, allowing users to transfer their tokens without having to trust anyone else.”\nThe KeepKey production client on the Chrome app store will allow access to ERC-20 tokens for KeepKey’s users, their site notes.\nFull List of ERC-20 Tokens: Aragon, Augur, Basic Attention Token, Civic, District0x, FunFair, Golem, Gnosis, OmiseGo, SALT, Bancor, ICONOMI, Melon, SwarmCity, Wings, iExec, Status, Numeraire, Metal, TenX, Qtum, 0x, FirstBlood, Ripio Credit Network, SingularDTV, DigixDAO, WeTrust, Matchpool, Edgeless and Storj.\nJust prior to this announcement, Jonny, replying to KeepKey on Twitter had said:\n“Please, add more coins! And update the Chrome extension!”\nTalking about KeepKey, Twitter user David Ferch said:\n“Where can I download the native app for MacOS ?

With all top 13 cryptocurrencies in the green, it is a rather odd sight given all of the negativity which occurred on Saturday and Sunday. While there are no major changes to speak of, the Bitcoin price is definitely heading in the right direction as of right now.\"Bitcoin Price Momentum Continues\" Bitcoin Price Momentum Continues Any Bitcoin price chart is usually a mix of up and down momentum, for rather obvious reasons. While there is positive momentum in the market right now, things looked very different just a few days ago. Rest assured this situation will look completely different by tomorrow or the day after, as cryptocurrencies are not known for their stability whatsoever. The Bitcoin price is perhaps the best example of this trend.\nEven so, there is something positive to note over the past few hours. Although the current Bitcoin price gain is pretty small, all things considered, it is still a lot better compared to what most people had expected at this time. Thanks to this small increase, the Bitcoin price has increased to $7,632 once again, although it seems unlikely it will stay there for long. More specifically, remaining above $7,600 will be the primary challenge for the Bitcoin price.\nJudging by the chart of the past week, the Bitcoin price has surpassed $7,600 on at least two occasions. Every single time, the price was pushed to well below $7,500 fairly quickly. It is likely this situation will happen once again, although there are no certainties when it comes to cryptocurrency whatsoever.\nThe Bitcoin trading volume hasn’t changed all that much, albeit one shouldn’t expect anything less these days. With $4.666bn, there is still plenty of interest in trading Bitcoin – either for profit or otherwise – albeit this volume will need to pick up the pace sooner rather than later if major gains are to be achieved. Whether or not that will happen, is a different matter altogether.\nLooking over the exchanges ranked by trading volume, it quickly becomes apparent Binance continues to dominate the markets at all times. The exchange’s USDT pair generates the most volume, and its EOS pair is also in the top five. Huobi and OKEx’s USDT pair, as well as Bitfinex’s USD pair, are all in the top five as well. A very peculiar mix of currencies, although it seems sufficient to keep the Bitcoin price momentum going, for the time being.\nAs far as the Bitcoin price is concerned, there are no certainties whatsoever. While the momentum seems relatively positive right now, things can turn on a dime at any given moment. If the Bitcoin price remains above $7,600 for a few days, interesting things are bound to happen sooner or later. According to the bigger picture, the Bitcoin price trend remains in place rather firmly, for the time being.\nBitcoin is struggling to maintain its ground\nBITCOIN AND BANKING CAN WORK TOGETHER ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T04:58:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05fa7c72950164c00668fe422eda941d552a90d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMASjMeS9N6GlM.zHdviDkbF08_1dnxdGm21xtvCkyY88mLEpQDp20ic4W8UCd6q6NP80Svxg3ezsm4Lx47sh.obCM8jm83LxZA--", "site_full": "www.thelincolnianonline.com", "site": "thelincolnianonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thelincolnianonline.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Lincolnian Online", "title": "Bitcoin Atom Price Reaches $0.78 on Exchanges (CRYPTO:BCA)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Atom Price Reaches $0.78 on Exchanges (CRYPTO:BCA)", "published": "2018-06-08T04:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2387.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05fa7c72950164c00668fe422eda941d552a90d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMASjMeS9N6GlM.zHdviDkbF08_1dnxdGm21xtvCkyY88mLEpQDp20ic4W8UCd6q6NP80Svxg3ezsm4Lx47sh.obCM8jm83LxZA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Caroline Horne", "published": "2018-06-08T04:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Atom Price Reaches $0.78 on Exchanges (CRYPTO:BCA)", "text": "Bitcoin Atom Price Reaches $0.78 on Exchanges (CRYPTO:BCA) Posted by Caroline Horne | Jun 7th, 2018\nBitcoin Atom (CURRENCY:BCA) traded 1.1% higher against the dollar during the 24-hour period ending at 19:00 PM E.T. on May 31st.

San Francisco-based Ripple has their own blockchain network, but unlike other cryptocurrencies, they're willing to work with centralized banks and other financial institutions.\nRipple Throwing Some Shade At the recent Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse talked to CNBC about several topics. He predicted that dozens of banks would be using XRP, Ripple's native cryptocurrency, in 2019 to make cross-border payments.\nGarlinghouse also brought up Bitcoin and its eventual role in the global economy. While he believes that Bitcoin will have a role, it will not become a global cryptocurrency. He said the following to CNBC:\nI think it's (bitcoin) not going to be the panacea that people once thought it would be, where it would solve all of these different kind of problems… Instead, you're seeing specializations of different kind of ledgers, different kinds of blockchains.\nThe Ripple CEO explained that a primary reason for Bitcoin not becoming a global cryptocurrency is due to its transaction times. He says that the Bitcoin blockchain is \"quite slow\" in processing transactions. Blockchain.info notes that today's average BTC transaction is 20 minutes. By contrast, Garlinghouse notes that the average XRP transaction is 4 seconds.\nNot a Competition Despite Garlinghouse throwing shade at Bitcoin , he says that XRP and BTC are not rivals. He notes:\nWell, I don't really think about it as one versus the other. I mean, it's actually unfortunate, I think, that there's some people in this, the crypto space, the blockchain space — for them, it's almost a holy war of one versus the other. I don't look at that at all.\nIn fact, Brad Garlinghouse believes that there will be \"many winners\" in the cryptocurrency space. He also believes that, eventually, Bitcoin will not be influencing the prices of other cryptocurrencies. He thinks this event will happen once people realize that there are key differences between various digital currencies.\nAs of now, Ripple (XRP) is trading at $0.67, an increase of 0.22% in the last 24 hours, and Bitcoin is trading for $7,666, a 0.1 percent increase in the last 24 hours.\nDo you agree with Brad Garlinghouse that Bitcoin will not become a global currency?

CHOOSE PROTOCOLS & PLATFORMS (OVER DAPPS). The state of cryptocurrency is in flux with different blockchain platforms all vying for dominance. BTC, the first cryptocurrency, itself is outdated. It does not support smart contracts, it’s slow, it’s expensive, and there’s a vicious civil war between the core developers who task themselves with improving the BTC infrastructure and the large mining companies & businesses with a vested interested in making as much money as they can from it. But the siren call of blockchain is strong. Some of the smartest people are promising that blockchain can optimize (through decentralization) many inefficient systems present in banking, government, supply chain, insurance, and many other broad areas. The real winner in a few years may not be Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other specific coin but Blockchain technology and how it disrupts our current technology. There is a mad scramble to find the blockchain /s that come out on top. The blockchain/s that prove they are the best and gain widespread adaption in the marketplace. Infrastructure projects also tend to give the best returns. If dApps built on a platform succeed in what they promise and gain real use, the fundamental value of the platform the dApp is built on itself will increase. For example, Microsoft Windows derives its value from the applications that have been developed on it. With cryptocurrency, you can invest in the actual underlying platform and profit as that platform succeed.\nImagine investing in the railroad infrastructure during the 19th century and getting paid rent as those rails were used by the trains. Would you want a piece of that? What about if you were paid when people used the ‘HTTP’ protocol. You would be gaining dividends in the web protocol itself, earning more and more as the protocol gains use. You would essentially be owning a piece of the web infrastructure. What would that be worth now? Billions. Trillions? Cryptocurrency platforms & protocols projects give you that option. Many are calling Blockchain the Web 3.0. A safer, more secure layer on which the new internet can be built upon, one centred around the idea of decentralization. That’s the longterm view anyways. But we still have ways to go — years likely — before this vision becomes a reality. At present, this web 3.0 is still in alpha and the best example of it is brought to its knees by a few thousand gamblers addicted to buying and selling digital cats. But if you hold to the long-term vision that the blockchain will be the seed of a new web 3.0, then investing in its infrastructure is a good play. dApps, beyond the speculative value they give now, will ultimately be tied (when the speculative frenzy has died down in the future) to the value of the company behind the application. Most dApps offer utility tokens which are, frankly, not at all needed as part of the core functionality. What am I saying here? Platforms and Protocols have delivered some of the biggest ROI.\nAnd if the market turns bear, these are the projects that will likely retain real value in the future — not the dApps built on them. So when evaluating potential ICO’s, give big preferential treatment to infrastructure projects over dAPPS. You’ll likely earn more over the long run. And they are safer bets over dapps. Look at some of the top cryptocurrency by market cap: EOS. ADA. IOTA. NEO. ICX. LISK. Notice a trend? A significant portion of the top 20 list is filled with infrastructure cryptocurrencies, not dApps. I don’t expect this to change until dApps actually start getting real-world use in the marketplace and disrupting industries. I figure we have anywhere from 2 to 5 years before this occurs. 2. ANTICIPATE THE MARKET TRENDS. Want to make millions. Here’s how. Anticipate the direction the market will go. Then invest in cryptocurrencies that promise those solutions. Now, this does sound easy but does involve knowing quite a bit about market trends and the general state of blockchain tech. You only get this by following crypto news and looking at what cryptocurrencies are currently rising. For example, I’m personally interested in cryptocurrency platforms & protocols that aim to solve the fundamental problems with current blockchain technology, the problems that must be overcome if blockchain is to be used to solve real problems and not just a speculative investment. Some of these problems that MUST be solved are scalability (increasing throughput of transactions speeds).\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/making-money-from-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-part-2/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn\nCLICK HERE to submit a Video Press Release to MyPR.\n–", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://mypr.co.za/making-money-from-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-part-3/", "https://mypr.co.za/making-money-from-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-part-2/", "http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben krypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T06:04:53.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ec74f281662eaaf20e7d2795fde60ecdf1862be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eXRIefSzY42BGramyAP5knkvnWmlTyhOLn89oe1DgiMk7u98_tTVKQm4qnQyqnpqHwYnUwd2sj9iEa5xh7LfoKg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoMarkets", "title": "Bitmain's CEO Jihan Wu, Bitcoin Mining Leader, Prepping for Record Breaking IPO", "title_full": "Bitmain's CEO Jihan Wu, Bitcoin Mining Leader, Prepping for Record Breaking IPO : CryptoMarkets", "published": "2018-06-08T04:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.071, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ec74f281662eaaf20e7d2795fde60ecdf1862be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eXRIefSzY42BGramyAP5knkvnWmlTyhOLn89oe1DgiMk7u98_tTVKQm4qnQyqnpqHwYnUwd2sj9iEa5xh7LfoKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mshanks1", "published": "2018-06-08T04:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitmain's CEO Jihan Wu, Bitcoin Mining Leader, Prepping for Record Breaking IPO", "text": "submitted by /u/mshanks1\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/bitmains-ceo-jihan-wu-bitcoin-mining-leader-prepping-for-record-breaking-ipo/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T01:26:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc6325a9ce766107e762d6027a31e688ee520693", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmglet_96dNUtCZHUmdU6713p2HQcHcPhcsZIiNeHX5bTguujJ0ByoDTmnOxFPO.4vaA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.

Initially the user would get an explanation of what this is about and why it needs to be paid for, a simple wallet would be integrated in the client so the user can load a balance and start publishing torrents on the network.\nWe'd use merkle torrents (they keep a merkle root hash instead of all the hashes to every torrent piece) if possible, if not, we'd add the .torrent's infohash and whatever user metadata can be fit into what the Memo.cash and Blockpress.com people are using to send tweets.\nEvery torrent client in the world could scan the blockchain and create a local (or distributed if it's too big) index, no more torrent index websites needed (for that content), it'd be up to client developers to sort out spam issues, for example algorithms such as \" Trust is Risk \" could be used to make sure we trust content only through the people we trust and not by what spammers may have attempted to do.\nYay or Nay?\nPlease Vote:\nPoll on Memo.cash\nPoll on Twitter\nand let's discuss here on reddit what all of this triggers in your brain.\n submitted by /u/gubatron\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/gubatron/status/1004811402609975296", "https://frostwire.wordpress.com/2017/08/01/trust-is-risk-a-decentralized-trust-system/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T23:15:20.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7249ccabbd8926b7247c4c4d839194b7532e41e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmat9jrYHfLX7Ak6t6XEpbcw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Negative side of Bitcoin", "title_full": "Negative side of Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-08T04:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7249ccabbd8926b7247c4c4d839194b7532e41e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmat9jrYHfLX7Ak6t6XEpbcw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ayubadairo", "published": "2018-06-08T04:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Negative side of Bitcoin", "text": "The computer server hosting such a cryptocurrency ledger could be destroyed.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.
