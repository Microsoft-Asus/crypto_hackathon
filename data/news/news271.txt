Even in our country If I say something openly about Bitcoin then Police will catch me! WTF! What do you think about it?\nBitcoin is actually not illegal in any country but they are banning Bitcoins as all the countries are having crime in them and Bitcoins are helping them to grow as Bitcoins are totally anonymous.\nAnd it is not governments fault neither any countries fault. If you tell anyone who is new to the cryptocurrency that most of the crimes and drugs sellers are using Bitcoins for the money transaction the newcomers will also live Bitcoins or the cryptocurrencies.. as everyone here is having the fear of getting jailed.\nThere are lots of speculations about that which other government is thinking. Bitcoin can be used in some transactions wherein the government is not aware. Bitcoin can be used in actions that is not allowed by the law if traders and users will take advantage of it.

May 15, 2018\nThe Wall Street titan is now all in when it comes to allowing clients to trade Bitcoin futures via one of its New York desks. Goldman Sachs becomes the first regulated financial institution to offer such a service. Part of the reason the firm decided to go this route is due to the several inquiries they received from hedge funds, foundations, and endowments which had received donations from Bitcoin millionaires. Goldman Sachs cosign of Bitcoin according to many crypto experts will increase confidence in the digital currency.\nThe legitimacy bar for digital currencies has been raised now that Goldman Sachs is going to facilitate the institutional trading of Bitcoin. They’re proceeding cautiously and will not trade actual Bitcoin initially. Instead, the bank will use its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts for clients. It will also trade non-deliverable forward futures where trades will be settled in the regulated currency it is quoted in.\nBitcoin had been on a rebound the past couple of months. Interest in the currency increased over the course of 2017, which also caused volatility to skyrocket. The price of the digital currency topped to $20000 which was triple its value in the second half of last year before dropping to $8,000 in February of 2018.\nThe cryptocurrency traded as high as $9,300 before South Korean officials raided South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, sending prices as low as $8,200.\nWhile Goldman Sachs dips its toes in the cryptocurrency markets, CultureBanx found BitMEX is way ahead of the game. CEO Arthur Hayes helms this leading cryptocurrency derivative exchange. The company offers derivative products to retail investors and has a daily trading volume approaching $3 billion. BitMEX made $21 million in revenue during January of this year and posted a revenue of $83 million in 2017. The company is on track to exceed its 2018 performance.\nHayes said to Bloomberg:\n“This is the best thing you could ever have. We make more money when the market goes down. We love this volatility.”\nAs institutional investors engage in these derivatives, they’ll be looking to ease their cautiousness by having a reliable benchmark for their performance. Goldman Sachs alumnus and billionaire cryptocurrency advocate Mike Novogratz announced a partnership with Bloomberg to launch the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index. It will track the performance of the 10 most liquid cryptocurrencies.\nNovogratz told Business Insider:\n“This is just one more building block in the foundation which will get, at one point, pension funds and family offices and sovereign wealth funds all participating in the crypto economy.”\nBitcoin had a rough start to the year and suffered a major loss during the first quarter causing the price to plummet down 48%. Hayes noted we should be on the lookout for increased volatility in Bitcoin prices as more players enter the derivatives market for the cryptocurrency.\nHayes said on the Flux Podcast:\n“People have been lulled into complacency with a market that keeps going up every day.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:43:26.084+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ebb6918cd1bc3d6fab206d95163d593508572a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbUnSIr.ik3J8WPMbLjtakg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "[ANN] Litecoin - a lite version of Bitcoin.

Is it even smart to report your gains after not having done it for years? I have been thinking about it for a while.\nCan you just claim that you found back an old wallet file? At some point large holders will become multi millionaires and it will somehow require them to come up with a solid plan of action to buy properties and such.\nThat's actually a good question, but it depends on what country you are from firstly. I have done some research on this last year, and the explanation was pretty simple and straightforward.\nIf I can prove that my coins haven't been into circulation in the previous years, which can be proven easily with how open the blockchain is, it's like I instantly obtained that wealth, and only have to start paying due taxes from the moment I claim that I gained back access. That's from a wallet backup, which I assume is the easiest part because it clearly shows that your coins haven't been moving. I don't know how things are in case you can't prove that your funds haven't been into circulation.\nIn case of the latter you are better off just not declaring anything, or you have to contact an attorney specialized in crypto tax cases to see what your options are.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T19:55:09.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ff0c345bdb49a3c8704dd755a8638b3fefe378c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXkrgI7Wa6LDbJv3pi_OiDs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Services", "title": "Bitcoin PR Service 4 Years Running (Reuters.com, CCN, FOX, NBC, + 400 More)", "title_full": "Bitcoin PR Service 4 Years Running (Reuters.com, CCN, FOX, NBC, + 400 More)", "published": "2018-05-14T19:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ff0c345bdb49a3c8704dd755a8638b3fefe378c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXkrgI7Wa6LDbJv3pi_OiDs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "psybits", "published": "2018-05-14T19:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin PR Service 4 Years Running (Reuters.com, CCN, FOX, NBC, + 400 More)", "text": "***Important - I am not always on the forum, for any question at all please email contact@bitcoinprbuzz.com to hear back from one of our Account Managers within 24 business hours. ***\nABOUT BITCOIN PR BUZZ:\nWe have recently upgraded our services again with more publication points including Reuters.com, CCN.com BitcoinNews.com , FOX, NBC and much, much more.\nWe not only publish your PR on 200-400 sites, but also secure featured articles on leading industry news platforms including CCN.com, The Merkle, Coinspeaker, Coin Idol, BitcoinNews.com and more.\nYou will also be assigned a dedicated Account Manager.\nLearn more at http://bitcoinprbuzz.com/services or read more about our new services below:\nAs the first cryptocurrency and blockchain PR agency in the industry we leverage our unique experience, partnerships and expertise to bring you the most refined, cost-effective Bitcoin press release distribution service to be found.\nWith over 4 years experience and over 500 clients, our Bitcoin press release services include guaranteed publication of not just your press release, but also featured articles on BitcoinNews.com, CCN.com, The Merkle, Coinspeaker, Coin Idol, The Bitcoin News, Cripto Noticias, Criptomoedas Facil, ZYCrypto.com, Bitcoin News Latin America, Brazil, Arabia and Indonesia, and PR publication on 200-400 other online news outlets including Reuters.com, NBC, Fox, WND.com, Digital Journal, International Business Times, San Diego Tribune, Boston Globe and much more.

A piece of gold today will have the exact same properties in 1000 years that it has today. This gives it predictability.\nCryptocurrency is not this. Cryptocurrency is mutable. IT'S SOFTWARE. That means the properties of the asset change whenever the software changes. The bitcoins that I bought in 2012 no longer exist. They have morphed into Bitcoin Core with Segwit, Bitcoin Cash (soon with opcodes), Bitcoin Gold and Diamond and Candy and God knows what else.\nBut the coins with the 2012 characteristics are no more.

Once the market gets larger (much larger) volatility should decrease significantly. The plus the lightning network will set Bitcoin up for use as a currency. Currently right now with its volatility, people view it as a speculative investment.

The state's Department of Financial Services said it also approved Gemini to offer custody services and trading of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in the future. Zcash's market value was roughly $1.3 billion on Monday, according to CoinMarketCap.com, while Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin's respective values were $25 billion and $8.3 billion. Bitcoin's market value was about $150.1 billion. \"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions. Industry critics say the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering. Last month, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked Gemini and 12 other cryptocurrency trading platforms to provide details about their operations and safety measures. Zcash incorporates the technology \"zk-snark,\" short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, which lets people trade with each other in anonymity. Gemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later. \"We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,\" Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo's office. The Winklevosses, who are 36-year-old twins, in 2008 reached a $65 million settlement with Facebook Inc and founder Mark Zuckerberg over who had the idea for the social media website. They also competed in the men's rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Tom Lee, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors and a longtime bitcoin advocate, fits that bill nicely.\nNow, Lee’s team of financial researchers has revealed a dramatically bullish prediction for the price of the world’s leading digital currency by market cap. Fundstrat’s Sam Doctor wrote late last week that the price of one BTC could climb to at least $20,000 and might soar as high as $64,000 sometime in 2019.\nFundstrat’s bullish call is related to the process of mining bitcoin as the cryptocurrency approaches its maximum supply of 21 million coins, according to newsbtc.com. The team believes that the cost of mining a single bitcoin has proved to be a solid support in the past; as the difficulty of mining increases while we approach the last bitcoin’s to be mined, this level of strong support will also increase.\nBitcoin recently passed the landmark of 17 million coins in supply, meaning that miners are getting relatively close to the pre-set maximum circulation.

By Charlie Allen\nWherever you look, cryptocurrencies are in the news. Love them or loathe them, you can't ignore them.\nIn the past few months alone, Lloyds Banking Group Plc has blocked customers from buying cryptocurrencies with their credit cards, becoming the first U.K. bank to ban borrowing for bitcoin. Furthermore, the South Korean government has barred its officials from holding and trading cryptocurrency, and a former Indian government official has stated that such currencies should not be allowed as it's impossible to regulate them properly. He claimed that unlike shares, which have an underlying value, \"they are created out of a vacuum or thin air.\"\nAt the same time, Cardtronics, a non-bank ATM operator, has claimed that the growth in public interest in cryptocurrency could affect the general population's need or demand for cash.\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 as a digital asset designed to act as a medium of exchange. In May 2010, two pizzas were bought using 10,000 bitcoins. The price has fluctuated greatly, but at the time of writing, one bitcoin is worth £6,650 ($9,005.59). According to a Nov. 27 Forbes article, bitcoin saw a 55 percent increase in trading volume in 2017 with 30,000 new wallets created daily.\nHow easy is it to use bitcoin and what role do ATMs and cash play in this? Bitcoin evolves, bringing new challenges\nIn recent years, bitcoin has become easier to use and more accessible. The evolution of bitcoin ATMs that enable users to buy and sell bitcoins for cash is an important element of this development. The first bitcoin ATM was introduced at a Vancouver coffee shop in 2013 and there are currently 115 of these ATMs in the U.K., 83 of which are in London.\nThough the term \"ATM\" is used, these are specialist machines and there is no connection to a bank account. Rather, users are connected to a bitcoin exchange. Bitcoin ATMs are expensive to operate and the fees charged reflect this.\nSo how is this similar to a traditional ATM and how are the required technologies similar? An exchange of value\nObviously, the process is more complex than a straightforward ATM cash transaction, but bitcoin purchases and sales via the machines do involve inward and outward cash payments. It is about the exchange of value to or from physical currency.\nThe machines therefore require the technology necessary to ensure only genuine cash is accepted and dispensed, and that the count is accurate. The ability to consistently detect doubles, even with severely degraded notes, cannot be understated and is where significant recent advances in technology have taken place. That's not all. Recent reports have highlighted the potential for money laundering and fraud at bitcoin ATMs, which is where serial number recognition technology comes into its own, enabling full traceability of every note passing through the machine.\nOptical character recognition exports the serial number of each banknote to a control computer through a direct communication application. Digital images of the banknotes can also be captured for enhanced security and risk reduction. Technology must adapt to new demands\nThis technology gives customers the confidence to know that only genuine notes have been dispensed and provides the evidence to challenge the operator if they are at all suspicious of counterfeit notes being issued. Serial number recognition is being mandated by more and more central banks, with the Chinese among the first to adopt it.\nUnderstandably, the rise in new payment technologies and the advent of cryptocurrencies could ultimately reduce the general population's need or demand for cash and negatively impact future transaction volumes for traditional ATM operators.\nOn the other hand, there is a definite opportunity for manufacturers to meet the growing demand for cryptocurrency by installing more self-serve kiosks in the market.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charlie allen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "glory global solutions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lloyds banking group plc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cardtronics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:13:56.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "491ae4ccd5e917004a086412f082bfab4a36c403", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46ehTR5OM8UlAUFJVBWKSkQg--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=21", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Modem - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-14T18:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "491ae4ccd5e917004a086412f082bfab4a36c403", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46ehTR5OM8UlAUFJVBWKSkQg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-14T18:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans", "text": " software complex for breaking any Captcha\nI'm shocked!

The conference could cause Bitcoin to rally, Thomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicted last week.\nConsensus, hosted by media and research company CoinDesk, has already featured Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard and FedEx CEO Frederick Smith, who said blockchain technology “could be the next big disruption.”\nSource:Bloomberg\nBullard did throw some cold water on the festivities, noting that “cryptocurrencies are creating drift toward a non-uniform currency in the US, a state of affairs that has existed historically but was disliked and eventually replaced.”\n© 2018 Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frederick smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james bullard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve bank of st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manhattan lamborghinis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hilton midtown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T00:02:51.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c08da1b22ac6400b646433f1c0ae55f19716f59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.svLVUcHwBfX0UYIw95g4haTgUaetW47vYFbAWntdNn_wyOTd6BswMLM_nTXr8DFpALb5ixjdc7uN", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Florida Tax Collector to Accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Payments", "title_full": "Florida Tax Collector to Accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Payments", "published": "2018-05-14T18:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8c08da1b22ac6400b646433f1c0ae55f19716f59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.svLVUcHwBfX0UYIw95g4haTgUaetW47vYFbAWntdNn_wyOTd6BswMLM_nTXr8DFpALb5ixjdc7uN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Bitcoiner (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T18:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Florida Tax Collector to Accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Payments", "text": "https://ift.tt/2IdUbhj Florida Tax Collector to Accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Payments https://ift.tt/2IdUbhj BitPay has partnered with a Florida county tax collector to facilitate tax payments in bitcoin and bitcoin cash. https://ift.tt/eA8V8J https://ift.tt/eA8V8J May 14, 2018 at 08:55AM CryptScout #BitFeed RSS - Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency News 24/7 http://cryptscout.com Florida Tax Collector to Accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Payments\nBitPay has partnered with a Florida county tax collector to facilitate tax payments in bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

The fourth-largest cryptocurrency recorded a price per token of $1,455.25 on Monday, with a market cap of $24.9 billion that gives it a valuation nearly double that of competitor EOS. The new upgrade is set to re-open old arguments about the role of Bitcoin Cash, and there’s evidence to suggest the upgrade could lead to big movements in the markets. Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork: OK, Hold Up, What Does That Even Mean? First, a quick primer. What is a “hard fork”? Bitcoin Cash was created as a “fork” of the original Bitcoin in August 2017, largely over disagreements about mysterious inventor Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision for the cryptocurrency launched in 2009. The Bitcoin network stores transaction data in “blocks” which add onto a global chain (hence the term “blockchain”), and around one new block is added to the chain every 10 minutes. Bitcoin’s block size has remained at one megabyte, and Cash supporters claim it needs to expand to continue working as a viable means of transferring value internationally. Bitcoin Cash launched with a block size of eight megabytes, which potentially means more transactions processed at once. This new upgrade, set for Tuesday, is known as the Adjustable Blocksize Cap upgrade. It quadruples the size of the block to 32 megabytes, while also enabling smart contract creation. The upgrade has a number of implications for speed and decentralized apps , also known as “dapps.” The revolution will not be televised. It'll be sent to your inbox by us. Bitcoin Cash's price over the past month. “A larger block size means that the network will have a better transaction throughput which should help it on its way to commercial adoption,” cryptocurrency blog CaptainAltCoin writes, which predicts a continuation of the coin’s upwards trend. “Smart contracts mean that Bitcoin Cash will become a suitable platform for people to develop Dapps on. With its improved block size it should have transactions that will be faster and more scalable than Ethereum, currently the main Dapp platform out there.” Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork: Price Predictions and What It Means for Investors One of Bitcoin Cash’s biggest proponents, Roger Ver, has gone one step further. In an interview with The Independent last week, he predicted that “big investors coming in soon could see it double again by next week” because “people love to chase a rising star.” Beyond the week, he predicted the cryptocurrency reaching a price of “hundreds of thousands of dollars” with Bitcoin Cash possibly overtaking Bitcoin before the end of 2020. Not everyone is supportive of the upgrade. Dutch exchange BL3P is using the fork as an opportunity to remove Bitcoin Cash altogether. In a Monday update, the company said : “Since there already was a planning for the removal of Bitcash, the hard fork has become a reason and strict deadline for the removal of Bitcash from BL3P.” Tom Lee, analyst at Fundstrat Global Advisors, has also taken the opportunity with the hard fork to reiterate his support for Bitcoin. In an interview with CNBC on April 24, days after the announcement of the hard fork, he recommended the cryptocurrency over Bitcoin Cash because “if I was putting new money to work, a fresh dollar, I’d be much more interested in buying a laggard that could attract inflows, rather than something that is potentially overbought.” Whether the upgrade excites the markets, or whether it results in more investors moving their money elsewhere, remains to be seen.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bl3p.eu/en/news/41/Bitcoin+Cash+wordt+verwijderd+van+BL3P", "https://captainaltcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork/", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ethereum-price-latest-updates-bitcoin-cash-roger-ver-crytocurrency-flippening-a8345166.html", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/04/24/in-the-battle-between-bitcoin-and-bitcoin-cash-tom-lee-says-buy-bitcoin.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T19:50:10.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e96b9858ab810d415b0ff93821fe088de259552c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbSVJt57vFA9u0TWYEfCL1c-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Roger Ver to be sued for defrauding bitcoin newbies.", "title_full": "Roger Ver to be sued for defrauding bitcoin newbies.", "published": "2018-05-14T18:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e96b9858ab810d415b0ff93821fe088de259552c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbSVJt57vFA9u0TWYEfCL1c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DooMAD", "published": "2018-05-14T18:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Roger Ver to be sued for defrauding bitcoin newbies.", "text": "I would agree with what has been mentioned abobe, that the raising attention to this accident can negatively affect the market but at the same time any attention is good because you are getting to be talked about.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T09:12:00.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee2090cd1168d07d44703615d3d6443fdab9de63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiT4VnKd3Fg5Gzs77Li_PLVEhfy9CQyOA.EVXtOOepT3xUH_kg9BMnxWqnTSNA1TAKg--", "site_full": "www.freerepublic.com", "site": "freerepublic.com", "site_section": "http://www.freerepublic.com/tag/*/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest Articles", "title": "The Bitcoin Bunker Holding Billions", "title_full": "The Bitcoin Bunker Holding Billions", "published": "2018-05-14T18:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9817, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee2090cd1168d07d44703615d3d6443fdab9de63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiT4VnKd3Fg5Gzs77Li_PLVEhfy9CQyOA.EVXtOOepT3xUH_kg9BMnxWqnTSNA1TAKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Safehaven.com", "published": "2018-05-14T18:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Bitcoin Bunker Holding Billions", "text": "Click The Pic To Donate Trump: 'No More DACA Deal,' Go 'Nuclear' for 'Tough Laws!'

Hardly any assets have proved to be as mysterious and alluring as the new digital cryptocurrency has over the last few years, with millions of investors jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon in 2017 and sending its price to record highs. Despite being one of the most volatile and exciting assets on the market, bitcoin has risen from just under $1,000 at the start of 2017 to over $19,000 towards the end of the year. Here is all you need to know about the mystery that is Bitcoin.\nWHERE DID IT COME FROM?\nBitcoin is known to be a ‘decentralised’ currency, meaning it is not tied to any central bank or government regulator. It’s a cryptocurrency that has no physical form and it exists only in a set of encrypted code. The creators wanted to introduce a new digital currency that was not regulated and could pass national borders. Bitcoin ‘miners’ crack complex sections of code known as ‘blockchain’ and that can be used as a payment method. The limit introduced by the creators are 21m bitcoins.\nIn its early days, very few businesses were keen on accepting the new cryptocurrency but as its success has increased, more and more began to take it as an acceptable form of payment. With its growing popularity, its price also rose and in equal measure the criticism and wariness from major financial institutions around the world. People are increasingly beginning to accept the idea of a decentralised currency.\nROLLERCOASTER\nIn its relatively short life so far bitcoin has experienced more volatility than many of its currency counterparts have seen in several decades. Bitcoin has gone through several rockets up in price that are closely followed by damaging crashes.\nOpinions are very varied on bitcoin’s rallies, some believe it’s just another flash in the pan and others that it may be the start towards being recognised as a global currency and viable alternative to centralised systems. Only time can tell.\nINVESTING IN BITCOIN\nEven though a single Bitcoin is currently heading towards more than $9,300, online trading platforms such as eToro allow users to engage in fractional trading, whereby sellers and buyers can agree prices based on values of less than one full Bitcoin. Like with any other investment, it is key to pick a strategy and stick to it, especially with an asset so volatile as bitcoin. Using the eToro platform, users can also view the actions of experienced Bitcoin traders and replicate their strategies to achieve the best results.\nFrom http://www.livecharts.co.uk/livewire/2018/05/all-you-need-to-know-about-investing-in-bitcoin/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:21:17.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64580a1844f5c0aa200ce3b5c44429771e99ccfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4Amv2X9MguiQLo2mQG1Gci6auE0x4UF.xw6ONEWoso5gr3LuNqTqF00YXXt9KV46z", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoins and Cryptocurrency: Who Gets What in Divorce?", "title_full": "Bitcoins and Cryptocurrency: Who Gets What in Divorce?", "published": "2018-05-14T18:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64580a1844f5c0aa200ce3b5c44429771e99ccfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4Amv2X9MguiQLo2mQG1Gci6auE0x4UF.xw6ONEWoso5gr3LuNqTqF00YXXt9KV46z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T18:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoins and Cryptocurrency: Who Gets What in Divorce?", "text": "Bitcoins and Cryptocurrency: Who Gets What in Divorce?\nBitcoins and Cryptocurrency: Who Gets What in Divorce?

The Ethereal Summit is selling tickets for $1300 The Token Summit charging a $979 The \"Women on the Block\" which was held on Mother's Day and charged $299 or $599 for a VIP access NYC Blockchain Tech and Invest Summit is charging $899 ADI Cryptocurrency Mining Summit is at a relatively cheap at $499 to $699 With so much crypto-testosterone rubbing shoulders in one city with cell phones in hand, its no wonder there would be a rally... Technically, the price of the digital currency did first fall today. Looking at the hourly chart below, from the Coinbase exchange, The price moved toward the lows from the weekend trading, but did stall ahead of those lows. That started the run higher. The price moved up to a new session high at $8824. That move on the hourly took the price back above the 100 hour MA at $8634. That MA stalled the high in earlier trading today. The break above is a bullish play. Stay above will have traders thinking the lows may be in place. The problem with the run, however, is that the high at $8824 crossed just above the 100 day MA (blue line in the daily chart below) at $8819.63 by about $5, but stalled. The price is down modestly, but there is a technical battle now going on between the 100 hour MA below and the 100 day MA above. The bitcoin stories, the hype, the trading crypto- testosterone is all going on this week in NYC. Just because of that I would expect the buyers have the advantage. If not, the digital currency may be in more trouble. Let the technical's tell the story. The 100 hour MA below should attract some buying if the bulls are to take control. On the topside though, the buyers do need to show their love for bitcoin above the 100 day MA. Get above and they can cheer each other to even higher levels. If it all fails, there were be some sad faces in the Big Apple.

Elduayen 7th April 2018 at 12:56 am\nIt is always nice and refreshing to listen to your show. Today’s show I enjoyed it thoroughly. I thought the intro was brilliant, you reading a book and then Jordan’s statement made me jump.\nI was living in the Maldives when that massive earthquake, and the consequent tsunami, struck Fukishima, Japan. Then the nuclear power station exploded and the planet was aghast. The following day a self proclaimed “spiritual leader” came to the school where I was working and congregated the entire school in the main hall. This guy began to give a sermon in Dhivehi, the language of the Maldives. I could not understand what the guy was saying, but I could hear it. He started his speech softly softly, but as the time was going by the tone become more a more aggressive and he ended the 20 minutes long speech practically shouting at the school children. I could only read and understand his body language and that was more than enough. I asked several of my colleagues to tell me what the guy spoke, but no one would tell me. Eventually, a guy told me, discretely when no one was around and hear him, what had been said. Basically, he was threatening the kids that they had to do their work and followed obediently what his parents, teachers and elders told them, otherwise the wrath god would create another tsunami in the Indian Ocean and punish them with death. I thought that was child abuse, to coerce the kids, to threaten them with a catastrophe if they dare to disobey their elders. He was invoking a sea monster in the name of his god, whoever that is. I wonder how many kids disobeyed and later realised that no tsunami came after challenging authority.\nIt was sheer lunacy from the some of our human greedy rulers to build the nuclear power station in such a place. Personally, I would not call it a sin. In the same way, I disagree with Jordan. A hurricane is *not* an act of god and not to prepare for it is not a sin. Gods are humans constructions and hurricanes, earthquakes and the like are natural phenomena which can be perfectly explained with Physics and Geology. I have not read Jordan’s latest book, but I have heard him in interviews. Without a doubt the guy is well versed and cultivated, but some of his statements crossed the line of rationality into dogma. That makes me jump.\nIn my opinion, some traditions are harmful, whereas others are very sensible. It is not always easy to discern the good ones from the dodgy ones.\nI must get a hardware wallet. And if I continue to procrastinate, which is not the same as sinning—no matter what Jordan says, I might have to regret my approach of “I will buy one at some later time” 😉 Thanks a lot for your work.

The state's Department of Financial Services said it also granted approval for Gemini to offer custody services and trading of Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash in the future. \"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement. Gemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later. \"We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,\" Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo's office. Zcash has a market value of about $1.2 billion, while the market values of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are about $24.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions, with trades conducted through a fragmented network of exchanges. Critics of the industry said the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering. The Winklevosses, who are twins, are internet entrepreneurs who also competed in the rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Goldman Goes All In\nFollowing a slew of inquiries from hedge funds, foundations, and endowments benefiting from Bitcoin millionaires, Goldman Sachs has become the first regulated financial institution to afford clients the ability to trade Bitcoin futures via one of its New York desks, according to Forbes .\nWhat this means is that the Wall Street titan will essentially help shepherd the herd of institutional investors into the trading of Bitcoin.\nGoldman Sachs will not actually trade Bitcoin, of course. Rather, the bank will trade Bitcoin futures contracts for clients using its own funds, in addition to non-deliverable forward futures.\nSuch a glowing endorsement from the most profitable securities firm in history should undoubtedly signal confidence in not only Bitcoin but the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Fashionably Late\nThe injection of investment funds into the cryptocurrency market comes after eToro senior analyst Mati Greenspan predicted a wave of Wall Street investment entering the space. Specifically, he explained that institutional investors were interested in catching Bitcoin at the bottom after missing the boat last year.\nGreenspan explained :\nSo they were trying hard to catch that bull run, and it seems they did miss the party. November was a very interesting time […] I imagine that the clients in the Wall Street banks also wanted to get in on that party.\nGoldman Sachs is now chauffeuring clients to said party, but it remains unclear which direction these futures traders will push the market.\n“Whether they’re going to go full-on bull or full-on bear we don’t know, but the important thing is that they’re ready to take on and ready to inject new liquidity into this market — which at least should even things out and stabilize the price,” explained Greenspan. Beaten by BitMEX\nGoldman Sachs official entrance into the Bitcoin futures market comes after BitMEX, a cryptocurrency derivative exchange, has already been offering derivative products to retail investors.\nAs noted by Forbes , the exchange has a daily trading volume upwards of $3 million and posted a revenue of $83 million in 2017.\nIn fact, BitMEX posted $21 million in revenue in January alone, when the market experienced a significant correction. Arthur Hayes, the company’s CEO said:\nThis is the best thing you could ever have. We make more money when the market goes down. We love this volatility.\nWhat do you think about Goldman Sachs entrance into the Bitcoin futures market? Which direction do you think institutions will push the market with their investment funds?

This has reinforced $1,500 as a key resistance level ahead of the hard fork scheduled for tomorrow (15 May). All eyes are now on that level as a break could see BCH displacing Ripple’s XRP as the third most valuable cryptocurrency, bringing more buyers to the market.\nFundamental View\nMarket participants continue to hold widely conflicting views about Bitcoin Cash . However, it’s important to note that its price performance has been better than most had expected, and it has managed to retain a strong following.\nAs far as adoption of Bitcoin Cash goes, there is little evidence that it is outperforming Bitcoin Core. As of March, Bitcoin Segwit transaction alone outnumbered transactions on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.\nTomorrow’s hard fork will result in the block size for BCH being increased to 32 MB, which will allow more transactions to be to be included in each block. Critics have pointed out that given the current number of transactions currently taking place, this is unnecessary.\nSince launching, BCH has mostly traded at between 7.5 and 20 percent of the value of BTC. It’s currently trading at around 16.5 percent of BTC’s value, and mean reversion would suggest a move back toward 12 percent – or $1,000 at current BTC prices. That is unless the long-term relationship is going to change in BCH’s favour. Bitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin Core (Image Credit: www.tradingview.com )\nThe Technical Picture\nBitcoin Cash rallied over 200 percent from a low of just above $600 on 6th April. Since reaching a high of $1,844 on 6th May, the price action has been bearish with a series of lower lows and lower highs. Bitcoin Cash Price Action Since 6th April Low (Image Credit: www.tradingview.com )\nTrendline resistance now coincides with horizontal resistance at $1,500. A break above this level may well result in an explosive move to the upside. This would likely result in BCH becoming the third largest cryptocurrency and bring new buyers to the market.\nHowever, a rally may not be sustainable in the long term unless there is news that supports a rally or significant new buying across the broader cryptocurrency market .\nIf on the other hand, support at $1,275 and $1,236 give way, the bearish trend will be confirmed.\nConclusion\nThe bulls are looking for BCH to break $1,500 following tomorrow’s hard fork. If that level does break, new buyers may be attracted to the market and the price would quickly reach $1,655 and possibly $1,848. Beyond that, the market will be looking for news to support a longer-term rally.\nIf, however, support at $1,275 and $1,236 is broken, traders may wish to hold short positions until the trendline is broken – it’s possible that the price may retrace all the way to $600.\nThis article was written by FX Empire", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxempire.com/", "http://www.tradingview.com/", "https://www.fxempire.com/crypto/exchanges", "https://www.fxempire.com/education/article/how-to-buy-bitcoin-cash-428434"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:31:15.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ded1cad3a1e084be94ef543d16718588e36c583", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ4648SdcVvvp2Epc9eQBqpKDA--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=20", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Lan - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "That is why Bitcoin crashed...", "title_full": "That is why Bitcoin crashed... - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-14T18:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ded1cad3a1e084be94ef543d16718588e36c583", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ4648SdcVvvp2Epc9eQBqpKDA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-14T18:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "That is why Bitcoin crashed...", "text": " software for SEO/SMM\nXEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Coin-crans , Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS , XEvil 4.0 + any SEO/SMM software = PROFIT! , I'm shocked!

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices.

Genesis, as many of you reading this might know, is the world’s largest cloud bitcoin mining company, with over 2 million customers worldwide. It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm.\nThis week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation.\nTell us how you got started in this industry.\nI’ve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin—it progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it.\nHow would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It’s a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.\nThe conventional banking system really shows its limitations when we try to move money between developed and underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa. There are some serious inefficiencies that, frankly, many of the big banks just aren’t interested in fixing. But with bitcoin, you don’t have to worry about that. You can send money to, say, a coffee farmer in Africa, and he’ll receive it directly.\nMoney transfers are only one among a number of many other uses. Bitcoin is also a store of value. It’s one of the few assets that I would say are uncorrelated to the broader financial markets.\nAs for blockchain, it has innumerable world-changing applications across a wide range of industries. That’s why I believe it’s crucial that people have the right information about blockchain and understand it. If people don’t understand it, and it gets overhyped, I’m afraid it could start going in the wrong direction.\nWe recently mined the 17 millionth bitcoin, leaving only four million left. Explain why it becomes exponentially more difficult to mine coins the closer we get to that 21 million-coin ceiling.\nIt’s not that the mining itself becomes more difficult. To answer this, I think we have to look at two components.\nOne component is the daily supply of bitcoin. At the moment, only 1,800 bitcoins can be generated every day by the whole network, meaning all the miners worldwide. But it’s important to remember that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined, the rewards are halved. What this means is that after the next halving, which I believe is expected sometime in 2020, the number of bitcoins mined a day will fall from 1,800 to 900. And then after the next halving, it’ll be 450. This helps reduce the supply in a natural way.\nclick to enlarge\nThe second component is a measure of how many miners and how much computing power is in the network. If more miners come online, then of course the competition becomes greater. Because the daily supply is already fixed, your market share shrinks.\nclick to enlarge\nThink of it like the California Gold Rush. Mining gold at first was relatively easy because the metal was plentiful and there were few miners. By the end, it became more difficult because the easy gold had already been claimed, and you were competing with far more miners. We’re seeing the same thing happen with bitcoin and other mineable digital currencies.\nSpeaking of computing power, HIVE Blockchain just announced that it expanded to 24.2 megawatts (MW), up from 2.4 MW in August. What’s next in the pipeline for HIVE?\nYes, the last expansion was a massive build-out in Sweden. It was done in three phases. I think this was a remarkable achievement for HIVE, that it could add so much computing power so quickly.\nThis is only the beginning. The year is still long and you can expect to see some bigger expansions on the way. In September, for example, we’re going to ramp up another bitcoin mining facility worth 20 MW, which is very exciting. And from there it goes even further.\nG20 finance ministers are scheduled to share their plans for more uniform regulation of cryptocurrencies by July. What are your expectations?\nI personally think that this is very good and that it will bring more professionalism into the market. The momentum and adoption has grown so much and so rapidly that there really needs to be some kind of strategy—the world’s economic leaders can’t just leave this space untouched. Anyone who believes otherwise isn’t facing reality.\nHaving said that, regulating this market will not be easy because it’s in a whole other dimension than anything that has come before it. As an analogy, imagine someone trying to regulate flying cars using the same measures that have been written for cars driving on the street. It wouldn’t make any sense. So there will certainly need to be some innovation to get it right. I think it’s also important that the regulators talk to the right people, the industry leaders. They have good input, and I think it could be a very fruitful dialogue.\nAlong those same lines, South Korea’s central bank just announced that it was looking seriously into how the Korean economy might use blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, there’s talk of the country going cashless by 2020. Do you think that’s where the global financial systems are headed?\nI think there’s a natural incentive for governments to go in that direction because, of course, they want to have greater control over their economies. But as is the case with overregulation, too many controls—or going completely cashless—could be harmful to the economy. This is certainly part of a long and interesting debate, and I’m curious to see how it plays out, in South Korea and elsewhere.\nWhere do you see the best application of blockchain technology right now?\nBlockchain’s greatest contribution is its ability to erase boundaries. It completely removes the element of trust—or distrust, I should say—and adds a stabilizing effect to nearly every industry because of decentralization.\nTake the global banking industry, for example. You don’t need to look far to find some serious inefficiencies, as I mentioned earlier. We’re already seeing some very concrete instances where blockchain can be of help here. The banks recognize this and are getting together to make use of this technology to improve their services.\nWhat’s been the greatest challenge you’ve faced so far in your journey?\nFor me, the greatest challenge can usually be found in the moment that you’re currently in. I always compare this industry to the beginning of the internet—no one knew where it was headed or what it would eventually look like. Most people had a general idea that it was innovative and could benefit the world, but the full implications were unclear.\nSimilarly, no one knows where blockchain and cryptocurrencies might take us, and having to deal with this constant uncertainty is, I’ll admit, not trivial. You must always be prepared to act quickly in response to another bitcoin fork, a hack or some other unexpected event. These are things that keep you up at night.\nBut it’s exciting. I think what history has shown again and again is that it’s dangerous to be ignorant and to not have an open mind. Not everything was euphoric and wonderful when the internet first emerged. Problems still occur online, but I believe most people would agree that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nNo industry is without its challenges, and as long as you’re willing to address them, it can be very rewarding. As for blockchain technology, I’m very happy and thrilled to be a part of it this early on.\nInterested in learning more?

Goldman Goes All In\nFollowing a slew of inquiries from hedge funds, foundations, and endowments benefiting from Bitcoin millionaires, Goldman Sachs has become the first regulated financial institution to afford clients the ability to trade Bitcoin futures via one of its New York desks, according to Forbes .\nWhat this means is that the Wall Street titan will essentially help shepherd the herd of institutional investors into the trading of Bitcoin.\nGoldman Sachs will not actually trade Bitcoin, of course. Rather, the bank will trade Bitcoin futures contracts for clients using its own funds, in addition to non-deliverable forward futures.\nSuch a glowing endorsement from the most profitable securities firm in history should undoubtedly signal confidence in not only Bitcoin but the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Fashionably Late\nThe injection of investment funds into the cryptocurrency market comes after eToro senior analyst Mati Greenspan predicted a wave of Wall Street investment entering the space. Specifically, he explained that institutional investors were interested in catching Bitcoin at the bottom after missing the boat last year.\nGreenspan explained :\nSo they were trying hard to catch that bull run, and it seems they did miss the party. November was a very interesting time […] I imagine that the clients in the Wall Street banks also wanted to get in on that party.\nGoldman Sachs is now chauffeuring clients to said party, but it remains unclear which direction these futures traders will push the market.\n“Whether they’re going to go full-on bull or full-on bear we don’t know, but the important thing is that they’re ready to take on and ready to inject new liquidity into this market — which at least should even things out and stabilize the price,” explained Greenspan. Beaten by BitMEX\nGoldman Sachs official entrance into the Bitcoin futures market comes after BitMEX, a cryptocurrency derivative exchange, has already been offering derivative products to retail investors.\nAs noted by Forbes , the exchange has a daily trading volume upwards of $3 million and posted a revenue of $83 million in 2017.\nIn fact, BitMEX posted $21 million in revenue in January alone, when the market experienced a significant correction. Arthur Hayes, the company’s CEO said:\nThis is the best thing you could ever have. We make more money when the market goes down. We love this volatility.\nWhat do you think about Goldman Sachs entrance into the Bitcoin futures market? Which direction do you think institutions will push the market with their investment funds?

currencies should make sure those activities are clearly “segregated” from their other operations, a top ECB official cautioned Monday, as ever more financial institutions mull jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon.\n“Due to the high volatility of VCs (virtual currencies) it might seem appropriate to require any VC trading to be backed by adequate levels of capital, and segregated from other trading and investment activities,” European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch said in a speech in Turkey.\nThe warning comes as regulators worldwide grapple with how to respond to the boom in so-called cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which lure investors with the promise of high returns but are not backed by any central banks and can fall prey to scams.\nVirtual currencies “are not money” and their influence on the real economy remains limited, Mersch insisted.\n“But this can change,” he admitted.\nUS banking giant Goldman Sachs announced plans in March to start trading bitcoin futures, in what could be a step towards giving the notoriously opaque cryptocurrency market more legitimacy.\nSeveral smaller financial players have already taken the plunge.\nIn Switzerland, Falcon Private Bank offers asset management services for a range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, while financial and trading services group Swissquote offers trading in five virtual currencies.\nUnderscoring the high risk that comes with betting on virtual currencies, Mersch noted that the price of bitcoin had plunged from almost $20,000 (16,700 euros) to below $7,000 between December and February.\nBitcoin trading is still in its infancy, Mersch said, with some 200,000 bitcoin transactions carried out globally each day compared with 330 million retail payments in the euro area.\nBut if the use of cryptocurrencies spreads, “a crash could affect the stability of the wider financial system if big banks were to hold huge unhedged exposures to VCs”, he warned.

Companies are looking for ways to divest themselves of the traditional blockchain mining ecosystem. While once a perfect fit, mining is now running head first into scalability issues.\nBetween advancing hardware and intense power consumption, the average miner can no longer turn a profit. The recent proliferation of ASIC mining rigs is even damaging the core concept of blockchain technology – decentralization. If a single entity can produce enough mining power, they can control a majority of newly minted coins.\nAs such, proof of work (PoW) is becoming less attractive. In its stead, established projects and ICOs alike are looking to proof of stake (PoS) to offer a new solution. Rather than require arbitrary computations and shifting difficulties to meter the release of new currency, PoS relies on an investment in the project itself. Users that hold a portion of the currency can serve as validators – rather than a series of mining rigs. The Shift to Proof of Stake\nEthereum is easily the largest project to plan a switch to a PoS algorithm. Their dominance of the smart contract environment put them in a poor position at the beginning of 2018. Transaction speed slowed to a crawl and mining fees started to grow. A proof of stake algorithm would free resources to focus on transaction validation rather than coin creation. Further, it would remove ASIC mining rigs from the equation – and the associated centralization that goes along with it.\nMany of the newer proof of stake coins use MasterNode systems. In these environments, users must possess a certain minimum amount to be considered vested in the project. At this point, they have proven their stake in the success of the coin and are considered trusted parties to validate transactions. However, this also ensures that only those with MasterNodes can collect transaction fees – leaving smaller investors out.\nUpcoming exchange DECOIN avoids this all together. Instead, every user that holds a minimum amount of their DECOIN currency is entitled to a return on their investment – proportional to the stored value and without the need for establishing a MasterNode. As such, they are using proof of stake as a means of sharing the value produced by their exchange – and to validate transactions on their blockchain.\nDECOIN’s PoS setup helps to create a community within their exchange. Users benefit from holding the native currency, while DECOIN rewards their loyalty to the platform. We’ve seen examples of native exchange coins in the past, but few have been so specifically integrated to provide digital dividends. Non-Financial Benefits of Proof of Stake\nWhile the internal benefits of a PoS system are considerable, there is also an environmental impact to the alternative. PoW algorithms and the associated mining ecosystem consumes an incredible amount of electricity. This electricity is created through a variety of means, but almost all require some sort of finite resource. Untethering cryptocurrency from mining will go a long way towards easing public fears about the industry. Considering at least one northern New York city has banned mining altogether, the shift may need to happen sooner, rather than later.\nMore information on the ICO and the company itself, including whitepapers and vision, can be found on https://www.decoin.io", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://decoin.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&aff_id=1000&source=bitcoinist", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "http://bitcoinist.com/world-class-crypto-expert-top-ranked-advisor-icobench-vladimir-nikitin-becomes-official-advisor-decoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T04:07:00.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d30c3b557eeecf5eae9cad1185cd4ad06119440", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1Ynn5avSSC08w1cT9TjrCsXroi7X8p7zxdN9orusV_9HwVzoe5t4CxmA.7b0KCdTRfqTA5XN_cS9RLHLF6UzKzqjg--", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Bitcoin can Attain $64000 value in 2019: Fundstrat – Investopedia", "title_full": "Bitcoin can Attain $64000 value in 2019: Fundstrat – Investopedia", "published": "2018-05-14T17:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-can-Attain-64000-value-in-2019-Fundstrat-8211-Investopedia.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d30c3b557eeecf5eae9cad1185cd4ad06119440", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1Ynn5avSSC08w1cT9TjrCsXroi7X8p7zxdN9orusV_9HwVzoe5t4CxmA.7b0KCdTRfqTA5XN_cS9RLHLF6UzKzqjg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-14T17:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin can Attain $64000 value in 2019: Fundstrat – Investopedia", "text": " Bitcoin can Attain $64000 value in 2019: Fundstrat – Investopedia\nWhen it comes to predictions about digital currencies like bitcoin (BTC), investors often turn to experts in the field.
