In January, at its peak, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market nearly reached a trillion dollars as blockchain projects still in their infancy and testnets such as Tron and EOS surpassed $17 billion.\nSince then, the price of most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Ripple have more than halved. Naturally, as the valuation of the cryptocurrency market fell by large margins, an increasing number of investors have started to lose interest in the market and confidence in the short-term rally of both major and emerging cryptocurrencies. But, regardless of the massive correction, big investors are still extremely optimistic and bullish.\nMany analysts expect that the bitcoin price will experience long-term growth as Wall Street investors grow more comfortable with the asset class. Earlier this month, CNBC Fast Money contributor and BKCM founder Brian Kelly emphasized that he was shocked the market did not react to the entrance of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and JPMorgan into the cryptocurrency market. If the two major institutions had entered the market in January, when the cryptocurrency market was at an all-time high, it likely would have pushed the cryptocurrency market beyond the $1 trillion mark.\nMore institutional investors, retail traders, financial institutions, banks, stock markets, and governments are involved in the cryptocurrency sector than ever and the market is nearly at a yearly low. While most individual investors and newcomers see a sell-off period in a highly volatile time frame like this, large-scale investors see an accumulation period and an opportunity.\nErik Voorhees, the CEO at ShapeShift, stated:\n“I’m all for financial companies getting involved in crypto. Crypto as a monetary unit is transparent and legitimate because it’s market-based, as opposed to what they do now, which is handling fiat, which is not transparent and not market-based.”\nAccording to Salzman, Voorhees emphasized that it is inevitable cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether will replace fiat currencies like the US dollar in the future. Voorhees also noted that he does not believe financial companies will attempt to sidetrack the effort as ultimately, businesses chase money. “That’s the point. t’s pulling them in,” Voorhees added.\nFuture In the short-term, the bitcoin price could dip below the $8,000 mark, potentially into the lower end of $7,000. It also could demonstrate a sudden increase in momentum and bounce back to the $9,000 region and eventually to $10,000.\nNo investor or analyst could predict where the price of bitcoin goes in the short-term with absolute certainty. But, big investors are convinced cryptocurrencies are here to stay and will compete with traditional currencies and assets such as the US dollar and gold, and that is what really matters.\nImages from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avi salzman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "barron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:28:22.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2ac02a5af58b502f30f48bc49c86b236378ad1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSOuYmX.40STNrXtjCW53Xo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How stable is Bitcoin.", "title_full": "How stable is Bitcoin.", "published": "2018-05-23T00:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2ac02a5af58b502f30f48bc49c86b236378ad1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSOuYmX.40STNrXtjCW53Xo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lukeclick", "published": "2018-05-23T00:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "How stable is Bitcoin.", "text": "The fact that Bitcoin is just another crypto doesn't afford it the luxury of having a stable value, With the kind of volatile market crypto dwell on, Its almost impossible to acheive stability, The value of the coin might be on the rise now, but we cant be sure on whether it will remain at that for a considerable period of time", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T01:51:40.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cacd0a3f927640e486978dcf99c991dabbb48430", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMq9zF8VnC78hTSSkbZCdNIbIn.grH0eljLORlo2WYF2HzNn1JI6Zy4X.pp5ktBAJ_FsHDQGGzVpN0qsBbw2KqnQjOh4B8UOT8g-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6291", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Money Morning", "title": "Bitcoin Prices Could Rally as South Korean Exchange Is Cleared", "title_full": "Bitcoin Prices Could Rally as South Korean Exchange Is Cleared", "published": "2018-05-22T23:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cacd0a3f927640e486978dcf99c991dabbb48430", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AH2gPgwZiBuMq9zF8VnC78hTSSkbZCdNIbIn.grH0eljLORlo2WYF2HzNn1JI6Zy4X.pp5ktBAJ_FsHDQGGzVpN0qsBbw2KqnQjOh4B8UOT8g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T23:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Prices Could Rally as South Korean Exchange Is Cleared", "text": "May 22, 2018 at 16:56 PM EDT Bitcoin Prices Could Rally as South Korean Exchange Is Cleared Bitcoin prices fell nearly 2% down, to $8,232, as the broader cryptocurrency market continues its correction, but recent scandals plaguing the currency are finally in the past.

This alleviated major concerns about the exchange and its operations.\nPlus, today also marks the eighth anniversary of the famous Bitcoin pizza purchase, a reminder of just how powerfully lucrative cryptocurrencies can be.\nEight years ago today, a programmer paid 10,000 bitcoins for two Papa John's pizzas. Crypto enthusiasts have now dubbed the anniversary as \"Bitcoin Pizza Day.\" The 10,000 coins used in 2010 would now be worth a whopping $82 million. Coindesk celebrated the event by released in a \"Bitcoin Pizza Day\" price tracker on its site.\nHere is a recap of the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap as of 3:00 p.m. EDT.

What is RSK?\nNon-Technical Explanation of Sidechain\nHow will it improve the price of bitcoin\nConclusion\nWhat is RSK?\nHow this new user-case for Bitcoin is not having a humongous buzz around it is beyond me, the hype is quite low if there is any.\n“The Rootstock platform provides Turing-complete smart contracts as proposed by Nick Szabo in 1993. At the same time, RSK’s VM is backward compatible with Ethereum VM, hence Rootstock gives the opportunity to developers working on Ethereum to benefit from the robustness of the Bitcoin Blockchain. “ — Whitepaper\nRootstock is a sidechain pegged 1–1 to bitcoin, a two-way peg, meaning what is valid on the BTC network is valid on the RSK network and vis-versa. Using Bitcoin as the main chain for security, rootstock won’t be running an ICO or pre-mint coins/pre-mine them, instead as a pegged side chain to bitcoin; every RSK is represented on the Bitcoin main.\nRootstock is turing complete, and this means that smart contracts will run correctly on it, it is projected to reach a tps of 300 transactions per second.\nIt is backward compatible with Ethereum, meaning that Ethereum smart contracts can easily migrate to RSK. With Oraclize service on the RSK network will enable this feature, it is a blockchain agnostic feature that will make different blockchain networks compatible with one another.\nRSK will merge-mine with BTC, as of now, the RSK blockchain secured with 10% of BTC hashrate, which will provide security for the network, RSK mainnet hasn’t launched yet, but the testnet has been running, expected lunch of mainnet if in June.\nNon-Technical Explanation of Sidechain.\nRSK is a sidechain, means it depends on another chain for some features such as security, it has its own on chain consensus and relies on merge mining meaning miners mine both mainchain and sidechain at the same time. The mainchain works as usual and doesn’t need to fork or change, then the RSK runs separately but relies on the transactions on the BTC.\nIn reality, there is no transfer between the chains; the funds are locked in one chain (the mainchain) for it to unlock in the other chain and vis-a-vis. These are automatically done and remains genuinely decentralized.\nHow will this improve the price of Bitcoin?\nRSK as a platform will be the launching board for smart contracts if RSK becomes successfully and lots of projects migrate to it, this will increase the demand for Bitcoin for this reason alone the BTC prices will go up because of the increased usage.\nRSK will increase the profits of Bitcoin miners; miners will make extra income through merge mining with RSK, this will help the profitability of mining bitcoin.\nConclusion\nIf the RSK team can achieve 300 tps as claimed after mainnet lunch and its backward compatibility using the oraclize service is valid, then lots of projects will migrate to RSK from other projects.it will be more secure and scalable than the rest, not even Ethereum is as scalable, and the backward compatibility is a game changer.\nSo we have all these features in a project that will be dependent on transactions on Bitcoin, this will influence the Bitcoin network positive way both in price, use, and importance. Though this will take time to be perfect with time it will grow to be huge; unfortunately, there won’t be ICO sales (no official announcement- but I don’t see the likelihood if it will is paired to BTC and no pre-mining)\nThis project is enormous and will be a major talking point once its out entirely hopefully next month.\nReference\nhttps://blog.oraclize.it/launching-the-oraclize-service-on-rsk-9141265b7e50\nhttps://steemit.com/blockchain/@haji/what-is-rootstock\nhttps://blog.trezor.io/trezor-firmware-updated-to-1-5-0-7a402d3e9f89\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/first-bitcoin-smart-contracts-sidechain-now-secured-1-10-miners/\nhttp://www.the-blockchain.com/docs/Rootstock-WhitePaper-Overview.pdf\nCulled from : https://medium.com/@ekeneobi/what-is-rootstock-rsk-the-bitcoin-sidechain-no-one-is-talking-about-838c4b0a668f\n submitted by /u/Ekene3tconcept\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blog.oraclize.it/launching-the-oraclize-service-on-rsk-9141265b7e50", "http://www.the-blockchain.com/docs/Rootstock-WhitePaper-Overview.pdf", "https://medium.com/@ekeneobi/what-is-rootstock-rsk-the-bitcoin-sidechain-no-one-is-talking-about-838c4b0a668f", "https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-firmware-updated-to-1-5-0-7a402d3e9f89", "https://www.coindesk.com/first-bitcoin-smart-contracts-sidechain-now-secured-1-10-miners/", "https://steemit.com/blockchain/@haji/what-is-rootstock"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:58:05.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "990e2d9cb394a9ae0d64c65defb3d4256a89b684", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqasQfHDev.g34pXFfnbLVid4ArZf.yo_FsQAyKweYCNnIx97WkxW0Yg_iBim2EIPIHL62V4GTSU3gXoaHHH_DdzWvptEGdEu7N", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Chairman Mow is whining like a little bitch.

The protection of client anonymity is the top priority at BestMixer.io and to that end they are the only Bitcoin mixer service offering total security for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash. Watch this fascinating short video about the basic principles of the BestMixer work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYDTKpTkCs\nBitcoin and the ever-expanding cryptocurrency asset class represent a thriving market and revolution in the way value is transacted. Blockchain, the technology which underpins cryptocurrency, is an immutable and trustful ledger of ongoing events, making all transactions public. Because all transactions are attached to the wallets that send and receive bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the anonymity of such transactions is shallow at best, creating a sea of easy targets for cybercriminals and surveillance.\n“BestMixer.io disguises where your coins have come from, making it impossible to study your digital track,” say the BestMixer team in their Wiki. “On a global scale, to maintain the best level of anonymity, you need to mix your coins every time you are going to send or get them from a new source.”\nCoins are deposited into a reserve containing the coins of other depositors and then tumbled, resulting in a break between the sending and receiving addresses and mixed, untraceable coins. Importantly, the Bestmixer.io bitcoin tumbler offers three reserves (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) for mixing, each providing a different source for mixed coins. The Gamma Pool, for instance, is restricted to BestMixer.io’s private reserve and investor coins, meaning coins mixed using this pool feature anonymization plus the guarantee of a reliable source.\nThe ramifications for privacy-oriented cryptocurrency users are undeniable as bad actors using identifying data to target and surveil wallets are effectively shut out. Until now, the majority of bitcoin mixer services fell short of their promises to provide total anonymity to users.\n“The comparative analysis of most mixers in the market today obviously showed that all of them, except for a few, are exactly the same,” said the BestMixer.io team in a recent announcement. “And do they give anonymity to the cryptocurrency that they promise? The answer is negative!”\nAdding to the already long list of features offered by Bestmixer.io bitcoin mixer, several languages are supported including English, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and German. The team has recently improved its support system, modified the Mixing Strength Meter, which is a crucial feature, enhanced the Q&A section and the randomization of miners’ fees, among other functions. New modules and improvements are under way. Tor-friendliness means users concerned with end-to-end privacy will find the Bestmixer.io experience intuitive and seamless.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bestmixer7o57mba.onion/en", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYDTKpTkCs", "https://bestmixer.io/en"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:32:35.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b3774de7c503e3933a95eaa3f07fc65add78b25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IYvGIr61AWG5V7XPBT_olX6ODX8IkSQFcQAAKufGKIcxfdi3yaXGzxciB0FeCVEJX2YJsir4dE_MhU8LgE.Nx_cmYFfSAD2BLsaWhGF5oDKzGtfflq6pE_R2Zdumv17o8-", "site_full": "en.avisus.net", "site": "avisus.net", "site_section": "http://en.avisus.net/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Ads avisus.net", "title": "a bitmain power supply antminer bitcoin apw3 12v 1600 b3", "title_full": "a bitmain power supply antminer bitcoin apw3 12v 1600 b3", "published": "2018-05-22T23:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://en.avisus.net/images/9b/66/-bitmain-power-supply-antminer-bitcoin-apw3-12v-1600-b3-3948497.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b3774de7c503e3933a95eaa3f07fc65add78b25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IYvGIr61AWG5V7XPBT_olX6ODX8IkSQFcQAAKufGKIcxfdi3yaXGzxciB0FeCVEJX2YJsir4dE_MhU8LgE.Nx_cmYFfSAD2BLsaWhGF5oDKzGtfflq6pE_R2Zdumv17o8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T23:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "a bitmain power supply antminer bitcoin apw3 12v 1600 b3", "text": " Bitmain Power Supply Antminer Bitcoin APW3++ 12V-1600 B3 Item Condition: New other (see details) New open box New open box ...Never hooked up...

The bearish trend has been receiving support from influential icons. The debate over the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is also contributing to the sell-off.\nBitcoin price trades around the $8,300 level today. Altcoins are in the red after a short rally at the beginning of the week. The total cryptocurrency market hovers in the range of $380 billion, down from $465 billion it hit a few days ago.\nJoe Davis, the chief economist for $5.1 trillion asset management firm Vanguard, thinks cryptocurrencies aren’t the alternative of fiat currency. His stance is similar to PayPal CFO and Warren Buffet – who already has rejected the possibility of using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange. Why Does Joe Davis Predict that Bitcoin will Crash to Zero?\nThe economist of the $5.1 trillion asset management firm warned investors that Bitcoin price is likely to crash to zero. He suggested investors keep their focus towards “ tried and true asset classes”. He believes that allocating even a small portion of the investment portfolio to cryptocurrencies could turn out to be a big mistake.\nHe said , “ The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them . “\nThe economist further argued that cryptocurrencies could be used as a medium of exchange, but they don’t have a store of value. Market Reaction was Strong Against Joe Davis’ Argument\nAlthough the majority of market participants believe the higher level of volatility in cryptocurrency prices makes it harder for the global community to use it as a medium of exchange, they think the market needs some time and more regulation clarity for complete stabilization.\nTwitter users reacted strongly against Joe Davis arguments. Cryptocurrency followers are comparing Bitcoin and other virtual currencies with the early age of internet and the Dow Jones.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/theres-a-decent-probability-bitcoin-goes-to-zero-says-vanguard-economist-2018-05-21", "https://cryptocurrencynews.com/daily-news/bitcoin-news/paypal-cfo-john-rainey/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siraj sarwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard economist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T23:43:33.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67e16dc7d9517a280ebd6314f76ec8967b1457ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.suyDmR9QVfk_Hp9WWW6VNRZOXms2KuoptrJARO7tnqtc_s8owb5FXbuedFNpKu2Cbw--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "We asked an A.I. bot to explain Bitcoin to us, and then animated it.", "title_full": "We asked an A.I. bot to explain Bitcoin to us, and then animated it.", "published": "2018-05-22T23:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67e16dc7d9517a280ebd6314f76ec8967b1457ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.suyDmR9QVfk_Hp9WWW6VNRZOXms2KuoptrJARO7tnqtc_s8owb5FXbuedFNpKu2Cbw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T23:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "We asked an A.I. bot to explain Bitcoin to us, and then animated it.", "text": "We asked an A.I. bot to explain Bitcoin to us, and then animated it.\n/u/ZBornstein\nsubmitted by /u/ZBornstein\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bornstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T23:23:24.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6835521a4f05cd9ca6fa48a0e3ca2c769c1b1ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaeX6BGtvROItZ2MHjHbwsy2nTCfWLnQss1A0OapJd9LxM2dfPj1p8ymYhuLpZqbLXqAGACYl0Ic.yfmVn5FCneYwbQJ.xYRQs", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "At least the Pizza guy got something for his 10k bitcoins.

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand – especially for high-end machines – was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. “Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Mr Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n“Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nRelated Posts Cambodia is at the early stages of mineral resource development and has an opportunity to lay the foundations for responsible mining.

But that doesn’t mean mining has slowed down. Rather, the opposite has been happening, giving environmentalists (and anyone but the most adamant cryptobros) cause for concern.\nBetween cooling fans, manufacturing hardware, and the outrageous, ever-rising energy costs needed to operate a bitcoin mining rig, the world’s Bitcoin network is expected to use as much as 7.67 gigawatts of power by the end of 2018, according to new research and models. That’s one two-hundredth of all the electricity used on the planet. And that’s terrible.\nLet’s put that another way. According to that research, which is admittedly based on some imperfect assumptions and averages, the Bitcoin network currently uses about as much power as the entire country of Ireland (which uses 3.1 gigawatts) and is expected to grow to the same energy consumption level as Austria, which is currently at 8.2 gigawatts.\nThe world’s population is right around 7.6 billion people. If everyone used the same amount of energy (which they don’t but bear with me) that would put Bitcoin’s energy consumption — and toll on the environment — at the same level as that of 38 million people.\nNow, this certainly doesn’t mean that bitcoin should be cancelled. And while it seems like nothing can convince crypto fans that bitcoin is anything but the way of the future, these findings show just how much of an impact the cryptocurrency is having on the world. And not a “we’re gonna take back the financial markets and build a better tomorrow!” kind of impact. More of a tangible “oopsy-daisy, we’re accidentally scorching the planet” kind.\nIf cryptocurrencies are truly going to become the money of tomorrow, then we’ll absolutely need to grapple with the environmental damage caused by this major energy suck (assuming the price of Bitcoin continues to climb). Or, figure out how to mine more efficiently.

The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on May 20 signaled a short-term bullish reversal that could have seen bitcoin rise to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method).\nHowever, the bulls ran out of steam at a high of $8,644 yesterday and prices had fallen back to $8,240 at time of writing – a drop of 2.8 percent over the last 24 hours, according to Bitfinex. The decline did not come as a surprise, though, given the breakout lacked volume support, and a drop to $8,000 could now be on the cards.\nAs seen in the chart above, BTC fell back below the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline yesterday, weakening the bulls and has established a lower-high and lower-low pattern (bearish setup). While a failed breakout usually indicates a bigger-picture bearish reversal, in this case it means the corrective rally from the low of $7,925 has ended and the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 has resumed.\nThus, prices could drop below the immediate support of $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) seen in the daily chart below. A break below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would bolster the bearish setup seen in the hourly chart and would allow a drop to $8,000.\nNote, though, that the 5-day and 10-day moving averages are beginning to curl upwards, so if the price moves above $8,408 (daily high), the bulls could make a comeback.

Some are even offering new hires $1 million dollar signing bonuses, according to Dave Schwartz, the chief cryptographer at Ripple, who told The Journal pay packages \"have gotten insane.\"\nJuha Mikkola, co-founder of Wyncode Academy, a coding school, told Business Insider he knows of developers being paid double the going-rate for their blockchain experience.\n\"It's not just tech companies that need this talent, it's real-estate, non-profits, and banks,\" Mikkola said in an interview.\nAdvertisement The number of blockchain or cryptocurrency job postings on LinkedIn increased at least fourfold in 2017 , Bloomberg News noted. Still such talent is in short supply, according to Miha Grcar, the head of business development for Bitstamp, a crypto exchange. He said the talent shortage is a bigger headache than bitcoin's volatility.\n\"Globally, the pool of talent — people with experience in blockchain and distributed-ledger technology — is somewhat limited,\" Grcar said. \"This is a big challenge.\"\nRead The Wall Street Journal report, here>>\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

A screenshot from the ad.\nMin, A former SEC attorney, who was also an aide for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, ran the ad which – among others – targeted Forde, an Obama-era White House cryptocurrency guru and former head of MIT’s cryptocurrency initiative.\nForde may very well be the first — or at least one of the earliest — American politicians to come out of the crypto-closet and openly accept donations in the form of cryptocurrency. Which makes Min one of the fist politicians to run anti-Bitcoin ads against an opponent.\nWe contacted Forde, who told us:\nWe’ve raised more than $130,000 at crypto.forde.com in response to his sensationalist and wildly inaccurate attacks on me, my supporters, and a technology he clearly does not understand. We’ll use this support to promote our positive message to elect a representative who believes in science, technology, and evidence-based policymaking.\nAs far as we can tell, there’s absolutely no truth to the allegation that one of Forde’s donors said anything remotely close to the language in the attack ad. A report from Axios indicates that Min’s campaign manager feels the language is warranted because Forde accepted donations from a board member of The Bitcoin Foundation, Brock Pierce:\nPierce, while extremely controversial, has never publicly said he opposes “cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking” — but Min’s campaign apparently believes the statement is fair because Bitcoin Foundation opposes certain regulations that could, in theory, make such things more difficult.\nForde responded to the attack in a Facebook post , saying he’d “rather fight for our progressive values than with fellow Democrats, and stay united in our goal of defeating Rep. Mimi Walters and her wholescale endorsement of the dangerous and irrational Trump agenda.”\nWe also reached out to Min, but didn’t immediately receive a response.\nNo matter what your politics are, the tired rhetoric that only criminals use Bitcoin has become borderline bigotry. Criminals use Bitcoin, but not quite as much as they use cash — according to experts . Criminals also use hammers, cars, and AR-15s, but those items don’t seem to be associated with them in the same way cryptocurrency is.\nIt stands to reason, for Min, that being branded a Luddite in a California Congressional district might hurt his campaign’s chances of success.\nAs for Forde, the attack ad may have actually helped his campaign. Cryptocurrency blogger Kiki Shirr, of dyorffs.org , yesterday attended an event celebrating his recent fundraising success.\nShe told TNW :\nThe overall feeling of the night was that none of the honest business innovators in the room wanted to see a Congressperson take office who thought they were no more than human traffickers and drug dealers–and bitcoin and ether donations poured into the Forde wallet as a result.

A new study by economist Alex de Vries estimates that bitcoin mining consumes at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity and, by the end of the year, that will have risen to 7.67 gigawatts - as much as Austria consumes in the same period. Mining the cryptocurrency involves computers solving complex mathematical problems. As the amount of bitcoin left to mine grows smaller and smaller, the problems become increasingly complex, meaning they require an even greater amount of computing power. 'Half a million PlayStations' Due to the secretive nature of mining, the research is based on speculative figures. The cryptocurrency's network is estimated to have around 10,000 connected nodes, but a single node in the network can represent either one or many machines. \"A hashrate of 14 terahashes per second can either come from a single Antminer S9 running on just 1,372 watts, or more than half a million PlayStation 3 devices running on 40 megawatts,\" the research says. The study is the first time that estimates of bitcoin's energy consumption have been peer reviewed and it has sparked calls to address the environmental impact of mining the digital asset. De Vries also runs the Digiconomist blog, which hosts the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. Some experts have queried the study's findings, claiming it is the latest example of overblown concerns about the strain that computers put on the electricity network. \"The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,\" Stanford researcher Jonathan Koomey said. \"There may be some basis for them, but it's a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that.

Several things, studying the bitcoin chart history mainly - but it is also based on - Astrology, Numerology, Trigonometry, Geology, Archaeology, Scientology, an Apology I once received when someone bumped into me at the supermarket - as well as a dream I had. Yeah have a laugh, insult me if you must - but remember you heard it here first.\nNow that's for bitcoin - what does that mean for XRP - I'd say probably a dramatic move preceding the bitcoin move (I bet we move first). I would not be comfortable being on the sidelines right now. I suspect the move will take place in the next two weeks - again based on all the above.

The cryptoverse is celebrating the eighth annual Bitcoin Pizza Day. Back in 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two Papa John’s pizzas in a Bitcoin forum. Back then, it was the equivalent of US$25, but now that amount is worth around US$80mln.\nCrypto-enthusiasts only poke fun at Hanyecz every May 22, while Twitter account @bitcoin_pizza tweets the price of the infamous pizza every day. The #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day! — Bitcoin Pizza ???? (@bitcoin_pizza) May 22, 2018\nOperation Crypto Sweep, a string of investigations by US and Canadian authorities into cryptocurrency scams, is in full swing. Regulators are looking into fraudulent initial coin offerings and sham crypto companies. Since its commencement on May 1, the operation has led to around 70 open investigations.\n“Not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution,” said Joseph P. Borg, President of the North American Securities Administrators Association in a statement.

With the help of the Mexican government, Laredo Sector Border Patrol Foreign Operations Branch agents confiscated 423 packages of marijuana weighing in at around 10,000 lbs, or 5 tons.\n“The seizure clearly demonstrates the exceptional level of binational cooperation that the Border Patrol has with the Government of Mexico,” said Jason D. Owens, Laredo Sector Chief Patrol Agent.\nFuture Farm Technologies Inc (OTCQX:FFRMF) has hired two strategic consultants to help navigate Florida’s application process for cannabis cultivation licensing. The Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use processes around 2,000 applications per week and the Vancouver-based company will soon add its own to the pile. Analysts predict that Florida’s high number of retirees will make it a shoe-in for one of the largest cannabis markets in the country after California. Shares of the Canadian cannabis company were down more than 8% to US$0.44.

With bitcoin you own the private key, with a separate bitcoin address. No one manages and controls accounts outside of you.\nAnd you?\nObviously there many benefit using bitcoin as investment than to invest fiat money, i agree using new technology bitcoin is easy to use and control anywhere have an internet access.\nFoe me i really need bitcoin because nothing doubt in my side bitcoin in the whole crypto currency (altcoins) are giving to an extra income aside from my regular job, adopting bitcoin as investment or working in bitcoin in the right are very helpful those people ned to earn extra to support their family needs.\nMost popular answer on this forum is extra income. Why people love cryptocurrencies, its cause of the extra income. Its extra income for people who knows about it, for people outside blockchain most interesting is the price and chance for earning. People became walking atm machines, nothing is important as money is.\nI think we need bitcoin and blockchain cause we can trust more in technology then in people, cause people will scam you sooner or later, technology is doing how she is programmed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:33:27.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c38cebf1dcabe5638b1af1b8aa71dea35487767e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaVCPxuJt_1DkYIMokpZ3pQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Depending your future in bitcoin...", "title_full": "Depending your future in bitcoin...", "published": "2018-05-22T22:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c38cebf1dcabe5638b1af1b8aa71dea35487767e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaVCPxuJt_1DkYIMokpZ3pQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "izzy13", "published": "2018-05-22T22:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Depending your future in bitcoin...", "text": "Quote: from: IvyAguas on March 12, 2018, 02:55:15 PM I think bitcoin is really a good investment for now, but I don't think it is a good idea to put all your investment in bitcoin or crypto currencies since it is unpredictable and very risky to take.

For nowadays, we can't put all our investments in neither bitcoins or altcoins.

May 22, 2018 1 Views Bitcoin Pizza Day is celebrated annually by the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community – marking an important, yet comical milestone for the virtual currency. 8 years ago, a user paid for two pizzas using Bitcoin, in what is hailed as the first ever instance that the cryptocurrency was used to pay for goods. The moment is immortalized online in a Bitcointalk.org forum , where a programmer called Laszlo Hanyecz confirmed that he’d bought two pizza for 10,000 BTC from Papa John’s Pizza in America. Hanyecz had initially solicited users in the forum to deliver two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, with a number of users offering to buy the pizzas online for him. Eventually a teenager named Jeremy Sturdivant , nicknamed Jercos, accepted the Bitcoin and sent Hanyecz two pizzas from Papa John’s. On 22 May 2010, Hanyecz announced that he’d accomplished his outlandish goal. At the time, as pointed out by another user in the thread, 1 Bitcoin was worth around 0.0041 meaning Hanyecz’ 10,000 BTC were worth a lowly $41. Today, the original value of a single Bitcoin pizza, $20.5, would cost you 0.0025 BTC, a staggering display of how much the value of the cryptocurrency has grown in the space of 8 years. Can I buy pizza with Bitcoin today? Services like PizzaForCoins , which was founded in 2013 , accept various cryptocurrencies as payment, and then place orders on behalf of customers online. Egifter also offer customers an gift card that can be bought with Bitcoin – allowing users to then order pizza online through Domino’s Pizza and Papa John’s . Clearly, the legacy left by Hanyecz’s original purchase has had a long lasting effect. Restaurants around America also accept Bitcoin as a payment method. A website called Bitcoinrestaurants has a database of 83 locations where you can settle your bill using Bitcoin. There are also reports that Subway branches in Buenos Aires, Argentina also accept Bitcoin. Yes, it’s a big deal On the surface, Bitcoin Pizza Day seems like a fun, quirky day for the crypto community to celebrate. However, the impact of that fateful transaction has shaped the cryptocurrency world forever. Even Ledger, a well known producer of cryptocurrency hardware wallets, launched a commemorative range of its Limited Edition Ledger Nano S . Hanyecz gave the company his blessing, while touting the importance of good storage practices for Bitcoin users: “Bitcoin was just a fun hobby project for me 8 years ago. When I paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas I had no idea that Bitcoin would eventually become as popular as it is today, with people using it for real world transactions every day.” Once again, Hanyecz’s pizza purchase is hailed as the first ever Bitcoin transaction for real-world goods, paving the way for the use of the cryptocurrency by users around the world. Today, there are an average of 198,878 Bitcoin transactions per day. Lightning pizza Hanyecz is still actively involved in the cryptocurrency community and made headlines in February 2018, reliving his original Bitcoin transaction by buying two pizzas using the Lightning Network . The programmer explained how he opened up payment channel with a friend in London, who then subcontracted the delivery – by paying for it himself – to a local shop. As Hanyecz describes, his latest foray explores a new technology that hopes to reduce transactions times and costs on the Bitcoin network: “So is there any point to doing this instead of an on chain transaction? For what I described here, probably not. The goal was just to play around with c-lightning and do something more than shuffling a few satoshi back and forth. Maybe eventually pizza shops will have their own lightning nodes and I can open channels to them directly.” Hanyecz statement is reminiscent of his 2010 experiment – where he was simply wanted to “say that I paid for a pizza in Bitcoins”. That original curiosity paved the way for Bitcoin becoming a revolutionary way for people to transact in a trustless, decentralized way. Only time will tell if the 2018 Lightning Pizza transaction will become a watershed moment for the second layer payment protocol.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-21427505", "https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/j5e4pg/remembering-that-time-a-dude-unknowingly-spent-dollar20-million-on-two-pizzas", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/001044.html", "http://bitcoinrestaurants.net/", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195", "https://www.egifter.com/bitcoin/papa-johns-gift-card-bitcoin", "https://blockchain.info/charts", "https://pizzaforcoins.com/#", "http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-8-surprising-places-where-you-can-use-2017-10?IR=T#zynga-7", "https://www.ledger.fr/2018/05/22/bitcoin-pizza-day-ledger-nano-s-limited-edition/", "https://www.egifter.com/bitcoin/dominos-pizza-gift-card-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy sturdivant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jercos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papa john’s pizza", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:58:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc65c4b5cd85e15acaed1efdbb85b12c5ed25de8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cVsry0F0PBOo_IAfIocV2w0TXE3YLzGvDjl7DeWev1DQOWB3vbGWR5w_qXDY1feun9oqpsysHMNtdlF63FVUakzYpizY7jR_KnJp6QuBU7h7OnwriEGabmFeLxA58aC4-", "site_full": "www.briefreport.co.uk", "site": "briefreport.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.newsrt.co.uk/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BriefReport.co.uk", "title": "South Africa kidnappers make ransom demand in bitcoin", "title_full": "South Africa kidnappers make ransom demand in bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-22T22:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i.briefreport.co.uk/upload/news/large/18/21/Hka_5184.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc65c4b5cd85e15acaed1efdbb85b12c5ed25de8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cVsry0F0PBOo_IAfIocV2w0TXE3YLzGvDjl7DeWev1DQOWB3vbGWR5w_qXDY1feun9oqpsysHMNtdlF63FVUakzYpizY7jR_KnJp6QuBU7h7OnwriEGabmFeLxA58aC4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T22:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa kidnappers make ransom demand in bitcoin", "text": "South Africa kidnappers make ransom demand in bitcoin\nA gang that kidnapped a South African teenager from a playground at the weekend have demanded a ransom in bitcoin worth about $123,000, police have said.

Law enforcement agencies often see them as a criminal tool used to buy drugs, guns or other illegal items; financial regulatory bodies can’t decide whether to classify them a security; and a handful of states have proposed legislation that would allow their constituents to pay their taxes with them.\nBut this regulatory uncertainty hasn’t stopped Brian Forde, a California Democrat running for the US House of Representatives, from accepting campaign donations in Bitcoin in the lead up to the 2018 elections. Forde’s embrace of Bitcoin makes sense: He was a senior advisor to the Obama administration on cryptocurrencies and other digital technologies, and headed up MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.\nIn 2014, the Federal Election Commission ruled it was okay for political action committees to accept donations in Bitcoin. Nevertheless, Dave Min, another Democrat vying for the same congressional seat, picked up on Forde’s crypto affiliations and used them as the basis for an attack ad.\nIt is likely the first political ad in the US to mention Bitcoin. In a copy of the ad provided to Motherboard by the Forde campaign, Forde’s face is superimposed over some footage of a stereotypical hacker typing on screens of streaming green code.\nA woman’s voice cites “Brian Forde’s big donors” as “Bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.” Min, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine, did not respond to my request for comment. Forde, who has raised over $100,000 in campaign donations in Bitcoin, called the ad “reckless.” “These comments about my supporters are sensationalist, wildly inaccurate, and in line with my opponent’s lack of understanding of the technology,” Forde told me in an email.

There are typical cases of the hacking of the Bitcoin exchanges wherein people lose a considerable amount of their hard-earned money. This might be the case while using the “soft” wallets for storing the cryptocurrencies. However, when you make use of a hardware wallet for storing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there is no such issue or fear of potential hacking. Thus, your money remains completely secure and under your control. Hardware Wallet: How is It Different from Other Wallets?\nA hardware wallet is represented by a small physical unit that is used for storing the Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies. Unlike the web-based or online wallets, these wallets can be actually held in hand. Thus, you can keep it completely safe with you.\nThe main reason why hardware wallets are considered safer for storing Bitcoins and others is that for accessing the cryptocurrencies in the wallet and for doing specific transactions, you need to install the device on a device (computer system, laptop, or mobile phone). Without establishing a connection of the device with the wallet, no one else would be able to gain access to your physical wallet. Top Bitcoin Hardware Wallets\nWith hardware wallet being an ideal option for storing Bitcoin, here are some of the top Bitcoin hardware wallets.\nLedger Nano S Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : Launched by a French startup, the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet for storing Bitcoin appears like a USB device. This USB device is able to be connected to any USB port. This hardware wallet gets started only when it is connected to any device like mobile phone or laptop. There is no battery in the same. There is no anti-tampering sticker as well. This is because the standard process of cryptographic checking ensures the integrity of the device. Ledger Nano S is FIDO certified and comes with the U2F authentication.\nKeepKey Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : Since its launch in 2015, KeepKey has been considered as one of the best hardware wallets for storing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Unlike other standard hardware wallets, KeepKey features some of the advanced specifications. Thus, it is the top choice of the experienced Bitcoin users. There is minimal designing all over along with a larger screen on the front side. The pin, as well as the passphrase, are completely secure through proper encryption inside the device. If the device is tampered with by anyone, the content inside the same gets destructed on its own.\nTrezor Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : This is also a great choice of the hardware wallet for the Bitcoin users. Manufactured by the Satoshi Labs in the Czech Republic, this wallet is considered to be of the gold standards when it comes to storing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a secure manner. The wallet appears like a keyless entry remote which is highly simple to use with other connecting devices. Even the applications are very easy to use and smooth in comparison to the other hardware wallets.\nLedger HW.1 Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : If you are looking for a budget-friendly wallet, then this could be the one for you. The only drawback with this wallet is that it does not come with any screen. However, it is equally secure and convenient to use just like other types of hardware wallets for storing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nPi Wallet Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : This hardware wallet serves as a small computer system that comes equipped with the Armory Bitcoin client. All the transactions by using this wallet are signed in an offline mode and are then transferred to the desired USB device. Then, these can be transmitted online for the purpose of broadcasting or for some transactions.\nBWALLET Trezor Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : This hardware wallet for Bitcoin is a clone of the standard Trezor wallet. Manufactured by a Chinese company, this is an open-source Bitcoin hardware wallet. This device functions just like the Trezor hardware wallet. However, it does not work with the official website of Trezor and also does not function with the official firmware of Trezor.\nOpendime Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : Simply referred to as the “Bitcoin Stick”, this is the first ever Bearer Bond with respect to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Opendime appears like a miniature USB stick. This allows the users to spend Bitcoin like physical cash. Even the setting up this USB device is highly simple and quick. This open source hardware wallet offers the multi-language user interface to the Bitcoin users.\nCoolWallet Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : This is a Bluetooth device which appears like a credit card. This device is used for storing the private keys as well as bitcoins in a secure manner. The best feature of this wallet is that it can be kept in your physical wallet easily and you can work with the same in a seamless manner.\nBitLox Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : This is a strong Bitcoin hardware wallet that comes enclosed in a special metal (titanium or aluminum) case. This wallet works through its own web-based online wallet that can be accessed through the USB device and the apps for Android & iOS through the Bluetooth LE. This is the only Bitcoin hardware wallet that is available for iPhone. You can set up hidden wallets with the help of this hardware wallet.\nBlochsTech Bitcoin Hardware Wallet : This is an open source hardware wallet for Bitcoin that appears as a Bitcoin card. You can use this wallet for shopping as it is faster to be accepted than the usual wallets based on QR Code. This wallet is assumed to be replacing the Visa system across the world in the coming future.\nIf you are looking for some high-end, convenient hardware wallet for Bitcoin, then make the wise selection from the best ones as listed above. A hardware wallet for storing Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies serve to be a highly secure system in the long run. Ensure the safety of your money and financial transactions through these Bitcoin walle Summary", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jasmine steve leave a", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:07:04.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0be7e03cbc2bf879f190b69fc67f19c360e9088e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4WrVcnnQA4rPU43VUr.1EFLmfIdbNNBw89hFLKvAKgHflh6bkAf3F5873iTtnTPcT_9MbPHZw0Y2DR4H__vh9RMfpc2naAH.F9bF5W95d_FGuiajZfBw8mUfIkysVdEcLJh67Uv9UcgNIRT65rLS67fWzZbwjmnWy5M_J9Uafi92SLIwvMXsGsvXpLEQehHf9ZXhTMrndsTx6BxTqHhrysIQ--", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "http://www.businessinsider.com", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Feedburner", "title": "Bitcoin may be down 40% this year but crypto developers are still fetching $1 million bonuses", "title_full": "Bitcoin may be down 40% this year but crypto developers are still fetching $1 million bonuses", "published": "2018-05-22T21:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0be7e03cbc2bf879f190b69fc67f19c360e9088e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4WrVcnnQA4rPU43VUr.1EFLmfIdbNNBw89hFLKvAKgHflh6bkAf3F5873iTtnTPcT_9MbPHZw0Y2DR4H__vh9RMfpc2naAH.F9bF5W95d_FGuiajZfBw8mUfIkysVdEcLJh67Uv9UcgNIRT65rLS67fWzZbwjmnWy5M_J9Uafi92SLIwvMXsGsvXpLEQehHf9ZXhTMrndsTx6BxTqHhrysIQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Frank Chaparro (feedback@businessinsider.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T21:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin may be down 40% this year but crypto developers are still fetching $1 million bonuses", "text": "@floydmayweather\nBitcoin may be down 40% year-to-date, but crypto developers are making out like bandits.

Some are even offering new hires $US1 million dollar signing bonuses, according to Dave Schwartz, the chief cryptographer at Ripple, who told The Journal pay packages “have gotten insane.”\nJuha Mikkola, co-founder of Wyncode Academy, a coding school, told Business Insider he knows of developers being paid double the going-rate for their blockchain experience.\n“It’s not just tech companies that need this talent, it’s real-estate, non-profits, and banks,” Mikkola said in an interview.\nThe number of blockchain or cryptocurrency job postings on LinkedIn increased at least fourfold in 2017 , Bloomberg News noted. Still such talent is in short supply, according to Miha Grcar, the head of business development for Bitstamp, a crypto exchange. He said the talent shortage is a bigger headache than bitcoin’s volatility.\n“Globally, the pool of talent – people with experience in blockchain and distributed-ledger technology – is somewhat limited,” Grcar said. “This is a big challenge.”\nRead The Wall Street Journal report, here>> NOW WATCH: Money & Markets videos Want to read a more in-depth view on the trends influencing Australian business and the global economy?

Some are even offering new hires $1 million dollar signing bonuses, according to Dave Schwartz, the chief cryptographer at Ripple, who told The Journal pay packages “have gotten insane.”\nJuha Mikkola, co-founder of Wyncode Academy, a coding school, told Business Insider he knows of developers being paid double the going-rate for their blockchain experience.\n“It’s not just tech companies that need this talent, it’s real-estate, non-profits, and banks,” Mikkola said in an interview.\nThe number of blockchain or cryptocurrency job postings on LinkedIn increased at least fourfold in 2017 , Bloomberg News noted. Still such talent is in short supply, according to Miha Grcar, the head of business development for Bitstamp, a crypto exchange. He said the talent shortage is a bigger headache than bitcoin’s volatility.\n“Globally, the pool of talent — people with experience in blockchain and distributed-ledger technology — is somewhat limited,” Grcar said. “This is a big challenge.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bna.com/blockchain-job-market-n73014474195/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave schwartz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juha mikkola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mikkola", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyncode academy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:21:28.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3bfa9b2ff952601dfc602b9e191e9ab5fbf560df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqq3i02RQzTBn3dOYsMG6Aclta9ufoWavbcfjt0xaQh0CUxRkqaOY9r.dg_dDnH7k7pBbYr87lz3haala_aficlnxhFYmHWjLXTkBuydr1cbNXWmZf6zMwrxMi5PkPORiR_VMmWSL7Xi7xMTjNQ5XTxxIKDIQh5U.JcrN4dWYxDI7pX1VDy8h3u", "site_full": "technewstube.com", "site": "technewstube.com", "site_section": "http://technewstube.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tech News Tube RSS Feed", "title": "Bitcoin may be down 40% this year but crypto developers are still fetching $1 million bonuses", "title_full": "Bitcoin may be down 40% this year but crypto developers are still fetching $1 million bonuses", "published": "2018-05-22T21:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5240837d6bb3f7d9408b4575-800/floyd-mayweather-truck-money.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3bfa9b2ff952601dfc602b9e191e9ab5fbf560df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqq3i02RQzTBn3dOYsMG6Aclta9ufoWavbcfjt0xaQh0CUxRkqaOY9r.dg_dDnH7k7pBbYr87lz3haala_aficlnxhFYmHWjLXTkBuydr1cbNXWmZf6zMwrxMi5PkPORiR_VMmWSL7Xi7xMTjNQ5XTxxIKDIQh5U.JcrN4dWYxDI7pX1VDy8h3u", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Frank Chaparro", "published": "2018-05-22T21:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin may be down 40% this year but crypto developers are still fetching $1 million bonuses", "text": "Bitcoin may be down 40% this year but crypto developers are still fetching $1 million bonuses By Frank Chaparro May 22, 2018, 2:57 pm 14 pts Bitcoin may be down 40% year-to-date, but crypto developers are making out like bandits.
