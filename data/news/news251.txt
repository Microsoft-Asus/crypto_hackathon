But estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge. In the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin's energy requirements, a Commentary appearing May 16 in the journal Joule , financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin's electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there.\n\"We've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" says de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist (@DigiEconomist), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nHis estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts--as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world's total consumption. \"To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world's electricity. \"That would be quite bad.\"\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins--a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. But all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power. \"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries says.\nIt's figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined. And that information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nOther researchers have used the fundamentals of this method before, but de Vries goes farther. He uses production information about Bitmain, the biggest manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines, to estimate both how much of a miner's costs are associated with hardware rather than electricity and when this equilibrium might be reached. And while he does have confidence in his estimates, the problem with this method is that these manufacturers are extremely secretive. \"Sometimes the best information we've got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That's the stuff we have to work with,\" he says.\nStill, he believes that getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them. Some states in the U.S. have already started to put restrictions around Bitcoin mining. \"But you need to base your policy on something. And I think that my method is important in that regard, because it's very forward-looking. It's focused not on the now, but on where we're headed. And I think that's something you really need to know if you're going to draft policy about it,\" he says.\nHe also points out that there is plenty of room for discussion of his method. \"I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That's actually quite debatable. We don't really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started. I'm doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it.\" ###\nJoule , de Vries: \"Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem\" http://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6\nJoule ( @Joule_CP ) published monthly by Cell Press, is a new home for outstanding and insightful research, analysis, and ideas addressing the need for more sustainable energy.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrechts service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and dont exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-bitcoin/german-online-bank-uses-bitcoins-to-transfer-loans-idUSKBN1ID07Y\nOne area bitcoin hasn't enjoyed much utilization is in loan markets.

Looks like this small german bank has stepped in to fill the vacuum and it appears to be enjoying success.\nHopefully this will be an indication of future progress with crypto based loans and we'll see other start ups embrace this trend by offering greater support for this. It is possible their loan process carries a lot of scrutiny and it may be doubtful that crypto based loans will ever rival fiat loans in terms of convenience, rapid deployment or ease of use.

From Bitcoin to Ether and lots of others, where are cryptos headed and what do they mean for market participants and global economics? This is part two of our conversation with Don Wilson, founder of DRW .\nWilson told a Chicago event in February that cryptocurrencies would “change the world.” But go back a few years and Wilson told us his firm had an internal debate about why Bitcoin was important. One side suggested the underlying technology was what mattered, while another stated that moving value in a frictionless manner was what is important.\nExplaining the latter point of view, he told us in late 2017, “It’s really the network effect that creates the value. And since Bitcoin is the first mover in that space, the first instrument to leverage that technology, then Bitcoin is the important thing.”\nIt’s insight into the thinking that led to Cumberland , a unit of DRW focused exclusively on cryptocurrency that launched in 2014.

Bloomberg News reported earlier Tuesday that Canaan had filed for an IPO that could raise about $1 billion. The filing didn’t say how much Canaan will seek.\nCanaan aims to start trading as soon as July, a person with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The company, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, had revenue of 1.3 billion yuan ($205 million) last year. Net income surged more than sixfold to 361 million yuan, according to Tuesday’s filing.\nA listing of Canaan would be the first Hong Kong IPO from the cryptocurrency industry. The company has about 15% of the global market for bitcoin mining chips and computer equipment, trailing Chinese rival Bitmain, according to a February report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\nCanaan, founded in 2013, sells computer equipment under the “Avalon” brand with fast, customised chips that win digital coins by solving complex math problems. The company’s hardware often ends up in remote locales housing large mining pools that depend on cheap electricity, Co-Chairman Jianping Kong said in an April interview.\nThe company also announced last year it was developing dedicated chips for use in artificial intelligence applications.\nNo final decisions have been made, and details of the offering could change, the people said. Kong declined to comment on details of the IPO plans.\nCanaan was preparing last year to list on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market known as the New Third Board, before opting to pursue a Hong Kong IPO.\nIn 2016, electrical equipment manufacturer Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric Plc sought to acquire Canaan, according to filings at the time. “Great uncertainties” surrounding China’s securities environment and regulatory policies torpedoed the deal, Shandong Luyitong said in a statement at the time.\nThe ASIC-based blockchain hardware market in China grew to 7.3 billion yuan last year from 50 million yuan in 2013, Canaan said in the filing, and consultant Frost & Sullivan forecasts that it will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020.\n© 2018 Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ipo canaan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "deutsche bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit suisse group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmb international capital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T09:36:57.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6170938a5a333aa27153d9b16046a6189900cb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZxfa6BMekXHsLlm6Fg1bC0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will bitcoin cliche $36,000 price by the end of next year?", "title_full": "Will bitcoin cliche $36,000 price by the end of next year?", "published": "2018-05-16T06:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c6170938a5a333aa27153d9b16046a6189900cb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZxfa6BMekXHsLlm6Fg1bC0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "West0813", "published": "2018-05-16T06:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin cliche $36,000 price by the end of next year?", "text": "I think bitcoin will not reach $36,000 this year.

After reading many, many different articles all over the internet, I still didn’t have a good idea of what bitcoins were, how they could be made, and if it was possible for the average person to use them. The first few things I read, they were made out to sound like you had to have a computer science degree to get them. However, after reading on about them, I learned that they are a type of currency that is 100% virtual. There is no government that regulates the currency, like almost every other single currency in the world. Instead, it is all virtual. The bitcoins that you own are stored on your computer. You can sell these bitcoins for real US or Canadian dollars. Below is a YouTube video explaining the whole concept of bitcoins. While good for visual learners, some like to read to learn. Bitcoins are a virtual currency. The currency is stored locally between peers. The currency (bitcoins) is transferred from computer to computer. Every transaction (transfer of bitcoins from one computer to another) is verified by “mining” for bitcoins. When first learning about bitcoins, you learn that bitcoins are stored directly on your computer. So, does that mean that by doing a bit of computer hacking you can give yourself thousands of dollars’ worth of bitcoins? The answer to this is NO! The system is worked out so well that hackers cannot do this.\nThe reason is because for bitcoins to be transferred from computer to computer, the transaction has to be verified. This verification is done by “mining.” Mining is a process where everyday people like you and I install some software onto their computer. This software is very advanced and hard to understand, but basically it does some high-level computing (SHA256 decoding) to verify transfers of bitcoins. The next question that often comes up is: Why would anyone want to just give up their computer to help decode these encryption things? Well, the answer is that you get paid to do it. Well, you don’t get paid, but you get free bitcoins for letting your computer work for you. This is almost the same as being paid, as you will learn in later steps. This is the ONLY way that new bitcoins are created. They can’t just come from nowhere, making the system hacker-proof. Mining can be very simple, but it can also be very complicated. By following this Instructable, you will learn one of the easiest ways to mine bitcoins and gain money. For more information, check out the Wikipedia Article, at http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/bitcoin as well as the Official Bitcoin Website, at http://www.bitcoin.org/. Step 2: Setting Up a Wallet. This step walks you through the process of installing the “Wallet” software. This software functions as a real wallet: it stores all of your currency, which in this case are bitcoins.\nThe first part of this step is to download the software. Go to the Official Bitcoin Website at http://www.bitcoin.org/. In a box at the top of the page, click the software version that applies to your given OS. The steps are the same for both Mac and Windows users, other than installing different software. Open the file and follow onscreen instructions. When it is done, open up the software from the Start Menu. It will take a few hours to download all blocks to your computer. You must just sit and wait during this time (see pictures). When it is done downloading the blocks (don’t worry about what this means; it’s not important), go over to the “Receive coins” tab up at the top. Right-click on the one existing list item, and click “Edit”. Give it the label “Main” and hit OK. Right-click on it again and click “Copy Address”. This is the unique address that your wallet was given. It is where you receive coins in later steps. The next step tests out your bitcoin wallet and shows you what a transaction looks like. Step 3: Test Your New Bitcoin Wallet.This step is for testing purposes only. Go to Daily Bitcoins at www.dailybitcoins.org. Near the middle of the page, paste your bitcoin address that you copied earlier. Uncheck the “Delay payment to minimize transaction fees” check box. It is to trick people. Enter the captcha (they are very simple ones on this website), and click Send. It will tell you that it was successful. If it didn’t, re-enter the captcha properly. Wait ten minutes and then open up the Bitcoin Wallet software again.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/bitcoin-beginners-guide-how-to-choose-the-best-bitcoin-exchange-part-1/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn\n a Video Press Release to MyPR.\n–", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bitcoin.org/.", "http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn", "http://mypr.co.za/learning-about-bitcoin-part-1/", "http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/bitcoin", "https://mypr.co.za/bitcoin-beginners-guide-how-to-choose-the-best-bitcoin-exchange-part-1/", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martedì giugno step", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T17:49:31.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ab179423720fb1f994260ae600bc533c5c60669", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXjvX6YlIHXgaPhFuzwbDzk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "What happens to bitcoin? up or down?", "title_full": "What happens to bitcoin? up or down?", "published": "2018-05-16T06:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ab179423720fb1f994260ae600bc533c5c60669", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXjvX6YlIHXgaPhFuzwbDzk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "exstasie", "published": "2018-05-16T06:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "What happens to bitcoin? up or down?", "text": "Quote: from: exstasie on May 14, 2018, 10:25:06 PM Very nice head fake!

Click on image below to check it out!\nAlso, they sent me a short write up, which I'm including part of here:\n\" Why is the Blockchain so disruptive?*\n\"It is a totally different way to deal with data. Instead of shoring up your servers or maintaining endless server farms, you ship the information out across the network. People who want to use the network have to download the software.\nBy doing this, they are assisting with the running and maintenance of the chain. So, instead of one company footing the bill to maintain the infrastructure, the costs are distributed throughout the network.\nAnd so is the data. And it is this that is part of the reason that the system is so secure. No one can cut off access to the data or delete it. There is no downtime unless every single computer within the network goes down. (Unlikely considering there are thousands on the network.)\nBut if anyone can log in, surely it is easy to add fake transactions. Well, actually no – every transaction that is added to the chain must first be verified on the network. That’s why it takes ten minutes for it to go through.\nThe security of this system exceeds that of traditional systems, even those with the best firewalls. In fact, it is so effective that all of the major banks have been researching how they can start making use of the systems themselves.\nBitcoin and blockchain have not only disrupted the financial services industry, but they have also blasted many well cherished beliefs out of the water completely.\"\n*NOT MY WRITING, BLURB PASSED TO ME BY INFOGRAPHIC CREATORS.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://bitcoinplay.net/58-insane-facts-about-bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T06:13:15.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51d3a8644d1c732c53608576174b426ec9ae4886", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91AAFr2hsw6XIfPMQR_cdpq.PsVMOHEKn.3tZi7J9xXv_UtN0SuVNhbPWCeQ7D_oOc3ZDVehPq2sX0f5KveBaQNPqV1IKSTEsnbTOWmlb7EsVm2yRBMIat9PQspbB6pXxvYopwAvQHww--", "site_full": "www.digitalmoneytalk.com", "site": "digitalmoneytalk.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitalmoneytalk.com/forum/100-cryptocurrency/", "site_categories": ["finance", "geology", "science", "adult", "stocks", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency - Digital Money Talk Forum - Forex, Ecurrency exchange and Cryptocurrency Forum - Sponsored by 1xBit.com &amp; Pokerdapp.io", "title": "[ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io - General Discussion - Digital", "title_full": "[ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io - Cryptocurrency General Discussion - Digital Money Talk Forum - Forex, Ecurrency exchange and Cryptocurrency Forum - Sponsored by 1xBit.com & Pokerdapp.io", "published": "2018-05-16T06:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.digitalmoneytalk.com/public/style_images/Plus_New/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 55075, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51d3a8644d1c732c53608576174b426ec9ae4886", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91AAFr2hsw6XIfPMQR_cdpq.PsVMOHEKn.3tZi7J9xXv_UtN0SuVNhbPWCeQ7D_oOc3ZDVehPq2sX0f5KveBaQNPqV1IKSTEsnbTOWmlb7EsVm2yRBMIat9PQspbB6pXxvYopwAvQHww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alick Bannerman", "published": "2018-05-16T06:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io - General Discussion - Digital", "text": "Finally, you find first reliable Bitcoin Doubler that really works as it has to be.

Canaan Creative has applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for an IPO while Zhejiang Ebang Communication has started working with advisers on a Hong Kong float, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. While the price of bitcoin BTC=BTSP has tumbled 35 percent this year and Beijing has tightened its grip on trade in the virtual currency, equipment makers are still hungry for capital to fund growth and to meet still robust demand for their machines. Both are seeking as much as $1 billion, IFR said, which would dwarf other known listings for crytopcurrency firms. Canaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. Canaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China’s push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company. Ebang delisted from China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing. While many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software. Another miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern. In Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalization of $333 million. Canaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying. Credit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan’s float, IFR added. Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356, and so far the transition has been smooth as the community awaits the next concession of blocks.\nMiners and other full BCH nodes had already upgraded their clients to the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 and other supported implementations like Bitcoin Unlimited, and XT over the past few weeks as the community prepared for the change. Among some minor updates, three notable changes have been enforced throughout the network which includes a 32MB block size, an increased default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes.\nThe first and biggest change to the Bitcoin Cash consensus rules is obviously the fourfold block size increase. Raising the block size to 32MB will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent inexpensive transaction fees.\nRight now the amount of BCH transactions per day has been steadily increasing, and because the base block size has increased by four times its original size, blocks will not fill up for a very long time. The capability of this mechanism has been proven multiple times as there have been many BCH blocks between 2-8MB processed over the course of the past nine months.

A favorite is [**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com). It is safe and based in the US. To make an account you will simply need to sign up with an email, connect your bank account to your exchange account, prove your identity by submitting a the back and front of your driver's license, and use your debit card to purchase the Bitcoin at the rate given by your exchange. To purchase the bitcoin, after registration you will, click [BUY AND SELL](https://imgur.com/wTACvMJ). Your next step is to [fill out your order sheet](https://imgur.com/8fCUvQz). Here I have made a $5 purchase. Even though your purchase was $5, you will not be receiving $5 in bitcoin due to fees. [Here](https://imgur.com/vjDOP9Y) I have linked a sample of what my $5 will get me in bitcoin. I highly suggest that you play around with your purchase amount to see the best fee price for your purchase. Another option would also be the **[Cash App](https://cash.me)**. This app is similar to Coinbase in the bitcoin buying sense, but as many people already use the app it becomes easier as your identification is already verified.\n&nbsp;\nYour next step would be to transfer your funds to a private wallet. Think of this as a secure bank account for bitcoin where only you have access. I recommend [**Exodus**](https://www.exodus.io/) as it held as software on my computer making it a little safer than an online wallet. 2 big reasons for keeping your bitcoin in a private wallet rather than the exchange is that 1) The private wallet is more secure, and 2) Sending bitcoin from your private wallet to the betting site is preferred as there have been examples of Coinbase banning accounts due to transferring funds to gambling websites. Transferring funds is not free and a fee will apply each time you send bitcoin between wallets. To transfer funds from your bitcoin exchange to your private wallet you'll need an address. WARNING: ONLY EVERY GIVE YOUR PUBLIC ADDRESS. PUBLIC ADDRESS IS TO RECEIVE FUNDS. YOUR PRIVATE ADDRESS IS A WAY TO REGAIN ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT. IF SOMEONE HAS YOUR PRIVATE ADDRES THEY BASICALLY HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT. When you set up the wallet it will come with a public address combining numbers and letters. Mine is : **19MXXrgZuR3wHkDXzWa2x5TFyp7mesmjDw**, yours will look similar. To transfer funds from Coinbase or Cash App to your private wallet, you'll go to the [ACCOUNTS](https://imgur.com/pLd1pzi) section and click the [Send Button](https://imgur.com/VHKZKGV) on the Bitcoin section. This will then prompt you to type in your public wallet address and your funds will be transferred for a fee. This transfer should take anywhere from a couple minutes to an hour depending on the blockchain. Make sure you type in the correct wallet address as there's no take-backsies. Once your funds are received and confirmed in your private wallet, you'll be able to transfer then to the betting site.\n&nbsp;\nI will be using [**Nitrogen**](https://nitrogensports.eu) as an example as it is very popular on this subreddit and the transfers don't take very long. Nitrogen is also anonymous so your identity is protected. Nitrogen will also give you a wallet address. This is the address you will want to transfer the funds from your private wallet to. Similarly to how you transferred funds from Coinbase to the Private Wallet. You will do the same from the Private Wallet to Nitrogen. Once in your account feel free to place bets as you wish. I recommend that you continually transfer bitcoin back into your private wallet as your hopeful winnings come in to keep them secure.\n&nbsp;\nHope this was helpful. As always.

2018 164 Trading and clearing platform LedgerX has launched a new Bitcoin (BTC) savings product that is licensed by the US Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC), Forbes reported May 15.\nThe savings product introduced by LedgerX is certified by a CFTC derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license and a swap execution facility (SEF) license. Juthica Chou, Chief Operating Officer at LedgerX said: “Everything we do requires both the licenses. And a lot of that is intentional, because by making it a package deal we can offer a number of services to our customers in a really clear, vertically integrated way.”\nThe licenses permit users to earn a yield on their Bitcoin assets. Rather than just “hodling” and hoping that Bitcoin appreciates, investors can earn a fiat-based yield on their BTC by employing what is referred to as a call overwrite technique, wherein an investor deposits BTC into LedgerX, then sells a call option at a slightly longer date, with a higher strike call option.\nThe project is designed to simplify BTC option trading to a basic point-and-click format, so “less sophisticated” bull traders can potentially get a premium price on their holdings. The product’s interface allows users to choose the implied rate they’re anticipating to earn and the number of BTC they wish to earn the yield on. Chou said:\n“This interface will definitely be skewed to the long Bitcoin holders, who will likely only deposit bitcoin and who will want to earn interest off of that Bitcoin.”\nAccording to Forbes, during the past three months, 70 percent of the trade volume of LedgerX has come from options, with an average trade size of $60,000. The options contracts will reportedly be available for a three-month and a six-month duration, while LedgerX charges a transaction fee for each service.\nYesterday, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched an Ethereum reference rate and real time index to the US dollar. The rates are offered in partnership with Crypto-Facilities, a UK-based digital asset exchange, that debuted the “first regulated” Ethereum futures last week.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ledgerx", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-a-county-in-florida-to-accept-crypto-for-tax-payment-the-seminole-county-florida-tax-collector-joel-m-greenberg-announced-may-14-that-the-county-will-begin-accepting-cryptocurrency-for-payment-for-various-services-starting-this-summer-to-eliminate-heav", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/05/15/ledgerx-launches-first-cftc-regulated-bitcoin-savings-accounts/#5c5bc9738094", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-based-crypto-trading-platform-launches-first-regulated-ethereum-futures", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cftc", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cme"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juthica chou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ledgerx", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us commodities future trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T08:06:13.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "727ac75acbcc078a876de0a3bd023ca740f485df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ghpkVT8HKvw3H_yVPxyJCMT1f2yxSHA_Fb2mlt.9z7pzSGlWPnvqwltmBVJo9SyJe16hpKZBeNHrX_ahzxWgy4VDoc_Q5XK2iuJyfcsfo6d54yv05F3lpYpKQgG7aEcI-", "site_full": "www.10dailythings.com", "site": "10dailythings.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/10dailythings", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "10 Daily Things", "title": "Man who claims he created bitcoin committed perjury, lawsuit says", "title_full": "Man who claims he created bitcoin committed perjury, lawsuit says", "published": "2018-05-16T05:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.10dailythings.com/upload/news/image_1526443244_36370701.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "727ac75acbcc078a876de0a3bd023ca740f485df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ghpkVT8HKvw3H_yVPxyJCMT1f2yxSHA_Fb2mlt.9z7pzSGlWPnvqwltmBVJo9SyJe16hpKZBeNHrX_ahzxWgy4VDoc_Q5XK2iuJyfcsfo6d54yv05F3lpYpKQgG7aEcI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T05:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Man who claims he created bitcoin committed perjury, lawsuit says", "text": "Man who claims he created bitcoin committed perjury, lawsuit says Man who claims he created bitcoin committed perjury, lawsuit says\nEnlarge (credit: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images )\nFor years now, the saga of bitcoin has been a tangled tale. Now, a new court filing has thrown a wrench into a recent high-stakes lawsuit that attempts to shed light on the mysterious origins of the cryptocurrency.\nThe new amended complaint submitted late Monday in the ongoing case of Kleiman v. Wright (which is underway in a West Palm Beach, Florida, federal court) makes a bombshell claim.\nThe lawsuit now argues that Craig Wright recently lied about his supposed lack of connections to a Florida-based bitcoin-related company.

I searched for litecoin wallets, which led to \"loaf wallet\". Looking at the github for loafwallet, it said \"deprecated, please look at litecoin-foundation/loafwallet-ios\". And clicking there led directly to the github fork of Bread ( github.com/litecoin-foundation/loafwallet-ios ) (note the big Bread logo). So... from that I concluded that Bread supports litecoin. If that's not the case, it's Ok, but... geez I'm confused. – martin jakubik Jan 24 at 16:20 @martinjakubik: I don't know how to prove a negative, but I have never seen any reference to Litecoin within the official Bread app nor its documentation. Loaf is not Bread; it's a fork. Someone took the Bread source code (which did not support Litecoin) and modified it to create a different app which does (but as far as I can tell the fork no longer supports Bitcoin). It looks like they were not very careful about changing all instances of the original app's name and logo. – Nate Eldredge Jan 24 at 16:27 alright, I'll take that as an answer. Thanks. what's frustrating is that they weren't careful about updating the ... uh... link to the App Store either. – martin jakubik Jan 24 at 16:37 1 There's a reference now.

Some of them are selling and some are still in the game but thinking about doing the same. This is because the crypto craze has reached its peak in that period and people were throwing money at any coin that was showing even a small sign of potential gains.\nAll of this fear of BTC never reaching its all time high again is causing the price to drop and it will probably continue doing so until at least one crypto project finds mass adoption. Will it be Ethereum or Bitcoin or some other coin, we cant know. Ripple has the biggest chance right now since they are the only ones trying hard to sell their product to banks and money transfer agencies.\nTo keep this answer short, I think BTC will go a lot bigger than 20k but time is a big factor now. The media wont talk as much about BTC until it starts growing again but it cant grow without media coverage. Mass adoption will bring new investors in, this will alert the media and if crypto finds a place in our everyday lives you can expect BTC to go a lot over $20k. I personally believe that it can hit close to a million per coin but only if cryptocurrencies as a whole become adopted worldwide.

While local media still discuss allegations and raise questions about Upbit’s business practice, some people believe that Upbit is already in the clear. The investigation continues.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space The Allegations\nLocal media reported on Friday that South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, is under investigation for alleged fraud. More information has surfaced since, casting doubt on whether the allegations can be considered fraud. No charges have been filed against Upbit at the time of this writing. However, the prosecutors have confiscated the exchange’s computers and records as part of the investigation.\nOn Monday, News1 Korea described:\nProsecutors searched Upbit for fraud charges triggered by coinless transactions, suspicion of insider trading during the listing process, and allegations of money laundering and leakage of money through US trading sites. Liquidity Issue\nThe first allegation, the most heavily scrutinized, concerns the liquidity of some of the coins listed on Upbit.\nThe exchange currently lists 137 cryptocurrencies but not all of them have wallets. South Korean prosecutors are accusing the exchange of “book-trading” where Upbit facilitates the trading of cryptocurrencies without actually having the coins in its possession. Joongang Ilbo elaborated:\nOf the more than 130 cryptocurrencies currently traded on Upbit, about 40 do not support e-wallets.\nNews1 also pointed out that there is a viewpoint among investigators that if users request a transfer or withdrawal of their coins all at once, then Upbit will not be able to return their money immediately, which would render the original transactions fraudulent.\nHowever, some argue that “most domestic trading sites are adopting this method” except those that handle a small number of cryptocurrencies such as Bithumb, the news outlet conveyed, adding that if this method is found to be an “apparent fraud…[then] the industry will not be much affected.” Upbit Calls It a Misunderstanding\nUpbit says that this investigation is “something that comes from misunderstanding,” Joongang Ilbo reported.\nThe exchange has repeatedly dismissed the above accusation, emphasizing that it will secure the needed cryptocurrencies as soon as it has brokered a transaction for the coins without a wallet, the news outlet detailed. In addition, Upbit insists that it has “never bought or sold cryptocurrencies that it did not own since it opened last October.”\nFurthermore, given Upbit’s exclusive partnership with the US exchange Bitrex, crypto experts believe that “the lack of understanding of the Upbit trading system that links the system with the overseas exchange has led to the suspicion of book trading,” the publication emphasized, adding:\nCryptocurrency traded in KRW is directly managed by Upbit, and when customers buy other virtual currencies…transactions are made through Bittrex under the responsibility of Upbit.\nA representative of another crypto exchange explained that except for the won market, Upbit transactions are made through Bittrex. “It is a legitimate book deal, and the prosecutors seem to have misunderstood why they are selling cryptocurrencies that they do not have.” Previous Internal Audit\nAnother factor at play is an article published by Money Today on Tuesday, referencing an internal audit which reportedly happened earlier this year. The news outlet quoted Lee Seok-woo, president of Dunamu Inc. which operates Upbit, saying that “In early March, when Upbit was suspected of only [conducting] book transactions without [holding the] coins…I have been notified that the amount of coins [in the books] is 100% identical to the number of coins” in the wallets.\nReferencing the above article, Twitter user Crypto of Korea wrote, “Upbit claimed that they had the internal account audit…The audit shows that 100% of the coins are real, the ledgers all synced to their own wallets.”\nSome people subsequently took Upbit’s claim as the exchange being clear of wrong-doing in this current investigation, while others remain more objective. Twitter user Nash wrote, “Not concluded yet. It’s just “Upbit’s claim.” Meanwhile, Korean media still raise questions about Upbit’s operations and seek more answers at the time of this writing. Insider Trading and Money Laundering Concerns\nThe prosecutors are also reportedly looking into allegations of insider trading and money laundering surrounding Upbit, News1 Korea wrote, noting that “some investors have raised strong suspicion that there is insider trading” at the exchange. “It is suspected that a person who receives information from an Upbit employee about an upcoming listing [on Upbit] would have bought the cryptocurrency from [an] overseas trading site and sold on Upbit.”\nFurthermore, the investigators alleged that “illegal business funds are more easily transferred from the domestic [exchange] to the US due to the linkage with Bittrex,” the publication described.\nAs for any fraud charges, a lawyer was quoted by the news outlet commenting:\nIt is difficult to judge it as a fraud because there is no victim. If the capital market law applies to the transaction site [Upbit], it is a criminal offense. The lack of a clear baseline law is a bigger problem.\nJoongang Ilbo further asserted that according to the position of the country’s financial regulators, “cryptocurrency is not subject to the Capital Market Law because it is not a monetary product.” In the unlikely event that the prosecutors can apply the Capital Market Law to this case, commissions through book transactions would be considered criminal proceeds, the news outlet explained.\nDo you think Upbit has done anything wrong?

Trading volume is much lower than in the bitcoin futures markets on fellow US exchanges CME and CBOE — which thus far have attracted more bitcoin bears than bulls — but the firm reports that volume has increased to $30 million per month over the past quarter, with individual trades averaging $60,000 in notional value.\nThe bitcoin savings product is one of a number institutionally-focused services that have been timed to coincide with “Blockchain Week” in New York City.\nAs CCN reported, cryptocurrency brokerage Coinbase unveiled a slew of products aimed at institutional traders, while Japanese financial holding company Nomura partnered with cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer Ledger (no association with LedgerX) to provide institutional traders with access to secure cryptoasset custody.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cryptocurr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juthica chou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T05:20:59.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e20d83d3750434a3610447279fe8fc8f1cc7928", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_7zgJLo.SVWTBB8hMhTpdvF2l8XtlEBw1Ri4YGsj3bv1nz60rpNlqMJC58TqPZ1RiFW30Ub3ZXe8ERPpL_ylBi.6l5IElBZE1yGLd.0aWDg--", "site_full": "22ticks.com", "site": "22ticks.com", "site_section": "https://22ticks.com/feed", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "22TICKS LIFESTYLE BLOG", "title": "Whalepool Live Bitcoin / Cryptocurrency Trading Stream 24/7/365", "title_full": "Whalepool Live Bitcoin / Cryptocurrency Trading Stream 24/7/365", "published": "2018-05-16T05:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://22ticks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gk6IeG.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e20d83d3750434a3610447279fe8fc8f1cc7928", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_7zgJLo.SVWTBB8hMhTpdvF2l8XtlEBw1Ri4YGsj3bv1nz60rpNlqMJC58TqPZ1RiFW30Ub3ZXe8ERPpL_ylBi.6l5IElBZE1yGLd.0aWDg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T05:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Whalepool Live Bitcoin / Cryptocurrency Trading Stream 24/7/365", "text": "From our experience, we only recommend trading on the following exchanges:\nBitcoin Futures Bitmex (http://bitmex.whalepool.io/) – Proven track record, available in the whalepool telegram chat also.

The launch of the savings account by the cryptocurrency asset management platform is the first to be regulated by the U.S. Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC).\nAccording to a report from Forbes, the aim of the bitcoin savings account is to give investors a fiat-based yield on the bitcoin they’re holding. Through the LedgerX Savings product investors use a technique known as a call overwrite.\nThrough a simplified version, a user chooses the implied rate they want to earn with the new savings account and the number of bitcoins they are hoping to earn the yield on. They then submit this to the LedgerX matching engine that is powering their existing bitcoin options product.\nAt its most basic, the idea is to make it easier for investors to know when they can potentially make a premium on the sale of their asset. The LedgerX Savings account also comes with two CFTC licenses: a derivatives clearing organisation (DCO) license and a swap execution facility (SEF) license.\nAccording to Forbes, this ‘signals an increasing level of sophistication being offered to bitcoin users.’ Designed based on the use patterns of LedgerX’s existing customers the platform expects to see high volumes on the product. Similar to the way a normal savings account works, though, it may have more appeal to those who prefer to hodl their bitcoin rather than sell.

By June 2017, they managed to set up a working implementation of the project on the Bitcoin testnet and invited peer review. Sponsored Links\nThe concept was designed by Zcash advisor and developer Andrew Miller. The project contributors also include Giulia Fanti, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and other University of Illinois researchers. How does Dandelion Improve Transaction Privacy?\nDandelion is best described by the proposal’s wiki on Github, which goes on to explain that the system works in two distinct phases, called the “stem” and “fluff” stages respectively. In essence, it is a routing protocol that overcomes deanonymization techniques that have been demonstrated in the past to uncover the identity of bitcoin users.\n“During the stem phase, each node relays the transaction to a single peer. After a random number of hops along the stem, the transaction enters the fluff phase, which behaves just like ordinary flooding/diffusion. Even when an attacker can identify the location of the fluff phase, it is much more difficult to identify the source of the stem.” Source: GitHub\nIn simpler words, the ‘stem’ refers to the data unique to a transaction, whereas ‘fluff’ is the process through which the sender’s IP address is hidden. By preventing nodes from ‘listening’ and finding out where a transaction originated, user privacy is improved by virtue of reducing the effectiveness adversaries can de-anonymize the network. Dispelling Concerns\nWhen first revealed, some speculated that while the Dandelion Project will bring a much-needed boost to the privacy and security capabilities of bitcoin, its effect may be somewhat short-lived and akin to a band-aid on a larger problem. Well-known Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell alluded to this issue himself in his reply to the mailing list in 2017, stating that malicious actors could still cross-check transaction patterns to identify the origin of the transaction.\nA year after concerns revolving around a deanonymization attack initially cropped up though, it appears as if the project’s authors finally have a solution. In another email sent to the bitcoin developer (bitcoin-dev) mailing list, the team suggested a feature to combat the issue, dubbed the “per-inbound-edge.” With the measure, transactions would be hopped through different nodes to prevent tracing attempts. Bitcoin Network Upgrades\nAny update to the Bitcoin protocol, including the one proposed by the Dandelion Project, needs to be approved by a majority of all nodes on the network. The last major update to the Bitcoin network was the launch of Segregated Witness (SegWit) in late August 2017, codenamed BIP-141.\nThe term BIP is shorthand for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.

Some of you may have noticed my project as one of the items in the recently released BCF report. Seeing as today is a day of celebration for the BCH community, following a successful 32MB upgrade and re-enabled OP Codes, I figured the timing was right to formally introduce the #BCHtruckTO project.\nOn July 1st, 2018 an LED video truck with screens on both sides and the rear will be driving around downtown Toronto, Canada. This project's main goal is to raise awareness/adoption for Bitcoin Cash by using bright LED screens to display BCH promotional materials and by giving away Bitcoin Cash. $4000 CAD in BCH will be given away throughout the course of the day on July 1st. Private keys will be displayed on the screens of the truck approximately every 10 mins with a prize amount drawn randomly from a pre-determined prize pool.\nThe prize pool is as follows:\n1 x $1000 CAD in BCH 2 x $500 CAD in BCH 10 x $100 CAD in BCH 100 x $10 CAD in BCH\nTo win one or more of these prizes you must snap a photo of the truck when it displays a private key and use the key to claim the Bitcoin Cash at the address.\nThe choice of July 1st was simple: Canada Day. The city will be busy and a bright green truck will stand out among a sea of red. The streets should be busy and there should be many impressions left. Marijuana was also scheduled for legalization in Canada that day, however it looks as though the legalization date may be delayed.\nPromotional Image: https://imgur.com/a/eceCic0\nGithub FPR: https://github.com/The-Bitcoin-Cash-Fund/FPR/blob/master/FPR-0035/EVAL-0035.md\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bch_to\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Bitcoin-Cash-Truck-Toronto-1228698153934447/\nMemo: https://memo.cash/profile/1HhJh2nBdRLCtAQDgP7zHu17DhrNt7qTtS\nBCF Discord: https://discord.gg/PPhdfx9 (you can find the specific channel, BCHtruckTO, for this project under the tab 'Projects (Active)')\nBitcoin Cash Fund: https://www.thebitcoincash.fund/\nMany thanks to the Bitcoin Cash Fund for their continued support of this community and its aspirations.\nCheers, Edge\n submitted by /u/Edgecloser\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://github.com/The-Bitcoin-Cash-Fund/FPR/blob/master/FPR-0035/EVAL-0035.md", "https://www.thebitcoincash.fund/", "https://memo.cash/profile/1HhJh2nBdRLCtAQDgP7zHu17DhrNt7qTtS", "https://twitter.com/bch_to", "https://discord.gg/PPhdfx9", "https://www.facebook.com/Bitcoin-Cash-Truck-Toronto-1228698153934447/", "https://imgur.com/a/eceCic0"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T01:15:36.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c16ec03271c36b206c7d8ce0bdb7608a4805cf53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQK4CHUfMaTGKYn.N1K6LzdD5R9kbgSwBdPeDLUNP9zYOuPSspNz9_17O4BzKUKJFnroKYbrW7_3NnYGR45F.rHXaNim_l5u_KMViI.bcAIWn0RgyYEwKNNt1DibWBZqUSi_lAHAwiRg--", "site_full": "btcihowtoinvest.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://btcihowtoinvest.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Beats Jamie Dimon as Only 17% Believe Crypto is a ‘Scam’ – How to invest with bitcoin 2018", "title": "Bitcoin Beats Jamie Dimon as Only 17% Believe Crypto is a ‘Scam’", "title_full": "Bitcoin Beats Jamie Dimon as Only 17% Believe Crypto is a ‘Scam’", "published": "2018-05-16T05:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c16ec03271c36b206c7d8ce0bdb7608a4805cf53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQK4CHUfMaTGKYn.N1K6LzdD5R9kbgSwBdPeDLUNP9zYOuPSspNz9_17O4BzKUKJFnroKYbrW7_3NnYGR45F.rHXaNim_l5u_KMViI.bcAIWn0RgyYEwKNNt1DibWBZqUSi_lAHAwiRg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "btcihowtoinvest", "published": "2018-05-16T05:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Beats Jamie Dimon as Only 17% Believe Crypto is a ‘Scam’", "text": "\nJust 17% of US adults think that cryptocurrency is a “scam,” according to a new survey which sheds fresh light on mainstream consumers’ relationships to Bitcoin and altcoins.\n40% ‘Aren’t Interested’\nCompiled by finance website Finder.com, 2001 people responded to various basic questions about cryptocurrency.\n7.95% had already purchased some form of cryptoasset, with another 7.76% planning to do so in future, the results report.\nThose who were not planning to do so said it was mostly (40%) either superfluous to their requirements or they simply weren’t interested.\n“This reason is followed by 35.02% who say that the risk is too high, 27.04% who find it too difficult to understand and 17.97% who say it’s a scam,” Finder adds.\nPrevious comments by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that Bitcoin was a “fraud” threatened to bring the concept into mainstream consciousness as a de facto ‘truth’ in September 2017, but Dimon subsequently took back his words.\nEarly Days For Bitcoin\nThe results reaffirm what many already know to be true about the current state of cryptocurrency: consumer adoption is still far out, with financial institutions due to adopt the technology long before the average …\nRead more –> click here all content is copyright Bitcoinist.\nNeed Bitcoin marketing and PR?

The framework had been put together earlier this year but it has come into effect yesterday. Thailand Begins Regulating Crypto\nThis year has been quite dynamic for the crypto field in Thailand. Back in February, the Bank of Thailand barred banks from investing in or selling digital currencies, grant loans to their clients with hopes to purchase crypto and also prohibited financial institutions to provide advisory support on the matter of crypto.\nYet, the Finance Minister of the Country, Apisak Tantivorawong said that:\nThe government will not ban cryptocurrency trading. A regulatory framework to govern digital currencies will become clearer within a month.\nThe royal decree which is to formally regulate transactions associated with digital assets came into force on Sunday, May 13 th . This falls in line with the position of the finance minister who said that regulations were necessary in order to regulate cryptocurrency as well as digital tokens comprehensively to prevent tax avoidance, crime, money laundering, and other illegal activities. What’s the Verdict?\nThe law, which is 100-sections long, stipulates that cryptocurrencies and digital tokens are seen as digital assets. At the same time, puts them under the purview of the country’s watchdog – the Security Exchange Commission (SEC).\nCryptocurrency sellers now have 90 days to register with the SEC. Stringent sanctions will fall upon those who fail to meet the terms. They will be fined no more than twice the amount of the digital transaction or a minimum of 500,000 baht (roughly around $15,671 USD). Jail time is also on the table of possible sanctions for up to two years.\nGoing further, the SEC and the Ministry of Finance will be working together on putting down comprehensive laws which would require digital asset exchanges, dealers, and brokers to register with the relevant institutional authorities. A Step Forward\nThe country’s position is particularly clear: this decree is a step forward as this doesn’t prohibit transactions with digital assets. Neither does it forbid Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) from being carried out in Thailand. It’s a step in the right direction of regulating the relatively new field, which desperately needs clarity to boost investor confidence.\nDo you think regulation is needed to shed further clarity on dealings with cryptocurrencies?

Now, a new court filing has thrown a wrench into a recent high-stakes lawsuit that attempts to shed light on the mysterious origins of the cryptocurrency.\nThe new amended complaint submitted late Monday in the ongoing case of Kleiman v. Wright (which is underway in a West Palm Beach, Florida, federal court) makes a bombshell claim.\nThe lawsuit now argues that Craig Wright recently lied about his supposed lack of connections to a Florida-based bitcoin-related company. Wright apparently co-founded and co-owned the company with a now-deceased Florida man who had a significant role in the early days of bitcoin: Dave Kleiman. (Gizmodo outlined the links between the men in a substantive May 2016 article.)\nWright is best known for his questionable 2016 claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s mythical creator. The lawsuit previously noted that it is \"unclear\" whether Kleiman, Wright, or both men \"invented bitcoin.\"\nThe new filing plainly states that Wright has committed a \"fraud on this court\" when he claimed that he had no connection to this Florida company even though he had informed an Australian court of the exact opposite years earlier.\nIn February 2018, the lawyer representing the Kleiman estate, Devin \"Velvel\" Freedman , told Ars that the estate of the late Dave Kleiman is owed, by Wright's own admission, at least 300,000 bitcoins (worth more than $3 billion today).\nWhy? In the early days of bitcoin (2011), Kleiman and Wright founded a Florida-based bitcoin company that they purportedly split 50-50: W&K Info Defense Research LLC.\nFurther Reading Craig Wright: “I don’t have the courage” to prove I’m Satoshi Nakamoto Tragically, Kleiman died suddenly in April 2013, but he seems to have told no one about his involvement in bitcoin and made no obvious way for his heirs to claim the fortune that he had amassed in bitcoins. Then, six months later, Wright sued W&K in an Australian court in an attempt to reclaim money and intellectual property that he, Wright, believed that he was owed.\nAfter Dave Kleiman’s death, Wright first contacted Dave’s brother, Ira Kleiman, on February 15, 2014 (days after first reaching out to their elderly father). Wright informed Ira of the bitcoin partnership that he and Dave had formed.\nBut Wright claimed, as the lawsuit describes, that Dave had signed his rights away “in exchange for non-controlling shares of a non-operational Australian company worth ‘millions.’ Craig told Ira he’d be able to sell Dave’s stake in the company in a few months. This was a lie. The company went bankrupt after Craig apparently misled the Australian Tax Office (‘ATO’).”\nIn April 2018, Ira Kleiman reinstated W&K as a Florida corporation, which had previously been dissolved. That same month, Wright himself submitted a formal court declaration that accompanied his motion to dismiss the case, denying that he had anything to do with W&K at all.\nAs he wrote :\nI have never shared in the profits or had a duty to share in the losses of W&K or any Florida business.\nI have never been an agent of W&K or any Florida business.\nI have never been a director, member, shareholder, officer, employee, or representative of W&K or of any Florida business.\nI have never exercised authority or control over W&K or any Florida business and have not had any right to exercise authority or control over W&K or any Florida business.\nFurther Reading Craig Wright’s proof that he invented Bitcoin: “F**k off, I’m not going to jump through hoops” But in the newly public Australian affidavit from the 2013 Australian lawsuit of Wright v. W&K Info Defense Research LLC , Wright specifically says that he and Kleiman were co-owners of the company:\nThe shareholding of W&K Info Defense was:\n1. Craig S. Wright 50.0 %\n2. David A. Kleiman 50.0 %\nThe newly amended complaint in the Florida case continues :\nCraig then doubled down on this ownership structure affirming further that “W&K Info Defense LLC was an incorporated partnership. All shares are held jointly.” (Id.). He then affirmed that he called a “shareholders meeting” on August 16, 2013 at which only he and Jamie Wilson were present. (Id.). Craig affirmed he was the sole vote that nominated Jamie Wilson to act as a director “for purposes of consenting to orders and the company to be wound down.” (Id. at 5).27 165.\nThese affidavit statements, in Freedman’s view, directly contradict Wright’s sworn statements that he had never been a shareholder or member of W&K and had never “exercised authority or control” over the company.\n“Craig’s boldfaced misrepresentations and perjury before this Court constitute a continuation of his grand fraud to unlawfully take Plaintiffs’ assets,” Freedman continued in the new filing. “Said differently, Craig’s latest fraud on this Florida Court is simply one more action he’s taken in Florida to defraud Dave’s estate and W&K.”\nWright did not respond to Ars’ request for comment by Twitter and email.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4463164-GetDocument-2.html", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390526-Gov-Uscourts-Flsd-521536-1-12.html#document/p2/a407031", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4462663-24-4.html#document/p5/a423127", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4460910-DE-12-02-2018-04-16-Ex-B-to-Motion-to-Dismiss.html#document/p2/a422956", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4462662-24.html#document/p38/a423201", "https://twitter.com/cfarivar/status/996411632271085569", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4460911-DE-12-00-2018-04-16-Motion-to-Dismiss-the.html", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390477-ConvertTiffToPDF.html", "https://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-friend-invented-bi-1746958692", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4462662-24.html#document/p39/a423240", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4462662-24.html", "https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/velvel-devin-freedman.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gizmodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave kleiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kleiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig wright", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "west palm beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T23:51:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a40e7c290ac52323630425c10e5e320fa27ed934", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.EDo4MK0Y3vC45kl5NqarAdDa7tLZgks5w4RamMJMPyYGQ3Wms_BOs0GnNwZ5Dn98-", "site_full": "www.bulkmoneyforum.com", "site": "bulkmoneyforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.bulkmoneyforum.com/forumdisplay.php?f=20", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "E Currency updates &amp; info Discussion (NO EXCHANGE)", "title": "[ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io", "title_full": "[ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io", "published": "2018-05-16T04:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a40e7c290ac52323630425c10e5e320fa27ed934", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.EDo4MK0Y3vC45kl5NqarAdDa7tLZgks5w4RamMJMPyYGQ3Wms_BOs0GnNwZ5Dn98-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kevin Keegan", "published": "2018-05-16T04:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] - First Bitcoin Doubler that really works cryptodoubler.io", "text": "Finally, you find first reliable Bitcoin Doubler that really works as it has to be.

A further 11.40% find it too difficult to use, and 5.75% think that there are too many fees involved,\" Finder reveals.\nWhat do you think about the Finder survey results?

maker of bitcoin mining rigs, earning a reported $4 billion in profits last year. Now it’s using that cash to become a major force in venture capital investing, announcing today (May 15) that it led a $110 million round in Circle, a Boston-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet business.\nThe mega-round, which reportedly values Circle at $3 billion, was done in just three weeks, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu said. “Our investment team is still quite small and we work fast,” he said on the sidelines of the Consensus conference in New York, where the announcement was made. Wu said his investment team was focused on blockchain projects for now. Wu would not say how much Bitmain invested. A slew of other venture capital firms also invested in the round, including Accel, IDG, and General Catalyst.\nBitmain will also partner with Circle to develop a so-called stablecoin—a crypto token that’s pegged to a regular currency—with the first one being a tokenized US dollar called USD Coin, or Circle USDC. The token will be completely backed by dollar reserves. The token will be designed according to a set of rules and governed by a non-profit called Centre. Centre members would be able to issue their own stablecoins, alongside the current members, Circle and Bitmain.\nThe stablecoin is the first step in Bitmain’s vision of “ private central banks ,” Wu said. That’s the notion of a blockchain-based, algorithmic issuer of currency that’s not linked to a government, as Wu has previously outlined. “It’s a very important enabler for a private central bank,” he said. “Currencies can do good or bad things, so we need a certain framework to limit money laundering risks. If we have an open platform we can limit the potential negative things.”\nThe rest of the crypto world is rushing to develop a widely adopted stablecoin. The appeal lies in the fact that stablecoins would allow crypto traders to shield their assets from the volatility of bitcoin or other crypto coins, while avoiding fees and delays in converting their crypto assets into fiat currency. Even the Nobel prize-winning economist Myron Scholes is advising a stablecoin project .\nThe issuers of the most popular stablecoin, Tether, say the token is backed by dollar reserves, but that claim is shrouded in controversy , and has not been proven by an independent audit. There are about $2.2 billion in tether circulating today, according to data provider CoinMarketCap .\nBitmain has also diversified into developing specialized chips for artificial intelligence . Wu said sales of its first-generation chip, called Sophon, amounted to “not much.” But he says a second-generation design is being tested, and that current results are on par with offerings from the chip-maker Nvidia.\nCompetition in the crypto mining business has been heating up. Samsung reported that its recent quarterly earnings were boosted by sales of cryptocurrency mining chips. Bitmain is not a Samsung customer, Wu confirmed. Bitmain uses Taiwanese foundry TSMC. A mysterious firm called Halong Mining is purported to use Samsung chips. When asked whether he thought Halong was behind the spike in Samsung chip sales, Wu was coy. “No comment,” he said, with a smile.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/bitmain-wants-invest-blockchain-powered-central-banks/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/", "https://www.coindesk.com/110-million-circle-series-e-bitcoin-unicorn/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jihan wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "circle usdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general catalyst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T06:28:30.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ddcf2d95e89016b5aed0ede751a738a2adbb0458", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBKIlP16QPvy_Ox5EgCVXV17FFya9eF157OX_73IFMYApGTdEDHzBKya9LBOA5YvDKiraFuDkYPejhbdg1k4fmEMwOUuBnRB0FzaoXWtewxlVA-", "site_full": "anynote.co", "site": "anynote.co", "site_section": "https://anynote.co/rss/?id=1", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Latest Blogs", "title": "ICO Occasion London 2017.

Early Days For Bitcoin\nThe results reaffirm what many already know to be true about the current state of cryptocurrency: consumer adoption is still far out, with financial institutions due to adopt the technology long before the average citizen.\nLast month, Bitcoinist reported on how a Thomson Reuters survey revealed some more surprising numbers in this respect: 20% of finance firms were planning a crypto market entry, with over 50 of the 400 participants planning to complete theirs before the end of 2018.\nDespite a push to formalize markets from multiple jurisdictions this year, and those such as Japan actively encouraging consumer uptake, most are still distanced from cryptocurrency.\nTo tip the balance for US consumers, it would appear Bitcoin, as the most popular cryptocurrency owned by survey respondents, must overcome barriers involving “bubble” fears, ease-of-use and fees.\n“While plenty of crypto proponents might disagree, 16.12% are waiting for what they think is a bubble to burst. A further 11.40% find it too difficult to use, and 5.75% think that there are too many fees involved,” Finder reveals.\nWhat do you think about the Finder survey results?

Trading volume is much lower than in the bitcoin futures markets on fellow US exchanges CME and CBOE — which thus far have attracted more bitcoin bears than bulls — but the firm reports that volume has increased to $30 million per month over the past quarter, with individual trades averaging $60,000 in notional value.\nThe bitcoin savings product is one of a number institutionally-focused services that have been timed to coincide with “Blockchain Week” in New York City.\nAs CCN reported, cryptocurrency brokerage Coinbase unveiled a slew of products aimed at institutional traders, while Japanese financial holding company Nomura partnered with cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer Ledger (no association with LedgerX) to provide institutional traders with access to secure cryptoasset custody.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juthica chou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T04:00:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72ddf552deb934670cf36b0edf4e5738d5e8a7e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRtHcwbqWXBphyFPn.RwaWM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Bitcoin is Different From Other Currencies?", "title_full": "Why Bitcoin is Different From Other Currencies?", "published": "2018-05-16T03:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72ddf552deb934670cf36b0edf4e5738d5e8a7e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRtHcwbqWXBphyFPn.RwaWM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MrRiuss", "published": "2018-05-16T03:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Bitcoin is Different From Other Currencies?", "text": "bitcoin is different from other currencies because bitcoin is the first known cryptocurrencies, it becomes a benchmark for other cryptocurrencies", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T03:43:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06121671f9a028eba19aafab1c9075faf97b4427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgz6.oNcLhO1jCA4eEr75i.JWcZDXyFF9lqmAVuvVzM9Bc5FrzmGBY6Xx6NBkWbr.bHsLkYUr9Z4lxX.bDfily0zwWdB50wYmT6TZLrBHLhQ0-", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Now you can pay for natural personal care products using bitcoin", "title_full": "Now you can pay for natural personal care products using bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-16T03:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06121671f9a028eba19aafab1c9075faf97b4427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgz6.oNcLhO1jCA4eEr75i.JWcZDXyFF9lqmAVuvVzM9Bc5FrzmGBY6Xx6NBkWbr.bHsLkYUr9Z4lxX.bDfily0zwWdB50wYmT6TZLrBHLhQ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-16T03:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Now you can pay for natural personal care products using bitcoin", "text": "On Monday, Schmidt’s Naturals, a personal care products company owned by Unilever, began accepting bitcoin for online payments.

Every Bitcoin holder can have access to owning Bitcoin cash at extremely reasonable fees.\nSeveral independent teams have been creating secure software applications to maintain a global decentralized development. Hence, not a single group can have control over it. Bitcoin Cash is widely popular in Asia, South Korea, and Japan.\nRyan Charles, the founder of Yours.org says:\n“The most noticeable thing will be on memo.cash. It’s a decentralised twitter, so you can fit more room in between.”\nThe necessary first step towards global adoption of Bitcoin cash shall take place on the 15th of May 2018. Bitcoin cash will go through a hard-fork where the block size will increase to 32MB and there will be changes pertaining to adoption of smart contracts. For better reference, we can come to an understanding of the recent surge in Bitcoin Cash’s price in mid-April which was over 100%. Basically, all the Bitcoin Cash node users are required to upgrade to Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 or any other software that’s compatible.\nBitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin ABC are user-friendly nodes. BCH is definitely making a comeback with the recent rise in valuation with this hard fork. This will benefit the upsurge of prices in the coming days. Bitcoin ABC is software that is used to run Bitcoin cash node that will hard fork for regular network upgrades.\nNew upgrades will have: Block size increase from 8MB to 32MB. The OP_RETURN data carrier size is increasing to 220 bytes. This will enable smart contracts. Bitcoin Unlimited [BU], the full node implementation for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks plays an important role in the upcoming hard fork along with ABC developers.\nWriting and operating software updates with the recent launch of Bitcoin Cash. Large transaction volumes can now be tested and experimented with. A maximum of 200 transactions is possible per second which you can adopt through the usage of the blockchain without other fundamental changes.\nBCH is currently priced at $1.432 with a circulating supply of 17,128,575 with an upsurge of 3.04% in the past 24 hours.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan charles", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yours.org", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T10:29:05.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0bc3c5ce1baf1f0b0415def3fea64259f17660d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8clshto8LIOYmUHHyaT7cmwEDnmxIHEwhv4o4yi7rd.qTqOE5MBKdSYm1Lrmfa2E_29vgV.BU8kBvk_MAeo7j3c-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "In honor of the Bitcoin Cash successful upgrade and now we have the true lightning network.
