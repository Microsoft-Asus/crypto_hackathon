Read: If bitcoin is a bubble, the ‘panic’ stage is near: economist Furthermore, bitcoin is holding the support line above $7,000 and pushing against a closely-watched short-term indicator.\n“The 15-day moving average has been a good proxy for trends,” said Sluymer in an interview, adding that momentum indicators have moved from overbought in May, to oversold. Sluymer expects bitcoin to make an upside attempt in the next few days to test the 15-day moving average, which “remains negative.” A moving average is a popular technical indicator to analyze price trends over a specific period of time.\nSluymer’s colleague, Tom Lee is one of the biggest bitcoin bulls and has a year-end target of $25,000 for the worlds biggest digital currency. While Sluymer may not be ready to call the bottom in bitcoin, he does see evidence that those betting against it should consider banking some profits.\n“We recommend tactical investors/traders begin reducing BTC short positions and begin phasing in long positions,” said Sluymer.

Although problematic in its own right, the attack highlights one of the biggest weaknesses of blockchain platforms like Bitcoin — computing power.\nBlockchain backed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and ZenCash , are built on a “proof-of-work” system. That means that the network goes along with what a majority of ‘nodes’ ( or miners ) say is true. It’s a secure system because to trick it, you need to control more than half of those nodes, or an equivalent amount of computing power.\nWhile that might be difficult for a platform like Bitcoin where there are thousands upon thousands of high-powered mining rigs, it’s much easier to trick smaller cryptocurrency networks. That is exactly what happened with ZenCash, where over a period of four hours, attackers used masses of computing power to take control of the blockchain and create alternate histories, thereby letting them spend their ZenCash twice.\nBecause the attackers covered their tracks, no one quite knows what they did with it, but no doubt it was profitable. Crypto51 looks at the hash rate, or global computing power currently mining different cryptocurrencies, and how much a 51 percent attack would technically cost to perform if rented from existing networks. In the case of ZenCash, the attacker would theoretically only have had to spend around $30,000 to complete the double-spend hack.\nBlockchain networks like Bitcoin, which are far larger, would require a much greater expenditure to complete a 51 percent attack — $717,000 for just one hour, according to Crypto51. Fortunately, there isn’t enough rental power in the world to conduct such an attack, but if an organization was to get a hold of enough hashing power, those currencies are just as vulnerable and could be attacked in much the same way.\nZenCash isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has been hit with a 51 percent attack. As Bitcoinist reports , both Bitcoin Gold and Verge have both been hit in a similar manner in recent months. They required less hashing power than ZenCash, so it’s possible that this latest attack is just another example if a trend of upward trajectory attacks that target much more vulnerable cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms.\nFifty-one percent attacks aren’t the only problems faced by Bitcoin and public blockchain platforms, though, these developers are trying to solve them .

While yellow crypto media and venal writers here and there are announcing it over already, Bitmain is busy punishing communities who dare to resist.\nAfter the shameful event of announcing z9 as Bitmain's latest ASIC crack against a PoW algorithm, two equihash based coins that happened to be the ones who officially had announced their intention to resist the ASIC crack by managing for a hard fork, Bitcoin Gold and Zencash, experienced a 50%+1 attack.\nIt is how it works in the 'real world' when it comes to money, we all know, but there is something else that we know too: Cryptocurrency is about changing this reality instead of giving it a hug.\nI'm sure, devs in both camps will do what they should, and Bitmain's evil strategy will fail but here I'm not talking about alternate currencies, instead, I'm willing to discuss Bitcoin situation, being seized by a company like Bitmain, praying for its majesty to play fair, desperately.\nThis company is dreaming of taking over the whole crypto ecosystem and I think it should be even kicked out of Bitcoin.\nVery opposite agendas in a ridiculous distribution of power and resources, they have everything and I'm on my own, I see but I have something they can't even dream of: a plan!\nFirstly, the depth of emptiness of Bitmain's strategy should be understood. Taking over a decentralized system is an impossible mission. This company is deemed to failure the question is whether it goes down alone or pulls Bitcoin down with itself.\nMy plan:\nI think eliminating ASICs is a very urgent necessity and it is absolutely feasible, both techically and socioeconomically. For coins that has not been overtaken by Bitmain (yet) it is more convenient, obviously, but in the case of infected ecosystems like Bitcoin, for which my plan is, it gets a bit more complicated. I'm thinking of 3 major projects:\n1- Specific enhancements can be made to bitcoin mining protocol that discourage pool operations and help decentralized mining. I call it de-pool project.\nRunning such a fork would prevent Bitmain from using its Antpool leverage in the first place and brings back mining power to the actual ASIC owners.\nThe technical challenges involved are not that hard and I have some proposals for it in my turn.\n2- A Dag based algorithm can be implemented with very acceptable resistance against ASIC attacks, despite what venal cryptographers and writers say. I call it de-ASIC project.\nAn enhanced version of Dagger Hashimoto can resist ASIC attempts very well. Bitmain's E3 is a misleading propaganda announcement, a joke and not a true ASIC crack.\n2- A smart solution can be devised to let a smooth migration from ASIC to gpu mining within few epochs that can take place in like 2 years. It is ASIC Break project.\nThis project is based on a multi-algorithm, multi difficulty approach and smoothly will retire ASICs in a 2-3 year period.\nEach of the projects needs a seperate thread to discuss but the whole picture deserves one as well.\nYou are welcome to discuss the feasibility of each project and share your ideas, but please, keep your 'ASIC is not that bad' shit out of this topic.

Your Security Down im Not Sorry.\"\nWhile Ticketfly scrambled to ascertain the extent of the damage to their security infrastructure and contain it, someone claiming to be 'IsHaKdZ,' the purported hacker contacted the media claiming that he found a vulnerability in the Ticketfly website and was brushed off when he attempted to report it to them.\nHuh, well shoot. Not every day you see a site as high profile as @ticketfly get taken down. Take your security seriously. pic.twitter.com/JUGOjjwqkI\n— Michael Stenberg (@MichaelStenberg) May 31, 2018\nThe hacker went on to demand 1 BTC \"for protection\" from Ticketfly , and when he did not receive it, he publicly exploited the existing vulnerability, potentially compromising sensitive personal information about thousands of Ticketfly customers and vendors, including names, email addresses, phone numbers and physical addresses.\nMotherboard was able to confirm personal details of six users to be correct, implying that hacker managed to compromise the data of Ticketfly users.\nLatest Developments in Ticketfly Case Subsequent information released in a tweet by Ticketfly indicates that the breach is not yet over, as some Ticketfly services remain offline as the platform races to contain the embarrassing service outage.\nIt was earlier reported that the hacker threatened to release another database labeled 'backstage,' though as yet there is no indication as to what sort of data is contained therein.\nThe only available information came from a statement by a Ticketfly spokesperson who said:\n\"We've determined that Ticketfly.com has been the target of a cyber incident. Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken all Ticketfly systems temporarily offline as we continue to look into the issue. We realize the gravity of this decision, but the security of client and customer data is our top priority. We are working tirelessly, and in coordination with leading third-party forensic experts, to get our clients back up and running.\"\nCrypto Crimes on the Rise? The incident is the latest in a growing pattern that sees bitcoin used as the currency of choice for hackers and blackmailers. In March 2018 , Atlanta's government computers were attacked by the notorious WannaCry ransomware virus, with hackers demanding $51,000 in bitcoin before they would end the attack.\nThe following month, on June 1, 2018, BTCManager reported Chinese authorities arrested 97 people and recovered $267 million associated with OneCoin pyramid scheme. In a separate case, hackers demanded $1 million in XRP after stealing bank's customer data.\nEarlier in January 2018, a hospital in Indiana, USA was hacked , with an unspecified ransom amount demanded in Bitcoin. Another ransom surfaced on May 25, this time a South African teen was kidnapped and the kidnappers demanded $120,000 in bitcoins.\nThe pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies makes them a hot target of hackers and criminals since cryptocurrencies are less likely to be detected than bank transfers or cash deals. Hackers who hacked Coincheck were able to launder over $500 million worth of NEM tokens on the deep web without anyone getting arrested.\nThese incidents are among a growing list of reasons for the increasing push by governments around the world to regulate bitcoin exchanges and mandate KYC frameworks for cryptocurrency trading platforms.\nThe post Ticketfly Hack Saga Continues: Status of Bitcoin Ransom Remains Unknown appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael stenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ticketfly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ticketfly possibility of compromised client information starting", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T20:39:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2beb7d8035c53838eec354d6879ebfbf4246100e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.stjg4YAvlsCz4YKwCMccrzI1.mjC7aaVptthV8Y3Eapm1H.Tvt4vfKNXvTn16uOPyw--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "You can now accept Bitcoin on Twitch!", "title_full": "You can now accept Bitcoin on Twitch!", "published": "2018-06-04T20:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2beb7d8035c53838eec354d6879ebfbf4246100e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.stjg4YAvlsCz4YKwCMccrzI1.mjC7aaVptthV8Y3Eapm1H.Tvt4vfKNXvTn16uOPyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-04T20:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "You can now accept Bitcoin on Twitch!", "text": "You can now accept Bitcoin on Twitch!\n/u/Lavaborama\nsubmitted by /u/Lavaborama\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T20:36:44.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37597af3cdb055c4353591b9a280b53da92ca7cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS4wjRtdxs5CY4iK2ihh_T4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "title_full": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "published": "2018-06-04T20:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37597af3cdb055c4353591b9a280b53da92ca7cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS4wjRtdxs5CY4iK2ihh_T4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cotton Candy", "published": "2018-06-04T20:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "text": "Quote: from: Jet Cash on December 28, 2017, 12:57:43 PM We are entering an era of multiple digital currencies, and many of them will survive.

June 4, 2018 — 1:23 PM EDT\nShares of Square Inc. ( SQ ) are surging and show no signs of slowing down amid the cryptocurrency craze and optimism over the company’s latest acquisition. Having announced last November that users were able to buy and sell bitcoin using its mobile app and more recently announcing plans to acquire e-commerce platform Weebly, shares of the mobile payment solution provider have reached new highs, according to Bloomberg. Reaching New Highs\nSquare, co-founded by Twitter Inc. ( TWTR ) co-founder and current CEO Jack Dorsey, allows users to transfer cash among themselves via its Cash App and helps small businesses to process credit card transactions, track sales and inventory data and even obtain financing. As of late last year, the company now allows users to buy and sell bitcoin, and with the announcement in late April that it will acquire Weebly, Square will be even more well equipped to serve creative entrepreneurs and small business owners. (See also: What is Square Inc.? ).\nOver the past year, shares of the payment solutions provider have climbed nearly 160%, bringing its total market cap to $21.7 billion. Since the start of 2018, shares are up as much as 73% as of 11 a.m, EST Monday. If RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin’s prediction that Square’s gross payment volume could comprise 4.1% of total U.S. payments volume in 2026, then there is still plenty of upside left. Driving Forces\nDorsey was quoted in Bloomberg as saying earlier last month that “the internet deserves a native currency,” indicating his support for cryptocurrencies and hinting that Square will continue to improve its compatibility with the virtual currencies, which have exploded over the past year. If the crypto market continues to expand, Square’s early entrance will help propel its value over the long term. (See also: Square to Soar on Crypto Potential, Say Bulls ).\nBy acquiring Weebly, a company that allows entrepreneurs to create websites on which to launch their business ideas, Square immediately benefits from gaining additional revenue. But that’s not all. The company is also demonstrating that it aims to help small businesses with more than just payment solutions. Square could become the one-stop shop for setting up an online store, providing both the platform for building a website and the infrastructure for accepting payments and keeping track of sales, expenses and inventories.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-31/square-adds-8-billion-in-value-with-help-from-m-a-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matthew johnston", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twtr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new highs square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T21:16:37.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53633806909e05c7e88c91216e5da6cfaea24bec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_3gMkC7nSPIXZaK6bu0kipVbhjob5wd5KZX8XHKj0r8qBt5oqCNtRVSlHHJoJU.wGwBHFxYXBMrCEvrfpDpjB1odK_OEwOzkkv8w8m8SQLXphoQC0H44A8FhCgKBNRY_DEN01GMxDTaPRT0csu.xIt", "site_full": "www.asit.com.es", "site": "asit.com.es", "site_section": "http://www.asit.com.es/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News As It Comes!", "title": "Bitcoin price latest: Why is Bitcoin falling?

Despite Bitcoin’s popularity, very few of us, myself included, understand the inner workings of an actual Bitcoin transaction and how this growing public ledger is maintained.\nBut wait, I work for MapD – the most powerful visual analytics engine on the planet – and extremely large data sets are perfect fodder for MapD. So, I ingested the raw Bitcoin transactions into the MapD Core analytics database, along with other publicly available market data. Now, we can explore the correlations between the different datasets and visualize them in MapD Immerse visual analytics.\nLater in this blog, I show how with a few clicks I was able to visually drill down into the transactions during the wild ride of late 2017 through early 2018, where I find all the million dollar transactions that involve the top 100 popular bitcoin addresses. Steps\nIn this post, I detail the following steps: Source the raw data from Google BiqQuery and copy it to a bucket in Google Cloud Platform Source related market data from Quandl, a marketplace for financial, economic and alternative data, and download it locally Give MapD Server access to the cloud bucket using gsutil Using a Python application, merge the Bitcoin transaction data with other pertinent data and ingest the data into MapD Core Use MapD Immerse to chart and explore the data together Bitcoin Data on BigQuery\nThere are many ways to download Bitcoin blockchain to examine the transactions. You can set up one of these Bitcoin clients which will download the entire blockchain, and you can extract the individual transactions from that. Setting up a Bitcoin client is resource intensive from a bandwidth, storage and computing perspective. So I used Google’s BigQuery , which I find to be the easiest way to get all of the Bitcoin transactions with the least amount of setup time. Of course, you need an account on Google and access to Google Cloud Platform . Bitcoin blockchain transaction data is now available on BigQuery’s bigquery-public-data:bitcoin_blockchain dataset and is updated every 10 minutes.\nBefore we query and export the data from BigQuery, you need to create a Bucket on Google Cloud Platform Storage to store all the transaction objects. Go to Google Cloud Platform dashboard and select Storage .\nOn the Storage dashboard, select CREATE BUCKET and give a unique name to the bucket.\nMake sure that the newly created bucket appears on the bucket list on the storage browser page. Now you are ready to use this bucket to download the Bitcoin transactions.\nGo back to Google BigQuery and select bigquery-public-data -> bitcoin_blockchain -> transactions.\nUse the Export Table option to export all the bitcoin transactions to the newly created cloud storage bucket. Notice that we have selected the export format to be JSON and enabled compression.\nClick on Job History to monitor the progress of the export task. The task will run for couple of minutes and report success with a green check mark (see below).\nYou should also click on the bucket under the Storage Browser and see thousands of objects which are gzipped Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin Data on QUANDL\nThe Bitcoin blockchain transaction information you downloaded from BigQuery contains details on each transaction like the date, the amount of Bitcoin value that is transferred from one Bitcoin address to another, block information, etc. You will find detailed information about all the fields that comprise a transaction under Table Details: transactions -> Schema .\nThis raw data from each transaction on its own is not very interesting if you are not mining or validating the transaction. If we combine this raw transactional information with market data on Bitcoin then we can see interesting patterns and highlight trends on this fascinating financial instrument.\nQuandl is a platform for financial, economic and alternative data that serves investment professionals. Quandl sources data on Bitcoin Blockchain and updates on various interesting Bitcoin related metrics on a daily basis. The data can be downloaded as a CSV file for each individual metric. You can select whatever metrics interest you; I downloaded the following metrics: BCHAIN/MKPRU Bitcoin Market Price in US Dollar BCHAIN/ETRVU Bitcoin Estimated Transaction Volume in US Dollar BCHAIN/TRFUS Bitcoin value of transaction fees miners earn per day in US Dollar BCHAIN/NTRAT Total Number of Unique Transactions per day BCHAIN/NADDU Number of unique Bitcoin addresses used per day BCHAIN/NTREP Number of Transactions Excluding Popular Addresses BCHAIN/DIFF Bitcoin Difficulty\nEach of these metrics is updated daily and can be downloaded as a CSV file, which has two fields – date and metric value. I joined these CSV files into a single CSV file (btc_quandl.csv) using the date field as a key. I also downloaded the 100 most popular Bitcoin addresses into the CSV file popular_btc_addresses.csv. gsutil – Accessing Google Cloud Storage\ngsutilis a tool that enables you to access Google Cloud Storage from the command-line. gsutil is part of the Google Cloud SDK, but I cover the standalone installation of gsutil because it’s the only tool required to access the cloud storage. For detailed instructions on installing Google Cloud SDK/gsutil, please refer to the website Install gsutil .\nUse gsutil to access the Bitcoin transaction data that you downloaded to your Cloud Storage bucket. Install gsutil on the MapD server if you have shell access so that the data can be ingested directly from Cloud Storage into MapD table after preprocessing without involving any intermediary server. If you don’t have shell access, gsutil and the preprocessing scripts can be installed on any Linux server for staging the data before uploading it to MapD. Download gsutil as gsutil.tar.gz Extract the files into your home directory tar xfz gsutil.tar.gz -C $HOME You will notice that a gsutil directory is created which contains the tool and associated files. Add gsutil to your PATH environment variable export PATH=${PATH}:$HOME/gsutil To authenticate gsutil to have access to your cloud storage, type gsutil config You will be prompted with a URL for the authorization page where you can authorize gsutil to access Cloud Storage. The gsutil dialog looks similar to the following: Copy and paste the URL into a browser window. If prompted, sign in with the Google account associated with your Cloud Storage data in the browser window. Click the Allow Access button. This authorizes gsutil to access Cloud Storage. Copy the authorization code that appears on the next page into the gsutil prompt and press Enter. After you provide an authorization code, gsutil prints the following: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform Console to find a project ID. Find the ID by clicking Manage all projects found in the drop-down in the upper right and enter it at the gsutil prompt. Confirm that you can now access your cloud storage by typing: gsutil ls Workflow for ingesting Bitcoin transactions into MapD\nThe list below captures the workflow for transferring from Storage Cloud each object containing the Bitcoin transactions in compressed JSON format to a CSV format that can be ingested into a MapD table. The application has been written in Python and you can download the code from its github repo .\nThe Python application performs the following steps for each object in the Storage Cloud bucket: Copy Object from Storage Cloud to chunk.json.gz Gunzip chunk.json.gz Execute btc_json2csv() to extract transactions from JSON format to CSV format Created btc_chunk.csv Read btc_chunk.csv and btc_quandl.csv (merged tables of all BTC metrics) into Pandas data frames Perform an inner merge on the two data frames using the transaction_date field Insert columns input_address_type & output_address_type Set the address type to either ordinary or popular based on whether the Bitcoin address in the transaction belong to the Top 100 popular Bitcoin address list (popular_btc_addresses.csv) Write out the data frame to a CSV file btc_chunk_final.csv Connect to MapD Create MapD table if it does not exist Using COPY FROM command load data into MapD table Close connection to MapD\nA MapD table is created with the following columns: Column Name", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.mapd.com/blog/bitcoin-transactions-from-bigquery-to-mapd"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T22:02:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f8c9d750dfe2953fef9465e2d266f12fbbb16a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUIxCc.OAX6uuEoweDaIdGM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "Selling Altcoins to Etherium or Bitcoin for trading", "title_full": "Selling Altcoins to Etherium or Bitcoin for trading", "published": "2018-06-04T20:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f8c9d750dfe2953fef9465e2d266f12fbbb16a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUIxCc.OAX6uuEoweDaIdGM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BlasterS", "published": "2018-06-04T20:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Selling Altcoins to Etherium or Bitcoin for trading", "text": "Of course selling bitcoin for trading than selling alternative coins to ethereum for trading\nbecause the company of bitcoin makes you literally profitable enough unlike to the others company they cant afford to compete what bitcoin have.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T20:18:09.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e471c2833adb4abeedb622b85259cf418910c31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0VzxeJZmns9lL1mrbJB.Gz8.4-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-04T20:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e471c2833adb4abeedb622b85259cf418910c31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0VzxeJZmns9lL1mrbJB.Gz8.4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-04T20:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 4, 2018 NEWS These signs show bitcoin may finally be bottoming, chart watcher says MarketWatch It's been slim pickings of late for owners of the No.1 digital currency, but coming off a subdued week, there are signals that more fruitful times may lie ...

In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero. ’\nOr, even more recently, economist and Yale professor Robert Schiller said to CNBC that bitcoin could be extinct in 100 years. As he said: ‘ Bitcoin won’t look anything like it is today. It will have a different name, if it exists. ’\nYep, bitcoin could very well not exist in 100 years…but, so what?\nThroughout history many currencies have gone bust. Some even in a relatively short period.\nIn fact, I have seen a few of them vanish in my lifetime.\nBack in the late 90s, the Argentinean austral for example, only survived six years.\nWhen the government first issued the austral, they issued notes for the values of one, five, 10 and 50.\nBut then, hyperinflation hit.\nIf you have ever lived through hyperinflation, you know it’s chaos. You could buy a bottle of water in the morning, and by the afternoon the price has changed.\nWorkers would receive their salaries at the beginning of the month and rush to the bank to exchange it for US dollars. That way they could hold its value until the end of the month to buy groceries, etc.\nSoon, the austral started adding zeros. It got so bad that the government created emergency provisional notes in the value of 500,000.\nYou were literally carrying millions in your wallet for everyday purchases, until they replaced it with the peso.\nAnother one was the Brazilian cruzeiro, which lasted only a few years.\nHigh inflation meant that it was then replaced by the cruzeiro real. This currency lasted a few months, until the current Brazilian real came into play.\nIn fact, a few years ago, a woman in Brazil found a suitcase full of money.\nThe suitcase was her grandfather’s and had savings he had accumulated over the years. Imagine her disappointment when she saw that it contained cruzeiros and other Brazilian currencies that weren’t in circulation anymore! Their value was pretty much zero.\nBut, currencies disappearing is not limited to third world countries.\nFrance…Germany…Greece…they have also had currencies disappear.\nThe fact is that in the long term, money tends to either vanish or lose its purchasing power because of money printing and inflation.\nThe US dollar has lost most of its value since 1913, as you can see in the graph below.\nSource: Nasdaq.com [Click to enlarge]\nAnytime a government starts the printing presses, a currency risks losing value and going bust.\nBitcoin, though, is deflationary. What I mean is that, contrary to fiat money, the value of bitcoin should — in theory — rise over time.\nWhy?\nBecause there will only be a limited number of bitcoins in circulation. 21 million to be exact…well, even less because of people losing their passkeys.\nBitcoin is a decentralised currency, which means that no one centralised entity controls it.\nThe thing is, the fact that it is decentralized is why many are arguing that it could disappear. That is, there is no central authority issuing it and forcing you to use it or pay taxes. The argument is that bitcoin could disappear because people don’t use it, but instead are buying it to store it.\nBut, in my opinion, that’s what makes it more attractive.\nBitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym, nobody knows who the real creator is) as a response to the 2007 crisis.\nHow do we know? Well, because there was a bit of text written on the genesis block, which is the first block — block 0 — of the chain. It said: ‘ The Times, 03/Jan/09, Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks. ’\nThis was the headline of The Times on the day the genesis block was created. It is most likely there as a time stamp…and to remark on the instability created by central banks.\nBitcoin is a currency so far untouched by central bankers…and it can be accessed and transported to anywhere in the world.\nAnd, when there is turbulence in the markets, some are starting to flock to it.\nI mean, we saw this back in 2013. We are currently seeing it with Venezuela. And, we saw it once again this week, as Italy headed into trouble.\nWhile the US markets plummeted, bitcoin gained about 5%.

Bitcoin is the most widely recognized form of virtual currency, also commonly referred to as digital, electronic or crypto currency.\nWhile most smaller businesses aren’t yet accepting bitcoin or other virtual currency payments from their customers, some larger businesses are. And the trend may trickle down to smaller businesses. Businesses also can pay employees or independent contractors with virtual currency. But what are the tax consequences of these transactions?\nBitcoin 101\nBitcoin has an equivalent value in real currency and can be digitally traded between users. It also can be purchased with real currencies or exchanged for real currencies. Bitcoin is most commonly obtained through virtual currency ATMs or online exchanges.\nGoods or services can be paid for using “bitcoin wallet” software. When a purchase is made, the software digitally posts the transaction to a global public ledger. This prevents the same unit of virtual currency from being used multiple times.\nTax impact\nQuestions about the tax impact of virtual currency abound. And the IRS has yet to offer much guidance.\nThe IRS did establish in a 2014 ruling that bitcoin and other convertible virtual currency should be treated as property, not currency, for federal income tax purposes. This means that businesses accepting bitcoin payments for goods and services must report gross income based on the fair market value of the virtual currency when it was received, measured in equivalent U.S. dollars.\nWhen a business uses virtual currency to pay wages, the wages are taxable to the employees to the extent any other wage payment would be. You must, for example, report such wages on your employees’ W-2 forms. And they’re subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes, based on the fair market value of the virtual currency on the date received by the employee.\nWhen a business uses virtual currency to pay independent contractors or other service providers, those payments are also taxable to the recipient. The self-employment tax rules generally apply, based on the fair market value of the virtual currency on the date received. Payers generally must issue 1099-MISC forms to recipients.\nFinally, payments made with virtual currency are subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.\nDeciding whether to go virtual\nAccepting bitcoin can be beneficial because it may avoid transaction fees charged by credit card companies and online payment providers (such as PayPal) and attract customers who want to use virtual currency. But the IRS is targeting virtual currency transactions in an effort to raise tax revenue, and it hasn’t issued much guidance on the tax treatment or reporting requirements. So bitcoin can also be a bit risky from a tax perspective.\nThe other issue of concern is the repaid fluctuation in value. If the amount of Bitcoin received has the value of $100 on the day received, and only $90 on the day it is disposed of, the business has income of $100 even though it has $90 in assets. There may be some tricky accounting and tax questions for the treatment of gain or loss.\nTo learn more about tax considerations when deciding whether your business should accept bitcoin or other virtual currencies — or use them to pay employees, independent contractors or other service providers — contact me at (856) 665-2121. see: http://www.TaxEsq.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T19:56:37.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d0c5064f2253b22d083da2aa81259eafe437b7d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa970ArTMug75qp453WFd1vjtqoQOWz8rheumf8eF0MQ7cF0VHc_rZEWwJKO0YpHdbFUtUCptJt7KyN73LZq8m6TmitU87yVd37Dfro.6Rxd5t49bDYsbE9d", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "‘Bitcoin Batmobile’: Argentinian Nonprofits Launch Minivan Tour to Spread Crypto Awareness", "title_full": "‘Bitcoin Batmobile’: Argentinian Nonprofits Launch Minivan Tour to Spread Crypto Awareness", "published": "2018-06-04T19:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy82NWUwZDRhZGE3ZjdhZDNjZGQwODU2YjYwMzI5NjQ2Mi5qcGc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d0c5064f2253b22d083da2aa81259eafe437b7d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa970ArTMug75qp453WFd1vjtqoQOWz8rheumf8eF0MQ7cF0VHc_rZEWwJKO0YpHdbFUtUCptJt7KyN73LZq8m6TmitU87yVd37Dfro.6Rxd5t49bDYsbE9d", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cointelegraph", "published": "2018-06-04T19:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘Bitcoin Batmobile’: Argentinian Nonprofits Launch Minivan Tour to Spread Crypto Awareness", "text": "‘Bitcoin Batmobile’: Argentinian Nonprofits Launch Minivan Tour to Spread Crypto Awareness June 4, 2018 201 Argentinian non-profit organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana have just launched a cryptocurrency awareness campaign “Bitcoineta,” local news outlet Infobae reports Monday, June 4.\nThe campaign’s name is an abbreviation from “Bitcoin” and “camioneta,” the Spanish word for minivan.\nIt consists of a Bitcoin-branded van, jointly purchased by the two participating organizations, that will go around Argentinian – and eventually Latin American – towns to spread basic knowledge about cryptocurrencies among local communities.\nThe idea behind Bitcoineta is to reach each village and town in the country to “show people how they can take advantage” of cryptocurrencies, the founder of the project Gabriel Kurman said.\nThe van is equipped with all the necessities to travel all over the country and, in the long term, all over Latin America. In addition to all the other tools, it has a projector to demonstrate crypto-related movies and presentations.\nBitcoineta’s first destination was Chascomus, a rural place some 120 kilometers away from Buenos Aires. The van arrived there on June 1 to give a short lecture on blockchain and cryptocurrencies for the locals. Nos fuimos de #Chascomus !

However, today is a different story. The price action today is more bearish. The price moved below a trend line and back below the 100 hour MA (blue line in the chart above) currently at $7582.97. That MA is now risk for the sellers/a level to get back above for the buyers. Failure to do so, keeps the sellers more in control On the downside now, the pair is testing the 200 hour MA (green line) at 7461.31. We currently trade at $7485. Trade and stay below would give the sellers more confidence and should lead to more selling from the longs on disappointment on the follow through buying today. Looking at the daily chart below, the price action - relatively - has been contained over the last 14 or so days both from an daily basis and over that period (see red box on the daily chart below). The trend line connecting lows (see red circles) comes in at $7149 and the low over the May and into June reached $7058.

Mr Wozniak was responding to comments made by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey earlier this year, who claimed that bitcoin would become the world's single currency within 10 years. \"I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,\" Mr Wozniak told CNBC . \"Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there's a way it's distributed... and it's pure and there's no human running, there's no company running and it's just... growing and growing.\" The decentralized nature of bitcoin meant that it is \"natural,\" Mr Wozniak added, saying: \"Nature is more important than all our human conventions.\" It is not the first time that Mr Wozniak has spoken publicly about the merits of bitcoin, having previously heralded the cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology as better than gold and the US dollar. Mr Wozniak first became interested in bitcoin a few years ago and bought some when they were worth around 10 per cent of what they are today. He has since sold all but one of the bitcoins, saying that he did not want to become: \"One of those people that watches it, watches it and cares about the number.\" At a conference in Las Vegas last October, Mr Wozniak said that traditional currencies were \"kind of phoney,\" due to the fact measures like quantitative easing could artificially inflate the money supply. The major drawback of gold, he said, was that there was no fixed supply. \"There is a certain amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,\" Mr Wozniak said at the Money 20/20 event. \"Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there's a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.\" His comments come in contrast to other influential figures, such as Warren Buffett, who claims that bitcoin represented a gamble, not an investment. The so-called 'Oracle of Omaha' said in May that bitcoin was \"probably rat poison squared.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Appealing a September 2017 ruling that deemed such confiscation to be illegal, the Supreme Court will see $2.3 million worth of BTC confiscated from a 33-year old surnamed Ahn — the proprietor of a child pornography website.\nConvicted in September 2017, Ahn and his Bitcoin cache have been the cause for months of debate — prosecutors failed to confiscate 216 BTC from Ahn in April 2018. Exempting Bitcoin from such action, a lower court dismissed the confiscation on the basis BTC had no physical form.\nThe Supreme Court, however, sees things differently. Citing Korean law, the nation’s top court dismissed the ‘intangibility’ argument explaining: “Korean law stipulates that a seizable hidden asset ranges from cash, deposits, stocks, and other forms of tangible and intangible objects holding standard value.” The move marks the first expropriation of cryptocurrency in the East Asian nation — further highlighting their recognition of the asset’s “measurable value.” The Supreme Court stated: “Bitcoin is intangible and comes in the form of digitized files, but it is traded on an exchange and can be used to buy goods.\nTherefore, receiving bitcoins is an act of taking profits.” Despite describing the Bitcoins as the “proceeds of crime,” the high court did not order all of Anh’s holdings to be stripped (191 of 216 BTC) — having forensically identified the exact number of Bitcoin units paid for pornography. Where the more anarchical users of cryptocurrency may see the ruling as a blow, many will invariably welcome legal clarity — the asset class distancing itself from such nefarious usages.\nWeeks after moving to allow domestic ICOs, South Korea may now be positioning itself as a regulatory leader in an economy filled with question marks. If only skin-deep, the ruling may be seen as a triumphant win for Bitcoin enthusiasts — who have witnessed a legal declaration of the coin’s economic value.

cryptocurrency was trading on Monday, according to data from CoinDesk.\nHe recently sold all but one bitcoin , saying that he only wanted to experiment with the technology and not be an investor. \"The Woz,\" as he is often affectionately referred to, also owns two ether, the cryptocurrency associated with the Ethereum blockchain platform.\nWhile Wozniak said that he may not necessarily believe what Dorsey predicted, he still called bitcoin \"pure.\"\n\"Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there's a way it's distributed… and it's pure and there's no human running, there's no company running and it's just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions,\" he told CNBC.\nThe cryptocurrency is not actually issued by a central authority, unlike traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Instead, there is a complex mathematical and cryptographic underpinning to the blockchain, the technology that underlies bitcoin. The bitcoin network is maintained by a number of players and that is why it is often referred to as decentralized. show chapters 9:08 AM ET Mon, 4 June 2018 | 04:44\nWozniak founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976 and was behind the launch of the company's first personal computers. He spoke to CNBC at an event at the Money 20/20 conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands, hosted by Feedzai.\nThere are now over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, but Wozniak said that bitcoin is the only one that remains \"pure\" because others have had to give up some of the aspects that makes bitcoin what it is, such as decentralization.\n\"Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that.

top companies around the world. And the ones who said that Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency would not last for long are taking back their words. The reactions are owing to the rapid increase in the number of bitcoin users and also the bitcoin share value.\nThe way we look at digital currency is now changing, and it is just getting better and better since the inception of cryptocurrency.

Whereas in India, Reserve Bank of India(RBI) has banned all the cryptocurrencies and is coming up with its digital currency.\nSo what exactly is a Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is a digital currency which works without any intermediary in short Bitcoin is a decentralized currency with no involvement of central banks. Bitcoin is a peer to peer transaction wherein the payment is made directly to the party without going through a financial institution.\nBitcoin was invented by an anonymous group or a person with the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin is the first in the line-up of cryptocurrencies; nodes verify these transactions with the help of cryptography and then recorded in a Blockchain.\nFor those looking to setup a bitcoin exchange, I have a found a cryptocurrency exchange script which will help you in setting up a bitcoin exchange in a jiffy.

A lot of your exchange service will depend on the location from where you start the exchange business and what kind of people are living in the community. Knowing about the location makes it easier for you when you are researching about the norms about the region.\nIt gets even much easier when you reach out to the public and ask them on what kind of exchange they want to see. I mentioned earlier about the certain legalities where every country has a different set of rules.\nAlso read, BharatCoin: Taking the place of cash in the economy\nThere is one such bitcoin exchange software that can help you setup your bitcoin exchange business without involving any third party.

This kind of swap heavily relies on the SCRIPT language.\nOff-Chain Atomic Swap: This one is a new one with the aim to achieve safe and reliable swap between two parties. Unlike the On-Chain Atomic swap, this one uses Hash Time Locked Contracts(HTLC).\nHTLC helps in tracking whether the conditions mentioned in the contract are in force if not then everything gets back to where it was.\nAlso read, BITCOIN PRICE – LATEST UPDATES: CRYPTOCURRENCY VALUE PASSES $9,000\nSecurity, BitExchange.systems seem to nail it when comes to security and what it calls “37-Fort Knox” kind of protection.

Country’s Redundant Crypto Laws\nAs per as a report by state-owned Global Times , considerate Chinese cryptocurrency regulations are much needed, as they make “more sense” than outright banning the cryptographic form of money. Sponsored Links\nThe world’s second-largest economy placed a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies in September 2017, igniting a massive sell-off in the cryptocurrency market presumably from Chinese investors. However, it is increasingly believed that a fundamental approach towards the technology will be the ultimate solution, eliminating the fear of putting the existing financial system in jeopardy.\nAs stated in the report, unconfirmed rumors started circulating in China after several central bank executives visited the former offices of Huobi, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency exchange by traded volume, in an effort to learn about the technology and possibly relaunch cryptocurrency businesses. However, Huobi’s CFO Zhu Jiawei dismissed the rumors shortly after.\nWhile China is shunning businesses related to cryptocurrencies, it is creating an optimal environment for blockchain development, setting up a $1.6 billion “blockchain park” in the city of Hangzhou with the purpose of incubating blockchain projects and startups. Hangzhou, China. The city is home to a $1.6 billion blockchain park ( Source : Hutong School)\nThe country undeniably embraces technology, and while cryptocurrencies are an innovative method of peer-to-peer payments, the asset class displays a wildly volatile nature, leading many to label it a “bubble.” From this perspective, it made good sense at the time to clamp down on cryptocurrencies in the country, to ensure the country’s economic stability.\nHowever, Global Times stated that China could be left behind in the “digital currency revolution,” as countries around the world swiftly introduce regulations and reforms on digital assets and related businesses. The report concluded:\n“It’s time for China to lay the regulatory groundwork for its rise as a future digital currency trendsetter.” China’s Blockchain Push\nSpeaking at the 19th edition of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ annual conference on May 28, 2018, President Xi said that breakthroughs like blockchain are “constantly coming,” and China remains fully committed to exploring state-run blockchain projects.\nInterestingly, the Eastern superpower is reportedly developing and unveiling “National Blockchain Standards” in 2019. Previously in May 2018, China also issued its own ranking of cryptocurrencies, placing smart-contract framework Ethereum at rank one and the pioneer cryptocurrency bitcoin at 13.\nDespite openly shunning cryptocurrencies, It must be noted that China is home to the world’s largest bitcoin mining organization, Bitmain, and also owns the highest number of blockchain patents. Xi’s speech explained:\n“If China is to flourish and rejuvenate, it must vigorously develop science and technology and strive to become the world’s major scientific center and innovative highland.”\nEvery new blockchain and cryptocurrency development in China begs the question: what is the country’s ulterior motive with the technology?

Although BTC remains well below its 50 (blue line) and 200 (red line) day moving averages, the short-term action is somewhat encouraging.\nWhile the inverted H&S formation requires further work, both investors/traders may want to utilize the following levels as a guide in order to garner further clues/evidence with respect to direction.\nIf, at any point in the days ahead, BTC can go top-side of the 7730 figure and ‘stick’ and perhaps more importantly, clear the 8020 level, such development/s, should they materialize, would certainly be a welcome relief and begin to repair some of the recent technical damage despite still trading below both its 50 and 200DMA’s.\nOn the flip-side, if BTC is unable to overcome the 7730 level and ‘stick’ and subsequently ‘takes-out’ the 7260 level at any time in the days/weeks ahead, such would likely suggest that the potential inverted H&S formation would once again be a failure and would also more than likely precipitate additional selling pressure.\nThus, while the recent short-term action is encouraging as well as providing some much-needed relief, further work remains before we can declare that BTC is out of the woods and in the clear.\nMoving on to Ethereum (ETH) , we can see from the Chart below that, much like BTC , Ethereum is also forming a potential mini inverted H&S formation and attempting to move up-and-out.\nWhile Ethereum also finds itself trading below both its 50 and 200DMA’s, representing a poor technical posture as we can observe above, ETH is not nearly as far beneath its moving averages as that of BTC .\nMoving forward, if, at any time in the days ahead, ETH is capable of clearing the hurdle located at the 650 level and can ‘stick’, which coincidentally is where we find the 50-day moving average, such development, should it occur, would certainly be a positive development. On the other side of the ledger, should ETH breach the 538 figure, such occurrence would likely render the inverted H&S formation null-and-void.\nLooking at the Chart of Litecoin (LTC) below, much like both BTC as well as ETH , Litecoin finds itself in a similar position attempting to move up-and-out of its mini potential inverted H&S formation as well as trading well below both its 50 and 200-day moving averages.\nWhen viewing the action of LTC above, it’s apparent that it finds itself in a similar technical posture as that of both BTC and ETH .\nThus, moving forward, both investors/traders may want to monitor the following levels for additional clues/evidence with regards to direction.\nIf, at any point in the days ahead, LTC is capable of going top-side of the 129.30 level and perhaps more importantly, the 141 figure, such development, should it occur, would surely be a positive step for LTC . Whereas, if LTC should happen to breach the 114.25 level at any time in the days ahead, such development, should it occur, would suggest that its potential inverted H&S formation would be a failure.\nLast, but certainly not least, we take a look at Bitcoin Cash below, as BCH may just find itself in a better position presently than the aforementioned above.\nAs we can observe from the action above, BCH , like BTC ; ETH and LTC also find itself in the process of forming its very own potential inverted H&S formation.\nHowever, unlike BTC; ETH as well as LTC , which have yet to clear their respective initial hurdles and ‘stick’– thus far, BCH has indeed cleared and is holding its initial hurdle located at the 1153 level.\nMoving forward, if BCH can continue to hold the 1153 figure and perhaps of more importance, can clear its 50DMA, presently located at the 1244 level, such would certainly go a long way in repairing some of the short-term technical damage that has been inflicted over the past several weeks. On the flip-side of the coin, should BCH lose the 941 level at any point in the days ahead, such would more than likely suggest that lower prices are in the offing.\nThus, of the four names we’ve focused on in this report, BCH presently finds itself leading the way, while BTC ; ETH as well as LTC have further work in order to complete their potential inverted head-and-shoulders formations.\nWhile the present overall climate finds itself reaping some welcome short-term relief in the absence of storm clouds, as we have suspected, further work remains before we can declare the coast is clear.\nHappy Trading!!\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

This makes sense, because these types of accounts have a lot of different benefits. However, it is a self directed type of investment account, which does mean you need to know a little bit of what you are doing to truly benefit from it.\nIn 2014, the Inland Revenue service determined that a digital currency should be seen as a form of personal property in terms of tax purposes. What this means is that a digital currency can be held in a Roth IRA. Additionally, because it is a self directed retirement fund, you take responsibility for the Investment choices you make. Hence, the IRA gives you the necessary legal authority to invest in a huge variety of assets. In fact, the IRS does not mandate what you can invest in, only what you cannot invest in, which is life insurance and collectables.\nYou have a number of options in terms of building your IRA, in particular in terms of the choices you can make. This includes: The type of IRA you prefer. There are a number of different retirement accounts that you can choose from, including the Roth IRA but also the SIMPLE, the SET, and traditional IRA. The cryptocurrency assets that have been approved by the IRS. That includes Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash, but also Litecoin, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, an Ripple. The conventional asset you would like to add to your IRA. This includes things such as mutual funds, individual stocks, and so on. The alternative assets you would like to ask your IRA. This includes such things as tax liens, precious metals, raw land, commercial and residential real estate, and so on.\nBecause of the popularity of cryptocurrencies as of late, it is now also much easier to open a bitcoin Roth IRA. Do make sure that you choose a custodian that is dedicated to making the process as easy as possible for you, so that you can learn to invest with Confidence. They should ensure that your Investments are kept secure, that you learn to understand the asset options you have, that all paperwork is completed properly, that your rollover is arranged with ease, that you can get assistance with your distributions and contributions, in that you genuinely receive all the support you need.\nThere are also a number of things you should look for in terms of the security of your crypto currencies. For instance, a good account will ensure your credentials are kept on a personal hardware device that is not connected directly to the internet and thereby cannot be hacked. In fact, this device should be stored within a protected vault and the vault and its contents should be fully insured against mistakes, theft, fraud, and hacking. This way, you will know that your cryptocurrencies will always be fully protected, no matter how many you decide to hold.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "https://coinira.com/bitcoin-ira/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david montes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T00:43:06.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4459bf97efeddecdf3ae91683a940924216e3d6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcMWKJExBhrV4vSpSZnPSMVQBuB5hSJtj89WlYEgBO.VqMYQ__.A.IP.v0qfmlORnWVbKOEohuvdLQUvLJvv6Ii018raDktGumsmxUzHz0BRjA1y9sZNKg9kj4vbqv0Ho-", "site_full": "the-digital-reader.com", "site": "the-digital-reader.com", "site_section": "https://the-digital-reader.com", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Digital Reader", "title": "Authors, Don’t Be Taken in by the Blockchain/Bitcoin Hype", "title_full": "Authors, Don’t Be Taken in by the Blockchain/Bitcoin Hype", "published": "2018-06-04T18:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 55104, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4459bf97efeddecdf3ae91683a940924216e3d6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcMWKJExBhrV4vSpSZnPSMVQBuB5hSJtj89WlYEgBO.VqMYQ__.A.IP.v0qfmlORnWVbKOEohuvdLQUvLJvv6Ii018raDktGumsmxUzHz0BRjA1y9sZNKg9kj4vbqv0Ho-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nate Hoffelder", "published": "2018-06-04T18:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Authors, Don’t Be Taken in by the Blockchain/Bitcoin Hype", "text": "Authors, Don’t Be Taken in by the Blockchain/Bitcoin Hype Posted on 4 June, 2018 by Nate Hoffelder in DeBunking , Self-Pub // 5 Comments\nIf you have been following tech news then you've probably heard the term blockchain thrown about more than once. This word is rarely explained in non-technical terms, but it is thrown around a lot by tech companies trying to get in on the hype.\nWe've even seen a few companies like Binded or LBRY claim to offer services to authors, and a lot of people in publishing saying that blockchain is the greatest thing since sliced bread . So far, none of the new ideas from either the tech companies or publishing pundits are actually useful to authors, but one day that is going to change.\nWith that in mind, I think now is a good time to go over some basic guidelines on how to evaluate new tech and whether we should use a new tool or service based on that tech.\nI was inspired to take up this topic by the recent announcement about a new startup called Authored.\nFrom BEG :\nThe Authored Platform is an application, which is active on both the iOS and Android platforms. This platform will function like Google Books, Amazon Books, Apress, Wiley, and many other online publishing systems. However, Authored is also a social networking site, which will allow users to publish high-end content from writers and authors of products.\nAuthored is scheduled to open to the public in in the second quarter of 2019. Right now Authored is raising funds via an initial coin offering (ICO) which may or may not be a scam (I would not invest my money, even if I had any to spare).\nThe thing to remember about blockchain (this will help you avoid falling for the hype) is that it is a technology, not a service or product.\nTo put that in perspective, you are reading this blog post in an app or web browser that integrates hundreds of different technologies on a computing device that integrates thousands.\nThe app, browser, and computing devices are the products that use tech, most of which you have never heard of.\nThe only reason blockchain is mentioned more than all the other tech we use everyday is that it is the tech buzzword du jure .\nRather than listen to the buzzwords, what you should do is ask whether a tool or service based on blockchain is useful - just like you would with any other new service you encounter.\nI usually ask myself these questions: Does the service do something I need? Does it fill that need better than a service I am already using?\nWe still don't really know anything about Authored other than it is supposed to be a social network and sales platform, so there's no reason to think it will be better and more useful than Gumroad or a dozen other third-party sales services.\nI do know a few details about Binded and LBRY, the two services mentioned at the beginning of the post, so let's analyze those companies and see whether we should use them.\nI have written about Binded before ; it offers a blockchain-based alternative to \"poor man's copyright\" that does absolutely nothing useful while at the same time misleading creators about how it protects their copyright.\nLBRY , on the other hand, is a sales and distribution platform where the content is locked inside the LBRY apps. This is arguably less useful the many existing sales platforms, and at the very least it offers no obvious improvement over what we have now.\nIf we let ourselves be swayed by the hype then we might sign up for one or both of these services just because they use blockchain, but when we step back and ask the hard questions it is clear that there's nothing to recommend either service.\nThe next time you encounter a service that pitches itself on its use of blockchain, you should ask yourself the two questions I used in this post. These are actually the questions you should ask about every new service you encounter, but they will be especially useful in keeping you from falling for the blockchain hype.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wiley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon books", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google books", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lbry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T18:16:55.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "381d3d5237dc0be56f33fec3586b08807cde45b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNA.gF3kq7FmVpQTq3RznwFkysXLUmxVM81x9dOVIztwqXvyrX.aq_naKafdG9FUjbZaQsDyy1.rg", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "https://www.techradar.com/computing", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "Computing | TechRadar", "title": "Best Bitcoin wallets Android", "title_full": "Best Bitcoin wallets for Android in 2018 | TechRadar", "published": "2018-06-04T18:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hzZAVwcTkVQ3TZKBg932QQ-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "381d3d5237dc0be56f33fec3586b08807cde45b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNA.gF3kq7FmVpQTq3RznwFkysXLUmxVM81x9dOVIztwqXvyrX.aq_naKafdG9FUjbZaQsDyy1.rg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nate Drake", "published": "2018-06-04T18:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best Bitcoin wallets Android", "text": "Best Bitcoin wallets for Android in 2018 Best Bitcoin wallets for Android in 2018 Keep your cryptocurrency portable with these Android wallets Shares\nIf you're investing in Bitcoin , then it's essential you have the best Bitcoin wallet software, and in this guide we list the best Bitcoin wallet applications available for Android phones and devices, allowing you to take your cryptocurrencies with you on the move.\nWe've narrowed down out list of the best Bitcoin wallets for Android into five trustworthy apps, and we've selected the apps that are as simple to use as possible.\nHowever, if you do have a large amount of Bitcoins you may want to choose a wallet with more security features such as GreenBits . If you only have a small amount of Bitcoin and just want to test the water, you can get started immediately with apps like Bitcoin Wallet.\nBitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency on the market today. If you hold any other kind of virtual currency, or would like to exchange some of your coins, you may prefer a multi-currency wallet such as Coinomi.\nWhen picking a wallet that's right for you, whatever choice you make, we strongly suggest you stick to the ones available either in the Google Play store or the F-Droid repository, as these are less likely to contain malware.\nThe ultimate lightweight and portable Bitcoin wallet Excellent reputation Strong security features Occasional issues with QR scanner\nElectrum is well-known in the Bitcoin world as one of the most popular 'thin clients' for storing Bitcoins, and the Android app doesn't disappoint. After downloading, your wallet is generated using a 'seed' of 12 random words, which you must write down. If anything happens to your Android device, you can then use this seed to restore your wallet along with your BTC. Your 'private key' is not locked in to Electrum and you can export your BTC to another wallet if you wish.\nThe Electrum Bitcoin Wallet for Android takes security seriously: your seed and private keys never leave your device. During setup you're also asked to create a 6-digit PIN which is used to confirm payments. If you already use the desktop version of Electrum, you can even set up a 'watching only' wallet on your phone which lets you view your balance and receive BTC – but not send them.\nThe most recent version of Electrum Bitcoin Wallet comes bundled with its own QR scanner to easily capture wallet addresses and send payments. To receive BTC, just tap on the 'Receive' section to display a handy QR code for others to scan. This feature is only compatible with the ZXing QR Scanner. If you use another app to scan codes, be warned that this may cause compatibility issues.\nManage and exchange all your coins in one place Supports multiple cryptocurrencies Restore your coins easily with backup phrase Some users claim issues with exchanging coins\nCoinomi Wallet was originally created in 2015 and has since developed a solid reputation as a great wallet for storing not only Bitcoin but other cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, not to mention any amount of Ether tokens. During setup you can choose which coins to display in the handy 'overview' section which lists the current market price and value of each currency.\nLike Electrum, your wallet addresses are generated using a 'master seed' of 12 random words which never leaves your device. You can use this to restore your wallet balance for all of your coins should anything happen to your device. Coinomi offers the option to set a password during setup rather than a mandatory PIN as with Electrum. If you choose not to set a password, make sure your Android device has screen lock enabled and is encrypted. See our guide on encrypting your Android device\nCoinomi has integrated support for exchanging different coins using either of the services Shapeshift or Changelly for a small fee. User reviews have reported occasional issues with this whereby transactions don't confirm for some time, although this wasn't an issue during our own tests.\nAs of January 2018, Coinomi also no longer appears to be open source. This means that it's very difficult to know if there are any undisclosed security bugs or backdoors in the software.\nBenefit from a Swiss army knife of privacy features Highly acclaimed Compatible with hardware wallets No Segwit support\nMycelium is one of the most highly acclaimed Bitcoin wallets around. The website claims that Mycelium won the ‘Best Mobile App’ award from Blockchain.info in 2014, and that there's no wallet which has more stars from reviews on Google Play.\nMycelium is entirely open source, which means it's much easier to check for any software bugs, and also near-impossible for developers to include hidden backdoors to steal your BTC.\nThe interface is laid out in very simple fashion with buttons to send and receive BTC as well as scan in QR codes. Mycelium also has a built-in address book for making payments.\nThe settings section of Mycelium contains a massive arsenal of security features. First and foremost is the security PIN which you can set so that Mycelium requests it each time you make payments. The app also supports sweeping private keys from paper wallets, as well as 'cold storage' wallets which will only display your balance, and cannot be used to send BTC.\nAlthough there's no desktop equivalent of Mycelium, you can use it with hardware wallets like Trezor to digitally 'sign' transactions. This makes it much harder for anyone to steal your Bitcoins.\nAt the time of writing Mycelium doesn't support Segwit. You can read more info about what this is and why it matters here . However, this should not affect everyday transactions.\nSpend your Bitcoin quickly and securely Make instant payments Extremely secure Setup can take time\nGreenBits is a secure and open source Bitcoin wallet. It is truly cross-platform in that as well as being available for Android, there's also a GreenAddress Chrome extension allowing you to manage your BTC from any device running Google’s browser.\nIf a person or company supports the GreenBits wallet service, BTC can be sent without needing to wait for confirmation via the Blockchain (which can take hours or days), allowing for near-instant payments. Each payment also has a unique 'hash' preventing fraudsters from spending the same coins twice.\nDuring setup, a 24-word mnemonic is created which you can use to restore your BTC on another machine if anything happens to your Android device. The app also prompts you to set up payment confirmation via two-factor authentication.\nGreenBits is secured via a PIN which you create during setup. If you fail to enter the PIN correctly three times, your wallet's decryption key will be destroyed. After that, the only way to recover your BTC is by re-entering the 24-word mnemonic.\nThis makes for a very secure wallet, although the setup process might be a little intimidating for newer users who only hold a small amount of Bitcoin. The good news is that once you have secured your wallet, the interface is very easy to navigate. BTC can be sent by entering an address or scanning a QR code.\nOne of the simplest ways to get started with Bitcoin Quick and easy setup Simple interface Can’t manage fees or export private keys\nWith BTC transaction fees skyrocketing at present, users may also be concerned that there's no built-in feature to manage these either. Bitcoin Wallet simply informs you what the transaction fee will be.\nThe developer of the free and open source Bitcoin Wallet claims that its Android app is the oldest in existence, and that it's one of the easiest ways to get started with Bitcoin.\nUnlike other wallets which require you to set up a PIN or write down a seed, you can use Bitcoin Wallet immediately after installation. The interface couldn't be any clearer – simply click 'Send' or 'Receive' to manage your BTC. There's even a handy address book to keep track of your favorite payment destinations. Your current balance is displayed in mBtc (millibitcoin) by default, as well as your local fiat currency, but you can change this in the app’s settings.\nThis extra simplicity comes at the price of security, however: anyone with access to your device could open the app and steal your Bitcoins. Your private keys, which are used to send payments, are stored securely on your Android device, but there doesn't seem to be an easy way to recover your BTC if anything happens to the device itself.\nThe app does, however, support 'sweeping' of paper wallets – in other words, scanning the private key of a Bitcoin paper wallet to empty it and add the BTC balance to the wallet app.\nWatch the video below for a deep dive into Bitcoin and crypto-currencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://f-droid.org/", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.electrum.electrum", "https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/mobile/android/greenbits/", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinomi.wallet&hl=en_GB", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinomi.wallet&hl=en_GB%20", "https://trezor.io/", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.electrum.electrum%20", "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/greenaddress/dgbimgjoijjemhdamicmljbncacfndmp", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenaddress.greenbits_android_wallet", "https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/", "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin wallet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T00:08:03.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9be5abc301b609b946f38fa58115b8fa258f5553", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDAZSdbB3EIZdIsE2AWrZBF", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "bitcoin", "title_full": "/biz/ - bitcoin - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2018-06-04T18:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9be5abc301b609b946f38fa58115b8fa258f5553", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDAZSdbB3EIZdIsE2AWrZBF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2018-06-04T18:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin", "text": "is now the time to invest?

The asset fluctuates below and above the price of $7,500. In other words, it fluctuates between the levels of $7,613 and $7,303. However, if the asset traded above the price of $7,500 it would be resisted at $ 7,613. Similarly, if the asset traded below the price of $7,500, it would fall to the low of $7,303. Today, Bitcoin is currently trading at $7,697. 52 and has broken the resistance level attempting to reach the high of $8,000. However, from the 4- hour chart, the price of Bitcoin has broken the trend line and the candlestick closed on the opposite of the trend line. The implication of this movement is that the bearish pressure of the asset might have ended. However, the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average indicating that price of Bitcoin is rising. BTC/USD Short-term Trend: BullishOn the hourly chart, the price of Bitcoin is in a bullish market. Price of the asset fell to the low of $7,039. 41 and commenced a bullish movement. A trend line is drawn showing the support levels of price of the asset where traders can place their long trades.

Soon enough, Christian’s interest was piqued further when he learned that Brisbane International Airport, a five-hour drive from Agnes Water, had begun accepting cryptocurrencies at a number of retail storefronts.\nSelling the idea to local businesses wasn’t hard, he revealed. “We started from the ground up, shared it with a couple of businesses and they were straight on board … I guess they were international travellers themselves and had heard of these types of payments,” he told ABC News . “Initially we had a good 10 businesses that just said, ‘Fine — let’s go for it’.”\nLocal tourism operator Arty Cipak added :\n“If it’s going to take cryptocurrency to get tourists to town, then bring it on.”\nPresently, 31 local businesses including resorts, backpacking establishments, tour companies and eateries are now accepting cryptocurrency payments through a point-of-sale app developed by TravelbyBit, a Queensland-based crypto payments startup.\n“We’ve got merchants all over Australia but they’re very sporadic,” TravelbyBit CEO Caleb Yeoh said. “[Agnes Water and] the Town of 1770 has the highest concentration.”\nWhile it’s early days, Australia’s first ‘digital currency town’ could soon lure a nice group of international tourists to Agnes Water rather than mainstream destinations, according to the crypto executive.\n“The town has made a very strategic move in trying to appeal to a niche market to take perhaps some of those tourists … to come out to their little part of the woods,” he said.\nYeoh added:\n“If you travel around the world you have to deal with multiple currencies, the exchange rate can be confusing, sometimes you struggle to find ATMs, and sometimes you get swindled by money changers. Travelling with one global currency like Bitcoin … makes sense.””\nAgnes Water beach image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Australia’s First ‘Digital Currency Town’ Accepts Bitcoin to Boost Tourism
