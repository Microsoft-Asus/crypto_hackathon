Korea Investigation, Mt.Gox Sell-Off\nNew scrutiny of South Korea’s largest crypto exchange helped fuel a sell-off across markets Friday. Bitcoin prices fell to three-week lows of around $8,540 on May 11, as markets reacted to a flash investigation of South Korean exchange Upbit and a fresh Mt.Gox funds liquidation.\nData from Cointelegraph’s price tracker and Coin360 shows BTC/USD dipping sharply over the past 24 hours, with major altcoin assets posting considerably higher losses of up to 18 percent.\nTraders appeared to deliver a knee-jerk reaction to news that Upbit, Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange and a subsidiary of communications giant Kakao, had received a visit from the country’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).\nAccording to local media, authorities suspect Upbit had “deceived customers” by providing false information about its balance sheets.\nAt the same time, executives in charge of refunding users of former Japanese exchange Mt.Gox have evidently sold a new chunk of about 8,000 BTC (about $70 mln at press time) in four batches of 2,000 BTC. Such actions in the past had reportedly affected global prices several times since November.\nAs of press time Friday, Bitcoin had lost around $800, or 8.5 percent, in the past 24 hours, hitting the lowest price the coin has seen since April 20 .\nAcross altcoin markets, Ethereum (ETH) posted near 12 percent losses , while Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fared worse, both losing about 17 percent over the same period. Market visualization from Coin360\nWhile some local sources took to social media to suggest the price dip was an “overreaction” on the part of cryptocurrency holders, the episode is a test for Korean exchanges, which only recently returned to the listings of popular price tracker resource CoinMarketCap .\nPreviously, the major crypto price tracker had removed key South Korean exchanges from its price average computations over what it described as an “extreme divergence” between prices listed there and on exchanges in other countries.

Gox liquidation speculation\n[Photo: EivindPedersen /Pixabay] By Cale Guthrie Weissman 1 minute Read When it comes to blockchain prospects, it’s always a roller-coaster ride for investors. Bitcoin, whose price had remained over $9,000 for most of this month, once again dipped below $8,000 yesterday and today. In fact, the price recently hit a three-week low.\nOne potential reason for the drop may be Mt. Gox, the now-defunct crypto exchange, which is in the process of paying off its creditors. Some have speculated that its trustee sold a large chunk of the bitcoin it had in its coffers, according to Bloomberg . What’s more, South Korean authorities recently raided one of the country’s biggest exchanges, UPbit, which likely impacted bitcoin’s price.\nNevertheless, some are still bullish on the bitcoin market overall.

Gox trustee.\nAs CCN reported, the Seoul police along with the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KIU) and Financial Services Commission (FSC) have initiated an investigation into South Korea’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange UPbit with allegations of fraud and illicit movement of client funds to the accounts of the exchange’s executives.\nThe local police has yet to release its final report on the case and is expected to confirm its findings on Monday next week.\n“We have secured hard disks and accounting books through confiscation. Analysis is expected to take days,” the authorities said, adding that the final report on the UPbit case will be released next week,” said local financial authorities.\nThe sell off of cryptocurrencies by South Korean traders on UPbit along with the possible sale of 8,000 bitcoins by the Mt. Gox trustee led bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market to fall.\nThe Mt. Gox trustee previously stated that it is not in its plans to sell off parts of its 200,000 bitcoin holdings until late September. But, it moved more than 8,000 bitcoins to external wallets, triggering a domino effect across major cryptocurrency exchanges.\nMarket Turns Red The entire market has fallen on May 11, without any exception. Even tokens such as ICON (ICX), Ontology (ONT), EOS, OmiseGo (OMG), and Ziliqa (ZIL), which have recorded massive gains against both bitcoin and the US dollar over the past two weeks, have recorded large losses in the range of 5 percent to 20 percent.\nGifto (GTO), STORM, Dent, Status (SNT), and other tokens which recorded 30 to 50 percent gains over the past month fell by more than 20 percent.\nAs shown in the graphic provided by Coin360, the entire market has demonstrated significant losses over the past 24 hours.\nRan Neuner, the producer of CNBC’s CryptoTrader, who has offered extensive coverage of the South Korean cryptocurrency market this week, stated that local investors believe traders on UPbit sold their cryptocurrencies on the platform with the intention of moving them to other platforms or cryptocurrency exchange.

Ironically, the dip came just as crypto bulls have been outdoing each other in setting outsized bitcoin price targets for both the short-term and the long run.\nThe price of one bitcoin hovered at $8,565 as of this writing, down 5.29 percent from 24 hours earlier, according to WorldCoinIndex (see chart below).

An official at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office did not provide the reason behind the raid, Bloomberg reported.\n“Upbit is currently under investigation by prosecutors and is cooperating,” the exchange said in a note to clients. South Korea is a huge cryptocurrency market, and Upbit traded $1.6 billion in virtual currencies during the past 24 hours.

And that’s exactly what happened.\nDespite bitcoin’s erratic price fluctuations and increasingly vocal opponents, Tom Lee is among a steady group of crypto bulls who believe digital currencies are here to stay.

The report shows that Bitcoin as a virtual currency is markedly different from e-money and cautions regulators and policy makers not to confuse the two.\nThere are few similarities between Bitcoin and e-money other than both being in digital format, according to the report. While e-money is a mechanism for interacting with government-issued and regulated currencies such as dollars and euros, Bitcoin is a virtual currency that has no fiat currency counterpart. Bitcoin is based on a decentralized peer-to-peer network that can be transferred somewhat anonymously and can be highly volatile in terms of value. These characteristics of Bitcoin, while having some potential benefits, can pose considerable risks to consumers and make it a challenge for regulators. bitcoinvsemoney.jpg\nOn the other hand, e-money is digitally issued against equal value of fiat currency, and it can be centrally regulated, usually by a central bank. The report also points out that, unlike Bitcoin, there is growing evidence that e-money schemes have helped bring people into the formal financial system, especially in developing countries through mobile phone technology.\n“The current reality is that Bitcoin is still a long way off from reaching the unbanked,” notes Sarah Rotman , Financial Sector Specialist at CGAP and author of the report. “While we shouldn’t completely rule out Bitcoin’s future potential in this market, it’s very difficult to predict where Bitcoin will be in five years and if it can have any impact for the poor.”\nWith the current widespread attention surrounding Bitcoin, the report warns that regulatory concerns about the virtual currency could spill over to e-money and cause previously favorable regulatory progress to be retracted. It concludes that for e-money to continue to open access to the formal financial system for the world’s unbanked, continuing with proportional regulation is essential.\nFor more information:\nMedia Contact: Kai Bucher +1 202 473 5995 [email protected] Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cgap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T21:47:39.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d632a0bae59abffc588413261573a019f5dae3e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSX9hzo2IzPtUctiDt8vmeQcji9WvbFZA3inyYBTXxeF7gvh8J4hU_f00o9lcglihRg--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "The 24 hr Bitcoin trading volume is 995,000 BTC.

Now that the air has come out of the crypto-mania, I hope itaEURtms safe to talk about the real opportunity.\nIaEURtmm not talking about Bitcoin. IaEURtmm talking about the blockchain aEUR\" and the dividend growth opportunities that will unfold as this aEURoemegatrendaEUR plays out in the coming years and decades.\nThe blockchain is the nascent technology that serves as the backbone for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, IaEURtmm going to introduce you to five pioneering income plays that boast a aEURoeblockchain kicker.aEUR\nFirst, a quick primer on blockchain.\nThe simplest way to describe the technology is to call it a digital ledger of sorts. ItaEURtms essentially just a group of encrypted records (aEURoeblocksaEUR) that can be used to record transactions and other interactions.\nThe utilization of blockchain that people are most familiar with are cryptocurrencies aEUR\" products such as Bitcoin that are meant to serve as digital currencies, but have quickly become extremely speculative investments as theyaEURtmve gained thousands of percent in just a few years. But companies are increasingly learning that blockchain can be used for so much more, from tracing medical histories to keeping voting records.\nAs a result, companies from Amazon ( AMZN ) and International Business Machines ( IBM ) to Bank of America ( BAC ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) are becoming increasingly involved in trying to exploit this technology. That has given rise to a few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on this space, including one thataEURtms surprisingly rife with dividend growth names.\nThe Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF ( BLCN ) is a portfolio of companies expected to benefit from blockchain in some way, with the stocks actually graded by their aEURoepotential for increased economic profit, operational efficiencies, and transformational business practices.aEUR In short, it holds aEURoecompanies working to utilize and incorporate blockchain technologies into their businesses.aEUR\nWhat fascinates me about this fund, however, is the dividend growth potential in some of its component stocks.\nReality SharesaEURtm BLCN is a deviation from its main focus: income. The ETF provider boasts another quartet of funds, all of which hold dividend stocks , and three of which are centered around the companyaEURtms proprietary aEURoeDIVCONaEUR system.\nThe DIVCON system essentially measures a stockaEURtms dividend health, assigning a score of 1 to 5, aEURoewhere DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut.aEUR\nAnd right now, this system is flashing a ringing endorsement for five blockchain-linked stocks, which are all at aEURoeDIVCON 5.aEUR In other words, theyaEURtmre in the best position for dividend growth going forward:\nVisa (V)\nDividend Yield: 0.6%\nBLCN Weight: 1.39%\nA stock like Visa (V) that yields just 0.6% hardly screams aEURoeincome opportunity,aEUR but it is. Visa has juiced its payout by 154% in five years. But itaEURtms not just a prolific dividend grower aEUR\" itaEURtms a perfect example of the share-price growth you should expect when a company puts its shareholders first via increasingly generous cash payments.\nAs VisaaEURtms Dividend Goes, So Does Its Price\nVisa already is elbow-deep in blockchain. The company launched a pilot phase of a blockchain-based B2B payments service called B2B Connect last year in partnership with banks in the U.S., South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines. The service will allow institutions to make payments to one another directly, and the second phase of the project is expected to go live later this year.\nMasterCard (MA)\nDividend Yield: 0.5%\nBLCN Weight: 1.40%\nVisa rival MasterCard (MA) also has its hands in blockchain, making its moves through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In early April, the credit-card processing company filed a patent to help verify and store identity data on a blockchain system. Later in the month, it filed another patent, this time to create aEURoefast track flagsaEUR within the blockchain that would allow nodes (any electronic device that performs a task within the blockchain network) to more quickly verify data, making the system work more efficiently.\nMasterCard (MA) Has Some Catching Up to Do aEUR\" in a Good Way\nMasterCard might be an even more intriguing opportunity. While VisaaEURtms share price and dividend growth have been roughly in line, MA shares aEUR\" despite more than tripling over the past year aEUR\" still havenaEURtmt caught up with the pace of the dividend, which has quadrupled and then some over the same time frame.\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\nDividend Yield: 2.2%\nBLCN Weight: 2.04%\nTexas Instruments (TXN) isnaEURtmt exactly known for being the flashiest of chip stocks. Its analog chips and embedded processors, which make up 80%-plus of revenues, are found in some of the simplest of devices, from calculators to alarm clocks. But they have a wide array of uses, from appliances to displays to motors drives and even avionics.\nThe company is increasingly delving into more cutting-edge technologies, however, such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. And its position as a chipmaker also puts it square in the world of enabling the devices that make the blockchain possible.\nThat said, TXNaEURtms positioning in the less glamorous world of analog chips makes it a cash cow with the few companies that even want to compete with it. And Texas Instruments makes good use of that cash, more than doubling its dividend over the past five years.\nIntuit (INTU)\nDividend Yield: 0.8%\nBLCN Weight: 1.31%\nIf the blockchain acts as a ledger of sorts, what better company to research its applications than Intuit (INTU) aEUR\" the well-known purveyor of accounting software such as TurboTax and QuickBooks.\nIntuit clearly spells out the blockchain opportunity in a post about the technologyaEURtms potential:\n\"Some accounting and auditing firms already embrace blockchain technology. Blockchain transactions are simpler, more visible, and more transparent. Improvements in operational efficiency mean that much of the work accountants do, such as collecting and inputting data, sampling, and proving provenance, takes place automatically. This leaves accountants more time to provide valuable services to their clients.\"\nAgain, this is another prolific dividend grower that has more than doubled its quarterly dole in five years. And its DIVCON rating of 5 implies that INTU is well-armed enough to continue the upward march.\nIntuit (INTU): Self-Service Taxes, Full-Service Dividends\nNvidia (NVDA)\nDividend Yield: 0.3%\nBLCN Weight: 2.06%\nOne of BLCNaEURtms most exciting holdings is also one of the aEURoehealthiestaEUR from a dividend perspective.\nNvidia (NVDA) , maker of high-performance chips, is among the stocks most commonly connected with the booming blockchain technology. ThataEURtms because its GPUs are widely used by cryptocurrency aEURoeminers,aEUR who need extremely powerful computers to do the processing necessary to generate new digital tokens.\nIn fact, demand is so intense that Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang recently said the company needs to crank out more of the GPUs to catch up, as video gamers (NvidiaaEURtms bread-and-butter market) are finding it difficult to procure the graphics chips their advanced games require.\nThe sky seems the limit, then, for its blockchain potential, and the same goes for NVDAaEURtms income opportunity. Because despite the fact Nvidia has powered up its A dividend by 76% since 2014, it currently boasts a mere 11% payout ratio. ThataEURtms a large reason why Nvidia boasts DIVCONaEURtms top score of dividend health, and why investors should be licking their chops over this dual-threat stock going forward.\nHow to Earn 12% Annual Returns For Life!\nRobust dividend growth separates the winners from the losers.\nAnd IaEURtmm not just talking about the stocks.\nLow dividend growth goes hand-in-hand with slow and no growth aEUR\" and even eventual decay. Hitch your wagon to the supposedly aEURoesafeaEUR blue chips that most financial pundits shill for, and youaEURtmll quickly be looking for part-time work a few years into your retirement.\nIf you want to retire fully funded and worry-free, itaEURtmll take more aEUR\" a lot more. In fact, itaEURtmll take 12% in safe, annual returns.\nThat sounds impossible, but itaEURtms not. It takes a special kind of portfolio that offers high current yield, and dividend growth, and the potential for double-digit capital gains in some years.

A high-growth, high-yield aEURoedouble threataEUR stock that threw off 252% gains the last time it was this cheap.

However, the moving average support may hold ground for a few hours as the relative strength index (RSI) shows oversold conditions.\n1-hour chart The 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA are trending south and positioned one below the other in favor of the bears. Yet, the RSI on the 60-minute chart also shows oversold conditions. So, a minor corrective rally cannot be ruled out.\nView Bitcoin will likely break below $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), signaling the end of the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 and may fall to $8,282 (50-day MA) at the weekend. BTC could revisit $9,000 as indicated by the oversold conditions 0n the 4- and 1-hour charts. That said, upticks will likely be short-lived as indicated by generally bearish setup. Bearish invalidation scenario: A rebound from the mildly bullish 200-candle MA located at $8,628 in 4-hour chart and a close above 10-day MA of $9,390 would abort the bearish view.

Given the surge in popularity of cryptocurrencies over the past few years, mining has become a seriously lucrative endeavor. All over the world miners have set up operations, big and small, as they look to capitalize on dwindling Bitcoin rewards from processing transactions and validating the blockchain.\nWith plenty at stake, the costs of setting up even a small operation can be hefty, from the actual hardware to cooling systems and electricity consumption. However, those with enough capital to buy the best hardware, namely ASIC miners , put themselves in a commanding position.\nBut that also makes them a target for criminals. Whether these crooks want to hack your system and steal your valuable cryptocurrency or make off with your physical hardware, the potential dangers are real.\nThe latter scenario grabbed headlines this month, as over 600 computers used to mine Bitcoin have been seized in China, valued at over $2 mln alone. From Iceland to China?\nThe seized equipment is being linked to a series of thefts in Iceland late last year. Three separate incidents spanning from December to January led to a total of 600 computers being stolen by a number of culprits.\nThe Associated Press reported that eleven people were initially arrested , while two men were kept in custody for the burglaries -- one of which took place in January at a data center that was housing computers used for Bitcoin mining.\nIcelandic IT firm Advania produced surveillance footage of thieves stealing computers from a data center in Reykjanesbær in January, which positively identified the two men that were in custody, according to local news outlet Visir .\nIn April, one of the culprits managed to escape from custody and fled to Sweden using a fake passport to board a flight to Stockholm. Sindri Þór Stefánsson later said he would return to Iceland in a statement. He claimed he had the right to travel at the time since his custody ruling had expired on April 16.\nTo date, Icelandic authorities have been unable to trace the stolen equipment. Police had asked IT service providers, electricians, and storage units in the country to report any unusual spikes in power use in the hopes they could track down the stolen mining computers.\nTwo months later, Chinese police seized 600 computers in Tianjin in what seems to be more than just a crazy coincidence. The operation caught the attention of Tianjin police after the local power grid operator reported abnormal electricity usage at the location where the equipment was being operated.\nGiven that the number of computers is exactly the same, there’s a good possibility they could be the PCs from Iceland. Icelandic police have reached out to Chinese authorities to try and link the two cases. Still need to be connected\nIcelandic authorities are still waiting on their Chinese counterparts to respond to their requests for collaboration. If and when they do, it shouldn’t be difficult to link the computer equipment at the very least. Given that the computers were stolen from Advania’s data center, it’s almost certain that the serial numbers of components will be available.\nThis could then be cross-checked with the computers seized in Tianjin to positively link the hardware. While the owners of the hardware will no doubt be pleased to recover their property, the investigation has the potential to uncover a nefarious crime syndicate.\nIcelandic police commissioner Olafur Helgi Kjartansson was quoted saying, “This is a grand theft on a scale unseen before,” adding that it was a “highly organized crime”. With numerous suspects being investigated in both China and Iceland, authorities have the chance to apprehend criminals that are preying on the cryptocurrency community.

Add unique flair when you tell people to send bitcoins to 1stDownqyMHHqnDPRSfiZ5GXJ8Gk9dbjO. Alternatively, vanitygen can be used to generate random addresses offline.\nVanitygen accepts as input a pattern, or list of patterns to search for, and produces a list of addresses and private keys. Vanitygen's search is probabilistic, and the amount of time required to find a given pattern depends on how complex the pattern is, the speed of your computer, and whether you get lucky.\nThe example below illustrates a session of vanitygen. It is typical, and takes about 10 sec to finish, using a Core 2 Duo E6600 CPU on x86-64 Linux:\n$ ./vanitygen 1Boat Difficulty: 4476342 Pattern: 1Boat Address: 1BoatSLRHtKNngkdXEeobR76b53LETtpyT Privkey: 5J4XJRyLVgzbXEgh8VNi4qovLzxRftzMd8a18KkdXv4EqAwX3tS Vanitygen includes components to perform address searching on your CPU (vanitygen) and your OpenCL-compatible GPU (oclvanitygen). Both can be built from source, and both are included in the Windows binary package. Also included is oclvanityminer, the vanity address mining client. Oclvanityminer can be used to automatically claim bounties on sites such as ThePiachu's Vanity Pool.\nCurrent version: 0.22\nWindows x86+x64 binaries here. PGP signature here.\nGet the source from GitHub. Includes Makefiles for Linux and Mac OS X.\nMain discussion at BitCoinTalk\nThe latest source doesn't work properly for high-end AMD cards (7XXX and greater). Solution is to change line 459 in oclengine.c from: return quirks; to: return quirks & ~VG_OCL_AMD_BFI_INT; Windows x86+x64 binaries that solve this problem plus provide support for compressed keys here. PGP signature here. If you have any problems with the binaries, join the relevant BitCoinTalk discussion.\nProper syntax for VanityGen is: Usage: vanitygen [-vqrikNT] [-t <threads>] [-f <filename>|-] [<pattern>...] Generates a bitcoin receiving address matching <pattern>, and outputs the address and associated private key. The private key may be stored in a safe location or imported into a bitcoin client to spend any balance received on the address. By default, <pattern> is interpreted as an exact prefix. Options: -v Verbose output -q Quiet output -r Use regular expression match instead of prefix (Feasibility of expression is not checked) -i Case-insensitive prefix search -k Keep pattern and continue search after finding a match -N Generate namecoin address -T Generate bitcoin testnet address -X <version> Generate address with the given version -t <threads> Set number of worker threads (Default: number of CPUs) -f <file> File containing list of patterns, one per line (Use \"-\" as the file name for stdin) -o <file> Write pattern matches to <file> -s <file> Seed random number generator from <file>\nThe important options to know are -i and -r which cause the search to be case-insensitive and use regex, repsectively. In its simplest format, you issue a command like:\nvanitygen.exe 1david\nWhich tells vanity gen to look for an address with the exact prefix \"1david.\" On a single core of my core i5 this runs at about 325,000 keys per second as shown by the status display (which does show a time estimation.): [324.43 Kkey/s][total 15166208][Prob 0.1%][50% in 9.1h]\nUsing the -i option drastically decreases generation time. vanitygen.exe -i 1david produced the following results in just a few seconds: Difficulty: 36384905 Pattern: 1david Address: 1DAVid3iW7XhDBzdoj8FbnaSaqWCjeTgUP Privkey: 5JvtXtpUbwbNNqRoQjF3w2nyXHhphJk6LX1pWkPYEkBr4nnnBeL\nThe -r option allows the specification of a regex value instead of the default pattern option. If, for example, I demanded that my address contain all lowercase letters but I don't care if the \"D\" in \"David\" is uppercase or not, I could use vanitygen.exe -r 1[Dd]avid. One downside to specifying a regex prefix is that you will not be given any estimated time or probability data since such calculations are not as trivial as matching a simple prefix.\nThe more specific your matching criteria (and the longer the pattern) the longer it will take to generate your address(es). This can be sped up considerably if you have an ATI/AMD video card since there is also an OpenCL version of VanityGen which can try millions of keys per second on a decent GPU.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vanitygen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanitygen", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "vanitygen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T20:40:59.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8dd549abbbe39bd21c225736d144397eeb748e2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSYJ3QzVk62tHnNDQiUld1pPaclQAFZlKHZwMnFqx0N6KM8QtumE8.pWLGlEUM.D8KV7XLSK6tshCo6hMWlx2T95UbdEsOJ.Yxvs5DE3N4Zl0yeXlqyn3a", "site_full": "nwmarbleandtile.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://nwmarbleandtile.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin & Altcoins Crash â€“ How Low Will Crypto Go?

Decentralization ensures the security, transparency and integrity of all transactions in the network. But are the popular cryptocurrency exchanges really decentralized, and safe? Most DEX’s are not able to accept BTC without using an unreliable gateway between the two blockchains.\nExploring the Token Swap Ecosystem\nThere are several different types of DEX (Decentralised Exchange) such as pseudo-decentralized, working in the Ethereum network only, for example projects that link blockchains to each other using their own tokens, and decentralized exchanges that use “Hashed Timelock Contracts”.\nEarlier, it was common knowledge that a crypto exchange that did not store user keys, and was decentralized and therefore safe. However, most of these exchanges are built on a single blockchain, which makes them vulnerable – in order to get funds from the Bitcoin network to such a crypto exchange for example, one needs to use a gateway, which takes bitcoin and produces a “holding” kind of bitcoins in another network in return. A similar principle lies with Ethereum-based exchanges, for example, EtherDelta.\nSecurity: Paramount\nDevotees of centralization believe that storing private keys on a secure server is safer than storing encrypted keys in the user’s browser. However, if a central server is hacked, everything will be stolen (as it was with a million bitcoins), and paranoids can remove signing of transactions from the browser into the application on the computer and encrypt it.\nSince all code is executed in the user’s browser, the greatest risk is the intrusion of extraneous scripts into the code. It is likely to be made by the extensions the user installed in the browser, or by a hosting provider.\nTo prevent such attacks, Swap.Online will use cloudflare.com together with Workers, a solution that, in response to any request to the domain, sends a “Content Security Policy” header with the hash of the JS code allowed for execution in the user’s browser. Thus, server hacking and most attacks based on the introduction of malicious code will be eliminated. To understand how this works, see the video of the system operation below, or try to make an exchange yourself at https://alpha.swap.online .\nThe Swap Online Platform\nBy using Bitcoin.js, web3.js, and the libp2p library in IPFS, Swap.Online created a cross-blockchain swap system directly in the browser. The full details of the system can be found below: The solution operates on an average 2 to 10 times faster than the existing stock exchanges (taking into account the time to deposit and withdraw funds). On average, the exchange takes 2 to 3 minutes. Swap Online does not store secret user keys. Moreover, even messages between users do not pass through our servers (we use IPFS ). The exchange works right in the browser – users do not need to download or install anything. The platform already works between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, with Tether, and Lightning Network planned. Theoretically, Swap Online is able to work with most cryptocurrencies, except for those where there is no scripting language.

Decentralization ensures the security, transparency and integrity of all transactions in the network. But are the popular cryptocurrency exchanges really decentralized, and safe? Most DEX’s are not able to accept BTC without using an unreliable gateway between the two blockchains.\nExploring the Token Swap Ecosystem\nThere are several different types of DEX (Decentralised Exchange) such as pseudo-decentralized, working in the Ethereum network only, for example projects that link blockchains to each other using their own tokens, and decentralized exchanges that use “Hashed Timelock Contracts”.\nEarlier, it was common knowledge that a crypto exchange that did not store user keys, and was decentralized and therefore safe. However, most of these exchanges are built on a single blockchain, which makes them vulnerable – in order to get funds from the Bitcoin network to such a crypto exchange for example, one needs to use a gateway, which takes bitcoin and produces a “holding” kind of bitcoins in another network in return. A similar principle lies with Ethereum-based exchanges, for example, EtherDelta.\nSecurity: Paramount\nDevotees of centralization believe that storing private keys on a secure server is safer than storing encrypted keys in the user’s browser. However, if a central server is hacked, everything will be stolen (as it was with a million bitcoins), and paranoids can remove signing of transactions from the browser into the application on the computer and encrypt it.\nSince all code is executed in the user’s browser, the greatest risk is the intrusion of extraneous scripts into the code. It is likely to be made by the extensions the user installed in the browser, or by a hosting provider.\nTo prevent such attacks, Swap.Online will use cloudflare.com together with Workers, a solution that, in response to any request to the domain, sends a “Content Security Policy” header with the hash of the JS code allowed for execution in the user’s browser. Thus, server hacking and most attacks based on the introduction of malicious code will be eliminated. To understand how this works, see the video of the system operation below, or try to make an exchange yourself at https://alpha.swap.online .\nThe Swap Online Platform\nBy using Bitcoin.js, web3.js, and the libp2p library in IPFS, Swap.Online created a cross-blockchain swap system directly in the browser. The full details of the system can be found below: The solution operates on an average 2 to 10 times faster than the existing stock exchanges (taking into account the time to deposit and withdraw funds). On average, the exchange takes 2 to 3 minutes. Swap Online does not store secret user keys. Moreover, even messages between users do not pass through our servers (we use IPFS ). The exchange works right in the browser – users do not need to download or install anything. The platform already works between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, with Tether, and Lightning Network planned. Theoretically, Swap Online is able to work with most cryptocurrencies, except for those where there is no scripting language. Even for currencies like Monero, solutions will be created over time.\nThe source code of the exchange is published in GitHub , and the protocol is distributed as Open Source. The AirDrop is scheduled for June 30th.\nThe Swap.Online team is also engaged in commercial implementation and release of related products: For the B2C market (swap.online) : Exchange solution for BTC -> ERC20 (with an orderbook and a reputation system) For the B2B market (b2b.swap.online) : Widget in the form of html code, which allows accepting any cryptocurrencies directly in the wallet of the site owner by sending tokens in return.

Cryptocurrencies Source: via Nvidia Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) reported its Q1 earnings yesterday. In the run-up to the announcement, Nvidia stock hit an all-time high and the company announced record revenue and earnings. But in after hours trading, NVDA was down over 3%. What gives? The bugaboo that spooked investors was the company’s disclosure, for the first time, that it made a big chunk of that revenue selling video cards to cryptocurrency miners. That market is volatile and expected to decline, and as a result, Nvidia stock took a hit. NVDA Earnings Are on Fire The Q1 Nvidia earnings report shows the company is firing on all cylinders. Revenue from its core video gaming business was up 68% year-over-year to $1.72 billion. Data center revenue, with high profile customers like Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS, was up 71% to $701 million. Professional visualization (content creation) revenue grew 22% to $251 million. The company’s automotive business was up 4% to a record $145 million. Overall revenue for the quarter hit a record $3.21 billion, up 66% from last year and GAAP EPS of $1.98 also set a new record, growing a whopping 151% from last year. That all sounds pretty spectacular, so why was Nvidia stock down over 3% in after-hours trading? That data center revenue set yet another record for the quarter, but at $701 million, it missed analyst expectations of $703 million. What’s really spooking investors, though, is the company’s now openly admitted reliance on cryptocurrency mining. Cryptocurrency’s Negative Influence on Nvidia Stock Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin elicit mixed reaction at best from investors. The digital currency is generated by a process called cryptocurrency mining, employing rigs packed with video cards to crunch numbers. This has been good for the video card industry in the sense that they are selling more video cards due to the demand from these miners, especially NVDA rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . (NASDAQ: AMD ), which has optimized products for cryptocurrency mining . But there are downsides as well. The entire cryptocurrency business still has an aura of sketchiness around it. It has also sucked up the supply of video cards, reducing availability (and driving up prices) for gamers , NVDA’s core customers. Cryptocurrency is also extremely volatile. When prices are high, miners snap up every video card they can, but then stop mining when prices drop. Compare Brokers Reuters points out that for the first time, Nvidia openly disclosed its sales from cryptocurrency mining . It amounted to $289 million, or nearly 9% of the company’s total Q1 revenue. NVDA also warned that revenue was expected to drop to around $100 million in Q2. There’s that cryptocurrency volatility. Having a major revenue source that has a respectability issue, hurts the company’s primary revenue source, and is subject to rapid and often unpredictable changes isn’t something that investors are particularly fond of.

Nonetheless, in recent times, a buy cryptocurrency brand new technique of offering value in an organization has turn out to be well-liked amongst hackers, with a whole lot of tens of millions in worth raised. However, the true share of the given token supply is just not, in actual fact, recognized, so once you buy in the ICO, you cannot know for sure what number of % of tokens you might have acquired. Nevertheless, unlike IPO, where investors buy or spend money on firm shares, ICO affords tokens that aren't shared however are a utility tokens. This displays a larger dynamic of ICOs, which is that they are almost exclusively utilized by know-how initiatives — and largely blockchain-based mostly tasks, at that. Need to receive updates about ICO's and tokensales. Instead of pitching their concept to a enterprise capitalist to fund, entrepreneurs can create their own cryptocurrency on the blockchain, or the ether blockchain referred to as Etherum, and sell it to be able to elevate capital for his or her business. In Bitcoin's brief history, the company has been subjected to at the very least forty thefts that gathered to over 1 million dollars in worth.Again in 2014, the ethereum ICO raised $18 million in bitcoin, or the equal of forty cents per ether. ICOs are a brand new means for startups to raise cash. Many view ICO projects as unregulated securities that permit founders to raise an unjustified amount of capital, while others argue it is an innovation in the conventional enterprise-funding model. The second part is the cryptocurrency, each ICO has its own cryptocurrency by which overall trading of the ecosystem takes place. Then you'll be able to complete your participation within the ICO by creating an account — if essential — and sending the designated quantity of the cryptocurrency to the fund's tackle. On high of the rankings, buyers also can look out for ICOs that embrace unbiased escrow agents, so that the capital raised doesn't attain the corporate getting into an ICO, however a 3rd celebration. ICO buyers profit when their tokens achieve in value at a faster charge than the foreign money they used to pay for them. Others remit the purchased tokens to the handle from which the funds had been sent. Backers send Bitcoins or Ethereum to the offered addresses and get the new token. A cryptocurrency begin-up that raised almost $375,000 by an initial coin providing has disappeared with the funds. (By no means ship cash to an ICO from an exchange; always send from a wallet such as Parity or MEW.

The method is precisely the same as promoting a cryptocurrency — find a trusted purchaser to make use of instantly or sell through an change. The SEC and Canadian CSA have both issued recent commentary suggesting that at least some ICO activity falls within the attain of traditional securities legal guidelines (assume for example of coins offered on the premise that income of the underlying challenge will probably be returned to coin-holders - this sounds an awful lot like a typical securities funding). Also referred to as an Preliminary Public Coin Offering (IPCO). Initial Coin buy cryptocurrency Providing projects have numerous similarities with Initial Public Offering and crowdfunding. Buyers might use the DAO's tokens to forged votes on the way to disburse funds, and any income had been supposed to come back again to the stakeholders. The principle objective of this decision is said to be associated to investors' protection - registered tokens will be monitored by the federal government, and thus every monetary operation with these tokens can be https://ico.echat.io topic to the federal regulation. Ripple pre-mined 1 billion XRP tokens and bought them to keen investors in alternate for fiat currencies or bitcoin. Only in July 2017 an influential monetary authority Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has started the first investigation of ICO gross sales by DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Group), stating that capital elevating by blockchain technologies doesn't remove conduct from the purview of the U.S. federal securities legal guidelines. ICOs differ enormously from IPO for the reason that coin offering, or token sale is launched very early for challenge development.

Family and friends and fools take the first cash in an organization, then business angels, traditional enterprise capital funds sometimes are available in at late seed sequence A by way of Collection B or C, at which level private equity begins putting money in, till lastly an IPO happens. ICOs are usually utilized by the undertaking to assemble startup capital, or preliminary investments to really start the project. Here's the biggest benefit of an ICO, nonetheless: in 2014, Ethereum offered cash through its ICO at a value ranging from $0.30 to $0.forty per token. These fundraising ICOs are carried out on-line and are usually introduced on a cryptocurrency forum. When the ICO finishes, participators can commerce their tokens in the marketplace. The first is that ICOs have change into a very popular different for entrepreneurs to boost capital for his or her projects. The primary crypto currency to appear was Bitcoin. There's loads of curiosity at current from an investor perspective, attributed to sizeable returns that buy cryptocurrency traders have enjoyed to date, demand driving prices, with massive prices gains incentivising buyers to lock in income, which may lead to mass promote-offs that might finally wipe out investor money, not to point out the corporate. Consequently, many ICOs are used to fund both cryptocurrencies themselves or platforms that are constructed onto preexisting blockchains, like the highly-well-liked Ethereum. A digital coin, or a digital currency is a digital model of money. However ICOs differ from crowdfunding in that the backers of the previous are motivated by a prospective return of their investments, while the funds raised in the latter marketing campaign are principally donations.

In order for the process to work at 100 percent?\nShould we split coins between different adresses or its better to keep them in one wallet?\nNote that with a balance of less than 30 BTC2 your staking efficiency would already be close enough to 100%. If you have a higher balance, consider doing the following steps:\nTo achieve 100% staking efficiency:\n1) Make sure you're allowing incoming connections and that you are connected to a lot of peers.\nThere's currently 25 nodes connected to the Bitcoin 2 network. If you see only a few peers connected, then have a look at the following to get better results:\nMost home routers have NAT that by default blocks incoming connections initiated by someone else than you so you are likely connected to very few peers because of that and thus more likely to mint orphaned blocks. You can usually fix that and start allowing incoming connections with one of two ways:\n... A) Launch Bitcoin 2 Core, go to Settings - Options. Go to Network. Enable: \"Map port using UPnP\". Then restart the app. You may also want to read this article: https://dirkmittler.homeip.net/blog/archives/3340\n... B) Or follow the guide at: https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#enabling-connections - the steps are exactly the same for Bitcoin 2.\n2) You wallet should have 100 UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs, AKA unspent incoming transactions) or more. This is because every time you stake or send an amount, that amount cannot be staked or spent for 101 blocks, while it is maturing (being staked). You can see the number of UTXOs that you have in the Coin Control dialog. Doesn't matter how many addresses or wallets they are split into. One single address can hold these 100 UTXOs.\nif your balance is lower than 500 BTC2, You can get a close enough result without that much effort by splitting your balance into stacks of 5 - 50 BTC2. For example 150 BTC2 can just be split into 5 pieces and you'd be unlikely to notice the difference in efficiency of that versus splitting it in 100 parts. You can do the splitting by sending BTC2 to yourself.\nFor example.\nI have 180 BTC2\nI just need to:\nSplit them into 6 pieces by sending to myself 6 times 30 BTC2?\nThat is all?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://dirkmittler.homeip.net/blog/archives/3340", "https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#enabling-connections"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T13:15:53.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8edac88e3d9d8e0bfa00a6a246f752cfb368ccc8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5KwN3j6K0SaRVt7ZUdZctttVK2TLwWnbYpOysxhNttbek.OJ6aHpYDzjeOknzn99w_TOzCm5kVXo6nWwumtx6YCrDzMkuEapBhHu4KMuwSGwiKxIDCG.iz2BcM_FcB8v5Mc.BMK._n4H9v0Xqk0s1SYqK_9BcuBzqfp3cS9zAQA--", "site_full": "www.express.co.uk", "site": "express.co.uk", "site_section": "http://express.co.uk//posts/rss/21/finance", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Daily Express :: Finance Feed", "title": "Bitcoin price: Bullish expert explains why he thinks bitcoin will go 'HIGHER from here'", "title_full": "Bitcoin price: Bullish expert explains why he thinks bitcoin will go 'HIGHER from here'", "published": "2018-05-11T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/22/750x445/958366.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1796, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 17, "comments": 0, "shares": 17}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8edac88e3d9d8e0bfa00a6a246f752cfb368ccc8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5KwN3j6K0SaRVt7ZUdZctttVK2TLwWnbYpOysxhNttbek.OJ6aHpYDzjeOknzn99w_TOzCm5kVXo6nWwumtx6YCrDzMkuEapBhHu4KMuwSGwiKxIDCG.iz2BcM_FcB8v5Mc.BMK._n4H9v0Xqk0s1SYqK_9BcuBzqfp3cS9zAQA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price: Bullish expert explains why he thinks bitcoin will go 'HIGHER from here'", "text": "Bitcoin price: Bullish expert explains why he thinks bitcoin will go 'HIGHER from here' sponsored by City & Business News Bitcoin price: Bullish expert explains why he thinks bitcoin will go 'HIGHER from here' BITCOIN price has historically risen every year for three years following an annual blockchain technology summit, according to cryptocurrency expert Robert Sluymer – who thinks this year will be no different.

One site that constantly tracks its value with regular commentary on the crypto market in general is ArmyOfBitcoin.com . In a recent post by Omkar Godbole, bitcoin’s struggle to stay above the $9000 mark in value was analyzed in greater detail. A small rally earlier this week to $9,990 was met with a decline to $8,980. The up and down nature of this crypto finally settled at $9,380 with no clear indication of which direction it will go from here. The bulls would like to think that it can sustain a value above $10,000, but the prevailing bears continue to see BTC hover around the $9000 mark in value. One of the tools that Army Of Bitcoin does use to measure this volatility is a ‘relative strength index (RSI). The RSI for bitcoin this week as been a balancing act that leans slightly towards the bears as far as future direction. The report also mentions the moving average (MA) as a key indicator of bitcoin value. Once again, the recent movement over the 50, 100 and 200 hour MA suggest the bears are driving the bus with values running into some major resistance at the $9,442 level. All three hourly measurements on the MA support this assumption. Also included in this ArmyOfBitcoin.com report is a longer-term MA chart going back as far as March when bitcoin values hovered between $11,000 and $10,200. The decline in early April took prices down below $7,000 but the currency recovered to a high of $9,767 on April 25. The early part of May has been a bit less volatile, but it is hard to say if this brief bout with stability will last. Using both the hourly and daily MA, the trend still points to a further retreat from the recent high of $9,990 in the short term. Some of the conclusions drawn by Army Of Bitcoin in this market reports include this bearish trend continuing if bitcoin does fall below the $9,228 level. Citing the 5-day and 10-day MA, any immediate decline could result in a drop below the $9,000 level to $8,980, which is the current value of the 100-day MA. Any close below $9,000 would confirm the bears’ current outlook for bitcoin . The bulls are patiently waiting for a move past the 10-day MA of $9,452 to possibly signal that bitcoin is poised to make that climb to its recent high of $9,990.\nAs the leader in blockchain news, Army Of Bitcoin presents itself as a media outlet that is guided by the highest standards in journalism with a strict set of editorial policies.

By Rakesh Sharma | Updated May 11, 2018 — 9:47 AM EDT A: Ring Signature (Cryptocurrency)\nThe bitcoin blockchain is essentially an enormous, shared, encrypted list of which addresses hold which bitcoin balances. Every new block represents the latest update to account balances after some further mining takes place or a transaction occurs where bitcoin is exchanged. When a transaction is submitted to the bitcoin network, the information is passed on through all bitcoin clients at the same time through the blockchain.\nThe blockchain network is designed to make double-spending very difficult, though breaches have occurred in the past. In this way, it functions much like a public ledger, accounting for economic transactions and providing some verification that all bitcoin users are equipped with the same information. Records in Each Block\nBlockchains consist of a series of individual blocks, each in chronological order based on the order of transactions. There are two parts to the information contained in a block.\nThe first part consists of the header elements that provide information about location and data pertaining to transactions contained within a block. For example, a hash within the header points to the previous block. There are no hashes for genesis blocks because these blocks have no predecessor. A merkle tree which is a data structure used in computer science to record transactions, is used to display the sequence of transactions contained within the block. Another hash within the block contains timestamp information (which displays the time and date of the block's creation), nonce (which is the number that is required to be solved by miners), and difficulty level (which denotes the difficulty of the problem being solved). The second part is the identifier information. Again, this is a cryptographic hash function . It is generated by hashing the header elements twice in a row. Anonymity\nOne of the alleged benefits, or risks, of bitcoin is its unique anonymity. Those transacting in bitcoins are supposed to be tied to a specific bitcoin address rather than a personal name or email. Yet, anonymity is somewhat compromised because of the blockchain information ledger. Since every transaction is publicly logged, one single breach of ownership identity could lead to the revelation of many other owners by simply following the transactions. The blockchain is still more anonymous than a bank statement, but it is not an impenetrable veil of secrecy as some assert. Even the name, or pseudonym, of the bitcoin founder is known.

You might think mainstream support for the highly speculative digital asset would give bitcoin and its crypto cousins a boost, as it helps unlock demand from much bigger investors. However, the crypto market seems unimpressed. Bitcoin prices are down this month.\nTo see how Asia’s manufacturing map is being redrawn, look at Nike and Adidas\nThis is despite a New York Times report that Goldman Sachs will post bids and offers for bitcoin futures, and is looking into ways to trade actual crypto tokens. A few days later, the newspaper reported that Intercontinental Exchange—the owner of the New York Stock Exchange —is discussing a type of bitcoin swap for institutional investors.\nThese derivatives could help open the door for large investors to get exposure to digital tokens, as there’s still a great deal of uncertainty about how crypto will be regulated. But futures and swaps can allow traders to bet on just about any asset’s price and, importantly, they fall under existing regulations administered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nIt took a century to create the weekend—and only a decade to undo it\nOther financial firms are also looking at ways to build scaffolding around the crypto market. Bloomberg, which runs the most popular data and messaging platform for Wall Street traders, said recently that it’s launching an index for the largest, most liquid crypto assets. It partnered with Galaxy Digital Capital Management, which was founded by former Goldman partner Mike Novogratz.\nThese aren’t the first forays by big finance into crypto. Bitcoin futures started trading at global derivatives exchanges in Chicago last year, just as digital token prices were soaring, with bitcoin peaking at nearly $20,000.\nIn a March earnings call, BNY Mellon executives said they were looking at ways to play a role in the custody of cryptocurrencies. The bank has $33 trillion (pdf) of assets under custody and administration. Custody—safeguarding a customer’s assets against theft or loss—is arguably one of the biggest challenges for crypto investors, as exchanges have often had their holdings stolen by hackers. Unlike institutional financial markets, crypto exchanges typically don’t have a specialized, separation of duties for this service.\nMaybe bitcoin prices would be even lower without the growing interest from Wall Street stalwarts. But so far, the advance of traditional financial players into the burgeoning crypto market hasn’t marked a return to the euphoria and soaring prices seen last year.\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief

People may not be able to connect a particular individual identity to a Bitcoin transaction directly (this is why sometimes Bitcoin is also called pseudo anonymous), but if they find it, then they can see all the transactions you have done on the Bitcoin network.

Between March 2010 and mid-December 2017, the value of an individual bitcoin token surged from a low of $0.003 to (briefly) more than $20,000 per token. A prescient $1,000 investment in March 2010, assuming you could find someone willing to part with that many bitcoin (333,333 tokens), would have been worth billions of dollars as of this past December.\nCryptocurrency optimists view bitcoin and <> blockchain technology as a game-changers for monetary theory and how currency is transferred from one party to another, which is a big reason bitcoin has been so successful thus far.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nBitcoin's underlying blockchain is its digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that works around traditional banking networks to record and process transactions. Most notably, blockchain offers the ability to transfer funds from one party to another considerably quicker than with current banking networks, especially in cross-border transactions. Sending funds overseas may take moments to validate and settle with blockchain, whereas traditional banking networks may take up to five business days to settle cross-border remittances. Stop comparing bitcoin to gold! They're nothing alike\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap has also drawn regular comparisons to gold, which is viewed as the go-to investment anytime fear, volatility, and/or inflation rear their heads. This comparison takes shape given the relative scarcity of each asset. In other words, there's a 21-million-coin limit on the number of bitcoin that can be mined, just as there's a limit on the amount of gold that can be mined from our planet. Therefore, the assumption has been made that bitcoin can act as a store of value much in the same way gold has for investors.\nHowever, I'm here to tell you, again , and for the last time, that you shouldn't believe everything you hear about bitcoin. It isn't, and <> will never be , the \"new gold.\" How do I know this? The answer lies in a number of comparative tests that bitcoin simply fails when put side by side with gold.\nImage source: Getty Images. There's absolutely no application comparison\nTo begin with, there's the application of gold versus bitcoin. Bitcoin <> exists in the digital realm as code . It's not tangible. You can't put it in your hand or do anything with it, aside from using it as a medium of exchange, or hoping that someone else comes along at a later date and pays more for it, per token, than you did.\nOn the other hand, gold is a physical asset that can be held in the palm of one's hand. It also has practical uses, such as being a conductor in electronic equipment, as the primary metal in fine jewelry, and as crowns in the cosmetic dental industry, to name a few uses. One asset is tangible and has practical use, the other exists entirely within the digital realm. Not comparable. A false sense of scarcity\nAnother comparison that fails to hold muster is scarcity. When it comes to gold, all we're ever going to have is what's on this planet. Putting aside science fiction hype of mining asteroids, what we have in the ground and have already mined is all the gold we're ever going to get. That provides a true physical cap on gold, allowing investors to make a genuine case for scarcity.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin does have a 21-million-coin cap, but this is <> only limited by protocols . Admittedly, getting consensus on bitcoin's network to increase the coin limit would be very difficult -- but the point is that it's not impossible. We can't wave a wand and make more gold appear out of thin air, but computer coders with the backing of the bitcoin community could do just that and create more bitcoin.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nTo add to this point, even without increasing the coin limit above 21 million, bitcoin's numerous hard forks essentially violate the idea of a token limit and scarcity. Bitcoin has had three instances since August where a disagreement between developers on the future path of bitcoin and its blockchain resulted in the creation of a new currency. These spinoffs of sorts -- Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Private -- topple the idea of true scarcity, as new coins have been, or could continue to be, created from bitcoin. Gold has history on its side\nIn terms of which asset has history on its side, that, too, goes to gold. Gold has been used as a currency for more than 2,700 years and is today a highly liquid asset, at least in terms of futures contract trading. It's also an asset held by central banks all over the globe. While you're not likely to pay for your morning cup of coffee with a gold ingot, gold has been viewed as an accepted form of currency for a long time.\nHowever, bitcoin doesn't have that tenured history. There are no fundamental tethers that allow investors to make a reasonable determination about bitcoin's value, and liquidity on bitcoin futures contracts has been spotty at times. Additionally, there are no governments holding bitcoin in their vaults, as they do with gold.\nThe bottom line is that gold and bitcoin are nothing alike -- and to think that bitcoin will behave similarly to gold could prove to be a big mistake.\nBitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you now When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Regulators and policy makers are also following Bitcoin, raising the occasional eyebrow as they evaluate Bitcoin’s risks and benefits and how to regulate this little understood virtual currency. Some media reports have confused Bitcoin with more popular electronic money (e-money) schemes used in many low-income countries to reach the unbanked. But the two are markedly different and should not be conflated. This Brief provides information about Bitcoin and contrasts Bitcoin with e-money to avoid alarm about the former to the detriment of the latter. bitcoinvsemoney.jpg\nOne way to comprehend virtual currency is to first understand fiat currency. Fiat currency is any legal tender designated and issued by a central authority that people are willing to accept in exchange for goods and services because it is backed by regulation and because they trust this central authority. Fiat money is similar to commodity-backed money in appearance and usage, but differs in that it cannot be redeemed for a commodity, such as gold (European Central Bank 2012).\nBy contrast, virtual currency is “a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community.” Although there are different types of virtual currencies (European Central Bank 2012), this Brief will focus on virtual currencies with “bidirectional flow” since these currencies intersect most directly with the real economy. Virtual currencies with bidirectional flow may be bought and sold according to prevailing exchange rates and may be used to purchase both real and virtual goods and services.\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 as an alternative to fiat currencies by an unknown computer scientist using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (n.d.). Bitcoins are not printed like fiat money, but instead are “mined” using computing power in a distributed global network of volunteer software developers. At its core, Bitcoin is nothing more than a digital file that lists every transaction that has ever happened in the network in its version of a general ledger called the “block chain.” Bitcoin is the first example of a growing category of money known as cryptocurrency in which open-source software solves complex mathematical calculations to mine more Bitcoins (Coin Desk 2013a). These “miners” make the Bitcoin network function by validating transactions and thereby creating new Bitcoins. This occurs when the Bitcoin network collects all the transactions made during a set period of time (usually every 10 minutes) into a list called a “block.” Miners confirm these blocks of transactions and write them into the block chain by competing against each other to solve mathematical calculations. Every time a miner’s system finds a solution that validates a block of transactions, that miner is awarded 25 Bitcoins (Coin Desk 2013b). Every four years, this reward is halved so that the total number of Bitcoins will never exceed 21 million.\nFor a new user not interested in the mining process, the most popular way to obtain Bitcoins is through a traditional exchange where fiat currency is converted into Bitcoins and then stored in a Bitcoin wallet. Wallets come in many forms, including desktop access, mobile access, and online web-based access. Each has its own risks as both desktop and mobile access are susceptible to hackers, a hard drive crash, or a lost mobile device. Online access uses third parties that may also be hacked, cheat its users, or go bankrupt (Lee 2013).

Today: Tyler Winklevoss explains Bill Gates how to short bitcoin in a Twitter post, former Goldman President predicts the creation of a new global cryptocurrency, the secret behind Facebook management and blockchain division launch. Tyler Winklevoss Explains Bill Gates How to Short Bitcoin in a Twitter Post\nBill Gates had claimed on a talk program arranged by CNBC that he would bet against bitcoin if he could. The co-founder of a crypto exchange, Tyler Winklevoss, responded to that statement on Twitter, explaining what Microsoft’s co-founder could do to short bitcoin.\nTyler Winklevoss together with his twin brother Cameron, who are notoriously known for suing Facebook, invested $11 million in the new financial technology in April 2013, when the price of bitcoin was $120 per each crypto coin. Nowadays their bitcoin assets are estimated to be worth upward $834 million if they have sold no virtual coins since. Former Goldman President Predicts the Creation of a New Global Cryptocurrency\nGary Cohn, former President of Goldman Sachs and former chief economic advisor to the current US President, suggests that a brand-new digital currency will be dominant on the world’s financial market, but it will definitely not be bitcoin.\nCohn also stated that the new global virtual coin would be simpler and easier for potential users to understand than the coins operating on the cryptocurrency market now. The Secret Behind Facebook Management and Blockchain Division Launch\nFacebook revised the roles of its product executives on Tuesday which resulted in a new division that was weird in nature.

As of mid-morning, bitcoin was at the $8,600 per single coin level, down from yesterday’s high of $9,300.\nThe rest of the market was also in correction, with Bitcoin Cash, Ripple XRP and EOS particularly hard hit, losing as much as 15 percent of their value.\nToday’s raid on the largest crypto currency exchange in Korea spooked investors, as one of the prime drivers of pricing was suddenly under fire after the country looked like its regulators were settling down.\nBitcoin market highlights for the 24 hours ending May 11, 2018 at 1:00 pm U.S. Eastern Time\nThe highest price seen was $9,376.35 on the Huobi exchange at 1:12 pm yesterday. Huobi saw $206,952,000 of bitcoin change hands.\nThe lowest price seen was $8,457.38 on Binance’s exchange at 8:24 am today. Binance’s 24 hour volume was $428,257,000.\nThe average price on the surveyed exchanges, as weighed by volume, was $8,831.93.\nVolatility was greater than average, with the BlockTribune Volatility Index coming in at 61.3. A higher number indicates greater price volatility with 50 describing an average day.\nThese statistics were consolidated from 8 different exchanges. It includes only BTC/USD trades and only on those exchanges that had at least 1% of the total volume of BTC/USD trades during the measurement period.

The rot set in late Thursday and has accelerated since. Altcoins have fallen even more heavily, which is not too surprising given outperformance against bitcoin during the recent rally.\nToday, bitcoin is down 6.8%, with top alts off by 10-15%, suggesting the failure of bitcoin to break above its 200-day moving average at $10,000 has shattered gathering bullish confidence.\nAltcoins have taken a hammering: Cardano is down 17%, IOTA 17.5% lower, Ripple off 15% and Ethereum is down 10%. South Korea ' s UpBit exchange under investigation, Mt.Gox whale dump\nNews from South Korea may account for the sudden dramatic reversal in the markets over the past 24 hours. The country's largest exchange UpBit is being investigated by the authorities regarding accusations of fraud, according to media in the country. UpBit's offices have been raided and computer equipment seized.\nAlso, Brian Kelly on CNBC's Fast Money Show claimed that the trustee in charge of the funds of the bankrupt Japanese Mt.Gox exchange may have offloaded as many as 8,000 bitcoin. Kelly is the founder of investment firm BKCM and is the manager of its Digital Asset Fund.\nAlso, the statements that came out of the annual general meeting of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders didn't help sentiment. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, the president and vice president respectively, doubled down on their previous sceptical pronouncements on crypto. Buffett attacked bitcoin as \"probably rat poison squared\" and was joined by Munger who described buying bitcoin as \"anti-social, stupid, immoral\".\nBill Gates was another well-known naysayer to pour cold water on the nascent asset class this week.\nThe pullback in the crypto markets reveals something of the fragility of the recent rally led by bitcoin.\nAccording to Datatrek's Nick Colas, who at the end of last week said the market was getting a bit ahead of itself, low wallet openings and a collapse in Google searches are key reasons for prospective investors to exercise caution. Colas was the first Wall Street analyst to cover bitcoin, and he is generally supportive of the industry. It is worth quoting the meat of what he had to say in his interview on CNBC.\n“Is now the right time to buy? No, for two fundamental reasons. The first is we are not seeing a lot of incremental engagement with people buying bitcoin for the first time. And like any new technologies you need new adopters to come in to make it more valuable and in terms of Google searches they are way down compared to the peaks of December and January - 85 to 90%.\n\"The second issue is we are not seeing a lot of wallet growth - people are not opening up a lot of new bitcoin wallets to purchase the asset. Growth in wallets was only 2% last month [April]; it was 5 to 7% per month all of last year.\"\nHuawei preinstalling crypto wallet on all its phones\nExciting news for the sector comes from Chinese mobile giant Huawei. It has launched an App Gallery that will be preinstalled on all its phones and includes BTC.com's cryptocurrency wallet.\nAlthough exchanges and initial coin offerings were banned in China last year, it is not illegal to own and use crypto. Huawei is the largest phone manufacturer in China and also owns the Honor brand.\nBTC.com is owned by China's Bitmain, the dominant crypto mining group globally. According to Bloomberg, Huawei is also seriously considering the manufacturing of a handset that can run blockchain applications. Blockchain projects such as Qtum, which has been expanding in China provides technology that would allow blockchain apps to run on mobile devices.\nJaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei Technologies' mobile services, said of the company's plans: \"From our leadership position in China, the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.\" Facebook sets up blockchain group\nOn Tuesday, tech news site Recode reported that Facebook had undertaken its most wide-ranging reorganisation ever, splitting the business into three divisions. In the division for \"New platforms and infra\" a new blockchain group has been created.\nThe blockchain efforts will be led by David Marcus, who was previously responsible for Messenger and breaking it out from Facebook as a separate app. Marcus is a former president of PayPal so knows a thing or two about payments, and at the end of last year joined the board of US exchange Coinbase.\nHowever, Facebook's move, although bolstering the credibility of the blockchain technology that underlies bitcoin and other crypto, could also be interpreted as a threat to existing startups in the space.\nThe Facebook blockchain group is only involved in exploratory work at this time, but when Marcus was running Messenger he did say he was not averse to one day bringing crypto payments to the messaging platform. Other use cases for blockchain might include, data protection and ID verification although the immutable features of blockchain might make such deployment problematic without further development. Gary Cohn sees global cryptocurrency ahead\nOther positive newsflow came from Gary Cohn, in a roundabout way. The former chief economic adviser to President Trump and a former president of investment bank Goldman Sachs, said he thinks there will eventually be a global cryptocurrency, but it won't be bitcoin. \"I'm not a big believer in bitcoin, I am a believer in blockchain technology. It will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency. It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it's created, how it moves and how people can use it.\"\nStaying in the US, Robinhood, the crypto trading app that has taken the US by storm, now boasting four million accounts and gaining a strong following among a younger crypto savvy crowd, completed a Series D funding round this week.\nThe trading startup raised $363 million (£268 million) in its latest fundraising drive, valuing the company at $5.6 billion. Robinhood has markets in bitcoin and Ethereum and provides data on 14 other coins and sees Coinbase with its 20 million customers as its main rival in the crypto exchange arena.\nChief executive Baiju Bhatt said: \"We expect by the end of the year to be either the largest or one of the largest crypto platforms out there. But we also really feel we'll have the absolute best experience for investing in crypto as well—from having a large variety of coins available to a more favourable cost structure – mainly no commissions – to just quality of product.\"\nRobinhood has four million accounts compared to Coinbase's customer base of 20 million, making the top US crypto exchange. Robinhood only has markets in bitcoin and Ethereum while Coinbase offers bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Both exchanges accept fiat deposits.\nRobinhood opened its crypto trading service in February and is available in 10 US states. Taking part in the latest funding round were venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital , Kleiner Perkins and Alphabet's venture arm Capital G. More bullish price targets and Israeli crypto comes to town\nOther news saw a price target of $64,000 slapped on bitcoin by a FundStrat analyst extrapolating from hash power (computing power) on the network. \"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" said head of data science research Sam Doctor in a report from the US research company.\nIn other price forecast news, Roger Ver, aka \"Bitcoin Jesus\" because of his early evangelism for bitcoin, thinks that Ethereum could be worth more than bitcoin by the end of the year. Ver is also a vocal backer of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) which he hopes will replace bitcoin as the \"real bitcoin\".\n\"Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020,\" he claimed, which his critics might say was more an attempt to undermine bitcoin and boost BCH than anything else.\nHe followed up those comments with a strong pump for BCH: \"Bitcoin Cash has more than doubled in value in the last month and big investors coming in soon could see it double again by next week. People love to chase a rising star.\"\nThe 19th UK Israel Technology Event takes place on 15 May in London, and provides interested parties with the chance to get a ground-floor view of the tech and, in particular, the crypto scene in Israel, where Tel Aviv has emerged as one of the world's major development centres and home for blockchain startups.\nPresale Ventures is one of the companies that will be exhibiting. It is a seed venture fund for crypto projects, looking to invest in blockchain project even before they've got to the presale initial coin offering (ICO) stage.\nDavid Hava, Presales Ventures chief business development officer, in exclusive comments to Interactive Investor, said: \"We have a unique new model, which provides exclusive early-bird investment opportunities into blockchain startups before their ICO events, maximally reducing investment risks and increasing ROI. Our team is well-known leaders in the Israeli technology sector and has accumulatively over 30 years of experience.\"\nICOs are high-risk investments and are not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.\nSpeaking of ICOs, blockchain project EOS's year-long ICO comes to an end on 1 June. The token, which has been trading on exchanges during this period, is currently down 15% at $15.4, but there is great interest in the launch of its Mainnet, scheduled to happen shortly after the end of the ICO.\nSocial trading platform eToro released a research paper on the EOS platform today and it is available here .\nThese articles are provided for information purposes only.

Here's the full story. Bitcoin https://www.profitconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-and-stock-market-300x198.jpg [caption id=\"attachment_127241\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"] iStock.com/KeremYucel[/caption] Bitcoin Prices Are Less Independent Than You Think Inside the world of cryptocurrencies, some truths go unquestioned: 1) centralization is terrible, 2) fixed money supplies are great, 3) cryptocurrencies are uncorrelated from stocks. The last “truth” is now in question. Many analysts, myself included, have raised questions about Bitcoin following the stock market before, but none of us made the case as strongly as Forbes contributor Clem Chambers. Chambers recently used intraday trade charts to show that Bitcoin prices often follow the same patterns as the Dow Jones Index. (Source: \" Bitcoin Price Is Correlated To Stocks ,\" Forbes , May 8, 2018.) In other words, he showed that Bitcoin and the Dow are connected. He offered a specific Dow chart to back up his claims. It showed that a rise in the Index often precedes a rise in Bitcoin prices and vice versa. As for the \"why\" of the situation, there's a simple explanation: It’s the Federal Reserve . Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, the central bank has tried to tempt investors into something known as a \"carry trade\" . This simply means that Wall Street borrows money at record low interest rates to invest in high-yield assets. If you’ve watched the markets for the last decade, you probably recognize it. The Fed pumped so-called “easy money” into the economy, and the result was a stock market boom from 2009 to now. But that world is falling apart. The Fed raised interest rates five times in the last two years. “Trillions of levered QE dollars have pushed the stock market to epic highs,” wrote Chambers. “This process is being unwound and because of that the markets have become extremely volatile.” (Source: Ibid.) Why Should Investors Care? Scroll down the Dow Jones Index and you’ll see only 30 names, all of them steeped in American history. It’s an exclusive list of blue-chip stocks— Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)—that appear in almost every major portfolio in the world. That amount of liquidity makes the Dow extremely sensitive to changes in the interest rate. Bitcoin, on the other hand, takes some time to respond because trades don’t happen instantly—they sometimes take several hours, if not days. This lag time in Bitcoin trading presents an opportunity. Studious traders can watch the Dow Jones to see if it breaks a tough price point, then execute a similar trade for BTC/USD. But let’s zoom out to 10,000 feet for a moment. There’s a bitter irony in the Dow influencing what happens to Bitcoin prices. Satoshi Nakamoto (the mysterious creator of Bitcoin) would probably shudder at the thought. After all, he made Bitcoin to replace the existing financial system, not to operate as a cute subdivision. Bitcoin enthusiasts often claim this anti-Fed attitude is what makes cryptocurrency so invaluable. I disagree. What makes cryptocurrency special is the ability to decentralize information structures, build smart contracts, or create an infallible record of something. I’m a big fan of these non-political uses of cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, big chunks of the community remain obsessed with toppling central banks and other such cartoonish goals. If anything, the link between Bitcoin and the Dow shatters any myth that BTC/USD prices are driven by an earnest evaluation of cryptocurrency adoption. It isn’t. Traders don’t care whether people are using Bitcoin to pay for Subway sandwiches—they care about the potential return. Speculation, more than anything else, is driving both Bitcoin prices and the Dow Jones Index through the roof. I don’t think the same is true for Ethereum or Ripple, both which provide value to real businesses. Analyst Take If you're trying to make a quick buck trading cryptocurrencies, this intraday correlation is something you can use to your advantage. However, I am a fundamentals/strategy guy. I like to evaluate the end game of a cryptocurrency. So, my favorites are, and will always be, those investments that actually do something in the real world. By Gaurav S.

It’s an exclusive list of blue-chip stocks— Boeing Co ( NYSE:BA ), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)—that appear in almost every major portfolio in the world.\nThat amount of liquidity makes the Dow extremely sensitive to changes in the interest rate. Bitcoin, on the other hand, takes some time to respond because trades don’t happen instantly—they sometimes take several hours, if not days.\nThis lag time in Bitcoin trading presents an opportunity. Studious traders can watch the Dow Jones to see if it breaks a tough price point, then execute a similar trade for BTC/ USD .\nBut let’s zoom out to 10,000 feet for a moment.\nThere’s a bitter irony in the Dow influencing what happens to Bitcoin prices. Satoshi Nakamoto (the mysterious creator of Bitcoin) would probably shudder at the thought. After all, he made Bitcoin to replace the existing financial system, not to operate as a cute subdivision.\nBitcoin enthusiasts often claim this anti-Fed attitude is what makes cryptocurrency so invaluable.\nI disagree.\nWhat makes cryptocurrency special is the ability to decentralize information structures, build smart contracts, or create an infallible record of something.\nI’m a big fan of these non-political uses of cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, big chunks of the community remain obsessed with toppling central banks and other such cartoonish goals.\nIf anything, the link between Bitcoin and the Dow shatters any myth that BTC/USD prices are driven by an earnest evaluation of cryptocurrency adoption. It isn’t. Traders don’t care whether people are using Bitcoin to pay for Subway sandwiches—they care about the potential return.\nSpeculation, more than anything else, is driving both Bitcoin prices and the Dow Jones Index through the roof. I don’t think the same is true for Ethereum or Ripple, both which provide value to real businesses. Analyst Take\nIf you’re trying to make a quick buck trading cryptocurrencies, this intraday correlation is something you can use to your advantage. However, I am a fundamentals/strategy guy. I like to evaluate the end game of a cryptocurrency.\nSo, my favorites are, and will always be, those investments that actually do something in the real world.\nThis post first appeared on Profit Confidential.
