The market cap now stands at US$144.86 billion, with US$1.64 billion traded in the past 24 hours. On the network side, hash rate and difficulty continue to push record highs, with ongoing shipments of ASICs from multiple mining companies, including Bitmain and Halong.\nAlthough the original Bitcoin Whitepaper described Proof of Work (PoW) as “one-CPU-one-vote,” the lead SIA coin developer David Vorick argues that “for any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware.” Drastic increases in ASIC usage can have a detrimental long term effect as they increase the likelihood of smaller independent miners being squeezed out of the market. The highest percentage of mining will continue to concentrate in large mining farms, where economies of scale and cheap electricity are available.\nFurthermore, ASIC chips are typically manufactured by a small number of technology companies, meaning the bulk of the network is running on the same hardware. If that hardware is found to be faulty or exploitable, the entire network is at risk.\nConcerns over PoW have not been limited to ASIC proliferation. A recent presentation by Alex de Vries of Price Waterhouse Cooper in the Netherlands, “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem,” concludes that Bitcoin currently consumes at least 2.55 GW of electricity, and is on pace to consume 7.67 GW in the near future.\nThis leaves the networks energy consumption comparable to countries such as Ireland now (3.1 GW) and Austria in the future (8.2 GW). Others see this as an energy revolution opportunity.

The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor.

About 3 years ago, we started working with a new direction: Prevent. As you know the most effective way to make money in the brush using Dumps + PIN at an ATM to get cash immediately. You can go directly to the account of the cardholder. ATM is more limited than in all dumping using (as usual it did not even have any restrictions, so you can get all the money that is available on the balance). The risk is minimal, because you will never get the \"Decline\" or \"Hold-Call\" or something like this - you will always get the cash. Withdrawals take several minutes. 100 Dumps + PIN you can draw them in one day, even by yourself only. The average balance on the card is around $ 2000 - $ 4000 and you do not need to pay any percentage for anyone or just get some money in return. As I said above, we have worked with some of our customers by this way about 3 years ago and the results were really impressive. In 3 years, we have collected the statistics, do research, prepare everything for the next step in this direction and now we're ready to show a very good service for our customers I will help most of them to make money really good Contact me via Mail: Jeanson.ancheta ICQ: 675499345 Y!!M: Jeanson.ancheta@yahoo.com http://shop-dumps-us.blogspot.com List DUMPS for customer (USA/CANADA/UK/AU/EU) USA DUMPS : USA Visa | MasterCard Classic-Standard USA Visa | MasterCard Gold | Premier -

As much 30% of exchange traffic now comes from the Middle East. This is vastly different than a year ago were almost no traffic came from the region.\nThe Blockchain Revolution is real and taking over all over the Middle East from UAE to Turkey. These customers are moving vast sums of into Crypto even as governments continue to ban them, but they are not moving into Crypto for investment reasons like China or the U.S. but because of fear of holding onto devaluing local currencies.\nMany countries in the Middle East have unstable currencies and people are frantically trying to prevent loss of local fiat currency values. The Syrian Pound is down over 90% in the last few years, and even in stable Countries like Egypt has lost 62% in the last 5 years. Lately the mad dash has come from Turkey were the Lira has lost 13% in the past month and over 60% in the past few years. Troubling numbers if you have any wealth or want to save money for retirement.\nFirms and wealthy people are running to Crypto in record numbers. The Middle East is in a currency crisis and creating pressure on businesses and individuals to find a safe haven other then local fiat currencies. Many people are saying if Crypto falls they will still be better off then dropping 13% like the Turkish Lira did this past month.\nWorld Coin Network the future of Middle East Crypto Currency, announced today it has successfully launched on several exchanges. They plan to become the leading Crypto Currency of the Middle East and help millions of people through this crisis. They have teams working with local exchanges in several countries to help people safe guard their wealth.\nWCN Coins are listed on the following exchanges:\n1) Iquant Exchange - Based in Hong Kong 2) Karsha.biz - Based in Dubai 3) TradeDex - Coming Soon\nWorld Coin Network initiative lending programs and payment gateways will allow WCN to be trading as easily as sending a text.

The research reveals cybercriminals are evolving their attack methods to increase their success rates and speed infections. While ransomware continues to impact organizations in destructive ways, there are indications that some cybercriminals now prefer hijacking systems and using them for cryptomining rather than holding them for ransom. For a detailed view of the findings and some important takeaways for CISOs read the blog. “We face a troubling convergence of trends across the cybersecurity landscape. Malicious cyber actors are demonstrating their efficiency and agility by exploiting the expanding digital attack surface, taking advantage of newly announced zero-day threats, and maximizing the accessibility of malware for bad”, said Phil Quade, chief information security officer, Fortinet. “In addition, IT and OT teams often don’t have the resources necessary to keep systems appropriately hardened or protected. Luckily, implementing a security fabric which prioritizes —speed, integration, advanced analytics, and risk-based decision making— can enable comprehensive protection at machine speed and scale.” Highlights of the report follow: Cybercrime Attack Methods Evolve to Ensure Success at Speed and Scale Data indicates that cybercriminals are getting better and more sophisticated in their use of malware and leveraging newly announced zero-day vulnerabilities to attack at speed and scale. While the number of exploit detections per firm dropped by 13% in Q1 of 2018, the number of unique exploit detections grew by over 11%, while 73% of companies experienced a severe exploit. Spike in Cryptojacking: Malware is evolving and becoming more difficult to prevent and detect. The prevalence of cryptomining malware more than doubled from quarter to quarter from 13% to 28%. Additionally, cryptojacking was quite prevalent in the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. Cryptomining malware is also showing incredible diversity for such a relatively new threat. Cybercriminals are creating stealthier file-less malware to inject infected code into browsers with less detection. Miners are targeting multiple operating systems as well as different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Monero. They are also fine tuning and adopting delivery and propagation techniques from other threats based on what was successful or unsuccessful to improve future success rates. Targeted Attacks for Maximum Impact: The impact of destructive malware remains high, particularly as criminals combine it with designer attacks. For these types of more targeted attacks, criminals conduct significant reconnaissance on an organization before launching an attack, which helps them to increase success rates. Afterwards, once they permeate the network, attackers move laterally across the network before triggering the most destructive part of their planned attack. The Olympic Destroyer malware and the more recent SamSam ransomware are examples where cybercriminals combined a designer attack with a destructive payload for maximum impact. Ransomware Continues to Disrupt: The growth in both the volume and sophistication of ransomware continues to be a significant security challenge for organizations. Ransomware continues to evolve, leveraging new delivery channels such as social engineering, and new techniques such as multi-stage attacks to evade detection and infect systems. GandCrab ransomware emerged in January with the distinction of being the first ransomware to require Dash cryptocurrency as a payment. BlackRuby and SamSam were two other ransomware variants that emerged as major threats during the first quarter of 2018. Multiple Attack Vectors: Although the side channel attacks dubbed Meltdown and Spectre dominated the news headlines during the quarter, some of the top attacks targeted mobile devices or known exploits on router, web or Internet technologies. 21% of organizations reported mobile malware, up 7%, demonstrating that IoT devices continue to be targeted. Cybercriminals also continue to recognize the value of exploiting known vulnerabilities that haven’t been patched as well as recently discovered zero-days for increased opportunity. Microsoft continued to be the number one target for exploits, and routers took the number two spot in total attack volume. Content Management Systems (CMS) and web oriented technologies were also heavily targeted. Cyber Hygiene - More Than Just Patching: Measuring how long botnet infections persist based on the number of consecutive days in which continued communications are detected reveals that hygiene involves more than just patching. It is also about cleanup. Data showed that 58.5% of botnet infections are detected and cleaned up the same day. 17.6% of botnets persist for two days in a row and 7.3% last three days. About 5% persist for more than a week. As an example, the Andromeda botnet was taken down in Q4 2017 but data from Q1 found it showing prominently in both volume and prevalence. Attacks Against Operational Technology (OT): While OT attacks are a smaller percentage of the overall attack landscape, the trends are concerning. This sector is increasingly becoming connected to the Internet, with serious potential ramifications for security. Currently, the vast majority of exploit activity is directed against the two most common industrial communication protocols because they are widely-deployed and therefore highly-targeted. Data shows that in Asia ICS exploit attempts appear to be somewhat more prevalent when comparing the prevalence of ICS exploit activity across other regions. Fighting Evolving Cybercrime Requires Integrated Security The threat data in this quarter’s report reinforces many of the prediction trends unveiled by the Fortinet FortiGuard Labs global research team for 2018 demonstrating that the best defense against intelligent and automated threats is an integrated, broad, and automated security fabric. A highly aware and proactive security defense system is needed to keep pace with the next generation of automated and AI-based attacks. Report Methodology The Fortinet Global Threat Landscape Report is a quarterly view that represents the collective intelligence of FortiGuard Labs drawn from Fortinet’s vast array of sensors during Q1 2018. Research data covers global, regional, industry sector, and organizational perspectives. It focuses on three central and complementary aspects of that landscape, namely application exploits, malicious software, and botnets. It also examines important zero-day vulnerabilities. To complement the report, Fortinet publishes a free, subscription-based Threat Intelligence Brief that reviews the top malware, virus, and web-based threats discovered every week, along with links to valuable FortiGuard Labs threat research.

For these types of more targeted attacks, criminals conduct significant reconnaissance on an organization before launching an attack, which helps them to increase success rates. Afterwards, once they permeate the network, attackers move laterally across the network before triggering the most destructive part of their planned attack. The Olympic Destroyer malware and the more recent SamSam ransomware are examples where cybercriminals combined a designer attack with a destructive payload for maximum impact. Ransomware Continues to Disrupt: The growth in both the volume and sophistication of ransomware continues to be a significant security challenge for organizations. Ransomware continues to evolve, leveraging new delivery channels such as social engineering, and new techniques such as multi-stage attacks to evade detection and infect systems. GandCrab ransomware emerged in January with the distinction of being the first ransomware to require Dash cryptocurrency as a payment. BlackRuby and SamSam were two other ransomware variants that emerged as major threats during the first quarter of 2018. Multiple Attack Vectors: Although the side channel attacks dubbed Meltdown and Spectre dominated the news headlines during the quarter, some of the top attacks targeted mobile devices or known exploits on router, web or Internet technologies. 21% of organizations reported mobile malware, up 7%, demonstrating that IoT devices continue to be targeted. Cybercriminals also continue to recognize the value of exploiting known vulnerabilities that haven’t been patched as well as recently discovered zero-days for increased opportunity. Microsoft continued to be the number one target for exploits, and routers took the number two spot in total attack volume. Content Management Systems (CMS) and web oriented technologies were also heavily targeted. Cyber Hygiene - More Than Just Patching: Measuring how long botnet infections persist based on the number of consecutive days in which continued communications are detected reveals that hygiene involves more than just patching. It is also about cleanup. Data showed that 58.5% of botnet infections are detected and cleaned up the same day. 17.6% of botnets persist for two days in a row and 7.3% last three days. About 5% persist for more than a week. As an example, the Andromeda botnet was taken down in Q4 2017 but data from Q1 found it showing prominently in both volume and prevalence. Attacks Against Operational Technology (OT): While OT attacks are a smaller percentage of the overall attack landscape, the trends are concerning. This sector is increasingly becoming connected to the Internet, with serious potential ramifications for security. Currently, the vast majority of exploit activity is directed against the two most common industrial communication protocols because they are widely-deployed and therefore highly-targeted. Data shows that in Asia ICS exploit attempts appear to be somewhat more prevalent when comparing the prevalence of ICS exploit activity across other regions. Fighting Evolving Cybercrime Requires Integrated Security The threat data in this quarter’s report reinforces many of the prediction trends unveiled by the Fortinet FortiGuard Labs global research team for 2018 demonstrating that the best defense against intelligent and automated threats is an integrated, broad, and automated security fabric . A highly aware and proactive security defense system is needed to keep pace with the next generation of automated and AI-based attacks. Report Methodology The Fortinet Global Threat Landscape Report is a quarterly view that represents the collective intelligence of FortiGuard Labs drawn from Fortinet’s vast array of sensors during Q1 2018. Research data covers global, regional, industry sector, and organizational perspectives. It focuses on three central and complementary aspects of that landscape, namely application exploits, malicious software, and botnets. It also examines important zero-day vulnerabilities. To complement the report, Fortinet publishes a free, subscription-based Threat Intelligence Brief that reviews the top malware, virus, and web-based threats discovered every week, along with links to valuable FortiGuard Labs threat research.

These and other controversies surrounding cryptocurrencies have induced varying governance responses by central banks, government ministries, international organizations, and industry regulators worldwide. Besides formal attempts to ban Bitcoin, there have been multifaceted efforts to incorporate elements of blockchains, the peer-to-peer technology underlying cryptocurrencies, in the wider exchange, recording, and broadcasting of digital transactions. Blockchains are being mobilized to support and extend an array of governance activities. The novelty and breadth of growing blockchain-based activities have fuelled both utopian promises and dystopian fears regarding applications of the emergent technology to Bitcoin and beyond.\nThis volume brings scholars of anthropology, economics, Science and Technology Studies, and sociology together with GPE scholars in assessing the actual implications posed by Bitcoin and blockchains for contemporary global governance.

Advertisement By The Citizen Reporter @TheCitizeTZ news@tz.nationmedia.com\nArusha. The buzz about Bitcoins is driven by speculation, an expert said here at the weekend, calling upon Tanzanians to be cautions injecting their money into cryptocurrencies.\nThe director of treasury and financial markets at CRDB Bank Plc, Mr Alex Ngusaru, told the bank’s shareholders at the weekend that one should think twice before putting investing his/her money into Bitcoins dues to their unpredictable trends.\n“The decision to invest remains purely on the interested individual. However, I would advise that you only invest in Bitcoins when you have enough extra income,” he said. The figures he produced at the seminar, which was conducted prior to the CRDB’s 23rd Annual General Meeting (AGM), showed just how speculation is driving the value for Bitcoins. On December 15, 2017, the bitcoin registered its highest value with one bitcoin exchanging at $20,000 (roughly Sh44.4 million).\nHowever, on March 31, 2018, the value fell to $7,000 (Sh159 million). As of Thursday, it had picked to $8,500 ( slightly over Sh190 million). “Rumours is what makes the value of the bitcoin to rise. This is not the right avenue to invest the money if you don’t have extra cash,” he said. Cryptocurrencies are digital monies that use cryptic algorithms for security and run on a complex code system called blockchain.\nCryptocurrency transactions are generally anonymous and are not subject to any government or central bank regulation. Regulators warn that since cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any central bank, they are a safe haven for money laundering, terrorism financing, tax evasion and fraud.\nA number of high-profile bankers have, at different times, warned against investing in cryptocurrencies.\nThe former Bank of Tanzania Governor, Prof Benno Ndulu, said late last year that Tanzanians involved with cryptocurrencies were doing so at their own risks. “We have also heard that there are some groups of people in the country engaging in the business, but my message for now is that they should understand that they are putting themselves at risk and we can’t help in case anything bad happens,” Prof Ndulu was quoted as saying last year.\nTidjane Thiam, the chief executive officer for Credit Suisse - a Swiss multinational investment bank and financial services company based in Zürich – said late last year that most banks in the current state of regulation have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency, which has anti-money-laundering challenges.\nThiam added: “From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.” advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex ngusaru", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crdb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crdb bank plc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "arusha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T11:11:19.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e8f44ade1206e3a87fc6407a11149c59f0a0d68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Rec8ynsrZtlRbEi_CySh3LiuCsH3IoI0QSw4Cm7cR1W3LByM.JDDqy0swNYG6FHM2QT1BdldiFmmLI1XsWnd7tR4ZXpgdrZcs-", "site_full": "alzibluk.com", "site": "alzibluk.com", "site_section": "http://alzibluk.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Al Zibluk:  Just Keeping It Real", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis – Consolidation continues", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis – Consolidation continues", "published": "2018-05-21T08:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e8f44ade1206e3a87fc6407a11149c59f0a0d68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Rec8ynsrZtlRbEi_CySh3LiuCsH3IoI0QSw4Cm7cR1W3LByM.JDDqy0swNYG6FHM2QT1BdldiFmmLI1XsWnd7tR4ZXpgdrZcs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Zibluk", "published": "2018-05-21T08:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis – Consolidation continues", "text": "Bitcoin Price Analysis – Consolidation continues\nBitcoin (BTC) has continued to seesaw, sliding 20% since May 6th and then recovering slightly over the past few days. The market cap now stands at US$144.86 billion, with US$1.64 billion traded in the past 24 hours.\nOn the network side, hash rate and difficulty continue to push record highs, with ongoing shipments of ASICs from multiple mining companies, including Bitmain and Halong. Although the original Bitcoin Whitepaperdescribed Proof of Work (PoW) as “one-CPU-one-vote,” the lead SIA coin developer David Vorick argues that “for any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware.”\nFurthermore, ASIC chips are typically manufactured by a small number of technology companies, meaning the bulk of the network is running on the same hardware. If that hardware is found to be faulty or exploitable, the entire network is at risk.\nConcerns over PoW have not been limited to ASIC proliferation. A recent presentation by Alex de Vries of Price Waterhouse Cooper in the Netherlands, “Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem,” concludes that Bitcoin currently consumes at least 2.55 GW of electricity, and is on pace to consume 7.67 GW in the near future. This leaves the networks energy consumption comparable to countries such as Ireland now (3.1 GW) and Austria in the future (8.2 GW).\nOthers see this as an energy revolution opportunity. Peter Van Valkenburg of CoinCenter, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency in Washington D.C., has argued that instead of destroying the planet, Bitcoin will push the energy market towards more sustainable alternatives, driving an energy revolution. Mining in Canada and Iceland uses hydro and geothermal power, while wind and solar are among the cheapest energy sources available. Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos shares this view and has questioned the hidden resource needs required by other payment platforms.\nHowever, the number of network nodes has fallen slightly over the past few months after reaching more than 12,500 in November. These statistics include mining and non-mining nodes. Although archival nodes are not incentivized directly with a block reward, they ensure network consensus. Based on global distribution, the United States and Germany have the highest percentage of nodes.\nTransactions per day remain down sharply from the record high in December, above 400k, and are currently below 200k per day. Transactions have not only declined due to a lack of usage but also transaction batching, where one transaction is sent to many addresses at once instead of each transaction being sent individually.\nUsing an adjusted network value to transactions (NVT) ratio, BTC remains in the upper-third of historical NVT value. While NVT has not been this high since January 2015 it has begun to turn downward recently, which suggests increasing on-chain network utility based on the dollar amount being transacted.\nAlthough NVT is difficult to compare between coins, which use different transactions types, the ratio can be used to assess the network’s relative utility over time. DOGE is the only coin that has had an NVT consistently lower than BTC (not shown). Additionally, inflexion points in NVT ratio can be correlated to extreme highs or lows in price.\nTransaction fees, which increased dramatically throughout 2017, have also declined significantly. This fee reduction is also multifactorial. Although a decrease in transactions per day means fewer transactions needing to be cleared, SegWit, which currently accounts for 39% of transactions, has also been a significant contributing factor to the average fee decline.\nThe SegWit soft fork also enabled second layer network upgrades like the Lightning Network. Since going live on March 15, the Lightning Network (LN) has continued to gain traction as new channels come online and apps are created.\nThe software solution enables trusted, bidirectional, off-chain, hub and spoke payment channels and also promises the possibility of instant payments, microtransactions, and increased scalability. The channels work much like a tab at a restaurant, which remains open until the client settles the bill. This format allows for numerous transactions to occur without a network fee until the channel is closed.\nAt Consensus NYC, Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey and Lightning Labs co-founder and CEO Elizabeth Stark discussed their vision for the future of payments. Dorsey, who had an early interest in hacker and cypherpunk movements, was also an investor in a Lightning Labs seed round.\nDorsey focused on the need to keep Bitcoin an open source project and the need for a native currency of the internet. He also hinted at a Square and Lightning partnership down the road saying, \"We want to go back to that original idea of being able to purchase a coffee with it. And that's why we're working with Lightning Labs. Whatever it takes to get there, we're going to make sure it happens.\"\nDuring his keynote speech at Consensus, eToro CEO Yoni Assia announced a new American crypto platform which will be trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Ethereum Classic, NEO, and EOS. Cryptocurrency trading on eToro increased by 4,500% in 2017, according to MarketWatch.\nBitcoin exchange traded volume this week has been led by the Tether (USDT) and USD markets for the fourth consecutive week, mostly on Binance, OKEX, and Bitfinex. In Asia, the JPY volume strongly leads the pack, thanks to friendly regulations and oversight, including declaring Bitcoin legal tender. The KRW premium is currently at 1.78%. CNY volume continues to fade.\nGlobally reported over the counter (OTC) volume from LocalBitcoins.com remains sharply down from December and January but has begun to increase again. Venezuela continues to post record highs in Bolivar volume, fueled by hyperinflation. Thus far, the hyperinflation rate has followed an almost identical trajectory as the Weimar Republic. The Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro Moros, won the national election earlier today.\nTechnical Analysis\nBitcoin continues to drift sideways on low volume, with an inability to establish a clean trend on high timeframes. The status of any emerging or nascent trend can be determined using Moving Averages, Chart Patterns, Ichimoku Cloud, and Pitchforks. Further background information on the technical analysis discussed below can be found here.\nOn the daily chart, open long/short interest on Bitfinex leans long, with shorts flat and longs rising (top panel, chart below). Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) have gone flat, suggesting price consolidation. Price has fallen below the 200EMA with a bearish 50/200EMA cross.\nPrice structure shows a multi-month symmetrical triangle, or coil. In Technical Analysis of Stock Trends (1948), Edwards and Magee suggest that roughly 75% of these triangles lead to a continuation of the trend, while the rest mark reversals. In any case, this pattern will be a ‘trade the breakout’ situation because it will likely lead to weeks of trend follow through. Breakouts post consolidation typically occur after at least 66% of the triangle has completed (yellow highlight).\nTurning to the Ichimoku Cloud on the weekly chart, there are four metrics; the current price in relation to the Cloud, the color of the Cloud (red for bearish, green for bullish), the Tenkan (T) and Kijun (K) cross, and the Lagging Span. The best entry always occurs when most of the signals flip from bearish to bullish, or vice versa.\nThe Cloud metrics on the weekly time frame are; price above Cloud, bullish Cloud, bullish TK cross, and Lagging Span above price and Cloud. Together, these signals suggest the trend is bullish, and will remain bullish until a bearish TK cross or price dips below the Cloud.\nPrice itself is below the Kijun and, seemingly, in no-man’s land. Price and volume structures suggest the possibility of an unconventional inverted head and shoulders, a bullish reversal pattern. A long entry would not be warranted until price is above the Kijun, essentially also above the neckline of the head and shoulders chart pattern.\nThe Cloud metrics on the daily time frame are; price inside Cloud, bearish Cloud, bullish TK cross, and Lagging Span above price but below Cloud. A long entry based on traditional Cloud rules does not occur until the Cloud is breached by price, currently at ~US$11,586. However, a long reversal trade opportunity known as the Edge to Edge (E2E) trade can be taken advantage of with the current Cloud structure.\nA long entry based on the E2E trade occurred several days ago, with a stop loss below the Kijun. Price dropped out of Cloud and below the Kijun, suggesting any active longs should be closed at that time. Although price has breached Cloud resistance for the second time, traders may avoid entering a second E2E trade this quickly as the previous E2E trade failed.\nAn E2E failing to reach its target is often an indication of additional consolidation being needed before price momentum returns. Price typically follows through with the direction of the E2E trade, but not until the Kumo twist, which in this case will occur after June 19th.\nThe Cloud metrics on the four hour time frame are; price below Cloud, bearish Cloud, bearish TK cross, and Lagging Span above price and below Cloud. A traditional long entry will not occur until price is above Cloud at ~US$8,942. An E2E long entry would trigger after a breach of Cloud at US$8,300. The previous four hour Kumo breakout led to a 27% price increase and both of the previous four hour E2E moves occurred in very few candles.\nPenultimately, price has returned to the original upward trending Pitchfork beginning in 2015, with anchor points in January, May, and August of that year. Price broke North of this trend in October 2017 and again currently sits in the upper limits. A downside target of US~$5,700 is possible should price return to the mean (red line) of the prior trend.\nastly, another Pitchfork on the daily chart starting in 2017, with anchor points in January, May, and July, shows price reaching a similar distance below the mean (red line) as was reached above the mean in December. Price has closed this pitchfork for several days suggesting bearish invalidation. If price returns to inside the Pitchfork, a return to the mean is possible.\nConclusion\nASICs continue to drive conversations about the network, both in terms of centralization and increasing power consumption. Network usage and fees remain relatively low with SegWit and Lightning metrics steadily increasing. Exchanges and go-to-market apps continue to be developed.\nTechnicals suggest ongoing consolidation with several failed bullish reversal attempts, based on Ichimoku Clouds and a longstanding Pitchfork. The structure of price consolidation suggests bullish continuation, which may occur as early as May 31st. If the consolidation results in further downside a bearish target of ~US$5,700 is likely, based on a multi-year Pitchfork.\nAuthor Josh Olszewicz, 21 May 2018\nPosted by David Ogden Entrepreneur\nAlan Zibluk Markethive Founding Member bitclub network Bitcoin Price Analysis Post navigation Hello, my name is Alan Zibluk.

The researcher behind the study, Alex de Vries, believes that this figure could potentially rise to as high as 7.67 gigawatts in the future.\nThe cryptocurrency demands significant computational power to solve complex hash calculations for processing financial transactions.\nEconomist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries said:\n“The primary fuel for each of these calculations is electricity. The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts).”\nThe research is based on speculative figures as there is no definitive way of calculating every miners’ power usage. There are 10,000 connected nodes, but each of these can represent a single machine or multiple machines.\n“A hashrate of 14 terahashes per second can either come from a single Antminer S9 running on just 1,372 watts, or more than half a million PlayStation 3 devices running on 40 megawatts,” de Vries said.\nA cryptocurrency mining farm in Iceland.

According to reports Bitcoin network now consumes as much electricity as the whole country of Ireland. Bitcoin is currently trading at $ 8501.11, in India the value is at Rs 5,78,180.\nBitcoins work on the decentralized ledger, which runs on computers across the globe. Unlike your bank where all transactions are centralized, Bitcoin transactions are validated by the group of miners and for validating and updating the transaction they are rewarded with a new Bitcoin.\nAccording to a report by Alex de Vries, the Dutch researcher, the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as Ireland. As reported, according to his estimates, “Bitcoin miners use at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” De Vries considers that electricity makes up 60 percent of the total cost of mining Bitcoin. He also states in his paper that the average cost of electricity around the world is 5 cents per KWh.\nMany people have, however, started raising questions on the way electricity consumption has been calculated. The fact that not much data is available on the subject negates the study. Moreover, miners which are the only source of information are spread across the globe and are not so willing to share information on them.\nAs the number of miners increase, the reward decreases whereas time-taken to process the cryptocurrency increases. According to estimates, it is currently 12.5 Bitcoin per 10 minutes. The number has slowed down considering it was 50 Bitcoins every 10 minutes around 2010. The data suggest that mining requires more energy to run faster processors.\nMeanwhile, there have been reports that other cryptocurrencies, such as, Ethereum, is working on the technology that might need much less energy than Bitcoin and could, therefore, dethrone the largest currency by market share in the long run.

Following a steady start to the day that saw Bitcoin Cash take a minor fall to an intraday low $1,163.4, holding well above the day’s first major support level at $1,141.87, a morning rally saw Bitcoin Cash break through the day’s first major resistance level at $1,214.57 with relative ease to $1,250.5, coming within reach of the day’s second major resistance level at $1,252.63. For the market bulls, Bitcoin Cash’s hold above the first major resistance level through the morning supported an afternoon rally that saw Bitcoin Cash break through the second major resistance level at $1,252.63 to an intraday high $1,312.6. While the day’s high fell short of the third major resistance level at $1,325.33, selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,298 saw Bitcoin Cash pullback to sub-$1,300 levels by the day’s end. In spite of the day’s rally, failing to move clear of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level continues to support the near-term bearish trend. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 1.19% to $1,277.1, recovering from an early $1,257 low, with Bitcoin Cash facing plenty of resistance at $1,300, a morning high $1,304.9 failing to hold and more importantly, move clear of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level at $1,298. For the day ahead, with the weekend rally having provided some solid gains, Bitcoin Cash could be under pressure through the start of the week, investors continuing to be bearish in spite of double digit gains on Sunday. A move back through to $1,300 levels would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $1,351.07, breaking free of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level key for any sustainable rally through the day. Failure to move back through to $1,300 levels to test the day’s first major resistance level will likely see Bitcoin Cash give up some of Sunday’s gains, bringing the day’s first major support level at $1,141.87 into play, though we would expect Bitcoin Cash to avoid ending the day at sub-$1,200 levels, barring materially negative news hitting the wires. BCH/USD 21/05/18 Hourly Chart Litecoin Looking to Consolidate Litecoin gained 3.26% on Sunday, reversing Saturday’s 0.95% fall, to end the day at $139.39. An early morning slide to an intraday low $132.2 saw Litecoin fall through the day’s first major support level at $133.08 before finding support from a shift in sentiment across the broader market. Litecoin rallied through the day’s first major resistance level at $137.02 and second major resistance level at $139.08 to an intraday high $140.7, before easing back to $139 levels by the day’s end. Litecoin failed to move through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $142, affirming the bearish trend, with Litecoin ending the week down 3.49%. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 0.63% to $138.5, Litecoin facing strong resistance at $140, holding back a move to test selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $142 at the start of the day. Litecoin managed to recover from an early dip to a morning low 137.6, though a move back through $140 to the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $142 would be needed to support a possible bearish trend reversal in the early part of the week, the day’s first major resistance level also sitting at $142 levels. Story Continues Failure to move through $140 to test key resistance levels would likely see a reversal through the middle part of the day, bringing into play the day’s first major support level at $134.16. With the bearish trend intact, any material deterioration in market sentiment could see Litecoin test sub-$129 support levels for the first time since Friday, as investors continue to fret over what lies ahead form a regulatory standpoint. LTC/USD 21/05/18 Hourly Chart Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly Ripple Looking for a Positive Start to the Week Ripple’s XRP gained 3.43% on Sunday, reversing Saturday’s 0.49% loss, to end the day at $0.69852, down 4.62% for the week, Monday through Sunday. Ripple’s XRP tracked the broader market through the day, an early morning 0.66712 low holding above the day’s first major support level at $0.6592 before a late morning recovery and an afternoon rally saw Ripple’s XRP break through the day’s first major resistance level at $0.6905 and second major resistance level at $0.7070 to an intraday high $0.71105, testing selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level at $0.7112. While unable to hold on to $0.70 levels, Ripple’s XRP was able to hold above the first major resistance level by the day’s end, though failing to break through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level continued to support the bearish trend formed in late April. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down 0.23% to $0.69697, with an early fall to an intraday low $0.68722 holding above the day’s first major support level at $0.6734 before recovering to $0.69 levels, Ripple’s XRP facing plenty of resistance at $0.70 early in the day. For the day ahead, Ripple’s XRP would need to break through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.7112 to test the day’s first major resistance level at $0.7173 and the near-term bearish trend, with any moves through to $0.72 levels likely to be in the hands of sentiment across the broader market. Failure to move through to $0.71 levels in the middle part of the day would likely see Ripple’s XRP pullback through the morning’s low to test the day’s first major support level at $0.6734 before any support kicks in at sub-$0.67 levels.
