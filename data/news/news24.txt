Being a Roth IRA me that you’ve paid taxes over your contributions but not over any games that your account may earn. It has to be self-directed if you wish to invest in cryptocurrencies, however, as this is classed as an alternative asset under IRS rulings. So how do you find the best bitcoin Roth IRA ?\nHow to Find the Best Bitcoin Roth IRA\nIs the concept of placing bitcoin or other forms of cryptocurrency in an IRA is still relatively new. As a result, there are still few custodians who accept them. However, this is changing because the public is becoming increasingly interested in taking control of their own investment accounts and in adding cryptocurrencies to doze. The result is that you now have quite a few choices to make but not all of them are actually good ones period so what should you be looking for?\nFirst of all, you should only use a bitcoin IRA company that has been properly reviewed by both regular users like yourself and by the experts. You will find that there are very good companies out there that have only recently opened up and equally so that have been around for a long time. Length of service is perhaps not the most important factor as the concept of digital IRA is it still so new. In fact, it was only in 2014 that it became officially legal to use them.\nThere are other things that you may want to look for that can denote firstly the experience the company has with cryptocurrencies and secondly with dealing with investors like yourself. Some of those things include:\nThe commitment of the company makes towards educating you on what the different asset options are. The history of the company has in relation to cryptocurrencies as a whole. Some have even started as mining companies, which means they truly have an understanding of what cryptocurrencies are. The types of investment accounts that they offer. The Roth IRA is one of those, but so is the traditional IRA and the 401 k to name but a few. How much you have to pay in order to hold the account. Whether or not professional input is available should you want it. The minimum required amount for your initial investment. Which cryptocurrencies you can invest in . Bitcoin is perhaps the best known one, but there is also Ripple, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, and more. Whether they also offer other investment options such as precious metals. How they will keep your bitcoin investments safe. Whether or not you are required to set up as an LLC in order to be able to manage the account. With a little bit of time to research your options, you should be able to find the right account for your personal needs. Good luck with embarking on what could be the most lucrative investment of your life.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T01:31:29.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "454cd2d9eb8926a13ac1768f5352ee9674e19b53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVf2HBJ10IRjN", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Digatrade-Financial-Corp-DIGAF-20186/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Digatrade Financial Corp.

This along with state legislature lowering taxes for large data centers could provide a bona fide drive to companies looking for mining locations.\nProject Spokane, the company receiving the recent state grant, is said to be the first of its kind in Montana, and the state is the first to receive public funds to entice Bitcoin business to the region. State officials have previously been inspired by their observations of Bitcoin servers operating in two other northwest states, Washington and Oregon.\nIn terms of power consumption, one analysis estimated mid-2017 weekly Bitcoin transactions totaling 302,150 consuming the same power as 268,990 average homes, although other reports suggest this figure doubles every six months.\nBig Sky Business Journal points out that Bridge suggests that the media became most interested in cryptocurrency mining last year when it rocketed from USD 750 in January 2017 to nearly USD 20,000 in December the same year. “…no one seems to agree on what it is if it is interesting and whether or not it is just a passing fad,” said Bridges.\n Economist Forecasts Montana as Bitcoin Mining Haven 4", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinnews.com/economist-forecasts-montana-as-bitcoin-mining-haven/", "http://www.bigskybusinessjournal.com/business-news/5405-bitcoin-mining-finding-home-in-montana", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://bitcoinnews.com/", "https://t.me/bconews"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brandon bridge", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bureau of business and economic research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "big sky business journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:24:44.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "952a9a05c9244fc9e04efce69a4a69564e269387", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggnYlOBtiARuCZnnYPEVBwFkJifo4uunS4erFNgHOkDWLHVnBcsT6.XMAXRmvJ7npw6GtsEv4GJ0Lg--", "site_full": "sg.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/topic/economy", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business finance, stock market, quotes, news", "title": "Treading Water: Bitcoin Bulls Await Break Above $7,780", "title_full": "Treading Water: Bitcoin Bulls Await Break Above $7,780", "published": "2018-06-06T19:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZMSXf9p_9qcwrSNQqpwzvQ--~B/aD05MDY7dz0xNTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/5710dbaa657fd393ccdcb82e23ebb610", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "952a9a05c9244fc9e04efce69a4a69564e269387", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggnYlOBtiARuCZnnYPEVBwFkJifo4uunS4erFNgHOkDWLHVnBcsT6.XMAXRmvJ7npw6GtsEv4GJ0Lg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Coindesk", "published": "2018-06-06T19:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Treading Water: Bitcoin Bulls Await Break Above $7,780", "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) continues to operate in bearish territory and only a move above $7,780 would put the bulls back into the driver's seat, the technical charts indicate.\nAs of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,591 on Bitfinex.

2018 ·3:00 pm · Views: 772\nGoogle searches for ‘Bitcoin’ have dropped by 75% this year in direct correlation with the price, though people are still searching for the world’s top cryptocurrency than ‘Beyonce’ and ‘blockchain.’ ‘Bitcoin’ Google Searches Correlate With Price\nAccording to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, the drop in searches is a bad sign for prices.\n“We use Google Trends to track search queries for ‘Bitcoin’ as a proxy for potential new buyers,” Colas said in an email to clients Monday. “Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.”\n(Graph n umbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term).\nColas adds that growth in new cryptocurrency wallets have only increased by 3.7% this year, as opposed to 7.6% during the last quarter of 2017. Bitcoin Beats ‘Beyonce’ and Sometimes ‘Trump’\nWhen it comes down to it, mainstream media sources like to cast doubt on Bitcoin despite the natural tendency for searches to correlate with price. Though this is certainly a “chicken or the egg” argument.\nRegardless, Bitcoin is still the king of cryptocurrencies and is even proving to be a top contender when it comes to pop culture.\nIn the past month, searches for ‘Bitcoin’ have been greater than ‘Beyonce’, and are only a few points below ‘Trump’, who is arguably the most recognizable person in the world today.\nWhen we incorporate a few more popular search terms, we see that Bitcoin is more popular than Taylor Swift and even Kim Kardashian.\nMost notably, it even surpasses the World Cup for most of the year.\nSo despite all the fear, uncertainty and doubt being spread about waning interest in Bitcoin, the data clearly indicates that the world’s most popular cryptocurrency does not need a new narrative, and actually has captured global attention.\nIn fact, it was the second most popular Google search term in 2017.\nAlthough the 2018 search data indicates a waning interest in Bitcoin for the time being, it also isn’t the first time searches have dropped or that the crypto market isn’t growing.\nOver $9b has been raised from initial coin offerings this year, which is $5b more than all of last year. Meanwhile, new Bitcoin-based financial instruments with growing interest from traditional finance and Wall Street have been in the headlines all year.\nSo despite the current downtrend in Bitcoin searches , cryptocurrencies are definitely not going away anytime soon.\nWhy do you think Bitcoin searches are down?

Programmed with sophisticated algorithms and powerful features, the software is capable of helping its users generate stable returns. It is an exceptional tool that automatically places trades and delivers positive results.\nJune 6, 2018 /MarketersMedia/ —\nThe cryptocurrency industry is growing in popularity by the day. Bitcoin, which is the most popular digital currency of the era is believed to reach new highs in time to come. These days, people who don’t even have any kind of experience in investing are looking to enter the bitcoin industry. With the introduction of ground-breaking investment tools and software systems, it has become much easier and fruitful than it ever was to become a part of the trading community.\nThe Bitcoin Code is a powerful new tool that has been designed to help traders meet their trading goals. This comprehensive trading solution does all the hard work on behalf of its users. It employs smart functions and strategies that can make anyone’s trading experience extremely enjoyable and rewarding.\nWhen using the software, traders have to invest maximum of 30 minutes per day. With just a few clicks of the mouse button, traders can generate significant returns and accumulate massive earnings into the trading accounts.\nOne of the major specialties of the software is that it doesn’t require its users to possess any kind of skills or prior knowledge of trading. Traders don’t even have to watch any Youtube videos to get going with the software because it is so easy to use. Basically, there are no complications attached to using it at all.\nAccording to Steve McKay, this software is a one of its kind investment solution offered to traders. He says that this trading system doesn’t rely on past data or trading history, but it utilizes complex algorithms to look for favourable opportunities in the market. Even the primary program doesn’t need to be updated continually because the Bitcoin Code has the ability to predict the conditions in the market without needing all the previous records and data.\nThe features of the robot are quite unique because they work in combination to offer the best possible trading results. This system is certified and proven to work after numerous testing was conducted to ensure its reliability. Initial testing confirms that it has the capacity to reach accuracy rates which have not been witnessed before. Instead of relying heavily on past data, the software makes use of heuristic insight to carry out analysis of the market conditions and its behaviour. It takes into account increase and decrease in value of the digital currency as well as all the trading operations including instructions that are sent via the dashboard.\nThe approach with which the Bitcoin Code works eliminates human errors, which leads to more successful trades being executed. By using this trading solution, traders will be able to avoid risking their funds in manual trading. The algorithmic nature of the software allows traders to manage their trading portfolios effectively.\nTraders can get started in just few minutes and then sit back and relax while the software carries out the tasks on its own. The risks attached are minimal, but the opportunity to achieve financial freedom and become successful investors in the field of bitcoin trading is huge.\nEven if traders don’t have big capital investment, they can get started with the trading robot with ease. The brokers synced with the software are legit and they allow traders to get started with a small initial deposit only.\nContact Info:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cybermentors.org.uk/bitcoin-code/bitcoin-code-should-you-invest/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve mckay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T01:33:42.060+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "83b457f89a976f6451122c9c33a31d6b5526f187", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LsrywaGm7KZSa2klivwGf2g-", "site_full": "www.instaforex.com", "site": "instaforex.com", "site_section": "http://news.instaforex.com/en/analytics/rss/?x=BAED", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex analysis review", "title": "BITCOIN Analysis for June 6, 2018", "title_full": "BITCOIN Analysis for June 6, 2018", "published": "2018-06-06T18:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83b457f89a976f6451122c9c33a31d6b5526f187", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LsrywaGm7KZSa2klivwGf2g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T18:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN Analysis for June 6, 2018", "text": "06.06.2018 17:58 BITCOIN Analysis for June 6, 2018\nBitcoin has been quite indecisive and corrective recently below $8,000 area where no definite trend pressure can be observed.

The bullish bias in this case can be only trusted after the price breaks above $8,000 with a daily close which will push the price higher towards $10,000 in the future.

(OTC: HVBTF ), a Bitcoin stock focused on cryptocurrency mining, tells us this company has tons of potential. My research shows shares will at least double over the next 12 months.\nEditor's Pick: The Best Blockchain Stocks to Buy in 2018 May Surprise You\n\"My primary goal and only concern is building the value of the company,\" Giustra told Tommy Humphreys on a post on CEO.CA . \"This is typically a three- to five-year exercise and the daily share price does its thing in the meantime.\"\nA native of Canada, Giustra is known mainly for his successes in the precious metals mining and entertainment businesses.\nGiustra's financial wizardry helped turn junior miner Wheaton River Minerals into a powerhouse that Goldcorp Inc. (NYSE: GG ) acquired in 2005. A worker at a Genesis Mining facility works on a mining rig.\nIn 1997 he founded film and television company Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LGF.A , LGF.B ).\nToday Frank Giustra is chair of Leagold Mining as well as president and CEO of private equity firm Fiore Group.\nBut he isn't the only notable person associated with the Hive Blockchain project.\nFrank Holmes, chief investment officer at U.S. Global Investors Inc. (Nasdaq: GROW ), a leading mutual fund and asset-management firm, serves as chair of the company.\n\"Millionaire Maker\": A potential upgrade taking place behind the scenes could send the Bitcoin price to unprecedented highs. Few people even know about this game-changer. Click here to learn how you could make millions…\nMeanwhile, the largest shareholder in Hive Blockchain Technologies is Genesis Mining, the biggest cloud-crypto miner in the world. Genesis also operates the data centers in Iceland and Sweden where the mining takes place.\nIt's an impressive lineup for a company with a micro-cap valuation of just $277 million and a share price that sits in penny stock territory ($0.85 on the U.S. OTC market).\nAnd it means Hive Technologies is a great alternative way to invest in cryptocurrency without the hassle of buying and holding any actual crypto. (Canadian investors can buy Hive on the Toronto Exchange, TSX: HIVE .)\nHere's why this Bitcoin stock has attracted so many heavy hitters… Why Winners Like Frank Giustra Are Backing Hive Blockchain\nHive has carefully planned its strategy to become a global leader in crypto mining. It intends to focus initially on mining Ethereum and Bitcoin , the No. 1 and No. 2 cryptocurrencies, although it expects to add others.\nHive has several advantages over potential rivals. Genesis Mining brings five years of Bitcoin mining experience to the project and knows how to squeeze the most profits from a mining operation.\nThe factors a miner can control are the availability of cheap electricity, the cost of the mining equipment, the energy efficiency of the hardware, and how well it can manage its operation.\nGenesis has developed proprietary software to manage its big mining farms, which it uses in the Hive facilities. This software automates much of the mining operation, saving money and extracting the most from the hardware.\nGenesis chose Iceland and Sweden because both offer very cheap electricity. Their cool climates also reduce the costs of artificially cooling the mining rigs, which generate a lot of heat.\nGenesis builds its own mining rigs using off-the-shelf parts and GPUs (the graphics processors that do the actual mining) from companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD ) and Nvidia Corp. (Nasdaq: NVDA ).\nThe cost of that hardware and assembling it in large facilities means hefty startup costs. This is Hive's most important advantage. It has access to the capital it needs to get off to a quick start… How Hive Can Fund Rapid Growth\nHive never had an IPO, instead gaining access to the public markets by executing a reverse takeover of Leeta Gold Corp. last September. It's a common maneuver among penny stocks.\nThat move, the deal with Genesis, the purchase of 17 million shares by Holmes' U.S. Global Investor, and the relationship with Giustra allowed Hive to raise $147 million of growth capital in its first full quarter of operation.\nWith prominent investors already backing Hive, raising capital as needed should not be a problem.\nAnd as a well-capitalized operation, Hive can do whatever it takes to get the high volume of GPUs its needs as quickly as possible (the sooner you get a GPU online, the sooner it can make money for you). That includes leasing Boeing 747s to transport the GPUs directly from the factories to the mining facilities.\nIt also means Hive can scale its operations very quickly. The company launched with just 2 megawatts of mining capacity last year. It's already expanded that to 24.2 megawatts and plans to nearly double that to 44.2 megawatts by September. It has already purchased more property in Norway for future expansion.\nThe rapid expansion of capacity means the annualized run rate of Hive's revenue will have grown from $8 million at launch to $153 million in the company's first year.\nAnd unlike many new companies, Hive has proven itself profitable – if only barely. In its first quarter of operation, it made $149,724.\nWhile this Bitcoin stock is obviously high-risk because of its exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency sector, that level of risk also has the potential to deliver huge returns.\nHere's what you can expect… Why This Bitcoin Stock Will Rise at Least 250%", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&fs=1&to&su=&body=https://mney.co/2LsnuKq", "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HIVE.V/", "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/hvbtf/", "http://twitter.com/DavidGZeiler", "http://compose.mail.yahoo.com/?body=https://mney.co/2LsnuKq", "https://pro.moneymappress.com/m/951743/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank giustra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david zeiler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tommy humphreys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giustra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hive blockchain technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T19:01:26.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62f5f943119b00ec22f017693fb967cbdbf18619", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1ansJrLFXkQu8MnFBqiuqGBtjTfvhnxnu0vRLX2wg_ORVDKQcbjjUXngMiJdEMa4a1EXDSrDxJJwItnGObLOS5Y", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6291", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Money Morning", "title": "Why Billionaire Frank Giustra Loves This $1 Bitcoin Stock", "title_full": "Why Billionaire Frank Giustra Loves This $1 Bitcoin Stock", "published": "2018-06-06T18:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62f5f943119b00ec22f017693fb967cbdbf18619", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1ansJrLFXkQu8MnFBqiuqGBtjTfvhnxnu0vRLX2wg_ORVDKQcbjjUXngMiJdEMa4a1EXDSrDxJJwItnGObLOS5Y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T18:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Billionaire Frank Giustra Loves This $1 Bitcoin Stock", "text": "June 06, 2018 at 11:57 AM EDT Why Billionaire Frank Giustra Loves This $1 Bitcoin Stock Billionaire Frank Giustra, one of the world's most successful investors, has thrown his weight behind an unassuming Bitcoin stock focused on cryptocurrency mining called Hive Technologies.

It’s even better to mine it to make the mental jump.\nFor me it was mining as my old 1060 notebook could mine and so I switched on Nicehash software and it told me I was going to make $1.50 a day in bitcoin for just being me and my old notebook and being kind enough to run the software. Not that I was anybody who gave any private info. They didn’t want me to register, they didn’t want proof of my identity, my e-mail or my mobile. They didn’t want to listen to my microphone like Microsoft and a few others with their ‘fluffy’ clouds praying to prey on my ‘selfish ledger’ of data, they just wanted my hash address.\nIn that moment I went from very skeptical to a total convert.\nMy computer was at last paying me for nothing. “I was making money at home with my computer” for real just like the scammers had promised for the 25 years I had been online. The moment had arrived when I was going to be paid for merely existing and having a computer. The thermodynamics of money and economics had reversed, and money was going to flow to me from the world rather than flow from me. Existence was now an asset not a liability.\nIt’s a bitcoiner epiphany.\nBut without such a moment these five questions come to mind to \"no-coiners\" and here are the answers.\n1. Bitcoin is backed by nothing, how can it have value? National currencies are backed by nothing but a promise, which is why currencies like the dollar, the pound, not to mention currencies like the lira, peseta and reichsmark have lost 95% or more of their value in the last 100 years. The backing is from trust, which is generally high in ‘fiat’ currencies and is also high among users of cryptocurrencies. Crypto has trust strengths and weaknesses but ultimately bitcoin has proven to be as good and in many cases better money than ‘fiat’ when it comes to transactions and ultimately money is backed by its ability to transact.\n2. Isn’t cryptocurrency just a way for criminals and terrorists to transact?\nIt will be a long, long time before cryptocurrency even registers alongside the transaction volumes of cash. Ninety percent of dollar bills test positive for cocaine so it’s kind of moot that the occasional bandit will use cryptocurrency to do their dirty business. Most crpytocurrencies, and likely all, are actually more traceable than cash transactions and many honest people will say that is a negative for bitcoin, so beyond the media hype, this is no more an issue than music pirates and pornographers using the internet to peddle their nefarious ways. This is how new technology works, the initial cohort of adopters are the opportunists and not all of them are nice people. Then comes the mainstream.\n3. Isn’t Bitcoin a bubble?\nYes it was. Yes it will be. Dotcom companies created a bubble that burst and now they rule the world. Bubbles have a bad rap because they leave a lot of greedy people crying but they also leave huge industries behind. Holland produces $2 billion a year of tulips these days, so even the mother of all financial bubbles left an industry behind that is still going 300 years later.\n4. Bitcoin is a ponzi\nNo it isn’t. A ponzi scheme is a financial card trick where people are promised returns, sometimes like Madoff’s fund, not even massive ones. These returns are paid out from new money coming into the fund from new investors, not from monies invested. The pension schemes of the West are ponzi schemes, perhaps yours included, and funnily enough they are melting away before your eyes. (As an aside, who is going to be brought to justice over that?) Bitcoin is merely a currency you buy, hold or transact with. It has no inherent return beyond an unknowable potential for capital gain based on demand for it to transact or use as a store of value.\n5. Bitcoin is just a fad.\nBitcoin is just an application of the new(ish) revolutionary technology broadly called ‘blockchain.’ Blockchain is ‘triple entry bookkeeping.’ Clearly to run most businesses you need bookkeeping and people got on just fine with that for a few thousand years. A huge breakthrough in accounting was double entry bookkeeping, which was a key foundation to the explosion of the late medieval economy. ‘Triple entry bookkeeping’ is the next step forward for business and economics; it takes accounting, resource allocation and value to a higher plane.\nThe ancient world = clay tablets and single entry bookkeeping\nThe modern world = double entry bookkeeping\nThe future = triple entry bookkeeping\nBlockchain is therefore a huge step for economics and cryptocurrency is the fuel for it.\nSo rather than ‘baby brain’ pate, bitcoin and blockchain are the future of money and while double entry bookkeeping types might not like the idea of it getting served up, triple entry bookkeeping is the wave of the future. I admit it, saying “blockchain and bitcoin is the wave of the future” sounds so much better, but perhaps if the semantics can be reframed, the no-coiners might have their epiphany.\n---\nClem Chambers

ASICs are really important because they add to the game theory mechanics. Bitmain will not be stupid to attack bitcoin because it might make their ASIC miners worthless.\nAlso there are other ASIC manufacturers that would try to protect their interests by adding more hash power in case of an attack on bitcoin. The real danger is really on the minority chain, bitcoin cash.\nVirtually, Bitcoin Network is run by ASICs. CPU, GPU, and FPGA mining are in the minority, perhaps not even up to 15% of the mining network with the current hashing difficulty. These ASICs that are running the Bitcoin Network are predominantly from one manufacturer, BITMAIN. The topmost mining pools have ties to the same manufacturer BITMAIN. There is no guarantee whatsoever that a company controlling a blockchain network cannot undermine the global interest of its network users. There had been an issue of discovered backdoor in those ASICs, even though BITMAIN tried to remedy the matter. There is no game theory mechanics because there is only one player. This is why blockchain developers are highly concerned and beginning to enforce bans on ASICs, e.g. Monero. Dialogue and transparency will definitely help. Developers have sympathizers and manufacturers like Bitmain have sympathizers too. The attack on Zencash and Bitcoin Gold may have been orchestrated by BITMAIN network itself (may or may not be sanctioned by the executives), sympathizers of BITMAIN or could be a 'false flag' attack by BITMAIN competitors in manufacturing. Nothing is ruled out. Dialogue is really the best approach.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T04:28:39.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f823cb5d8e4abc9e9e06ddf46564504aa6a2552", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVXiQAIQOxc4B", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Digatrade-Financial-Corp-DIGAF-20186/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Digatrade Financial Corp.

That type of currency is not a security.” While Clayton did not comment on specific assets besides Bitcoin about their status as securities, he went on to explain that what he considers to be securities are tokens that act as digital assets: “Where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture […] and in return for me giving you my money, you say, ‘You know what, I’m going to give you a return.’ That is a security, and we regulate that. We regulate the offering of that security, and we regulate the trading of that security.” When asked to make clear his statement on whether Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are securities, Clayton told the interviewers, CNBC’s Bob Pisani, “Bob, I just did.” Clayton added that the SEC won’t support changing the definition of a security to support the ICO community, as they are not “going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security which has worked well for a long time.” The SEC chair had previously praised distributed ledger tech, blockchain as an example, during February’s SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) cryptocurrency hearing. At the time, Clayton had noted that every ICO that the SEC had seen so far would be considered a security. Altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have come up in the cryptocurrency security question, with Joseph Lubin of Ethereum emphatically denying that ETH was ever a security, and Ripple similarly rejecting a security classification.\nRipple is now facing a class action lawsuit from a disgruntled investor claiming that the sale of XRP is the sale of an unregistered security, with a former SEC chair recently appointed to represent Ripple in court.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/class-action-lawsuit-against-ripple-alleges-sale-of-unregistered-securities", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-sec-chair-represents-ripple-in-lawsuit-for-alleged-sale-of-unregistered-securities", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-hints-at-tighter-regulation-for-icos-smart-policies-for-true-cryptocurrencies", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/06/06/sec-chairman-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin--not-securities.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/it-never-was-a-security-ethereum-under-the-regulatory-spotlight", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cftc", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-absolutely-not-a-security-says-ripple-chief-market-strategist", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-and-cftc-hearing-more-legitimate-icos-or-if-there-was-no-bitcoin-there-would-be-no-blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jay clayt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay clayton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:57:08.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "950818168a2d9f04caecc0505f0626dca1450e32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jlfh9kCY5WzAoAL3M5NXTtBOp3CuTlrvCeefc6Kp5XJBrd9FUhkH2vHgdlmSob4q3Cc9lJaPnKVU2C_LENyGNcz7BOx4LLXO7", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "SolidX Teams Up with VanEck to Launch Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF", "title_full": "SolidX Teams Up with VanEck to Launch Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF", "published": "2018-06-06T18:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bitcoin-3.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "950818168a2d9f04caecc0505f0626dca1450e32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jlfh9kCY5WzAoAL3M5NXTtBOp3CuTlrvCeefc6Kp5XJBrd9FUhkH2vHgdlmSob4q3Cc9lJaPnKVU2C_LENyGNcz7BOx4LLXO7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Financemagnets", "published": "2018-06-06T18:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "SolidX Teams Up with VanEck to Launch Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF", "text": "SolidX Teams Up with VanEck to Launch Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF June 6, 2018 414\nSolidX Partners Inc, a blockchain technology company, is giving its cryptocurrencies initiative another shot. SolidX, in collaboration with money management firm VanEck, today filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a physically-backed bitcoin exchange-traded product .\nAt a time where regulators seem split between loving and hating cryptos, the move puts the ninth biggest ETF provider in the bulls camp, as the firm views ETFs as a necessary step for this nascent sector to grow.\nHelp us make Finance Magnates better!\nLast year, New York-based VanEck withdrew an application to list a bitcoin derivatives ETF after the SEC said it wouldn’t review a petition for a fund that intends to invest in virtual assets that aren’t yet available.\nIn addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) refused to grant an exemption that would have let SolidX become the first bitcoin-based ETF to launch on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In an order disapproving of the proposed rule change, the agency said it believed the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated. Bitcoin ETF proposals facing regulatory hurdles\nThe SEC repeatedly delayed making a decision on the application, first extending the time it had to act on the proposal in September, then instituting formal proceedings to determine approval in October, and again extending its deadline to March.\nDespite investor interest, it seems unlikely that the SEC would be comfortable using bitcoin as an underlying asset in a regulated investment vehicle any time soon.\nSolidX was the second company to file for a bitcoin exchange-traded product with the U.S. regulators. The SEC also denied a request to approve the Winklevoss twins’ bid to list a bitcoin ETF on the BATS exchange. The watchdog based its rejection on Bats’ inability to reach “security surveillance sharing agreements” that could “help address concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices”.\nFounded in 2014, SolidX Partners Inc., which develops blockchain products and services focusing on capital markets, raised $3 million from investors with the goal of offering total return swaps to large institutional bitcoin investors.\nCommenting on the news, van Eck, CEO of VanEck, said: “I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios. The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.”\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible

"Investment Firm VanEck Attempts New Bitcoin ETF Filing, Aims at Institutional Players June 6, 2018 332 VanEck and SolidX Partners Inc. have filed a request to list a Bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bloomberg reports June 6. VanEck is an NYC-based investment management firm with $38 bln under management and SolidX is a provider of blockchain software development and financial services. According to a report by Bloomberg, the request filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is for a fund that is physically-backed, meaning it will hold actual Bitcoins. The firms bringing the request say that this will protect against the loss or theft of the cryptocurrency. The SEC has held a strict attitude when it comes to ETFs (exchange-traded funds) involving cryptocurrencies, rejecting the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF last year and asking about a dozen applications to be withdrawn in January. SolidX CEO Daniel H. Gallancy said in a phone interview with Bloomberg that he thinks that “regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,” and added that this attitude will change over time, “but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.” If their request is approved, Bloomberg reports that the share price of the fund will be around $200,000 in order to target institutional investors — significantly higher than most ETFs which have traditionally focused on individual investors. The approval of a Bitcoin ETF is considered the holy grail of mainstream financial acceptance of cryptocurrency by some and major players like Huobi — the third largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume — are launching ETFs of their own.

A recent analysis from Deloitte reports that as of 2015, U.S. consumers were collectively enrolled in more than 3.3 billion of these programs—with enrollment rising 20 percent from 2012.\nHowever, loyalty programs are struggling. According to the same report, only half of loyalty program members are active in them, and of that half, 20 percent have never redeemed any rewards at all. This is a big problem for businesses: The report suggests that customers who don’t claim rewards are nearly three times as likely to defect to other programs, and unclaimed loyalty rewards represent a financial liability to a company’s bottom line.\nThese defections and unclaimed rewards are largely related to the friction that arises between the different stakeholders involved in a given loyalty program (from the brand to the bank to the customer). And loyalty programs have no consistent infrastructure, making different programs wildly incompatible and adding to the friction. For example, while you can use airline points to rent a car, it’s often difficult and time consuming to redeem points across different offerings.\nA potential solution to loyalty program ills? Brian Shniderman, principal and global payments practice lead at Deloitte Consulting LLP, says to look no further than the emergence of blockchain technology.\nYes, Shniderman’s talking about the same blockchain that’s become synonymous with controversial cryptocurrency bitcoin. Blockchain is the underlying technology that powers bitcoin’s promise of a distributed ledger (a secure way to transfer information without one single administrator or centralized data center). For loyalty programs, this type of ledger could remove the friction of loyalty programs by promising more-efficient transactions that could lead to the real-time experiences. And in a world where brand experience and instant gratification are standards, efficient loyalty programs are tantamount to customer retention.\nChristian Catalini, Founder, MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab Points in the Chain: An Easy-to-Use Points System\nFunctionally, loyalty points on blockchain wouldn’t work in a dramatically different fashion than do today’s version, but storing loyalty information in a blockchain-based network would make the points much more useful. Loyalty points would be more easily transferable or tradable—for example, a traveler could trade his unwanted hotel points to another user in exchange for airline miles. From a business perspective, liabilities are cleared off the books more quickly, and program information would also be more accurate and more up to date.\nTo really grasp the promise of blockchain for loyalty programs, it’s important to first understand some of their current pain points. Franchise hotels are a good illustration of the issues that exist for business owners and customers regarding loyalty programs. With franchises, individual owners participate in loyalty programs with a brand that operates as the intermediary between individual owners.\n“I may travel to a small town for work and earn points at a hotel, but I’m not going to bring my family there to burn those points,” Shniderman explains. “I’m going to take them to a resort town, so the owner of that property is essentially working with the brand to settle a ledger with the other property. You’ve got all these moving parts. By moving to a blockchain, you remove the burden to the brand.”\nWith a streamlined process—one that is located on a distributed ledger instead of moving through different banks, brands, and franchise owners to redeem or register reward points—blockchain could remove the headaches of loyalty, rewarding a group of truly dedicated consumers instead of those who hop from program to program.\n“A blockchain-based solution would make it easier to reconcile data across many different services,” says Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.\nBlockchain could also help to prevent one of the biggest problems with loyalty programs: fraud. Scammers steal loyalty points, or even access prepaid cards attached to loyalty programs. In these rising cases (loyalty theft made up 11 percent of account takeover attacks in 2017—up from just four percent the year before), a blockchain environment would be much more secure.\n“By nature of how the distributed ledger works, it’s replicated in a way that makes it very hard to alter,” says Shniderman. “The more we can move control away from any one entity, the more we can eliminate different types of loyalty fraud.”\nRich de Moll, Blockchain for Finance Practice Lead, Deloitte Harnessing True Brand Loyalty\nBeyond fraud prevention and a streamlined process for franchise owners, blockchain also provides advantages that make point hoarding less attractive. Point hoarders aren’t loyal, says Deloitte’s blockchain for finance practice lead, Rich de Moll. Instead, they tend to spend their points in one chunk and move on to entirely different programs.\n“If someone stays in your hotel, and then 10 years later they redeem the points they earned, you’re really disconnecting the reward from the behavior,” explains de Moll. “In fact, many times, they’ll use all their points and then switch to another brand, because now they’ve cleared all the points off their books. That’s not much of a loyalty program.”\nBlockchain allows loyalty programs to be driven less by milestones and goals, making possible more-frequent transactions with smaller numbers of points. Under a blockchain-enabled system, companies are actually building loyalty through real-time rewards and point redemption.\n“Think of them as micro-rewards, providing a reward at the time of the behavior you want to reinforce,” says Shniderman. “With a blockchain solution, you’re able to speed the whole process up by significantly reducing a lot of unnecessary blockers from the ecosystem.”\nAs used in this document, “Deloitte” means Deloitte Consulting LLP, a subsidiary of Deloitte LLP.

Needless to say, none of these exuberant high-return promises panned out; instead, investors ended up losing money.\nBhardwaj was arrested in April by Indian police and has been under custody since then. After interrogating him, police is now reportedly questioning people associated with him and his companies.\nThe first to fall under ED’s radar is the British businessman Raj Kundra (who does most of his business in India). Kundra was questioned for eight continuous hours by ED on Tuesday, local outlet Times of India reports .\nED found several transactions made between Bharadwaj and one of Kundra’s firms prompting them to investigate further.\nKundra has however denied all allegations of being involved in the scam. He told TOI:\nThis is to clarify that I have no involvement or connection in the Bitcoin scam whatsoever. I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An inquiry is underway and I am cooperating with the law enforcement agency as Bhardwaj is an acquaintance and protocol is being followed. Bharadwaj was to buy a team in the poker league and got into a contract with us. But due to non-payment, his contract was terminated. I have come as a witness to the same.\nAnother Indian news channel reported the questioning of Kundra subsequently led to more celebrities, who purportedly promoted GBMiners at various events in Dubai and Singapore. The most prominent name on the list is Sunny Leone, the adult film star turned Bollywood actress.\nThe rest of the list also features film actresses that any Bollywood fan can recognize in a jiffy: Prachi Desai, Aarti Chabria, Sonal Chauhan, Karishma Tanna, Zareen Khan, Neha Dhupia, Huma Qureshi, Nargis Fakhri, and Kundra’s wife Shilpa Shetty.\nHowever, it appears none of the celebrities have been indicted in the scam so far, according to local media. They are being questioned about their promotional activities in relation to Bharadwaj’s companies.\nThis is not the first time that celebrities are getting in trouble for promoting cryptocurrency projects or initial coin offerings (ICOs) that prove to be fraudulent — Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled, and Steven Seagal have all been there .\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even issued a warning against celebrity-backed ICOs last December, noting that such sponsored endorsements are illegal if the celebrity fails to disclose their relationship (or stake) with the cryptocurrency.\nIt seems India could benefit from similar legislation.

As a result, more nodes are appearing online every day, a growing number of users are opening channels with one another, and some merchants even started to accept Lightning payments.\nBut of course, these are still the very early days of the Lightning Network . While the main implementations are usable and some wallets and other applications are available, Bitcoin\\u2019s overlay payment network is projected to improve over the next few years in areas ranging from network architecture to security and usability, and more.\nThese are some of the more important Lightning projects currently in development.\nDual-Funded Channels The Lightning Network consists of a series of payment channels. Each payment channel exists between two users, allowing funds to be sent back and forth between them.\nHowever, in this early stage of development, payment channels can only be funded by one of the two parties. The funding party must first make a transaction to his counterparty; only then can that counterparty return a payment within the same payment channel.\nThe Lightning Network white paper , however, proposed dual-funded channels, for which a specification proposal has now also been made by ACINQ , the company behind eclair . As the name suggests, dual-funded channels will let both users partly fund a payment channel by each depositing some bitcoin. This should bring more flexibility to the Lightning user experience, as users can immediately send as well as receive payment after having opened a channel.\nSubmarine Swaps In order to make a Lightning payment, users must deposit funds in a Lightning channel. Once in a channel, these funds cannot be sent to regular (on-chain) Bitcoin addresses (unless the channel is first closed). This means that bitcoin in a Lightning channel is somewhat separated from bitcoin in a regular wallet, not unlike how money in a checking account is somewhat separated from money in a savings account.\nBut there are solutions to make switching between Lightning and on-chain payments more seamless.\nOne solution is Submarine Swaps . Developed by Alex Bosworth (but conceptualized by Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun even before that ), Submarine Swaps essentially let users send Lightning payments to a middleman on the Lightning Network; that middleman will send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a regular (on-chain) Bitcoin address. It also works the other way around: users can send regular on-chain payments to the middleman; that middleman will then send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a receiving Lightning node on the Lightning Network.\nImportantly, with Submarine Swaps, this conversion is done \\u201catomically.\\u201d Using a trick that is already embedded in the Lightning Network, the Lightning payment and the on-chain payment can effectively be linked to each other. This makes it impossible for the middleman to steal funds by not forwarding the payment. (In agreement with the users, he could charge a small fee for his service.)\nSplicing Another solution to make the Lightning user experience more seamless is called \\u201csplicing.\\u201d In essence, splicing would let a user \\u201ctop up\\u201d funds in an existing Lightning channel, or \\u201cdrain\\u201d funds from it, potentially while keeping the channel open.\nThe idea is simple. Any Lightning channel starts with an opening transaction, which ensures that both users consent to moving the funds in the channel. The rest of the Lightning channel consists of a series of subsequent transactions exchanged between the users, which aren\\u2019t usually broadcast to the Bitcoin network. The funds in the opening transaction don\\u2019t move until the channel is closed.\nWhen \\u201csplicing in,\\u201d users take the opening transaction to instead send funds to a replacement opening transaction, which includes more bitcoin, from one or both users. Once this new opening transaction confirms on the blockchain, the channel is topped up. Until the new opening transaction is confirmed, the two users can simply update both the old and the new channel at the same time to avoid any \\u201cchannel downtime.\\u201d\nConversely, when they \\u201csplice out,\\u201d users take the opening transaction to send funds to a regular (on-chain) address, and potentially keep some of it in the channel using the same trick. This way, users can make on-chain transactions straight out of a Lightning channel.\nEltoo Each time a new payment is made, Lightning channels between users are updated to reflect their mutual balances. The trick used to accomplish this currently includes a penalty for users who try to cheat by broadcasting an older balance (presumably because that older balance would pay them more). Cheating users can lose all the funds they have in a channel.\nThe problem is that the broadcasting of old balances is not always a cheating attempt. There are a number of scenarios in which users can accidentally broadcast an older balance; for example, because of a software bug or a backup gone wrong. In such scenarios, a complete loss of channel funds is quite a heavy punishment.\nFirst published on April 30, 2018, eltoo is the newest proposal featured in this article. \\u00a0Developed by Blockstream\\u2019s c-lightning development team \\u2014 Dr. Christian Decker and Rusty Russell \\u2014 and Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun, eltoo updates a channel by building a chain of time-locked transactions, where each transaction spends funds from the previous one to reflect the latest channel balance.\nIf one user broadcasts an older transaction (representing an older channel balance), her counterparty has some time to broadcast the latest transaction (representing the latest channel balance).\nA solution like this could work today, but it isn\\u2019t practical in cases of failure. It would require that the entire chain of transactions be broadcast and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, more or less defeating the purpose of the Lightning Network. Decker therefore proposed a soft-fork change to the Bitcoin protocol to introduce a type of hierarchy in these types of transactions: any newer transaction can override any older transaction without requiring that all transactions in the entire chain be broadcast.\nIf this soft fork is adopted and activated on the Bitcoin network, Lightning users could create channels in both the current style and by using eltoo, depending on what they prefer.\nCompact Client-Side Block Filtering While the Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is still relevant for Lightning users for security purposes. Specifically, Lightning users must keep an eye on the blockchain to see if specific transactions are included. This can be resource intensive, in particular for mobile users.\nA solution for this is called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and was described in the Bitcoin white paper. Current SPV wallets use a trick called \\u201c Bloom filters \\u201d to find out whether any relevant transactions happened.\nUnfortunately, Bloom filters are rather privacy-unfriendly, as wallets essentially reveal all of their addresses to nodes on the Bitcoin network. They also have some scaling and usability issues, as each individual SPV wallet takes up resources from at least one full Bitcoin node.\nTo tackle these issues, Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod, along with Coinbase developer Jim Posen, designed a new solution called \\u201ccompact client-side block filtering,\\u201d which they are implementing in the Neutrino wallet.\nCompact client-side block filtering essentially inverts the trick that current SPV wallets use. Instead of wallets requesting transactions relevant to them by creating and sending out a Bloom filter to full nodes, full nodes create a filter for all Neutrino wallets. The Neutrino wallet then uses this filter to establish that the relevant transaction did not happen \\u2014 which is really all that users need to know to be sure they are not being cheated. (If the filter produces a match, Neutrino fetches the relevant block to see if the match really concerns the exact transaction instead of a false positive.)\nInterestingly, while this trick was designed with the Lightning experience in mind, it could be utilized to benefit regular light wallets as well.\nWatchtowers To avoid being cheated, Lightning users must keep track of potential on-chain transactions that could be relevant to them.\nWhile compact client-side block filtering should make things much easier, users do need to \\u201ccheck in\\u201d once in a while to make sure they\\u2019re not being cheated. If they forget to check, it creates a security risk.\n\\u201cWatchtowers\\u201d are a potential solution that can be traced back to the Lightning Network white paper and has since been improved by Lightning Network white paper co-author and lit developer Tadge Dryja and others. As the name suggests, Watchtowers could let users outsource blockchain monitoring to third parties.\nCurrent Watchtower designs are not set in stone but would roughly work like this. Whenever users update a channel, they send a small data package to a Watchtower. The first part of this package is a \\u201chint\\u201d of a transaction they should look out for, as if it were a piece of a puzzle. This hint alone doesn\\u2019t reveal anything about the content of the transaction that the Watchtower must look out for; users don\\u2019t give up any privacy in this sense.\nHowever, if the relevant transaction shows up in the Bitcoin blockchain, the Watchtower can use the hint to recognize it. Then, with the transaction data on the blockchain itself, the Watchtower can use the second part of the package they\\u2019ve received to reconstruct the penalty transaction. This penalty transaction sends all funds in the channel to the user that is being cheated. (Or in the case of eltoo, it just broadcasts the correct channel balance.) The penalty transaction can also be designed to let the Watchtower claim part of the funds as a reward, as an incentive to do its job.\nUsers can outsource channel monitoring to multiple Watchtowers. Even if one fails, another might not, limiting the risk for Lightning users to the point where it\\u2019s arguably negligible.\nAtomic Multi-Path Payments What makes the Lightning Network a network is that the payment channels between users are interconnected. Users can pay across payment channels, through peers on the network that act as \\u201cmiddlemen,\\u201d to users they don\\u2019t have a direct channel open with.\nHowever, right now a single payment must be routed over a single route. If one user wants to pay 5 mBTC to another, not only must he have 5 mBTC in a single channel, all the middlemen on the route must also have 5 mBTC ready in a channel to forward. The bigger a payment is, the smaller the odds of this being the case.\nAtomic Multi-Path Payments (AMPs) could go a long way of solving this limitation. First proposed by Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun and Conner Fromknecht, the idea is simple: Larger payments can be \\u201ccut up\\u201d into smaller pieces, all of which have their own route from the payer to the payee, through different middlemen.\nA challenge to realize this solution is that Lightning payments can fail, which would in this case mean that a payment is made partially. Partial payments can easily be a bigger problem than no payment at all, however: a merchant won\\u2019t be satisfied with a partial payment, while a customer won\\u2019t be happy spending any money for nothing.\nThe solution to this problem is that AMPs use an extension to the hash time-locked contracts , which are already used along Lightning routes and involve passing secret data along a network. Using a trick similar to the one used by deterministic wallets (which generate multiple Bitcoin addresses from a single seed), the smaller pieces of a larger payment can only be redeemed by the payee if all of them are: if some secret data doesn\\u2019t make it through the route whole, the entire payment fails.\nAtomic Swaps The Lightning Network is designed as a scaling layer for Bitcoin. But since many altcoins are software forks of Bitcoin\\u2019s codebase(s), it\\u2019s often not difficult to create similar scaling layers for these altcoins. Already, a small Litecoin Lightning Network exists, and more Lightning Networks are likely to follow.\nInterestingly, these networks don\\u2019t need to remain separated in the future.\nUsing a fundamental building block of the Lightning Network called \\u201catomic swaps\\u201d (first proposed by Tier Nolan and realized on Lightning by Lightning Labs\\u2019 Fromknecht), payment channels can be linked across different blockchains. In other words, a user can send bitcoin, and as long as a node on the network is willing to make the exchange, another user can receive the payment as litecoin.\nOf course, this also means that users can send such payments to themselves: they can send bitcoin and receive litecoin. In effect, the Lightning Network could establish a network of trustless cryptocurrency exchanges.\nFor more information on this topic, see: \\u201c Atomic Swaps: How the Lightning Network Extends to Altcoins .\\u201d\nChannel Factories The main benefit of the Lightning Network is arguably its potential to vastly increase the upper limit of bitcoin transactions without burdening the Bitcoin network. As long as two users both have funds in their channel, they can pay each other a virtually unlimited number of times, while only requiring two on-chain transactions: one to open a payment channel and one to close it.\nStill, two transactions per payment channel could add up if Bitcoin and the Lightning Network gain more adoption over time.\nA proposal by ETH Zurich researchers Christian Decker (also of Blockstream), Roger Wattenhofer and Conrad Burchert called \\u201cChannel Factories\\u201d could further decrease the average number of on-chain transactions required per payment channel, perhaps significantly.\nLoosely based on an earlier Lightning-like proposal by Decker and Wattenhofer from 2015, Channel Factories are a type of payment channel that can exist among many users. Meanwhile, like any payment channel, a Channel Factory only ever requires two on-chain transactions. (If Schnorr signatures are implemented on Bitcoin, these transactions could be quite compact, even if it involves many users.)\nThe Channel Factories can, in turn, act sort of like \\u201csub-channels\\u201d for the Lightning Network. Participants within a Channel Factory can open and close a virtually unlimited number of Lightning channels with each other, without requiring any additional on-chain transactions. By doing so, they could, in theory, bring the number of required on-chain transactions for the Lightning Network down by a magnitude.\nFor more information on this topic, see: \\u201c This New Scaling Layer Could Make Payment Channels Ten Times More Effective \\u201d.\nThanks to Blockstream developer Christian Decker, Lightning Labs developer Conner Fromknecht, ACINQ CEO Pierre-Marie Padiou and others for information and feedback.

As a result, more nodes are appearing online every day, a growing number of users are opening channels with one another, and some merchants even started to accept Lightning payments.\nBut of course, these are still the very early days of the Lightning Network . While the main implementations are usable and some wallets and other applications are available, Bitcoin\\u2019s overlay payment network is projected to improve over the next few years in areas ranging from network architecture to security and usability, and more.\nThese are some of the more important Lightning projects currently in development.\nDual-Funded Channels The Lightning Network consists of a series of payment channels. Each payment channel exists between two users, allowing funds to be sent back and forth between them.\nHowever, in this early stage of development, payment channels can only be funded by one of the two parties. The funding party must first make a transaction to his counterparty; only then can that counterparty return a payment within the same payment channel.\nThe Lightning Network white paper , however, proposed dual-funded channels, for which a specification proposal has now also been made by ACINQ , the company behind eclair . As the name suggests, dual-funded channels will let both users partly fund a payment channel by each depositing some bitcoin. This should bring more flexibility to the Lightning user experience, as users can immediately send as well as receive payment after having opened a channel.\nSubmarine Swaps In order to make a Lightning payment, users must deposit funds in a Lightning channel. Once in a channel, these funds cannot be sent to regular (on-chain) Bitcoin addresses (unless the channel is first closed). This means that bitcoin in a Lightning channel is somewhat separated from bitcoin in a regular wallet, not unlike how money in a checking account is somewhat separated from money in a savings account.\nBut there are solutions to make switching between Lightning and on-chain payments more seamless.\nOne solution is Submarine Swaps . Developed by Alex Bosworth (but conceptualized by Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun even before that ), Submarine Swaps essentially let users send Lightning payments to a middleman on the Lightning Network; that middleman will send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a regular (on-chain) Bitcoin address. It also works the other way around: users can send regular on-chain payments to the middleman; that middleman will then send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a receiving Lightning node on the Lightning Network.\nImportantly, with Submarine Swaps, this conversion is done \\u201catomically.\\u201d Using a trick that is already embedded in the Lightning Network, the Lightning payment and the on-chain payment can effectively be linked to each other. This makes it impossible for the middleman to steal funds by not forwarding the payment. (In agreement with the users, he could charge a small fee for his service.)\nSplicing Another solution to make the Lightning user experience more seamless is called \\u201csplicing.\\u201d In essence, splicing would let a user \\u201ctop up\\u201d funds in an existing Lightning channel, or \\u201cdrain\\u201d funds from it, potentially while keeping the channel open.\nThe idea is simple. Any Lightning channel starts with an opening transaction, which ensures that both users consent to moving the funds in the channel. The rest of the Lightning channel consists of a series of subsequent transactions exchanged between the users, which aren\\u2019t usually broadcast to the Bitcoin network. The funds in the opening transaction don\\u2019t move until the channel is closed.\nWhen \\u201csplicing in,\\u201d users take the opening transaction to instead send funds to a replacement opening transaction, which includes more bitcoin, from one or both users. Once this new opening transaction confirms on the blockchain, the channel is topped up. Until the new opening transaction is confirmed, the two users can simply update both the old and the new channel at the same time to avoid any \\u201cchannel downtime.\\u201d\nConversely, when they \\u201csplice out,\\u201d users take the opening transaction to send funds to a regular (on-chain) address, and potentially keep some of it in the channel using the same trick. This way, users can make on-chain transactions straight out of a Lightning channel.\nEltoo Each time a new payment is made, Lightning channels between users are updated to reflect their mutual balances. The trick used to accomplish this currently includes a penalty for users who try to cheat by broadcasting an older balance (presumably because that older balance would pay them more). Cheating users can lose all the funds they have in a channel.\nThe problem is that the broadcasting of old balances is not always a cheating attempt. There are a number of scenarios in which users can accidentally broadcast an older balance; for example, because of a software bug or a backup gone wrong. In such scenarios, a complete loss of channel funds is quite a heavy punishment.\nFirst published on April 30, 2018, eltoo is the newest proposal featured in this article. \\u00a0Developed by Blockstream\\u2019s c-lightning development team \\u2014 Dr. Christian Decker and Rusty Russell \\u2014 and Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun, eltoo updates a channel by building a chain of time-locked transactions, where each transaction spends funds from the previous one to reflect the latest channel balance.\nIf one user broadcasts an older transaction (representing an older channel balance), her counterparty has some time to broadcast the latest transaction (representing the latest channel balance).\nA solution like this could work today, but it isn\\u2019t practical in cases of failure. It would require that the entire chain of transactions be broadcast and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, more or less defeating the purpose of the Lightning Network. Decker therefore proposed a soft-fork change to the Bitcoin protocol to introduce a type of hierarchy in these types of transactions: any newer transaction can override any older transaction without requiring that all transactions in the entire chain be broadcast.\nIf this soft fork is adopted and activated on the Bitcoin network, Lightning users could create channels in both the current style and by using eltoo, depending on what they prefer.\nCompact Client-Side Block Filtering While the Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is still relevant for Lightning users for security purposes. Specifically, Lightning users must keep an eye on the blockchain to see if specific transactions are included. This can be resource intensive, in particular for mobile users.\nA solution for this is called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and was described in the Bitcoin white paper. Current SPV wallets use a trick called \\u201c Bloom filters \\u201d to find out whether any relevant transactions happened.\nUnfortunately, Bloom filters are rather privacy-unfriendly, as wallets essentially reveal all of their addresses to nodes on the Bitcoin network. They also have some scaling and usability issues, as each individual SPV wallet takes up resources from at least one full Bitcoin node.\nTo tackle these issues, Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod, along with Coinbase developer Jim Posen, designed a new solution called \\u201ccompact client-side block filtering,\\u201d which they are implementing in the Neutrino wallet.\nCompact client-side block filtering essentially inverts the trick that current SPV wallets use.

Then, with the transaction data on the blockchain itself, the Watchtower can use the second part of the package they\\u2019ve received to reconstruct the penalty transaction. This penalty transaction sends all funds in the channel to the user that is being cheated. (Or in the case of eltoo, it just broadcasts the correct channel balance.) The penalty transaction can also be designed to let the Watchtower claim part of the funds as a reward, as an incentive to do its job.\nUsers can outsource channel monitoring to multiple Watchtowers. Even if one fails, another might not, limiting the risk for Lightning users to the point where it\\u2019s arguably negligible.\nAtomic Multi-Path Payments What makes the Lightning Network a network is that the payment channels between users are interconnected. Users can pay across payment channels, through peers on the network that act as \\u201cmiddlemen,\\u201d to users they don\\u2019t have a direct channel open with.\nHowever, right now a single payment must be routed over a single route.

As long as two users both have funds in their channel, they can pay each other a virtually unlimited number of times, while only requiring two on-chain transactions: one to open a payment channel and one to close it.\nStill, two transactions per payment channel could add up if Bitcoin and the Lightning Network gain more adoption over time.\nA proposal by ETH Zurich researchers Christian Decker (also of Blockstream), Roger Wattenhofer and Conrad Burchert called \\u201cChannel Factories\\u201d could further decrease the average number of on-chain transactions required per payment channel, perhaps significantly.\nLoosely based on an earlier Lightning-like proposal by Decker and Wattenhofer from 2015, Channel Factories are a type of payment channel that can exist among many users.

Participants within a Channel Factory can open and close a virtually unlimited number of Lightning channels with each other, without requiring any additional on-chain transactions. By doing so, they could, in theory, bring the number of required on-chain transactions for the Lightning Network down by a magnitude.\nFor more information on this topic, see: \\u201c This New Scaling Layer Could Make Payment Channels Ten Times More Effective \\u201d.\nThanks to Blockstream developer Christian Decker, Lightning Labs developer Conner Fromknecht, ACINQ CEO Pierre-Marie Padiou and others for information and feedback.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://twitter.com/roasbeef/status/964608261830750208/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/lit/overview//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/milan/unlinkable-outsourced-channel-monitoring//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/lightnings-first-implementation-now-beta-developers-raise-25m//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/new-scaling-layer-could-make-payment-channels-ten-times-more-effective//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2224949#msg2224949%5C%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://www.ethz.ch/en.html/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/atomic-swaps-how-the-lightning-network-extends-to-altcoins-1484157052//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://acinq.co//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-creating-the-network-1465326903//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/history-lightning-brainstorm-beta//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-building-a-bidirectional-payment-channel-1464710791//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-completing-the-puzzle-and-closing-the-channel-1466178980//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/lightning-network-now-supports-transactions-across-blockchains//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://lightning.engineering//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/184/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-April/015908.html/%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://submarineswaps.org//%22", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/%22https://www.coinbase.com//%22"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T05:57:39.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b803140f90987b1949a2fcfc084aa128ef30b20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tfxi38U19mWIvH6U4IJteoPFkdLWC24r8cSlhOwEk_uJUQ4n4wFgA20zwxQgjpr_crtZ1yIvDt655gvfvFcEqhTxELf6ji4AXJJ9JVEI0.5jl", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "CCN", "title": "Market Move?

Bitcoin Price Rebound to $7,800 Could Confirm Short-Term Rally Advertisement Get exclusive analysis and cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nThe bitcoin price has increased from $7,300 to $7,600 over the past 24 hours, sparking optimism regarding the short-term growth of bitcoin. A break to $7,800 could confirm a short-term rally for bitcoin while a drop below the $7,500 mark could lead it back to the $7,300 region, making $6,000 a possibility, yet again. Low Volume\nThe price trend of bitcoin and predictions of analysts are conditional as of current due to the low volume of BTC. While BTC has prevented a further drop to the $6,000 region as it rebounded from $7,300 to to $7,600, the volume remains nearly identical to yesterday. Although the valuation of the cryptocurrency market has improved, the state of the market remains the same.\nA break to $7,800 would effectively exceed the descending one-month trend line extending from May 5 to June 5, signifying a potential rally for BTC in both the short to mid-term. The corrective rally of BTC from the $7,040 has ended at $7,500, but based on the daily candle chart of BTC, and given the stability of BTC over the past seven days, it is possible that BTC gains momentum in the upcoming days and re-enter the $8,000 region.\nOn March 20, BTC broke a descending trendline from March 4, with a strong spike in volume and price. Within five days, the price of BTC increased from $7,800 to $9,200. However, in a period of 15 days, the price of BTC dropped from $9,200 to $6,500, even though the corrective rally was supported with strong volume.\nIf BTC can record a gradual increase in volume and value throughout June and establish a strong foundation for a potential mid-term rally, it is possible that BTC returns to its previous levels by the end of 2018, possibly back to $20,000. But, if BTC cannot sustain its momentum and falls below the $7,000 mark once again, a drop to the lower end of $6,000 is still a possibility. Mid-Term Optimism\nThis week, Nathaniel Popper from The New York Times reported that Susquehanna International Group, one of the biggest investment firms in the world, has already started to facilitate bitcoin trades.\n“We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,” Bart Smith, the head of digital assets at Susquehanna, said.\nThe firm, which first experimented with BTC in 2014, has started to process the settlement of bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash futures, enabling institutional investors and large-scale traders to invest in the cryptocurrency market.\nThe entrance of firms like Susquehanna into the cryptocurrency sector could lead to a domino effect in Wall Street and the global financial sector. While investors are uncertain about the short-term future of the market, the majority of traders are bullish on the long-term growth of bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/technology/bitcoin-susquehanna.html", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:57:31.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e33449b16c82d71972f9a313d66da6c1fe52f41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYsojTKdUojMdQft5F83q20-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "can the bitcoin price rise high?", "title_full": "can the bitcoin price rise high?", "published": "2018-06-06T18:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e33449b16c82d71972f9a313d66da6c1fe52f41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYsojTKdUojMdQft5F83q20-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "borjois56", "published": "2018-06-06T18:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "can the bitcoin price rise high?", "text": "I want to ask you all, last year bitcoin price is very high at the end of the year, whether at the end of 2018, bitcoin prices will rise again high, give your answer?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T17:54:04.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70c2016bdad1daa5bf499ba55ec574c571fc1922", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXCr7nDE.4FaXHT0OVyz150-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Wont be global Currency - Ripple CEO", "title_full": "Bitcoin Wont be global Currency - Ripple CEO", "published": "2018-06-06T18:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70c2016bdad1daa5bf499ba55ec574c571fc1922", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXCr7nDE.4FaXHT0OVyz150-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "huntingbtc5", "published": "2018-06-06T18:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Wont be global Currency - Ripple CEO", "text": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghous told CNBC that Bitcoin wont able to be the global currency that people are hoping for.\nI think its not going to be the panacea that people once thought it would be, where it would solve all of these different kinds of problems,\nSource : https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-wont-be-global-currency-ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse/\nWhats your thoughts about it.

While it is a currency, the majority of people don’t buy them in order to purchase goods. Rather, most people seem to hold onto them in the hopes of one day selling them for fiat currency and making a profit. As such, investing in Bitcoin is not about wishing for a future in which centralised currency is no longer exist, it is about earning more regular money . How Investing in Bitcoin Works\nBitcoin was not designed in order to become an investment. However, it is incredibly volatile, which makes it very difficult for it to be used as an acceptable currency. At the start of a bitcoin transaction, it is possible that its value is much higher than at the end of the transaction, even if there are only a few minutes of time between that. So volatile is Bitcoin that, by the end of 2017, it had a $20,000 value. In the latest report shows that it is crushing tremendously and now doesn’t even reach the $10,000 mark. That is within just 5 months but it is just as possible that people will wake up tomorrow and it will be worth $50,000. It is all down to what people are willing to pay for it.\nThis volatility is what makes investing in Bitcoin quite complex. Even the most professional and experienced analyst simply cannot predict the direction the cryptocurrency will move in. On the one hand, this is the main reason why financial experts do not recommend it, particularly for the Beginner investor period on the other hand, this is also precisely what makes bitcoin so interesting. Furthermore, bitcoin is accessible to the everyday individual. IIt can, in a sense, be compared to penny stock , which some people would say is akin to gambling in a casino. And while nobody would recommend gambling in a casino in order to earn millions, the reality is also that there are plenty of people who went on a day trip to Vegas and came back millionaires.\nInvesting in Bitcoin is reasonably complex to set up. However, once you have done that comma it is incredibly easy. If you want to build a retirement fund, then you must choose between a traditional or Roth self directed IRA. Most of the time, you will also have to set up as an LLC in order to be able to fund your retirement account and purchase cryptocurrency. You need to find a custodian that allows digital IRS and you also have to open a digital wallet, used for the purchasing and selling of the cryptocurrency. Once you have done all of this, you will be good to go and investing in cryptocurrencies will be possible. It is imperative that you properly monitor the market as this type of account is completely self directed, meaning that you have to decide what percentage of your investment funds go to the cryptocurrency and when you want to buy and sell. Investing in Bitcoin is both scary and exciting, and if you have the ability to cope with the stress it will undoubtedly cause, then it is certainly a consideration worth making.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinira.com/benefits-of-investing-in-bitcoin/", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:39:40.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db86b94ba21e8fa9ab3b1ce32f662445008d5b30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgsRnc1.30knzpNvKfrxcczs7TdxTdcTUEEUV7hPnK8fam.tP2yRU91FGCo0.W8ouhEscQ92sdFC.2azzUiYcPrsJhuJA6j1XnapIZBjaVb1yJ_f7ayeZokw--", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Trefis Research cuts year-end bitcoin price target to $12,500 from $15,000", "title_full": "Trefis Research cuts year-end bitcoin price target to $12,500 from $15,000", "published": "2018-06-06T18:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db86b94ba21e8fa9ab3b1ce32f662445008d5b30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgsRnc1.30knzpNvKfrxcczs7TdxTdcTUEEUV7hPnK8fam.tP2yRU91FGCo0.W8ouhEscQ92sdFC.2azzUiYcPrsJhuJA6j1XnapIZBjaVb1yJ_f7ayeZokw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-06-06T18:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trefis Research cuts year-end bitcoin price target to $12,500 from $15,000", "text": "It’s déjà vu for cryptocurrencies with major coins mostly unchanged to begin Wednesday trading.

More and more Australians sitting around wishing that they invested earlier are finally making the jump to actually doing something about it, but those of you who are somewhat out of the loop may be wondering how exactly you can go about buying some Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency for that matter.\nThe best methods to buy Bitcoin for Australians are actually not that complex. Anybody with a bank account and an internet connection can invest in cryptocurrency.\n#1: Online Exchanges The buying and selling of Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrency is done through online exchanges and markets . Acting in a similar way to the stock market, cryptocurrency is sold peer-to-peer between two individuals: one person who is selling their cryptocurrency to another person who wants to buy it.\nThere are many popular exchange sites and they are easy to get set up on and begin using. When registering, you will need to upload some form of ID to verify your identity, transfer some Australian dollars to your account, and you are good to go – you will be able to immediately invest in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency which takes your fancy.\nIn fact, this is virtually the only trusted, safe, and tested method to exchange Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and is the only one we will recommend.\n#2: What Happens When I Buy Bitcoin? You own it. That’s all! Your Bitcoin is stored in your exchange account in a digital wallet, which can only be accessed by you. Your wallet will have its own public address – similar to a bank account number – and cryptographic key – like a PIN number – and this information is used to make purchases and trade Bitcoin – and any other cryptocurrency.\nIt is important to note that if you lose your cryptocurrency key (the public address) then your wallet is gone forever . You cannot recover a lost Bitcoin wallet, so it is very important that you take good care of this information and have multiple copies of it.\n#3: Use a Reputable Exchange Whilst we recommend only using cryptocurrency exchanges to buy and sell your Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it is important to exercise some due diligence and only use trusted exchanges. Whilst most are reputable, the key players are better than the more obscure names, and the lower-level exchanges always have an increased risk of being attacked and hacked.\nThis is bad news because you cannot insure your cryptocurrency, so if it is lost through hacking or attacks, then it is gone forever. For extra security, invest in offline wallets which are stored on your computer and not kept in cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThanks to the price hike Bitcoin enjoyed at the end of 2017, it has seen a surge in popularity. More and more people want in, and anybody can do it. If you do decide to buy Bitcoin, though, ensure you have done your research and remain vigilant.\nThe post Buying Bitcoin in Australia appeared first on OxGadgets .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:59:15.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc77aacbb366e5bd0db273a92453f7d853c49dfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIaye.4A67pDM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nThat investment plan is actually not a scam instead is it some kind of bank promotions which is so complicated but I think bitcoin or crypto investment still risky than bank investment because when you invest in banks there's an insurance or compensation you might receive when the bank is bankrupt but in crypto industry you might end up losing all your investment when everything goes down.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:34:12.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c6d3e8b9735f60ec7299eee4a50f641caa3f2a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1ZbhvMTPFOh54tOLtDv9JifQUIlmcGvaU5vjPGcwIhl.KJOm26B1PhE", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6904", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Press Release Distribution Service", "title": "New Bitcoin Software Bring State-of-the-Art Technology to Global Traders", "title_full": "New Bitcoin Software Bring State-of-the-Art Technology to Global Traders", "published": "2018-06-06T18:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c6d3e8b9735f60ec7299eee4a50f641caa3f2a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1ZbhvMTPFOh54tOLtDv9JifQUIlmcGvaU5vjPGcwIhl.KJOm26B1PhE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T18:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Bitcoin Software Bring State-of-the-Art Technology to Global Traders", "text": "June 06, 2018 at 11:23 AM EDT New Bitcoin Software Bring State-of-the-Art Technology to Global Traders\nBitcoin Loophole is a new investment tool that utilizes complex algorithms and beneficial features to executes highly accurate trades. Steve Mckay, who is the creator states that this software has the potential to optimize results for its users, making trading extremely easy for them.\nJune 6, 2018 /MarketersMedia/ —\nWhether it is the Wall Street or the rest of the world, cryptocurrency has become a craze. It all began when Bitcoin was released amidst the global financial crisis in 2008. Increasing from a value of just $0.008 to $18,000 per unit in 9 years, bitcoin is regarded as one of the most sought-after digital currencies for trading.\nTo cater to the increasing demands of traders, software developers and experienced investors are getting together to create trading systems that can simplify the entire process without requiring traders to gain knowledge of the working mechanism and complexities surrounding blockchain technology. Today, there are many such tools available which can assist traders with their trading tasks.\nThe Bitcoin Loophole is the brainchild of Steve McKay , who happens to be a professional investor himself. It makes use of super-fast computers and complex algorithms to execute trades with a high level of accuracy.\nAccording to Steve, he developed this software so he could give back to the community. He has had an extremely successful career as an investor and now he wants others to become like him. He has learned from his experience that these kinds of trading systems only benefitted the wealthy class of people who never revealed their secrets to newcomers or small scale traders.\nAfter he realized that his creation could change lives, he decided to give it away for free. But, licenses are limited to a certain number of sign-ups per day. He says that genuine traders who are interested in finding success in online trading can use Bitcoin Loophole without any risks. This software is proven to work and deliver satisfactory results.\nSince its official release, testimonials have been coming in from those who tried it. These testimonials state that the software is capable of producing excellent results and since it is easy to use, even newcomers can take advantage of the opportunities that are presented by the bitcoin market.\nAlthough the algorithm took a long time to be developed, tested and implemented into the trading software, it is the main element that is responsible for its high accuracy rate. In addition, the developer has integrated a host of special features that have been designed to make trading more flexible and beneficial for traders.\nEach of its features have been tested thoroughly. The team has ensured that the trading system has been tweaked whenever the potential to upgrade was available.\nBasically, its design and interface keeps into account the needs of both novices and experienced traders. Bitcoin Loophole can serve as an excellent tool for all levels of traders. To use it, traders have to determine few settings after which it can be left to operate on its own. All the investment decisions are carried out by the trading system and yet traders have full control over the trades it executes and the investments it makes.\nThe software is a great investment vessel because it eliminates emotional elements from trading. These include emotions like anger, frustration, jealousy, boredom, etc.\nIn fact, it is a very common thing for people to make mistakes out of emotional disturbances. Both experienced and inexperienced traders are vulnerable to making trading decisions based on the emotions they are experiencing and most of the times, they lead to wrong or bad trades to be executed. So another benefit of using this fully automated trading system is that it gives traders the opportunity to enjoy emotionless trading.\nAdditionally, traders get access to features which are advanced, helping them to reduce their risk factors and enhance their returns.\nContact Info:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://top10binarydemo.com/system-scam-reviews/bitcoin-loophole/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve mckay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T01:33:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7654549372dc718d7ced785a659a5fbc6db8e525", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSy03S_B2zdIl6ffAJxV4yhjWDXe29GcrKKhDwgNSMD15j.s5s1YeUqD.YnbTck4gf38Rg_8gxOBkMq4gIUT9f1lH_jypsJB30iG_JKvUdvZg--", "site_full": "www.thedailyeconomist.com", "site": "thedailyeconomist.com", "site_section": "https://www.thedailyeconomist.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "The Daily Economist", "title": "The Daily Economist update for June 6 2018 -

They’re proposing a physically backed bitcoin ETF, the Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust , and it just might be poised to break the losing streak of mainstreaming BTC on Wall Street. This time, they’re aiming at institutional investors by pricing it at $200,000 per share.\nAlso read: Russian Farming Village: Local Crypto, Bitcoin Reserves, No Govt Money Van Eck and Solid X Team for Bitcoin ETF Priced at $200,000\nVan Eck CEO Jan van Eck cheered, “I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios. The Solid X team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.” The Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust will also offer itself as being insured against bitcoin lost or stolen.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports, “The firms also set a relatively high per-share price: $200,000. The price tag is designed to aim the product at institutional rather than retail investors.” And in “determining a marketing partner,” Solid X CEO Daniel H. Gallancy underscored, they “looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio. Van Eck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities.”\nThe two have in common being New York-based and the dubious honor of having been shot down by the SEC when they attempted individually to list a bitcoin ETF. The present filing, as of 6 June 2018, will be watched closely by the ecosystem. Jan van Eck expressed optimism at their latest tactic, “We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\nChicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and its BZX Equities Exchange is believed to be where such a fund, pending approval, would ultimately be listed. The Cboe market maker was the first to list Bitcoin Futures back in December of last year. Results have been decidedly mixed after ecosystem enthusiasm almost promised BTC would moon in response. Now, some have taken to blaming exchanges such as Cboe and its crosstown rival CME for retarding the BTC spot price, for essentially being Crypto Winter’s catalyst as it were. Could be the Right Combination at the Right Time\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” the Van Eck CEO stressed.\nIndeed, earlier this year, these pages reported how in a “ Staff Letter: Engaging on Fund Innovation and Cryptocurrency-related Holdings of 18 January, signed by newly appointed Director Dalia Blass from the Division of Investment Management, the SEC wrote to the Investment Company Institute and Asset Management Group Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) about the prospects of bitcoin ETFs.” It was a letter filled with admonitions and warnings and potential confusions. One thing was glaringly clear: any bitcoin ETF going forward must contend with its concerns.\nTwo months ago to almost the day, however, hopeful signs appeared to emerge. Presumably in response to a Cboe open letter plea for action from President and COO Chris Concannon, the SEC seemed to be moving along further than it had previously while it considered two fund candidates from Pro Shares. Comment portion of the process has just wrapped. The Journal quotes Mr. Gallancy of Solid X as reminding they “never had any intention of giving up.” Neither has the broader crypto investment community, showing how it is not content to just sit back and wait for permission. “Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on its recently launched index of ten digital assets,” News.Bitcoin.com explained. In further anticipation, “Okex, the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users.

Mr de Vries published the study, titled ‘Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem’, in the energy-focused CellPress Joule and warned that power demand among Bitcoin miners could triple by the end of this year alone.\nIt’s an argument that’s akin to the concerns raised by computing experts in the 1990s that half of the American energy grid would be dedicated to powering the internet alone. That theory proved to be somewhat overestimated as the Berkeley Lab ScienceBeat confirmed. Jonathan Koomey, a researcher at Berkeley Lab, also disagrees with the view of de Vries on the power demands of Bitcoin. Koomey fears that the same false alarm bells are being rung about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole, with the assertion that Bitcoin energy amounts to the same amount consumed by Ireland leaving him somewhat uneasy.\nKoomey insists that de Vries and other people that are keen to “overestimate electricity use” through the use of computers simply “don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions” they are alluding to. Within de Vries’ report, he claims that the global Bitcoin network currently consumes a minimum of 2.55 gigawatts of electricity, with the potential for that to grow two-fold to around 7.67 gigawatts. Furthermore, de Vries is not alone in his fears about the appetite for gigawatt usage throughout the Bitcoin community.\nWhile the vast majority of Bitcoin investors will choose to buy Bitcoin from credible exchanges, many of which are listed and reviewed on Best Bitcoin Exchange , a minority prefer to ‘mine’ their own Bitcoin using computer processors to solve cryptographic puzzles and create the Bitcoin, before adding it to the public ledger. Not even Koomey is suggesting that Bitcoin mining is not energy-intensive. But what Koomey is debating are the underlying calculations of the value of energy used in Bitcoin mining and the price paid for the energy. Image: Pixabay.com\nKoomey believes that many of the figures bandied about by de Vries are simply plucked “out of the air”. He added that it was “very unreliable” to make assumptions based on calculations in this way. Another factor in the unreliability of de Vries’ Bitcoin energy claims is that much of the Bitcoin mining that goes on tends to be carried out in private. Subsequently, much of the energy consumption data necessary to come to any accurate conclusion is not easily at hand. In addition, many Bitcoin miners are very eco-conscious and aware of their impact on the wider environment. They tend to scour the world for cheap, low-carbon energy, with Iceland’s geothermal resources proving particularly popular with the Bitcoin community, according to Computing.co.uk .\nWhen de Vries was pushed for comment on the feedback made by Koomey and co., he could not be reached, but the Dutchman released his own press release soon after, admitting that “back-of-the-envelope calculations” only go so far and that increased “scientific discussion” was needed to determine where the Bitcoin network is headed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3026563/cryptocurrency-miners-set-to-use-more-power-than-consumers-in-iceland-this-year", "http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/net-energy-studies.html", "https://pixabay.com/en/power-plant-geothermal-67538/", "https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6?code=cell-site", "https://www.bestbitcoinexchange.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael mortimer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan koomey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koomey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "much energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkeley lab sciencebeat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkeley lab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cellpress joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T00:25:41.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0eea38e94c76967efdb4727738161030330acc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZnGLbCheFxGZIpT1UCO1VU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin will get legitimacy in all countries?", "title_full": "Bitcoin will get legitimacy in all countries?", "published": "2018-06-06T18:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0eea38e94c76967efdb4727738161030330acc2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZnGLbCheFxGZIpT1UCO1VU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "boty", "published": "2018-06-06T18:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin will get legitimacy in all countries?", "text": "bitcoin will be legitimacy when bitcoin has very clear rules and when bitcoin can be used in all countries with clear legality then bitcoin can gain legitimacy, it may take some time to get it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:32:21.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86f8650ffd067f62f6ceeac5ff545281660561da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUYSTcua7GyafWTBWRDjtRlliaIG_rp8Y8ewgYTm0p5kwJOLZCsGAVeK7xvdvc4pEQmwtT5I0L0UqXq_4zGPuunpgfaGS16WInLgA3sYqlNA9", "site_full": "alterminds.xyz", "site": "alterminds.xyz", "site_section": "http://alterminds.xyz/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Alter Minds", "title": "Major Wall Street Firm Secretly Traded Bitcoin for Over Two Years", "title_full": "Major Wall Street Firm Secretly Traded Bitcoin for Over Two Years", "published": "2018-06-06T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86f8650ffd067f62f6ceeac5ff545281660561da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUYSTcua7GyafWTBWRDjtRlliaIG_rp8Y8ewgYTm0p5kwJOLZCsGAVeK7xvdvc4pEQmwtT5I0L0UqXq_4zGPuunpgfaGS16WInLgA3sYqlNA9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alter Minds", "published": "2018-06-06T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Major Wall Street Firm Secretly Traded Bitcoin for Over Two Years", "text": "\nWall Street continues to show a great interest in Bitcoin. Various firms are looking at the concept of introducing trading desks. One company, which has flown under most people’s radar, already took the plunge a while ago. Susquehanna International Group has built up a trading desk of a dozen people buying and selling cryptocurrency. Advertisements Bitcoin is an Appealing Currency\nA lot of money can be made and lost with cryptocurrencies. The volatile nature of this industry makes it appealing to speculators and investors. It was a matter of time until the Wall Street big shots began dabbling in these currencies as well. So far, most of the major firms are still in the early process of developing these new options for their clients.\nThat is not the case for Susquehanna International Group. The firm is best-known for trading stocks, ETFs, and options. In that regard, it is not all that different from most Wall Street firms on the market today. What does make it unique is its position in the cryptocurrency trading industry. The privately owned firm has been buying and selling Bitcoin and other currencies through private deals for two years.\nExpanding this functionality will occur shortly. The company indicates they will expose 500 of its clients to cryptocurrency trading in the coming weeks. If successful, the venture will be expanded upon rather quickly. It is another sign of how cryptocurrencies are bound to go mainstream very soon. Moreover, it seems a matter of time until other financial institutions follow this lead by example. A Major Gamble by the Wall Street Firm\nTwo years ago, Bitcoin was not in the position it is right now. In fact, its value was a lot lower and far less attractive to Wall Street. Even so, this particular Wall Street firm saw merit in jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon at such an early stage. In hindsight, it seems to have been a very smart decision when it comes to Bitcoin.\nUnder the current circumstances, not everyone favors Wall Street getting involved in cryptocurrency trading. A lot of people wonder whether or not this will lead to even more speculation and price volatility. Susquehanna’s head of the digital asset group isn’t too concerned in this regard. In his opinion, Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold as a scarce commodity. Even so, Smith acknowledges the currency has a “wide array of uses”, but did not further specify which those may be.\nAll of this shows there is a bright future ahead for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. When Wall Street firms prepare to take the plunge on this industry, it is a matter of time until mainstream traction occurs. Even so, cryptocurrencies still have very few real-world use cases outside of speculation. Changing that will not be easy by any means. Future scaling solutions for Bitcoin and Ethereum may effectively speed up that change a lot sooner than people anticipate.\nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Major Wall Street Firm Secretly Traded Bitcoin for Over Two Years appeared first on NewsBTC.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "susquehanna international group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:50:28.065+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eee1b9518782bb0636e32046c83b33b672be7751", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUbkow9LuvTJSdcWilZU.BS8fwVTjCJjwLfFCYG2H0w4OVhCly_YwhNxqZivBUttRy7YNwe59COY2kvcapbyMnVThQ0x81vA.vw--", "site_full": "alterminds.xyz", "site": "alterminds.xyz", "site_section": "http://alterminds.xyz/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Alter Minds", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website", "title_full": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website", "published": "2018-06-06T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/alterminds.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/russia-court-768x768.png?fit=768%2C768&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eee1b9518782bb0636e32046c83b33b672be7751", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUbkow9LuvTJSdcWilZU.BS8fwVTjCJjwLfFCYG2H0w4OVhCly_YwhNxqZivBUttRy7YNwe59COY2kvcapbyMnVThQ0x81vA.vw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alter Minds", "published": "2018-06-06T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website", "text": "\nA Russian court has overturned a previous court decision to block a bitcoin-related website because it contains information about cryptocurrencies. The Supreme Court ordered the city court to hear the appeal. Advertisements\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Russian Court Overturned Previous Decision St. Petersburg City Court.\nThe St. Petersburg City Court has overturned the ruling of the Vyborgsky District Court of St. Petersburg to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in Russia.\n“The St. Petersburg City Court quashed the decision of the district court to recognize the information posted on the Bitcoininfo.ru website,” Tass reported the city court explaining on Monday, June 4.\n“Vyborg District Court of St. Petersburg will again consider the case of the blocking of the site on cryptocurrencies, www.bitcoininfo.ru,” Rapsi learned from the city court, adding:\nThe city court canceled the decision to block the site and sent the case [back] to the Vyborgsky District Court for a new hearing. Problem With Spreading Crypto Information\nThis case began in July 2016 when the St. Petersburg Vyborgsky District Court made the ruling to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in absence of the site owner. The court “considered the statement of the prosecutor’s office that the site contains information about cryptocurrencies” and decided to block the site, the publication detailed.\nAccording to the case file, Tass explained that the prosecutor’s office demanded the site be blocked based on its content about cryptocurrencies that “do not lend themselves to state control,” “promote the growth of the shadow economy,” and “do not have certain consumer properties.”\nThe representative of the website’s owner, Sarkis Darbinyan, told the publication that the prosecutor’s actions “takes place without the involvement of site owners,” adding that none of them received “requests for the removal of prohibited information, and the city court refuses to accept appeals after the actual blocking of websites.”\nHe further detailed:\nAccording to the statements of the prosecutor’s office of St. Petersburg, about 100 sites devoted to cryptocurrencies have been blocked.\nThe domain administrator appealed against the court’s decision, believing it to be illegal. However, the city court did not consider his appeal so he appealed to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which subsequently ordered the city court to consider his complaint.\nIn March, the St. Petersburg City Court struck down a ban on 40 bitcoin-related websites offering information about cryptocurrencies and exchange services in Russia, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.\nDo you think bitcoin websites will finally be unblocked in Russia?

Not a new thing\nHe says that the question of whether banking will eventually become obsolete is as old as the internet itself, but never before has it seemed so pertinent. The IMF does not consider cryptocurrency to be a threat – yet .\nHelp us to make Finance Magnates better!\nCentral banks must defend themselves against cryptocurrency, the report says, by carrying out ‘effective monetary policies.”\nThere are three things that fiat currency can offer that Bitcoin can’t – potection against structural deflation, the ability to act as a lender of last resort, and the “smooth the business cycle” in the event of unexpected shocks to the system. In short, the guiding hand of a central command.\nBut, he notes, this could come in time. Bitcoin could become less volatile simply through long use establishing institutional trust, and artificial intelligence could smooth those shocks.\nThese, in tandem with the intrinsic advantages of digital money (that it is cheaper and easier to send long distances), mean that He considers a changing of the guard to be a very real possibility.\nHe argues that by rendering intermediaries irrelevant, cryptocurrency could bring the world back to a commodity-based economy, replacing the credit-based economy to which we have become accustomed (“…we may move full circle back to where we were in the Renaissance!”).\nA more important question to the IMF though is if central banks could lose the ability to control the national economy. He says yes. Central banks set their policies by setting interest rates in relation to the country’s money reserves, of which it is the monopoly supplier. A cryptocurrency-based economy would mean that this monopoly is lost, and a bank may find itself needing to sell/buy large amounts of cryptocurrency to regain control.\nHe uses ‘dollarization’ as an example, referring to the process by which foreign money supercedes the national currency in a developing country. When this happens, the central bank’s policies become disconnected from the real economy, and thus irrelevant. What should they do?\nHe argues that they first thing that central banks should do is “strive to make fiat currencies better and more stable units of account.”\nThe second thing is to regulate cryptocurrency in order to “prevent… any unfair competitive advantage crypto assets may derive from lighter regulation.”\nLastly, these banks could try to make their money more user-friendly, making it digital, and perhaps even issuing tokens of their own. “Such central bank digital currency could be exchanged, peer to peer in a decentralized manner, much as crypto assets are,” writes He.\nSome would argue that He may have missed the point here. However his words echo those of Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the IMF, who said in a speech at the Bank of England last year: “The best response by central banks is to continue running effective monetary policy, while being open to fresh ideas and new demands, as economies evolve.”\nThe IMF was created in December 1945 as part of the Bretton Woods agreement. Its function is to maintain international economic stability by providing advice and by issuing loans. It has 189 member states and controls a fund of $668 billion. It is headquartered in Washington D.C.\nIn its last report it devoted considerable space to the question of whether cryptocurrency is a threat to the existing financial system, concluding that it isn’t at the moment, but could be .\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRisHN0415X-E5Ru16ORunEn_qNxIuhGgZIlFqtW8ul0HEpg/viewform?usp=sf_link", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/imf-cryptocurrency-not-appear-pose-risk-financial-stability/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-experts-say-blockchain-just-slow-database/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monetary and capital markets department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:25:30.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e86e1845343d509bdf07b55d44c600287e111a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBOuT9qpdxOfHwwXBJCXTslJuMAPKcg585tBRtc.tdQyzd4F37sFSuC..rUiKGDa4BYxe_UhaogR8k3vfq3KTFjRW8Kvxe4qqjZx5BBXQILbxJdKVHptcP29ZkExC4a_YWohZ9S0wwYSvh6HoB6tjGJvuguR5659z0l5hcqs76deGXNzBFZelnMvAdzn5dcG1SQ", "site_full": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoinschannel.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoins Channel", "title": "Personalized Bitcoin Wallet Card Insert – Engrave Your Public Key on This Unique Metal Laser Engraved Credit Card Sized Cryptocurrency Gift", "title_full": "Personalized Bitcoin Wallet Card Insert – Engrave Your Public Key on This Unique Metal Laser Engraved Credit Card Sized Cryptocurrency Gift", "published": "2018-06-06T17:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417YI81LttL.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e86e1845343d509bdf07b55d44c600287e111a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBOuT9qpdxOfHwwXBJCXTslJuMAPKcg585tBRtc.tdQyzd4F37sFSuC..rUiKGDa4BYxe_UhaogR8k3vfq3KTFjRW8Kvxe4qqjZx5BBXQILbxJdKVHptcP29ZkExC4a_YWohZ9S0wwYSvh6HoB6tjGJvuguR5659z0l5hcqs76deGXNzBFZelnMvAdzn5dcG1SQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "writer", "published": "2018-06-06T17:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Personalized Bitcoin Wallet Card Insert – Engrave Your Public Key on This Unique Metal Laser Engraved Credit Card Sized Cryptocurrency Gift", "text": "6 Views\nPrice: $22.95 Accept bitcoin anywhere you go with this personalized public key wallet card.

Needless to say, none of these exuberant high-return promises panned out; instead, investors ended up losing money.\nBhardwaj was arrested in April by Indian police and has been under custody since then. After questioning him, the police is now reportedly questioning people who associated with him or his companies.\nThe first to fall under ED’s radar is the British businessman Raj Kundra (who does most of his business in India). Kundra was questioned for eight continuous hours by ED on Tuesday, as per a report from Indian daily Times of India (TOI).\nED found several transactions made between Bharadwaj and one of Kundra’s firms prompting them to investigate further.\nKundra has however denied all allegations of being involved in the scam. He told TOI:\nThis is to clarify that I have no involvement or connection in the Bitcoin scam whatsoever. I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An inquiry is underway and I am cooperating with the law enforcement agency as Bhardwaj is an acquaintance and protocol is being followed. Bharadwaj was to buy a team in the poker league and got into a contract with us. But due to non-payment, his contract was terminated. I have come as a witness to the same.\nAnother Indian news channel has reported that the questioning of Kundra has led ED to more celebrities who all promoted GBMiners at various events in Dubai and Singapore. The most prominent name on the list is Sunny Leone, the adult film star turned Bollywood actress.\nThe rest of the list also features film actresses that any Bollywood fan can recognize in a jiffy: Prachi Desai, Aarti Chabria, Sonal Chauhan, Karishma Tanna, Zareen Khan, Neha Dhupia, Huma Qureshi, Nargis Fakhri, and Kundra’s wife Shilpa Shetty.\nNone of the celebrities are however being indicted in the scam, as per local media reports. They are being questioned about their promotional activities in relation to Bharadwaj’s companies.\nThis is not the first time that celebrities are getting in trouble for promoting cryptocurrency projects or initial coin offerings (ICOs) that turn out to be a scam — Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled, and Steven Seagal have all been there .\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even issued a warning in December last year against celebrity endorsements of ICOs, stating that most of such endorsements are illegal if the celebrity fails to disclose their relationship with or investment in the cryptocurrency.

Needless to say, none of these exuberant high-return promises panned out; instead, investors ended up losing money.\nBhardwaj was arrested in April by Indian police and has been under custody since then. After interrogating him, police is now reportedly questioning people associated with him and his companies.\nThe first to fall under ED’s radar is the British businessman Raj Kundra (who does most of his business in India). Kundra was questioned for eight continuous hours by ED on Tuesday, local outlet Times of India reports .\nED found several transactions made between Bharadwaj and one of Kundra’s firms prompting them to investigate further.\nKundra has however denied all allegations of being involved in the scam. He told TOI:\nThis is to clarify that I have no involvement or connection in the Bitcoin scam whatsoever. I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An inquiry is underway and I am cooperating with the law enforcement agency as Bhardwaj is an acquaintance and protocol is being followed. Bharadwaj was to buy a team in the poker league and got into a contract with us. But due to non-payment, his contract was terminated. I have come as a witness to the same.\nAnother Indian news channel reported the questioning of Kundra subsequently led to more celebrities, who purportedly promoted GBMiners at various events in Dubai and Singapore. The most prominent name on the list is Sunny Leone, the adult film star turned Bollywood actress.\nThe rest of the list also features film actresses that any Bollywood fan can recognize in a jiffy: Prachi Desai, Aarti Chabria, Sonal Chauhan, Karishma Tanna, Zareen Khan, Neha Dhupia, Huma Qureshi, Nargis Fakhri, and Kundra’s wife Shilpa Shetty.\nHowever, it appears none of the celebrities have been indicted in the scam so far, according to local media. They are being questioned about their promotional activities in relation to Bharadwaj’s companies.\nThis is not the first time that celebrities are getting in trouble for promoting cryptocurrency projects or initial coin offerings (ICOs) that prove to be fraudulent — Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled, and Steven Seagal have all been there .\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even issued a warning against celebrity-backed ICOs last December, noting that such sponsored endorsements are illegal if the celebrity fails to disclose their relationship (or stake) with the cryptocurrency.\nIt seems India could benefit from similar legislation.

Juni 2018 - NTT Security, das auf Sicherheit spezialisierte Unternehmen und „Security Center of Excellence“ der NTT Group, berät seine Kunden zu den wichtigsten IT-Risiken bei der Nutzung von Kryptowährungen. openPR.de/t1006577 openPR.de/t1006577 Bei spekulativen Finanzanlagen müssen Anleger immer mit Verlusten rechnen. Das ist bei Kryptowährungen nicht anders als bei Aktien oder Derivaten. Jenseits wirtschaftlicher Risiken stellt sich bei Bitcoin und Co. aber auch die Frage nach der IT-Sicherheit. Die Experten von NTT Security informieren über die wesentlichen Punkte: openPR.de/t1006577 openPR.de/t1006577 • Bitcoin ist die bekannteste Implementierung der Blockchain-Technologie und kann nach heutigem Wissenstand als sicher gelten. Die kryptographischen Verfahren sind sehr aufwändig und gut durchdacht. Trotz des aufsehenerregenden Höhenflugs des Bitcoins, der ihn für Cyber-Kriminelle eigentlich zu einem lohnenden Ziel macht, ist bisher kein erfolgreicher Angriff auf diese Technologie bekannt geworden. openPR.de/t1006577 openPR.de/t1006577 • Stark gefährdet ist jedoch die Infrastruktur, die sich um den Bitcoin gebildet hat, und ohne die der Bitcoin nicht funktionieren kann. Bitcoin-Handelsplätze (Börsen) und Wallets (lokale Software für den Zugang zu den Börsen) waren in der Vergangenheit immer wieder Ziel von erfolgreichen Angriffen. Die Marktteilnehmer müssen in solchen Fällen meist mit einem Totalverlust rechnen, da die Betreiber der Börsen derartige Verluste nicht ausgleichen können beziehungsweise wollen. openPR.de/t1006577 openPR.de/t1006577 • Ein weiterer möglicher Angriffspunkt sind die Systeme der Nutzer selbst – wer sich auf seinem PC etwa einen Virus eingefangen hat, dem helfen auch beste kryptographische Lösungen nicht. Angreifer können dann Bitcoins leicht auf eigene Konten umleiten. Wer daher am Bitcoin-Verfahren teilnehmen will, muss zuerst seine eigenen Systeme absichern. openPR.de/t1006577 openPR.de/t1006577 • Vom hohen Sicherheitsniveau der Bitcoin-Technologie darf man nicht auf andere Kryptowährungen schließen. In der Vergangenheit haben sich wiederholt Design-Fehler gezeigt, die zu Verlusten bei den Teilnehmern geführt haben. So konnte ein Unbekannter beispielsweise einen Programmierfehler bei Ethereum nutzen, um mehrere Millionen dieser Währung auf seinen eigenen Account umzuleiten. openPR.de/t1006577 openPR.de/t1006577 • Auf einer ganz anderen Ebene wirkt ein Sicherheitsproblem, das kürzlich in Verbindung mit der Kryptowährung Monero bekannt wurde: Dabei wurden die Rechner von Nutzern bestimmter Websites dazu missbraucht, um im Rahmen eines Botnetzes heimlich und auf Kosten der betreffenden Nutzer das rechenintensive Generieren von Monero (Mining) durchzuführen. openPR.de/t1006577 openPR.de/t1006577 \"Alles, was digital ist, ist ein potentielles Ziel für Cyber-Kriminelle, und das gilt natürlich auch für Kryptowährungen\", erklärt René Bader, Manager Critical Business Applications & Big Data bei NTT Security. \"Auch beim herkömmlichen Online-Banking muss man auf die IT-Sicherheit achten, und wer sich auf dem Rechner, mit dem er Online-Banking betreibt, Malware eingefangen hat, der hat auch hier schlechte Karten. Die Besonderheit bei Kryptowährungen ist jedoch, dass sie keine prinzipielle Instanz kennen, die aufpasst oder womöglich sogar Schadensersatz leistet. Wem Bitcoins durch einen Implementierungsfehler oder durch Schadsoftware abhandenkommen, der verliert sein Geld. Entsprechende Vorsorge ist also unerlässlich.\" openPR.de/t1006577 openPR.de/t1006577 Diese Presseinformation und das Bild in höherer Auflösung können unter www.pr-com.de/nttsecurity abgerufen werden. openPR.de/t1006577 openPR.de/t1006577 Diese Pressemitteilung wurde auf openPR im Presseportal München veröffentlicht. openPR.de/t1006577", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://opr.li/33a0f8/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nutzung von kryptowährungen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trotz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kunden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derivaten", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kryptowährungen wie bitcoin & co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntt security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ntt group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "deutschland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismaning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kryptowährungen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T17:48:36.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c727c9e00019775cb0e9e43119b1c53b75ffe6bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1a9ebIvFfFiBEElP4nxV2gF_wZp7x_7q7FP0Q.92lvUI1AjrJZfnrac9TFzP7baF6nCV2fsDYU_7ADbFqVvjXqPjvOTgqRO7EuSa8bssGpLqWpDUXyInp22ZbEqcAiLnDqQ3DdHrXwo6pPrI1XKfmZzey1tHnvEv8CjZ5WWJR8STQ--", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6904", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Press Release Distribution Service", "title": "The Bitcoin Foundation’s Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture’s Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018", "title_full": "The Bitcoin Foundation’s Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture’s Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018", "published": "2018-06-06T17:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c727c9e00019775cb0e9e43119b1c53b75ffe6bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1a9ebIvFfFiBEElP4nxV2gF_wZp7x_7q7FP0Q.92lvUI1AjrJZfnrac9TFzP7baF6nCV2fsDYU_7ADbFqVvjXqPjvOTgqRO7EuSa8bssGpLqWpDUXyInp22ZbEqcAiLnDqQ3DdHrXwo6pPrI1XKfmZzey1tHnvEv8CjZ5WWJR8STQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T17:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Bitcoin Foundation’s Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture’s Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018", "text": "By: Press Release Distribution Service June 06, 2018 at 10:36 AM EDT The Bitcoin Foundation’s Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture’s Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018\nTokenMarket announces its second phase of speakers in addition to its number of high profile speakers whom will join the already distinguished summit line up.\nGibraltar, Gibraltar - June 6, 2018 /MarketersMedia/ —\nTokenMarket , the leading ICO advisory firm, announced today the second round of guest speakers to appear at its debut blockchain event, ‘ TokenMarket 2018: Insights into the Token Economy ’.\nThe summit will take place at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel in Gibraltar during 28th-29th of June, hosting a number of industry leading speakers discussing a variety of emerging topics surrounding blockchain.

Cloud mining service Coinmint confirmed it would press ahead with opening a Bitcoin mining plant in an abandoned smokestack in Upstate New York, CNBC reports June 5. The move, which authorities greenlighted in January, will see the company invest “up to $700 mln” in the project, which will repurpose the former 1300-acres-large Alcoa aluminium smelting plant by the end of 2019. Operations will continue under the newly-formed subsidiary North Country Data Center Corporation, which began work this week, a press release confirmed. “As long as bitcoin network exists we anticipate mining to be profitable,” Coinmint CEO Prieur Leary said quoted by CNBC, adding in the release that the subsidiary launch “is a key milestone towards the Massena site reaching its full capacity.” This year has seen multiple schemes to leverage former infrastructure in area with cheap electricity for the purposes of mining Bitcoin . Not all have struck a chord with local governments, with plans in nearby Quebec meeting with stiff criticism over the impact on local economies. “If you want to come settle here, plug in your servers and do Bitcoin mining, we’re not really interested,” the region’s Premier Philippe Couillard said in March. For politicians in Massena, the nearest town to the Alcoa plant, the project conversely represents a boon to the local workforce, as it promises to create an extra 150 jobs. “The thought of 150 jobs and revitalization of the Alcoa East Facility is exciting and what we have been working for,” Massena Town Supervisor Steve O'Shaughnessy said as part of the press release. “We are ready to provide any assistance we can to move this project to its full potential.” ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/quebec-were-not-interested-in-bitcoin-mining-without-added-value", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/bitcoin-miner-revamps-alcoas-aluminum-factory.html", "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-largest-digital-currency-data-center-commences-operations-300659812.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-comes-to-new-york-as-lawmakers-approve-power-allocation", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-mining"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prieur leary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "upstate ny home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north country data center corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alcoa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upstate new york", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "upstate new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T01:09:13.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b396be16b4af452b1b399108b44cb6907dab829c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJU820hfFrJnj4NNqB0o9n5wlBxPZoQkPQNHs8GYuOuXFetQc2BsUzJ6tItdcPY1W2jUksS7EMU0qPFD3N6zaCB3zLiZz_BgZxaGqldMEeetye9ambry4_aY8buXI1.UtSMKdNjFZRPqVcHZkfjP_j", "site_full": "www.ibtimes.co.in", "site": "ibtimes.co.in", "site_section": "http://www.ibtimes.co.in/rss/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "IBTimes India : Top News", "title": "Bitcoin scandal: After Raj Kundra, now Sunny Leone, Neha Dhupia, Zareen Khan names crop up", "title_full": "Bitcoin scandal: After Raj Kundra, now Sunny Leone, Neha Dhupia, Zareen Khan names crop up", "published": "2018-06-06T17:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/689492/sunny-leone-neha-dhupia-zareen-khan.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2795, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b396be16b4af452b1b399108b44cb6907dab829c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJU820hfFrJnj4NNqB0o9n5wlBxPZoQkPQNHs8GYuOuXFetQc2BsUzJ6tItdcPY1W2jUksS7EMU0qPFD3N6zaCB3zLiZz_BgZxaGqldMEeetye9ambry4_aY8buXI1.UtSMKdNjFZRPqVcHZkfjP_j", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T17:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin scandal: After Raj Kundra, now Sunny Leone, Neha Dhupia, Zareen Khan names crop up", "text": "Bollywood Bitcoin scandal: After Raj Kundra, now Sunny Leone, Neha Dhupia, Zareen Khan names crop up Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra said he went to the Enforcement Directorate as a witness for the ongoing investigations in the Rs 2,000 crore bitcoin scam.

An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency.\"\nAccording to a report in Zee News, during the interrogation, several names of high-profile Bollywood celebrities have also cropped up which includes Sunny Leone , Prachi Desai, Aarti Chabria, Sonal Chauhan, Karishma Tanna, Zareen Khan, Neha Dhupia, Huma Qureshi and Nargis Fakhri. The ED is likely to question Shilpa Shetty as well on the matter.\nHowever, this is not the first time Kundra had a brush with law. In the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team. Some members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal.\nIn his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: \"I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.\"\n\"The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,\" said Kundra.\nHe added that Bhardwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same.\n\"However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection. While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments,\" he said.\n\"Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical. We remain excited about the company's future and strive to keep adding shareholder value,\" he said.\nIt may be recalled, the ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against a bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others.\nThe ED had alleged that about 8,000 investors lost around Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nThe Pune police had later arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek in the case.\nIn May, the Gujarat branch of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had arrested Kirit Paladiya for stealing bitcoins from his partner. According to the police authorities, Paladiya stole 176 bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore from his partner, Shailesh Bhatt.\nFurthermore, Amreli's Superintendent of Police Jagdish Patel, Amreli local Crime Branch inspector Anant Patel and two other constables were arrested for alleged involvement in the case.\n(With IANS/ANI Inputs) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

to Launch Bitcoin ETF NEWS Nikhilesh De Jun 6, 2018 at 14:30 UTC | Updated Jun 6, 2018 at 14:38 UTC\nInvestment firm VanEck has partnered with financial services company SolidX in their latest attempt to launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\nThe companies announced Wednesday that they would list a \"physically-backed bitcoin ETF that will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin.\"\nUnder the arrangement, VanEck will market the ETF, while SolidX will act as sponsor, according to a press release . The companies noted that both have previously filed individually to list bitcoin ETFs on various stock exchanges.\nVanEck chief executive Jan van Eck said bitcoin is \"a legitimate investment option, as a type of 'digital gold' that may make sense for investors' portfolios.\"\nThe CEO noted that the ETF has not yet been created, saying \"We're pleased to join with [SolidX] in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.\" When asked by CoinDesk, he declined to provide details on what assets would be used to back the fund.\nNeither SolidX nor VanEck has succeeded in launching a bitcoin ETF to date. As previously reported by CoinDesk, both companies withdrew previous attempts at launching the products at the request of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nVan Eck expressed optimism about the fund's potential, despite the regulatory obstacles they have faced, saying:\n\"We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.\"\nIf approved by regulators, the new ETF would be listed on the CBOE BZX Equities Exchange, according to the release.\nMarkets image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

227\nBitcoin Gold, already a fork of Bitcoin, has announced an upcoming hard fork of its network. With this upgrade, the development team is aiming at two aspects that are making the network vulnerable – the threat of increasing ASIC miner flooding the network and to prevent future 51 percent attacks .\nIn the official announcement released on 4th June, the team noted: “We’re doing this for two reasons: we need to address the threat of ASIC miners coming into the Equihash mining space, and we need to take steps to improve the security of our blockchain in light of the recent 51% / Double Spend attacks.”\nHelp us to make Finance Magnates better!\nBitcoin Cash was created in October 2017 by forking Bitcoin’s blockchain . To keep the existing ASIC miners of Bitcoin at a distance, the new coin used Equihash Proof-of-Work algorithm, an alteration to Bitcoin’s hash algorithm. Though for the time being, it kept the ASIC miners away, Bitmain’s introduction of a new mining device – Antminer Z9 – opened the gates of Bitcoin Gold to the ASIC miners.\nIn the new upgrade, the team is changing the existing Equihash algorithm with new Equihash-BTG. This will increase the memory required for the ASIC miners for the mining activity and thus will make their mining business unprofitable. Vulnerable network\nAnother major target Bitcoin Gold developers are trying to hit is the vulnerability of the network to 51 percent attacks. The coin shares its algorithm with many cryptocurrencies and thus hash rate generated from a collective pool can easily exploit the network.\nMoreover, Bitcoin Gold’s network was already compromised using 51 percent attack last month which resulted in the theft of $18 million worth of BTG tokens.\nThe team is claiming that the introduction of the new algorithm will drastically reduce the required hash power which will make it very difficult to take similar control over the network.\nAccording to the announcement, the development team has already started the process, however, the exact date of the migration is not revealed yet as it will take the involvement of all the stakeholders including wallets, exchanges, and mining pools.\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRisHN0415X-E5Ru16ORunEn_qNxIuhGgZIlFqtW8ul0HEpg/viewform?usp=sf_link", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/51-percent-attacks-appear-hit-verge-electroneum/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/todays-day-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-now/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/bloggers/possible-bitcoin-hard-fork-repercussions-trading/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:25:41.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c953546ca39bcd4478a7c66f2280180584920f36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQErkeMmdCj0jK90Cd7.15w-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "I lost 80% of my bitcoins in alts, What can I do now?!", "title_full": "I lost 80% of my bitcoins in alts, What can I do now?!", "published": "2018-06-06T17:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c953546ca39bcd4478a7c66f2280180584920f36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQErkeMmdCj0jK90Cd7.15w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Collider", "published": "2018-06-06T17:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "I lost 80% of my bitcoins in alts, What can I do now?!", "text": "You can sell 50% of your altcoins into Bitcoin and wait few years.\nOr you can do day trading, but be very careful, you can loose everything!\nThere isnt better option.

Behind the scenes though, the development of Bitcoin has continued to defy market movements with the continuous development of the Lightning Network (LN), which has led to the creation of several bitcoin LN wallets.\nThe Lightning Network ushered in the promise of easing network congestion by moving on-chain transactions to the second-layer protocol.\nHere are some of the mobile wallets currently in development. Eclair\nDeveloped by Paris-based ACINQ, Lightning-ready Bitcoin wallet Eclair currently has 3,000 wallet downloads, and it came about as a result of three years of working on Lightning. The Eclair wallet is a real Lightning node not a remote control app for a node running on a server. Users can transfer money from a checking to a savings account by closing channels, generate Lightning invoices, and pay Lightning invoices through QR codes or Lightning invoices.\nDominique Padiou, a software engineer at Eclair, told Bitcoin Magazine that payment route computation is made by the wallet itself, which creates better privacy, similar to the way a node on a server would.\nAt the moment, the wallet is outbound only. This is a deliberate move as the company believes users need a mobile Lightning wallet to make payments but not necessarily to receive payments. There are plans, however, to add a receiving feature in the future.\nFor now, funds stored in LN channels cannot be backed up through the app. Padiou said the company plans to “improve the performance of the wallet in the future, make it secure and add a backup mechanism for the LN channels.” This wallet is only available on the Google Play Store . Bitcoin Lightning Wallet\nBitcoin Lightning is an SPV BIP37-based wallet developed by Anton Kumaigorodski. It features full Lightning Network support that provides for both on-chain and off-chain network transactions and is available in both testnet and mainnet.\nProcessing is local for both on- and off-chain transactions. Users can send and receive bitcoin almost instantly through dedicated channels. One unique quality of this wallet is that it uses a system of storage tokens to store channel backups and delay refunding transactions anonymously.\nThis process is important, since “having a mnemonic phrase won’t get your lost channel balance back unless you have a backup,” Kumaigorodski stated. The potential for funds to go missing due to inconsistencies remain, but Kumaigorodski added that “the wallet offers off-chain data loss protection by automating the channel.” This wallet is available on the Google Play Store . Rawtx\nRawtx, short for “raw transactions,” is a mobile Lightning Network wallet for Bitcoin that allows users to send and receive testnet bitcoins on the blockchain and Lightning Network. The lead developer, known by the alias “raw tx,” told Bitcoin Magazine that they created the wallet for users who wanted to test out and get familiar with Lightning technology.\nHe went further to explain what makes the wallet unique. “It is the easiest to start with. One of the first things we show the user is a way of opening a channel with Lightning faucet.” The Rawtx wallet is built on lnd which is one of the most stable Lightning implementations out there.\nThe app currently supports mainnet transactions but enabling it is not entirely straightforward. The developer told us that the current app available for download is only on testnet, but mainnet testing has begun and it looks promising.\nThe iOS version of the Rawtx wallet is scheduled to be released later this month while the Android version can be found here .\nOther bitcoin Lightning wallets that have been released include LND Thin Wallet developed by Union 7 Labs, Swift Lightning Project and Shango Lightning Wallet . They offer similar features with very little difference in structure and how they process off-chain transactions. Usability Issues\nWhile Lightning has grown since it was first proposed back in 2015, there is still a long way to go in making these apps easy to use for everyday payments for the average person.\nAt the time of publishing, there are currently 2,135 open nodes and 5,566 channels . While there is lots of excitement and optimism about what the Lightning Network represents, users are expected to be cautious as the technology is still in development and surprises are possible.\nThere are also usability issues which could affect the speed of its adoption unless they are fixed. This is most evident in the channel creation process. A user has to go through a series of confirmations before a new channel is accepted, which means the user has to monitor the channel carefully.\nYou can read more about the Lightning Network here .\nBitcoin Magazine currently does not endorse any of these wallets. While we have no concrete reason to believe they are insecure, all Lightning software is still in very early stages, and we cannot guarantee they will work as advertised.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://github.com/neogeno/shango-lightning-wallet", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-building-a-bidirectional-payment-channel-1464710791/", "https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/.", "https://swiftlightning.io/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lnd-thin-wallet/id1375747279?mt=8", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/first-lightning-network-wallet-app-now-available-google-play/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dominique padiou", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T23:25:01.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5f1b82f1742156d5e81b9fb427231b3fad44edf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfY4LrqtSUM5B4SMqQs5qC1hbm8VM54h9RlVC1uSExx5LeN0bekYfliLzJb1aR1LD1Ummq2eA0Gwm", "site_full": "www.coindesk.com", "site": "coindesk.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Binance Coin Hits Record High Against Bitcoin", "title_full": "Binance Coin Hits Record High Against Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-06T17:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/06/Balloon.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10453, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 6}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5f1b82f1742156d5e81b9fb427231b3fad44edf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfY4LrqtSUM5B4SMqQs5qC1hbm8VM54h9RlVC1uSExx5LeN0bekYfliLzJb1aR1LD1Ummq2eA0Gwm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T17:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Binance Coin Hits Record High Against Bitcoin", "text": "Binance Coin Hits Record High Against Bitcoin NEWS Omkar Godbole Jun 6, 2018 at 14:15 UTC\nBinance coin (BNB), the token launched by the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has hit an all-time high against bitcoin.\nBNB achieved the new milestone of 0.002287 BTC at 10:45 UTC Wednesday, and was last seen changing hands at 0.0022 BTC on Binance, up 8 percent since yesterday.\nThe sharp rally pushed BNB's market capitalization to a five-month high above $1.9 billion, making it the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\nFurther, the rally is backed by a 155 percent rise in trading volume over the last 48 hours, so the stellar gains look sustainable.\nMeanwhile, the binance coin-U.S. dollar (BNB/USD) exchange rate hit a 5.5-month high of $17.60 on Binance and was trading at $16.74 at press time – up 15 percent in the last 24 hours.\nA detailed look at the individual markets reveals that the BNB/BTC and binance coin-tether (BNB/USDT) pairs account for more than 85 percent of the total BNB trading volume ($0.148 billion) seen in the last 24 hours.\nBalloon image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/#markets", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/historical-data/", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/hot-air-gas-burner-fills-dome-213712009?src=n7bAVjn56xDx7DB1b68NlQ-1-2"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bnb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:16:09.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "543e10e6c68200b318015e4cade2522c1213f88e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz01GQqGzB3nwTGbByFsCJmQ-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert -

So far, most of the major firms are still in the early process of developing these new options for their clients.\nThat is not the case for Susquehanna International Group. The firm is best-known for trading stocks, ETFs, and options. In that regard, it is not all that different from most Wall Street firms on the market today. What does make it unique is its position in the cryptocurrency trading industry. The privately owned firm has been buying and selling Bitcoin and other currencies through private deals for two years.\nExpanding this functionality will occur shortly. The company indicates they will expose 500 of its clients to cryptocurrency trading in the coming weeks. If successful, the venture will be expanded upon rather quickly. It is another sign of how cryptocurrencies are bound to go mainstream very soon. Moreover, it seems a matter of time until other financial institutions follow this lead by example. A Major Gamble by the Wall Street Firm\nTwo years ago, Bitcoin was not in the position it is right now. In fact, its value was a lot lower and far less attractive to Wall Street. Even so, this particular Wall Street firm saw merit in jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon at such an early stage. In hindsight, it seems to have been a very smart decision when it comes to Bitcoin.\nUnder the current circumstances, not everyone favors Wall Street getting involved in cryptocurrency trading. A lot of people wonder whether or not this will lead to even more speculation and price volatility. Susquehanna’s head of the digital asset group isn’t too concerned in this regard. In his opinion, Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold as a scarce commodity. Even so, Smith acknowledges the currency has a “wide array of uses”, but did not further specify which those may be.\nAll of this shows there is a bright future ahead for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. When Wall Street firms prepare to take the plunge on this industry, it is a matter of time until mainstream traction occurs. Even so, cryptocurrencies still have very few real-world use cases outside of speculation. Changing that will not be easy by any means. Future scaling solutions for Bitcoin and Ethereum may effectively speed up that change a lot sooner than people anticipate.\nImage from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/technology/bitcoin-susquehanna.html", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/30/eos-valued-higher-spacex-despite-not-launching-mainnet/", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/04/wall-street-banks-to-follow-goldman-sachs-bitcoin-trading-desk-says-analyst/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "susquehanna international group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:20:32.049+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a04a4d43c913a624ce899ec185f7147981250cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.shjB2KKwwt3Yay.hgd7CKh2dfJf_RPfG_xr7SzK8VHcesJrkI7zJiBqkkmW84xnTG7ty_mUbu09A", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "My Experience Using Bitcoin to Purchase Hotel Through Expedia.com", "title_full": "My Experience Using Bitcoin to Purchase Hotel Through Expedia.com", "published": "2018-06-06T17:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a04a4d43c913a624ce899ec185f7147981250cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.shjB2KKwwt3Yay.hgd7CKh2dfJf_RPfG_xr7SzK8VHcesJrkI7zJiBqkkmW84xnTG7ty_mUbu09A", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T17:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "My Experience Using Bitcoin to Purchase Hotel Through Expedia.com", "text": "My Experience Using Bitcoin to Purchase Hotel Through Expedia.com\n/u/hodIing\nI just recently went on a vacation which I will not go into detail about. What I do want to talk about is the experience I had in purchasing my hotel room through expedia.com using Bitcoin.\nFirst let me explain the process. Expedia uses coinbase as a merchant tool. Whenever you purchase something through Expedia coinbase allocates you 15 minutes for at least one confirmation to go through before your transaction is completed. If you do not get a confirmation within this 15 minutes the item you are purchasing will be reset and a new Bitcoin address for your purchase will be issued.\nBut you've already broadcast your first transaction which will still be sent to expedia's coinbase account. So now you're looking for a refund on that first tx and the only way to get that refund is by creating a coinbase account or logging into your existing and accessing the refund from there. I repeat no refunds are sent to an external address, they are sent to a coinbase Bitco in address.\nSo I'm on Expedia. I send my 1st tx, doesn't confirm in 15 minutes, invoice resets. Send 2nd tx, doesn't confirm, invoice resets. Send 3rd tx, doesn't confirm, invoice resets. Send 4th tx and finally confirms, invouce completed, but I've sent 3 times as much Bitcoin that I need too and I'm now owed 3 refunds.\nI contact expedia customer support to see how this is done. Customer support claims they only owe me 2 refunds and that they are not seeing that failed invoice for the 3rd tx. I receive 2 refunds into my coinbase account which I haven't used in over a year. I tell customer service they still owe me for my 3rd failed tx. I provide details about it and guy tells me he will contact customer support at coinbase to see what happened. He says give him 24-48 hours.\nBy this time I've got my room booked and 2 refunds, I'm still owed 1 refund. The 2 refunds that went to my coinbase account are locked for 3 days while coinbase verifies some crap . I receive a generic response 2 days after my purchase from Expedia customer support stating that coinbase will not issue refund for 3rd failed tx. Expedia tells me to contact customer support at coinbase. I decide to do that later.\nSo after this last call with expedia I'm sitting down eating and I receive 3 new emails. \"Expedia Inc has sent you *** bitcoin\". Okay... I check my coinbase account and now I have a total of 5 refunds. I check Expedia and my reservations are still set. I call hotel and it's all in the system.\nThe extra refunds are sitting in my coinbase account. The 3 refunds I was owed I withdrew. Should I keep it or give it back to this huge corporation that wasted about 3-4 hours of my time on phone with customer support people?\nTldr; Expedia uses a shitty merchant tool which forces people to use coinbase because that's where all refunds are sent. I was owed 3 refunds for tx not confirmed in 15 minutes. 4th tx went through I got my room . Expedia issued 2 refunds. I complained about not getting 3rd refund. Days later They send 3 additional refunds. I've got a total of 5 refunds and a booked room.\nsubmitted by /u/hodIing\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "expedia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T17:11:46.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "341e0d4652d659fdf2255ddf022d5fb9c2b755c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSEZGErHt7jhhHcmlJ_HxlqeJHLb1sTiaBw2v852ZBnG6FEayUZYjb1Ro1CDsDnZmuSof5suVEUzHYWQY0.pB0rbYQQ0bwQH6C5BOxXHfN9Fvb4lS88emRDYdrq33NrLbl8hMXIpGkFReuNn0bJMd3FLu6jMLGOEHjPqm3MChRCdZv8RTrJjNElZQHp_pGPfnlSqWHnRVTTUQ--", "site_full": "thedailycoin.org", "site": "thedailycoin.org", "site_section": "https://thedailycoin.org/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Daily Coin", "title": "Once again a gold backed cryptocurrency is defying the market as Bitcoin and other cryptos hemorrhage value and market cap", "title_full": "Once again a gold backed cryptocurrency is defying the market as Bitcoin and other cryptos hemorrhage value and market cap", "published": "2018-06-06T17:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thedailycoin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/public-domain-gold-clock-technology-bitcoin1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "341e0d4652d659fdf2255ddf022d5fb9c2b755c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSEZGErHt7jhhHcmlJ_HxlqeJHLb1sTiaBw2v852ZBnG6FEayUZYjb1Ro1CDsDnZmuSof5suVEUzHYWQY0.pB0rbYQQ0bwQH6C5BOxXHfN9Fvb4lS88emRDYdrq33NrLbl8hMXIpGkFReuNn0bJMd3FLu6jMLGOEHjPqm3MChRCdZv8RTrJjNElZQHp_pGPfnlSqWHnRVTTUQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ken Schortgen", "published": "2018-06-06T17:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Once again a gold backed cryptocurrency is defying the market as Bitcoin and other cryptos hemorrhage value and market cap", "text": "· Updated June 6, 2018\nOnce again a gold backed cryptocurrency is defying the market as Bitcoin and other cryptos hemorrhage value and market cap by Ken Schortgen, Jr. The Daily Economist\nThere is occurring an interesting investment scenario for those who study trends, fundamentals, and technical charts, and it involves two differing types of cryptocurrencies.\nJust as in the Forex market where normally currencies and precious metals act in opposition to one another, ie… when the dollar goes up, gold and silver go down and vice-versa, this same type of actions is starting to show itself between the unbacked cryptos and the ones backed by a resource like gold.\nClick image to enlarge\nAfter several days of bullish momentum crypto markets have slid back once again quashing hopes of any real recovery. The selloff started yesterday during the US session and has continued into today as all gains since Friday have been wiped out. Bitcoin has led the decline by falling 3.5% on the day to $7,430 and Ethereum has taken a bigger hit dropping 5.5% to $585. No news has initiated the fall; it has just become an expected symptom of a sideways market. Altcoins are predictably in the red this morning in Asia, and just as predictably the only one that performs well during a selloff is DigixDAO.\nEverything in the top 25 has plummeted according to Coinmarketcap. To find an altcoin in the green we have to go way down the list to spot 50 where DGD is trading 17% higher. Gold based DigixDAO is currently trading at $165, up from $142 this time yesterday. Over the week it is up 36% from $123 this time last Tuesday. The past month has not been good for DGD however as it has lost 35% from $260 this time last month. Against Bitcoin it is up 23% on the day to 2267700 satoshis from 1845000 sats this time yesterday. Weekly gains on BTC have been 31% from 1726000 satoshis this time last week.\nGold backed Ethereum token DigixDAO always seems to defy the selloff and perform well when all other cryptos are plummeting. In a similar pattern to gold versus fiat it has become somewhat predictable and traders are loading up. The Digix Gold Token DGX was listed on Airswap a few days ago but this current pump is likely to have been caused by inverse action on other altcoins. – News BTC\nWhat this means for investors of cryptocurrencies is that there is the potential to play one type against the other, and be able to swap back and forth between unbacked and gold backed cryptos when one is on the decline, and the other is moving opposite to them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/05/asian-cryptocurrency-trading-update-gold-backed-digixdao-defies-selloff/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ken schortgen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T17:14:11.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf19b2da6913813cf5151e7023db414bb1687857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHIuglB2uM4oVVgduDWX.wyiyui1UU82MXbAXcDSZbRr3dHSftWxYFNOJg6PWrCScQI-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – Bankera’s BNK Token to be Listed on HitBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Bankera’s BNK Token to be Listed on HitBTC", "published": "2018-06-06T17:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.wp.com/abitco.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bankera-Press-Release.png?resize=1000%2C800", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf19b2da6913813cf5151e7023db414bb1687857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHIuglB2uM4oVVgduDWX.wyiyui1UU82MXbAXcDSZbRr3dHSftWxYFNOJg6PWrCScQI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-06-06T17:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Bankera’s BNK Token to be Listed on HitBTC", "text": "Bitcoin – Bankera’s BNK Token to be Listed on HitBTC 6 June 2018 8530\nBitcoin Press Release: Blockchain-based digital bank project Bankera has announced that BNK tokens will be listed on the popular cryptocurrency exchange, HitBTC, starting on Monday, June 4th . The trading itself is expected to commence near 5 p.m. UTC .\n6th of June 2018, Tortola – This event was long-awaited after Bankera, has completed a record-breaking token sale that attracted over 100,000 contributors from across the world. People who missed their chance to purchase BNKs during the token sale will have a second opportunity to acquire BNK tokens on Monday, when they will be tradable on HitBTC .\nGetting listed on leading exchanges in the market is crucial to ensure the liquidity and advancing the growth of the BNK token in the blockchain ecosystem. On HitBTC exchange BNKs will be paired with major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and Tether USD ( USDT ) to give Bankera’s contributors a wider choice when trading and to make BNK tokens readily available to cryptocurrency traders across the world.\nOne of a Kind Token\nIn preparation for listing, the BNK tokens have been submitted to four layers of audit to ensure the ultimate security of the BNK smart contract and then released on the Ethereum blockchain . In the future, BNK tokens will be supported as Nem Mosaics as well, thus BNK token holders will be able to switch between blockchain technologies.\nAdditionally, each BNK token is entitled to a part of a commission constituted of 20% of Bankera’s and its MVP SpectroCoin’s net transactional revenue. For the commission to be distributed to the token holders, BNK smart contract, unlike any other, was designed to store commission funds in Ether. Contributors who hold their tokens in SpectroCoin blockchain wallet get their share of commission automatically settled to their accounts every week. Those who decide to keep their tokens on external wallets or HitBTC exchange, will have to claim the commission via smart contract.\nWhat’s Next?\nHitBTC is just the first of several exchanges that BNK tokens will be listed on. Once BNK price stabilizes on HitBTC, BNK tokens will be added to SpectroCoin exchange. However, Bankera’s main focus remains on the development of its own trading platform as the company aims to provide its community with a secure, and cost-effective alternative to existing exchanges. Bankera’s exchange will support most of the major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, DASH, Ethereum, NEM, Litecoin and later ERC20 and NEM mosaic tokens. Additionally, to increase BNK token demand, Bankera exchange will offer holders the possibility to trade BNK token pairs without paying commission fees.\nBankera – A Digital Bank for the Blockchain Era\nBankera is building a digital bank for the blockchain era without costly brick and mortar branches. Launched in 2017 , it is an operational fork of SpectroCoin – cryptocurrency exchange, wallet, prepaid card, and payment processor with over 5 years of experience in the market and over 860,000 existing customers. While SpectroCoin has always been focused on payment solutions for cryptocurrencies and never intended to be a bank, it has developed an infrastructure comparable to the traditional banks and plans to leverage it to build Bankera. Bankera’s digital bank will offer traditional and investment banking services, including savings and loans accounts, low-cost investment products, such as exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) and crypto funds, essentially merging banking and blockchain worlds together.\nTo learn more, visit the Website: https://bankera.com/ Chat with us: https://chat.bankera.com/channel/community Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/bankeracom\nMedia Contact Contact Name: Ruta Contact Email: r.cizinauskaite@bankera.com\nBankera is the source of this content.
