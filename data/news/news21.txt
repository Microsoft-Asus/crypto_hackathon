He said a segment about buying Ripple's XRP epitomized the \"peak nonsense\" of the bitcoin mania that swept financial media and markets. Mike Novogratz, the famed hedge funder turned crypto-enthusiast, poked a little fun at a segment on financial news network CNBC when describing to rival Bloomberg News the crypto hype that marked the very start of 2018.\n\" CNBC, not to pick on CNBC, but I think I can since I am here, they literally had a show where they were one by one walking people through how to buy the Ripple, the XRP coin, literally when it was trading at $3.20 having moved from $0.20 8 weeks earlier,\" Novogratz said speaking to Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker .\nNovogratz said that was \"peak nonsense.\"\nRipple's XRP, a bitcoin rival, was technically trading above $2.57 when CNBC broke down how to buy it on exchange operator Poloniex on January 5 . Still, the crypto market was red-hot then, with the entire market racing towards an all-time high market capitalization above $830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP ultimately fell to $0.49 on April 5.\nTo be sure, many publications created walk-throughs for readers and viewers on how to purchase crypto-assets during the run-up. Business Insider published \"Ripple's XRP is the hot new cryptocurrency - here's how you buy it\" in January when Ripple was trading at approximately $2 a token.\nThe second-half of 2017 also saw the rise of initial coin offerings, a quick way to raise funds using cryptocurrency. Many of these fundraisers were promoted by celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather.\nNovogratz said this phenomenon might be the reason regulators started to clamp down in 2018. But it is something Novogratz, who is building out a crypto merchant bank, thinks is a positive sign for the market.\n\"So we are going to knock out some of the crap from the system,\" he said. \"It is healthy.\"\nNotably, the Securities and Exchange Commission hit a number of cryptocurrency company with subpoenas . It also recently promoted V alerie Szczepanik to lead its new cryptocurrency enforcement unit. The New York Attorney General's office earlier this year launched an inquiry into cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe question now hanging over the space is whether regulators will deem crypto assets as securities, which would require entities that facilitate crypto trading to subscribe to a whole range of regulations.\n\"I bet dimes to donuts [regulators] will say 'ethereum probably was a security but it is not anymore,'\" Novogratz said.\nNovogratz said there are about 200 tokens in regulatory \"no-man's land.\"\nJay Clayton, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, didn't provide additional clarity during an interview Wednesday with CNBC.\n\" I’m not going to comment on specific crypto assets and whether they are a security or are not a security,\" Clayton told CNBC's Bob Pisani.\nCNBC declined to comment.\nNOW WATCH: THE KRISTIN LEMKAU INTERVIEW: JPMorgan Chase's CMO explains how she deals with disruption on two fronts at once, why she's moving some ad dollars back to

That seems to be the response from a pair of fund shops that were rebuffed by the Securities and Exchange Commission when they first tried to launch bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\nVanEck and SolidX, which attempted to launch their own individual bitcoin ETFs, have teamed up to launch a physically-backed bitcoin ETF. The SolidX Bitcoin Trust will fly under the ticker XBTC if it gets approved, according to filings. VanEck will be in charge of marketing and SolidX will be the sponsor, though, it will use VanEck's MVIS OTC Bitcoin Index to value the assets.\nOf course, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were the first to file for such a product, one that would hold bitcoin outright instead of bitcoin derivatives. But what makes it special, perhaps, is all the security around it.\nThe process of buying bitcoin outright is difficult enough, but making sure it doesn't get stolen or lost is even more difficult. For those who aren't familiar with cryptocurrencies, investors hold assets in a digital wallet or an account, which can be accessed via a unique private key. Without that key, the investment just sits in digital space. But without any security around that key, it's fair game for hackers and other thieves. That's also why startups like Xapo and others are angling to deliver Fort Knox-like security for crypto investors with underground bank vaults.\nOne of the big questions around a bitcoin fund is figuring out how to hold bitcoin securely, Jan Van Eck, chief of $46bn eponymous asset manager, told Barron's. \"SolidX is a technologically-driven firm so they built processes to secure the private keys and have insurance on top of that,\" says Van Eck. \"It's the best you can do these days.\"\nREAD An audience with Davide Serra: The hedge fund founder who votes Labour\nThe first level of security, says Dan Gallancy, chief of SolidX, is the cold storage, which he describes as \"non- trivial electronic oversight.\"\n\"Think of it as a way to secure fine art and gemstones,\" Gallancy continues, only with code-generating code on top of code-generating code, though, it isn't entirely bulletproof. \"The cold storage reduces the risk of any sort of event and the insurance addresses the far out tail risk, but it's impossible to make anything a zero probability,\" he explains.\nWhile fees have not been disclosed yet, the extra security means the ETF will likely be pricier than others given the operational costs. In addition, the ETF will start at an initial share price of $200,000 — unusual, but necessary because the product is meant for institutions if it gets regulatory approval. And that is at the very heart of the reason behind the structure of the ETF.\n\"We are guessing and not guessing about standards, because the SEC has previously shared their concerns — market structure, unregulated exchange, and security,\" Gallancy says. \"The ETF design is to alleviate those and we're looking to set the standards bar as high as possible, so we could hopefully meet the SEC's.\"\nThe year's theme for crypto has been regulation, says Van Eck, but if this ETF proves unhackable even to regulators, it could pave the way for others.

With Google searches about Bitcoin falling down by 75% and the trading volume racing down to 78k, the value of the Bitcoin is stuck and still not spiked up to $10k. With these facts, all clear and not favorable, Tom Lee points out how they are wrong.\nHe addresses the fallacy about Google searches by stating that they are not leading indicators of Bitcoin and they are mere signaling indicators.\nAs far as the trading volume is considered, it has dropped down to 80% in the month of December as it was a parabolic blowoff for Bitcoin that year. Besides that, he also added that the trading volumes were 40% higher than the mid-year volumes as compared to last year.\nRegarding the price, he states that Bitcoin has some technical issues with busting charts and all it needs to go on top of the hill is just ten days and this ten days could also hopefully be at the end of this year.\nWhen he was questioned if Bitcoin is underperforming, to which, he says that Bitcoin and other coins are correlated but when we look at the ICOs, the demand of Bitcoin is close to 10 billion dollars, which is double of what the ICOs raised last year.\nWhile discussing the newly appointed SEC Czar and the regulations that are going to be implemented, Tom seems to be very confident about the Bitcoin prices. He believes that Bitcoin does not have the risk of being regulated out of the existence because it is performing well outside the U.S market.\nHe says:\n“It is a great store of value and it works really well in terms of digital transactions. It is a great example of security.”\nHe also noted that in the past 10 years not even a single person has entered a fraudulent entry on the blockchain, considering the trillions of dollars which have already been transacted on-chain.\nHe also noted that the cost involved in mining has also increased from $1.0 to $6,000 indicating that as the time passes and based on several factors, the mining fee increases.\nA Twitterati named dj Thistle commented:\n“mining cost is more like 3-4K based on electricity costs of the main miners based on the countries they are located in. eg China, Canada, Western US.”\nDavid Yee, a cryptocurrency enthusiast commented:\n“ @ MelissaLeeCNBC Maybe Tom has one thing wrong, it is a bubble asset that will never take over from so calle fiat currencies.

An old Alcoa plant in New York will be turned into a major Bitcoin mining operation soon. This $700m investment will create 150 new jobs in the process.\nBitcoin Mining Remains Appealing Various key factors need to be taken into account prior to setting up a Bitcoin mining operation. One needs ample space, expensive hardware, an accessible power grid, and a somewhat stable Bitcoin price. This latter aspect has been the big problem in the Bitcoin world for some time now. Even so, Coinmint is confident their new Bitcoin mining operation will be profitable.\nThis new venture will be set up on the Canadian border. More specifically, it will be housed inside an old Alcoa plant. The plan is to invest as much as $700m into this new mining operation. This will also result in creating up to 150 jobs over the next 18 months. Using an old aluminum smelting venue to perform Bitcoin mining is certainly an interesting decision.\nWhat makes this deal interesting is how the deal was signed in December of 2017. At that time, the value per Bitcoin was several thousand dollars higher than it is right now. Coinmint is seemingly not too concerned about this particular development. Company CTO Prieur Leary is confident profitability can be achieved through a \"process to get an edge in the market.\"\nThe location of this Bitcoin mining operation was not chosen randomly either. This former Alcoa plant has access to hydroelectric power and wind energy. As such, the electricity costs can be kept down, increasing the chances of turning a profit in the process. It is expected this operation will go live within the next twelve months. At its peak, the facility will require 435 Megawatts to mine Bitcoin.\nDo you think such a mining operation will be profitable?

Sponsored Links\n“There’s a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies,” said Garlinghouse to CNBC at the Power Lunch on May 30, 2018. “It’s early, over time you’ll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that.”\nGarlinghouse also stated recently that he thinks bitcoin will not become a global currency. The Ripple CEO stated to reporters at Money 20/20:\n“I think it’s not going to be the panacea that people once thought it would be, where it would solve all of these different kinds of problems. Instead, you’re seeing specializations of different kind of ledgers, different kinds of blockchains.”\nThe San Francisco-based company is currently developing a decentralized blockchain-based network to facilitate faster global financial payments. According to CNBC , the company hit significant milestones in its first quarter after signing 20 production contracts with new companies. On May 30, 2018, Ripple also signed a deal with the largest bank in Kuwait to test the company’s token for cross-border payments. Ripple Token Considered a Poor Performer in Crypto Markets\nHowever, despite these achievements, the Ripple token lost 70 percent of its value and was considered a poor performer compared to other cryptocurrencies on top of the leader board. Though, it wasn’t just the Ripple token that experienced significant declines. The cryptocurrency sector had an extremely bearish market with the market capitalization of the whole cryptocurrency industry falling more than 50 percent.\n“It’s still a nascent industry, the speculation in the market dominates the trading activity,” said Garlinghouse. “I think it’s a matter of time until people understand the different use cases.”\nAlthough there are currently more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, Garlinghouse believes that over 99 percent of these digital assets will no longer exist in the next ten years. “There’s gonna be a bit of a correction along the way here where a lot of the players in the space that don’t actually solve a real problem are going to get washed out,” said Garlinghouse. Cryptocurrencies and Securities Regulation\nGarlinghouse also spoke to CNBC about cryptocurrencies in regards to securities regulation in the US. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton announced in March that all initial coin offerings (ICOs) constitute as securities, however, Garlinghouse believes that the Ripple XRP Token should be classified differently.\n“If you own XRP, you don’t own rights to the profits or any dividends to the company,” said Garlinghouse. “XRP has real utility.”\nGarlinghouse, however, noted that while some cryptocurrencies have no proven use cases, others have launched ICOs to scam and cheat investors. The CEO of Ripple believes that intervention by regulators to protect retail investors are important and recognizes that not all tokens are frauds and that many, have real utility.\n“The SEC is getting involved as they should because there have been frauds committed,” said Garlinghouse. “We have been advocate of yes the government should get involved, the government should be protecting investors and companies, but there’s also examples of real utility.” Category: Altcoins, Bitcoin, Commentary, News Tags: altcoins, altcoins news, bitcoin, bitcoin news, commentary, cryptocurrency,

Minnesota Using Bitcoin? Jun/06/2018\nFor this year's FIFA World Cup, the best way to place bets online from Minnesota will be with bitcoin using a cryptocurrency wallet that can be linked to one's banking account. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL MINNESOTA WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nMinnesota is a state that is willing to offer sports betting as soon as possible. Whether they are ready or not, that's a different story.\n\"This is like Sunday liquor sales on cocaine,\" said Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington, drawing a parallel with the long legislative effort to scrap the state's Sunday liquor sales ban, finally achieved in 2017. \"That's how excited people are going to be.”\nGarofalo had already been working on legislation to legalize sports betting in Minnesota, but unlike a handful of other states, Minnesota will not be ready by World Cup, entire 2018 football season or even Super Bowl 53. Beyond that, the state has a good shot of passing a law some time in 2019. Unfortunately, this year's legislative has come to an end.\n\"I look forward to Minnesota joining other states that will provide a safe, fair and regulated sports gambling experience,\" Garofalo said.\nNeedless-to-say, Minnesota gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "garofalo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat garofalo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:54:07.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e122caa1ce426cfe9fde5071b47ca583d625923", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKgT7nJQ6pUSKnXxkQ6GUI.XlYVzN3q2aTessDGqCU9aVb37fgDJiQDcEVYR0ojm5QzBQ6td7Z1UukP.4N4W1fhy1uN9FcinoTlpVxslBsAQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinometrics.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinometrics.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITCOINOMETRICS", "title": "Bitcoin Buying on the Rise Again in Venezuela", "title_full": "Bitcoin Buying on the Rise Again in Venezuela", "published": "2018-06-07T01:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e122caa1ce426cfe9fde5071b47ca583d625923", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKgT7nJQ6pUSKnXxkQ6GUI.XlYVzN3q2aTessDGqCU9aVb37fgDJiQDcEVYR0ojm5QzBQ6td7Z1UukP.4N4W1fhy1uN9FcinoTlpVxslBsAQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Amon (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T01:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Buying on the Rise Again in Venezuela", "text": "Bitcoin price in Venezuela: A report has it that Venezuelans’ interest in buying Bitcoin has increased significantly over the last three months, Criptonoticias news outlet reports Wednesday, June 6, citing data from the LocalBitcoins exchange.\nVenezuela experienced its first cryptocurrency boom in early 2017, when a record volume of 805 bitcoins exchanged in a week was set.\nRead: Market Move? Bitcoin Price Rebound to $7,800 Could Confirm Short-Term Rally\nFollowing that, the level of interest towards crypto in Venezuela dropped, coinciding with a decline in trading volume to as low as 150 bitcoins bought per week.\nHowever, according to Criptonoticias, in early-to-mid 2018, Bitcoin investment surged once again in Venezuela, as evidenced by LocalBitcoins data.\nThe volume of Venezuelan bolivar to Bitcoin exchange increased by 138% from March to April, and by 39% more from April to May. The first week of June was in line with this tren, Criptonoticias points out.\nOver the last week of May some 4.9 trillion bolivars were spent on bitcoins, while the first week of June had seen the volume grow by 40.8% to 6.9 trillion.

Two Sigma is known for its strategy of trading based on algorithms and artificial intelligence. And unlike many other hedge funds, the firm’s staff is chock full of Ph.Ds. Siegel himself holds a PhD in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nAnd the strategy has paid off for Siegel. Siegel has regularly been featured among t he top hedge fund earners on an annual basis.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies has made others wealthy. Over the last 12 months, the value of all cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, has swelled to roughly $350 billion. While that’s a far cry from its $816 billion peak in January, the value is still roughly three times its $101 billion value a year earlier.\nBut Siegel thinks this influx of investments in cryptocurrencies—which he thinks would be better defined as crypto assets—are a symptom of a larger problem: Investors storing their money, rather than putting it to work in innovative projects.\n“You already see certain kinds of assets inflating in price,” he said pointing to real estate markets and cryptocurrencies. “People are looking for new ways to store value, rather than new ways to invest and create new things. I think there’s a little bit too much interest in storing value, and not enough interest in creating new value and expanding the pie.”\nStill, while it is hard to cleanly separate cryptocurrencies from blockchain ( many blockchain projects are raising funding by offering the digital currencies), Siegel notes that it is blockchain technology itself, which effectively distributes copies of the same, constantly updating database to multiple parties, that he thinks has the most potential.\n“The math behind [blockchain] is pretty cool,” Siegel said. “There’s an awful lot of hype around the blockchain, but think the blockchain will ultimately create new business models. I think it will be particularly helpful in the developing world where registries are not as established as here in the more developed economies.”\nIn 2018 at least, some investors appear to concur with his analysis. Venture capital funding to cryptocurrency and blockchain-related startups has soared in new heights, reaching $1.4 billion as of June , according to Pitchbook, compared to $964 million raised through all of 2017.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mdg45eikkf/4-david-siegel/#55e9f6a66cbc", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-06-05/two-sigma-s-siegel-on-tech-in-society-video"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david siegel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucinda shen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor j. blue/bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "billion hedge fund", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "two sigma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg invest summit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg invest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "two sigma investments lp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T01:52:47.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a6d8f24255b807b2368109abea98d0ba8d27ca5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQHt1kcPv9iNARRC6laSMLw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Where does bitcoin end up this year", "title_full": "Where does bitcoin end up this year", "published": "2018-06-07T01:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a6d8f24255b807b2368109abea98d0ba8d27ca5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQHt1kcPv9iNARRC6laSMLw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Idaujotaite", "published": "2018-06-07T01:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Where does bitcoin end up this year", "text": "Sincerely, for now, I don't think anyone can say where Bitcoin is gonna end this year.

(OTCQB: VRCP), a company established to bring cryptocurrency transactions into the mainstream, has signed a deal that will allow Lincoln Billiards, Israel’s leading billiards club, to accept payments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ( http://ibn.fm/GmX07 ). This is the first commercial contract for Virtual Crypto, whose goal is to make cryptocurrencies more available to the public by combining application programming interfaces (API) and mobile applications to develop payment solutions that can be used in ATMs, PCs, tablets and other handheld devices.\nCryptocurrency transactions typically take from 10 minutes to 24 hours to confirm, which is a major drawback for consumers who want to use them in mainstream sales operations, since exchange rates will change over the course of a long transaction period. With Virtual Crypto’s proprietary NetoBit Pay technology, users can complete their cryptocurrency deals without waiting for the final confirmation from the blockchain, decreasing checkout time to seconds. NetoBit Pay clients/operators are able to immediately and securely, through user-friendly platforms, receive payments without being exposed to price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. NetoBit Pay provides the best exchange rate through simultaneous comparison of multiple crypto exchanges, enabling the best sale price at point of trade and resolving one of cryptocurrency’s main hurdles.\nIn addition, there is a distinct advantage for businesses using NetoBit Pay as a platform to receive crypto payments: Netobit Pay businesses will receive access to a client management system (back-office) that provides wide options to oversee and manage incomes and offers exportable financial reporting detailing trades, plus a notification and alert mechanism.\nVirtual Crypto’s groundbreaking new agreement will start with cryptocurrency being accepted in one of Lincoln Billiard’s six venues in Israel. Following this initial phase, Virtual Crypto will roll out its payment system into the remaining billiard locations.\nIn a news release, Alon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd., said, “This is an important milestone for the company. To date, we have been working primarily with cryptocurrency service providers and industry insiders, but this is our first foray into the commercial sector. Lincoln Billiards is a very popular venue across Israel, and this agreement gives us direct contact with a receptive, tech-savvy consumer group. We look forward to introducing them to the benefits of cryptocurrency.”\nA representative of Lincoln Billiards said that accepting transactions in cryptocurrency would give their venues the edge in a very competitive entertainment market. “While we are by far the largest billiards club operator in the country, we are competing with other entertainment options. As a result, we are always looking for ways to make it easy for our customers to enjoy their experience with us. The ability to accept cryptocurrency is something we have been toying with for some time, and Virtual Crypto’s platform allows us to do that without exposing ourselves to the exchange rate volatility and related financial risk associated with other unsecured systems. I expect this capability will be very attractive to many of our customers.”\nIndustry analysts expect the cryptocurrency ATM market to exceed $285 million in less than a decade ( http://ibn.fm/4ljcO ).

Bitcoin Price Rebound to $7,800 Could Confirm Short-Term Rally", "text": "Bitcoin latest price: In the latest news, the bitcoin price has increased from $7,300 to $7,600 over the past 24 hours, sparking optimism regarding the short-term growth of bitcoin.\nA break to $7,800 could confirm a short-term rally for bitcoin while a drop below the $7,500 mark could lead it back to the $7,300 region, making $6,000 a possibility, yet again.\nLow Volume\nThe price trend of bitcoin and predictions of analysts are conditional as of current due to the low volume of BTC. While BTC has prevented a further drop to the $6,000 region as it rebounded from $7,300 to to $7,600, the volume remains nearly identical to yesterday. Although the valuation of the cryptocurrency market has improved, the state of the market remains the same.\nA break to $7,800 would effectively exceed the descending one-month trend line extending from May 5 to June 5, signifying a potential rally for BTC in both the short to mid-term. The corrective rally of BTC from the $7,040 has ended at $7,500, but based on the daily candle chart of BTC, and given the stability of BTC over the past seven days, it is possible that BTC gains momentum in the upcoming days and re-enter the $8,000 region.\nOn March 20, BTC broke a descending trendline from March 4, with a strong spike in volume and price. Within five days, the price of BTC increased from $7,800 to $9,200.\nHowever, in a period of 15 days, the price of BTC dropped from $9,200 to $6,500, even though the corrective rally was supported with strong volume.\nIf BTC can record a gradual increase in volume and value throughout June and establish a strong foundation for a potential mid-term rally, it is possible that BTC returns to its previous levels by the end of 2018, possibly back to $20,000. But, if BTC cannot sustain its momentum and falls below the $7,000 mark once again, a drop to the lower end of $6,000 is still a possibility.\nMid-Term Optimism\nThis week, Nathaniel Popper from The New York Times reported that Susquehanna International Group, one of the biggest investment firms in the world, has already started to facilitate bitcoin trades.\n“We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,” Bart Smith, the head of digital assets at Susquehanna, said.\nThe firm, which first experimented with BTC in 2014, has started to process the settlement of bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash futures, enabling institutional investors and large-scale traders to invest in the cryptocurrency market. The entrance of firms like Susquehanna into the cryptocurrency sector could lead to a domino effect in Wall Street and the global financial sector.\nWhile investors are uncertain about the short-term future of the market, the majority of traders are bullish on the long-term growth of bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market.

The BCH Geek event was held on June 1-3 and firms like Bitmain Technologies, Viabtc, and BTC.top were in attendance. According to local reports and BCH-focused forums , the hackathon featured 100+ programmers who produced solid research, prototypes, and applications built using the BCH blockchain. The BCH Geek event was initiated by the blockchain video portal Chongqing TED.CC, and other members of the BCH community. BCH-Based Browser Plugins, an Authenticator, and a Quiz App\nThere were more than 11 teams who consisted of developers from firms like Viabtc, and students from Chongqing University. This week on Reddit, a BCH Geek attendee stated the hackathon resulted in a “satisfactory way,” while detailing the platforms created by a few of the top teams who participated in the event. Three teams mentioned in particular were the groups Mempool, Viabtc, and Gon. According to the report, Mempool created a URL-paying browser plug-in based on bitcoin cash which integrates with the HTTP and Status Code 402 protocol. Image credits: Cindy Daily\nViabtc developers designed a BCH-based authenticator that can store data and synchronize across multiple devices. The application does not require a server and authentication data can be restored easily. Another team called Gon designed an application called Token Dice which is a decentralized on-chain 1v1 quiz application based on BCH. The Token Dice programmers used the OP_Code , ‘ OP_DATASIGNVERIFY,’ to build the quiz platform. Another application featured was called ‘ IF Password’ a password management software (ifpass.cash) that is tethered to the BCH blockchain. Image credits: Cindy Daily New BCH Apps to Appear in the Wild Soon\nAttendees also heard from speakers such as Edward Liu, the co-founder of Bitkan, and Jiang Zhuoer, the founder of BTC.top, who talked about the innovation being built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network right now. The industry luminaries also spoke about currently built platforms like Memo , Blockpress , and Cointext that are providing the on-chain ‘killer apps’ once heralded a few years ago. The BCH Geek event ended with great success and it’s safe to say quite a few bitcoin cash-infused platforms demonstrated at the event in Hangzhou will be released into the wild shortly.\nWhat do you think about the BCH Geek event held in China this week?

The fund will be physically backed, which means it will hold actual Bitcoin, and will be insured against loss or theft of the cryptocurrency, according to the firms.\nThe SEC asked companies to pull about a dozen applications for cryptocurrency-linked products in January, and last year rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF. SolidX and VanEck were among the companies who had filed to list funds. They hope to have addressed regulators’ concerns with changes they made in the new, joint request by increasing the share price and basing prices off regulated trading firms, according to SolidX Chief Executive Officer Daniel H. Gallancy.\n“Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,” Gallancy said in a telephone interview. “We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.”\nHopes for a Bitcoin ETF were running high last year after the CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc. listed Bitcoin futures, as investors speculated the SEC might approve funds linked to financial instruments trading on major exchanges. But those expectations soured as regulators said they were concerned about the high volatility and lack of depth in the market, and about pricing and trading that would be based on lightly regulated platforms.\n“While I’m still skeptical a Bitcoin ETP gets approved in any form this year, you gotta be in it to win it, and this extra hustle from VanEck could pay off down the road,” said Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst.\nSolidX and VanEck want to address these concerns by basing prices for the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust on an index that tracks over-the-counter trading by U.S.-based institutions, which are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MVIS, a subsidiary of New York-based VanEck, will compile the index and publish price updates throughout the day.\nVanEck oversees more than $45-billion in assets and manages more than 70 exchange-traded products. SolidX is a New York-based financial technology company, developing cryptography software and capital markets products.\nIf approved, the product will be priced at 25 Bitcoins per share, which equals about $188,000 at Wednesday’s prices, to target institutional investors, Gallancy said. This compares with a double-digit share price for most ETFs. This would be a change from the focus in the ETF industry, which has traditionally been on individual investors.\nThe firms haven’t determined fees for the fund yet, but Gallancy said it will probably be on the more expensive side compared with other ETFs, as they’ll be handling the additional risk and hassle of trading cryptocurrency.\nSolidX would handle custody of Bitcoin using a so-called cold storage solution, which means so-called private keys that serve as ownership codes are kept offline. Funds will be insured one-to-one by a syndicate of insurers, which the firms didn’t disclose.\nVanEck had previously filed a Bitcoin future-based ETF. A physically-backed Bitcoin ETF will be attractive as it tracks Bitcoin spot prices more closely, said the firm’s head, Jan van Eck.

More Money management firm VanEck is trying again for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\nOn this third attempt, the company is teaming up with blockchain company SolidX and basing the fund on actual bitcoins rather than futures.\nEach share of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is set to cost a hefty $200,000, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.\nIt's not clear whether the structure of the ETF or bitcoin's relative stability recently will help the fund gain approval. Several companies, including VanEck, have tried unsuccessfully to launch bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\nVanEck first filed for an ETF based on bitcoin futures in August, but withdrew the application in September at the request of SEC staff since the futures didn't exist yet. The company and several other firms filed again when bitcoin futures launched on CME and Cboe in December. But they had to withdraw those applications in January at the request of SEC staff.\nIn a letter that month, the commission raised concerns such as extreme price volatility and the ability for customers to withdraw funds easily.\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on Wednesday. Bitcoin traded near $7,500 on Wednesday, holding within the trading range of the last few months.\nSolidX has also struggled to launch a bitcoin ETF. In March 2017, the SEC rejected the company's application for an exchange-traded product based on physical bitcoins. Around the same time, the commission also rejected, then said it would review, the Winklevoss twins' proposal for a similar bitcoin fund.\nVanEck will help market the new bitcoin ETF, SolidX will sponsor or create the underlying index and Bank of New York Mellon will be the custodian, the filing said. If approved, the ETF is slated to trade under the symbol XBTC on Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\"I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of 'digital gold' that may make sense for investors' portfolios,\" Jan van Eck, chief executive officer of VanEck, said in a statement.\n\"A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Bi2MPi43s_UC1H_0h6j29g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/video.cnbcuk.com/18daf012f09e3a51f140b00fe49f3c6a", "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1668039/000110465918038369/a18-2298_1s1a.htm", "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1668039/000110465918038369/a18-2298_1s1a.htm&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vaneck", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "solidx", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vaneck solidx bitcoin trust", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T22:13:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a1918566eae6ec088d555d45c170e7871ac88b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFY1yvaBwKZLeYO0TQl0V6CtSUMHJ6q8ocuj4ZhiLJB6DmypjyshgEyQ3O.9YUgYI.ZbGgXAOHLICRVLrHadSTkQ-", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website", "title_full": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website", "published": "2018-06-07T01:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/russia-court-1024x1024.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a1918566eae6ec088d555d45c170e7871ac88b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFY1yvaBwKZLeYO0TQl0V6CtSUMHJ6q8ocuj4ZhiLJB6DmypjyshgEyQ3O.9YUgYI.ZbGgXAOHLICRVLrHadSTkQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-06-07T01:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website", "text": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website by\nA Russian court has overturned a previous court decision to block a bitcoin-related website because it contains information about cryptocurrencies.

This method is an auditing nightmare what with having to scrape telephone and messaging records.\nThe new platform built by Jump Trading allows the firm to conduct electronic trades with its clients. The firm created a GUI, which makes it possible for its parties to interact with the OTC desk via a desktop platform. The connection is secured, and users will not be able to connect with external exchange platforms.\nOTC trading is popular with large bitcoin traders who don't want to deposit a large amount of funds to online cryptocurrency exchanges. Also, such large volume trades might upset the balance of the market as the presence of a massive buy/sell order could send the wrong signals to retail investors.\nThere is also the problem of slippage , i.e. significant price changes between order placement and execution that can affect the profitability of such large transactions.\nBitcoin is Maturing as an Asset The new Jump Trading bitcoin OTC trading platform is yet another indication that the cryptocurrency is rapidly maturing. According to forex trader, John Spallanzani, a portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners, bitcoin's growth closely mirrors that of the multi-trillion-dollar forex market.\nIn the early 90s, long before the advent of desktop and mobile FX platforms, brokers would call multiple banks at once for spot FX prices. These days, everything is done in front of a computer or smartphone screen, and now it appears bitcoin is on the same trajectory.\nSince 2017, bitcoin has emerged as a viable investment asset with dozens of investment funds and OTC trading desks . There are over 360 different bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments funds in the market, operating in various places around the world.\nIn 2018 alone, more than 60 new bitcoin funds have been established. Many commentators also attest to the fact that institutional investments in the cryptocurrency will help to increase its price to new all-time highs.\nWill Jump Trading's electronic OTC platform improve the speed and efficiency of large bitcoin trades? Keep the conversation going in the comment section below.\nImages courtesy of Jump Trading and CoinMarketCap, Shutterstock\nThe post An Electronic Bitcoin OTC Platform Has Been Built For Institutional

Venezuela experienced its first cryptocurrency boom in early 2017, when a record volume of 805 bitcoins exchanged in a week was set. Sponsored Links Venezuelan bolivar to Bitcoin exchange volume. Source: LocalBitcoins Following that, the level of interest towards crypto in Venezuela dropped, coinciding with a decline in trading volume to as low as 150 bitcoins bought per week. However, according to Criptonoticias, in early-to-mid 2018, Bitcoin investment surged once again in Venezuela, as evidenced by LocalBitcoins data. The volume of Venezuelan bolivar to Bitcoin exchange increased by 138% from March to April, and by 39% more from April to May. The first week of June was in line with this tren, Criptonoticias points out.

Tax Bitcoin, home offices, work deductions and property investors in the ATO’s ‘tax gap’ firing line Frank Chung, news.com.au June 8, 2018 9:05am\nHOME offices, work uniforms, Airbnb hosts and bitcoin investors are set to go under the microscope this year as the Australian Taxation Office attempts to close the “tax gap” and crack down on dodgy claims.\nWith the end of the financial year fast approaching, taxpayers are being warned there’s nowhere to hide from the sophisticated data matching capabilities of the ATO, which is apparently a little bit upset with us.\n“The ATO have been doing some work around what they call the ‘tax gap’ for individuals, which is basically the difference between what taxes people are paying and what the ATO believes they should be paying,” said H&R Block director of tax communications Mark Chapman.\n“What they’ve done is do a series of random audits on taxpayers. Rather than targeting taxpayers they think have issues, it’s like a lottery, taking random taxpayers and auditing them. From that they’ve been able to work out what the gap is, and then extrapolate that over the whole taxpayer population.”\nMr Chapman said the ATO, which hasn’t released the exact numbers yet, placed a “fair bit of blame” for the size of the tax gap on the work-related expenses area. Last month’s Federal Budget handed the ATO extra cash specifically to deal with the issue.\n“The ATO have flagged work-related expense claims, specifically they’ve highlighted some of the flat-rate deductions that people can claim under the work-related expenses rules,” he said.\n“So for instance the 66-cents-per-km vehicle use which you can claim up to 5000km, the ATO are concerned people are claiming that as a standard amount irrespective of whether or not they travelled the 5000km.\n“[Similarly] the $150 people can claim on laundry expenses, and the $300 people can claim without any substantiation if that’s all they’re claiming. The ATO are concerned people are claiming that almost as a standard deduction, which it’s not.”\nAustralians claim about $22 billion in work-related expenses annually, and ATO commissioner Chris Jordan last year said a “startlingly” large number of people were effectively gaming the system.\nAbout 6.3 million people made claims against clothing expenses in 2014-15 totalling almost $1.8 billion, which would mean “almost half of the individual taxpayer population was required to wear a uniform or protective clothing or had some special requirements for things like sunglasses and hat”.\nmedia_camera Don’t try any holiday home funny business.\nThe ATO has previously warned that there was no such thing as a “standard” deduction. In the same year, more than three million people made work-related car expense claims totalling $8.5 billion, a “significant proportion” of which were “right at the limit that does not require detailed records”.\nMr Chapman said the “other deductions” category — covering things like home office usage, union fees and mobile phone costs — was also a big concern for the ATO. Taxpayers should expect greater scrutiny on what proportion they claim for work versus private use.\nAlso in the firing line this year will be property investors incorrectly claiming deductions, such as people with holiday homes claiming for times they actually use the home themselves, or letting the home out to family or friends at a reduced rate but claiming the full amount.\n“There are also some instances where the ATO believes the properties are not genuinely available for rent in the first place but they’re still claiming deductions,” he said. “They might have all sorts of restrictions or terms and conditions on renting the property which would make the renter say no.”\nAnother popular rort is when spouses who jointly own a property split the rental income in a way that’s not 50-50, funnelling the higher deductions to the spouse who earns more to maximise the benefit.\n“You can’t do that,” Mr Chapman said. “If it’s two spouses it’s 50-50, unless you’ve got some really compelling evidence to the contrary, and that’s rare.”\nUber drivers, Airbnb hosts, Airtasker taskers and other people who earn money in the sharing economy should also watch out. The banks and even the platforms themselves now hand over your information directly to the ATO, meaning the discrepancy will automatically be picked up.\n“The computers see it as a mismatch, that there was some income which wasn’t declared,” Mr Chapman said. “They don’t typically do a full audit, but they’ll send you a letter asking if you want to amend your return.”\nFinally, investors who first got into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies towards the end of last year could be in for a rude shock. “The ATO is really looking at that as a big risk area, because it’s new and people don’t understand the tax implications,” he said.\n“Probably the most common scenario is people will have capital gains tax implications through buying cryptocurrency and then selling. That could produce a very large profit or very large loss depending on when they did.”\nmedia_camera Bitcoin investors may be in for a shock. Picture: Nhac Nguyen/AFP\nLiz Russell, senior tax agent with Etax.com.au, said while cryptocurrencies were often touted as an anonymous payment system that can’t be tracked by banks or governments, the ATO’s data matching kicked in as soon as they were converted to fiat currency.\n“It’s important to know how the ATO classifies cryptocurrency, as this determines how it’s treated for taxation purposes,” she said.\n“There is a long-running debate over what cryptocurrency actually is — whether it’s an asset, currency or collectable — but the ATO has made it clear that it treats cryptocurrency as an asset. That means it’s subject to the same capital gains tax provisions that apply to real estate and shares.”\nCapital gains tax provisions are triggered when you sell cryptocurrency, in whole or in part. “Let’s say you originally bought $5000 worth of XEM, which is one of the lesser-known coins consistently in the top 10 of cryptocurrency market caps,” Ms Russell said.\n“If you later traded it for fiat currency of $8500, then the $3500 in profit is considered a capital gain, and you’ll need to add it to your assessable income for the financial year — much like you would any gains you make the sale of shares or an investment property.”\nOn the other hand, if you sold your cryptocurrency at a loss — which is more likely given the market crash since its December peak — then you can deduct that amount from capital gains you made from another asset.\n“For example if you made a $3000 loss on the sale of cryptocurrency but a $4000 gain on the sale of shares, your net capital gain would be the $4000 gain minus the $3000 loss, equalling a $1000 capital gain,” she said.\nOne exception is when you use cryptocurrency to purchase items for personal use — such as in the ‘digital currency-friendly’ Queensland tourist town of Agnes Water, where visitors can use cryptocurrency at restaurants, cafes and other stores.\n“For these sorts of transactions, no CGT is payable when disposing of cryptocurrency,” Ms Russell said.\nFor businesses who receive cryptocurrency for goods and services, you must include the value of the cryptocurrency in Australian dollars as part of your ordinary income, the same as receiving any other non-cash payment under a barter transaction.\n“One way of determining the value in Australian dollars is the fair market value which can be obtained from a reputable cryptocurrency exchange,”\n“Where you purchase business items using cryptocurrency, including trading stock, you are entitled to a deduction based on the arm’s length value of the item acquired.”\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\nShould we get rid of tax deductions? 1:12 The ATO have seen it all, and Aussie’s are claiming $21 billion in work related expenses per year.

Tax Bitcoin, home offices, work deductions and property investors in the ATO’s ‘tax gap’ firing line Frank Chung, news.com.au June 7, 2018 4:34pm Share this on Facebook social-facebook_circle Share this on Twitter social-twitter_circle Share this by Email social-email_circle\nHOME offices, work uniforms, Airbnb hosts and bitcoin investors are set to go under the microscope this year as the Australian Taxation Office attempts to close the “tax gap” and crack down on dodgy claims.\nWith the end of the financial year fast approaching, taxpayers are being warned there’s nowhere to hide from the sophisticated data matching capabilities of the ATO, which is apparently a little bit upset with us.\n“The ATO have been doing some work around what they call the ‘tax gap’ for individuals, which is basically the difference between what taxes people are paying and what the ATO believes they should be paying,” said H&R Block director of tax communications Mark Chapman.\n“What they’ve done is do a series of random audits on taxpayers. Rather than targeting taxpayers they think have issues, it’s like a lottery, taking random taxpayers and auditing them. From that they’ve been able to work out what the gap is, and then extrapolate that over the whole taxpayer population.”\nMr Chapman said the ATO, which hasn’t released the exact numbers yet, placed a “fair bit of blame” for the size of the tax gap on the work-related expenses area. Last month’s Federal Budget handed the ATO extra cash specifically to deal with the issue.\n“The ATO have flagged work-related expense claims, specifically they’ve highlighted some of the flat-rate deductions that people can claim under the work-related expenses rules,” he said.\n“So for instance the 66-cents-per-km vehicle use which you can claim up to 5000km, the ATO are concerned people are claiming that as a standard amount irrespective of whether or not they travelled the 5000km.\n“[Similarly] the $150 people can claim on laundry expenses, and the $300 people can claim without any substantiation if that’s all they’re claiming. The ATO are concerned people are claiming that almost as a standard deduction, which it’s not.”\nAustralians claim about $22 billion in work-related expenses annually, and ATO commissioner Chris Jordan last year said a “startlingly” large number of people were effectively gaming the system.\nAbout 6.3 million people made claims against clothing expenses in 2014-15 totalling almost $1.8 billion, which would mean “almost half of the individual taxpayer population was required to wear a uniform or protective clothing or had some special requirements for things like sunglasses and hat”.\nmedia_camera Don’t try any holiday homes funny business.\nThe ATO has previously warned that there was no such thing as a “standard” deduction. In the same year, more than three million people made work-related car expense claims totalling $8.5 billion, a “significant proportion” of which were “right at the limit that does not require detailed records”.\nMr Chapman said the “other deductions” category — covering things like home office usage, union fees and mobile phone costs — was also a big concern for the ATO. Taxpayers should expect greater scrutiny on what proportion they claim for work versus private use.\nAlso in the firing line this year will be property investors incorrectly claiming deductions, such as people with holiday homes claiming for times they actually use the home themselves, or letting the home out to family or friends at a reduced rate but claiming the full amount.\n“There are also some instances where the ATO believes the properties are not genuinely available for rent in the first place but they’re still claiming deductions,” he said. “They might have all sorts of restrictions or terms and conditions on renting the property which would make the renter say no.”\nAnother popular rort is when spouses who jointly own a property split the rental income in a way that’s not 50-50, funnelling the higher deductions to the spouse who earns more to maximise the benefit.\n“You can’t do that,” Mr Chapman said. “If it’s two spouses it’s 50-50, unless you’ve got some really compelling evidence to the contrary, and that’s rare.”\nUber drivers, Airbnb hosts, Airtasker taskers and other people who earn money in the sharing economy should also watch out. The banks and even the platforms themselves now hand over your information directly to the ATO, meaning the discrepancy will automatically be picked up.\n“The computers see it as a mismatch, that there was some income which wasn’t declared,” Mr Chapman said. “They don’t typically do a full audit, but they’ll send you a letter asking if you want to amend your return.”\nFinally, investors who first got into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies towards the end of last year could be in for a rude shock. “The ATO is really looking at that as a big risk area, because it’s new and people don’t understand the tax implications,” he said.\n“Probably the most common scenario is people will have capital gains tax implications through buying cryptocurrency and then selling. That could produce a very large profit or very large loss depending on when they did.”\nmedia_camera Bitcoin investors may be in for a shock. Picture: Nhac Nguyen/AFP\nLiz Russell, senior tax agent with Etax.com.au, said while cryptocurrencies were often touted as an anonymous payment system that can’t be tracked by banks or governments, the ATO’s data matching kicked in as soon as they were converted to fiat currency.\n“It’s important to know how the ATO classifies cryptocurrency, as this determines how it’s treated for taxation purposes,” she said.\n“There is a long-running debate over what cryptocurrency actually is — whether it’s an asset, currency or collectable — but the ATO has made it clear that it treats cryptocurrency as an asset. That means it’s subject to the same capital gains tax provisions that apply to real estate and shares.”\nCapital gains tax provisions are triggered when you sell cryptocurrency, in whole or in part. “Let’s say you originally bought $5000 worth of XEM, which is one of the lesser-known coins consistently in the top 10 of cryptocurrency market caps,” Ms Russell said.\n“If you later traded it for fiat currency of $8500, then the $3500 in profit is considered a capital gain, and you’ll need to add it to your assessable income for the financial year — much like you would any gains you make the sale of shares or an investment property.”\nOn the other hand, if you sold your cryptocurrency at a loss — which is more likely given the market crash since its December peak — then you can deduct that amount from capital gains you made from another asset.\n“For example if you made a $3000 loss on the sale of cryptocurrency but a $4000 gain on the sale of shares, your net capital gain would be the $4000 gain minus the $3000 loss, equalling a $1000 capital gain,” she said.\nOne exception is when you use cryptocurrency to purchase items for personal use — such as in the ‘digital currency-friendly’ Queensland tourist town of Agnes Water, where visitors can use cryptocurrency at restaurants, cafes and other stores.\n“For these sorts of transactions, no CGT is payable when disposing of cryptocurrency,” Ms Russell said.\nFor businesses who receive cryptocurrency for goods and services, you must include the value of the cryptocurrency in Australian dollars as part of your ordinary income, the same as receiving any other non-cash payment under a barter transaction.\n“One way of determining the value in Australian dollars is the fair market value which can be obtained from a reputable cryptocurrency exchange,”\n“Where you purchase business items using cryptocurrency, including trading stock, you are entitled to a deduction based on the arm’s length value of the item acquired.”\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\nShould we get rid of tax deductions? 1:12 The ATO have seen it all, and Aussie’s are claiming $21 billion in work related expenses per year.

That means it’s subject to the same capital gains tax provisions that apply to real estate and shares.”\nCapital gains tax provisions are triggered when you sell cryptocurrency, in whole or in part. “Let’s say you originally bought $5000 worth of XEM, which is one of the lesser-known coins consistently in the top 10 of cryptocurrency market caps,” Ms Russell said.\n“If you later traded it for fiat currency of $8500, then the $3500 in profit is considered a capital gain, and you’ll need to add it to your assessable income for the financial year — much like you would any gains you make the sale of shares or an investment property.”\nOn the other hand, if you sold your cryptocurrency at a loss — which is more likely given the market crash since its December peak — then you can deduct that amount from capital gains you made from another asset.\n“For example if you made a $3000 loss on the sale of cryptocurrency but a $4000 gain on the sale of shares, your net capital gain would be the $4000 gain minus the $3000 loss, equalling a $1000 capital gain,” she said.\nOne exception is when you use cryptocurrency to purchase items for personal use — such as in the ‘digital currency-friendly’ Queensland tourist town of Agnes Water, where visitors can use cryptocurrency at restaurants, cafes and other stores.\n“For these sorts of transactions, no CGT is payable when disposing of cryptocurrency,” Ms Russell said.\nFor businesses who receive cryptocurrency for goods and services, you must include the value of the cryptocurrency in Australian dollars as part of your ordinary income, the same as receiving any other non-cash payment under a barter transaction.\n“One way of determining the value in Australian dollars is the fair market value which can be obtained from a reputable cryptocurrency exchange,”\n“Where you purchase business items using cryptocurrency, including trading stock, you are entitled to a deduction based on the arm’s length value of the item acquired.”\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\nShould we get rid of tax deductions? 1:12 The ATO have seen it all, and Aussie’s are claiming $21 billion in work related expenses per year. So should we be getting rid of individual tax deductions?\nSeptember 28th 2017 8 months ago Should we get rid of tax deductions?

You see in a previous video what I said to you was that if Bitcoin takes out and closes below this support level.\nSo here’s our support level and here’s why this is the February low and this is the April low and as you may remember in a previous video I said to you that if Bitcoin falls below this major an important support level this February April low which is about $6500 to $6000 level.\nOkay if we fall below that level that essentially would be terrible for Bitcoin because that is breaking market structure and could lead to significantly lower levels, in other words significant sell-off in Bitcoin now having said that I want to show you in this video why there is an exception to that rule.\nLet me explain you see yesterday I was looking at the chart of Bitcoin from 2013 to 2014 and here’s something important we can learn from bitcoins behavior from a few years ago you see back in 2013 which I’m sure many of you remember in that year especially in November from about October to December of 2013 as you may recall Bitcoin did something very similar to what it did last year which is it went up nearly a thousand percent.\nBitcoin sky rocketed from about a hundred and fifty dollars in October November of 2013 and it went up all the way to just above eleven hundred dollars so again about a thousand percent move now you’ll notice what happened next is very similar to what happened in December of last year in 2017 you see in December of 2013 Bitcoin had a very sudden drop or crash you want to call it that then a rally.\nAnd then another drop okay and it continued to do this until it finally made this bottom in December of that year around about the $400 level and then staged a very strong rally.\nNow I want to just mark that level there for you let me just so what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna grab a line and I’m gonna place a horizontal line right about that bottom there okay alright so there’s our low from December of 2013 and then after that rally which failed.\nNotice it came back now it did have an intermediate drop below the level and then it went up again but notice what happened next in February of 2014 it came back and retested that level there it is and notice it held that level.\nso in other words about a few years ago Bitcoin made a low or a bottom back in December of 2013 and then it retested that level in February 2014 forming a sort of double bottom pattern now look what happened next about a few months later in April of that year look what it did it broke below that significant level that’s in other words it’s breaking market structure here but notice what happened next it quickly recovered and went back above it again now is that significant yes and I’m gonna show you why it’s significant.\nYou see guys in technical analysis or chart analysis that is what’s called a false breakout and a false breakout is one of the most important and most significant chart patterns you’ll ever see in the markets and they happen more often than you might think remember guys a false breakout of a support level is by far one of the most important and most powerful by signals you’ll find in chart analysis in fact let me show you exactly what happened after that false breakout okay.\nSo let’s take a look at what happened next so just to put into context.\nThere’s our 2013 low the 2014 low draw a line across it okay like so and look what happened here you see there it is that’s the false breakout and essentially the market here is what we’re seeing here is a break of market structure.\nNow it is true that breaking market structure is a terrible thing for that market because essentially you’re breaking key support levels which leads to significant sell offs however there is an exception to that rule.\nThe exception to that rule is when you see a false breakout and what you see here is a pure and perfect example of a false breakout because what is happening here and actually by the way guys a lot of this is happening due to algorithmic and BOTS activity.\nIt is important for you to remember that a lot of market activity today is not done necessarily by actual investors and traders (by human beings) but they’re done by algorithms and BOTS designed and created by institutions and big market players.\nI personally think this is a pure example of it because what these algorithms and these BOTS do, they deliberately push the price down below this key support level and that is done why it’s done to manipulate a lot of the traders out there.\nIn fact, the classic textbook on chart analysis says to you that that’s actually a sell signal and these institutions have read the same textbooks that you’ve probably read so they know that’s what you’re thinking that when the price falls below the key support level or breaking market structure they know that what you’re probably thinking is okay you know what that is a sell signal and that of course drives a lot of people to start shorting that market.\nAll right unfortunately what happens next is the price quickly recovers and goes back above goes back above the key support level.\nThat guy’s is a very powerful buy signal a false breakout which is exactly what that is this is how you know it’s a false breakout when price falls below the key support level right there and then quickly recovers and goes back above it all right that is how you know it’s a false breakout that is how you know it’s a buy signal because you’re back above the support level and look what happen immediately afterwards.\nWell immediately afterwards we had a rally pull back and then a continuation of that rally so what does that mean now it means this it means that if you take a look at Bitcoin chart right now let’s draw a line across the bottom here and here we go we’re gonna draw a line across that significant low that is the February April low which is about the 6500 to 6000 level there what it means is this if Bitcoin we’re to drop below that February April oh okay yes it is breaking market structure and yes it is bad but remember breaking of market structure is only bad if you stay below that level in order for that signal to be confirmed because if you quickly see a recovery and if price quick it bounces back above it again in other words if price breaks the February lows about 6500 if we quickly go back above it again like we just saw back on Bitcoin a few years ago that is actually a false breakout what that shows to you is that a lot of these bots and algorithms have deliberately pushed price below the February lows and that counts as a buy signal.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations":

Coders Gather in China to Build Apps Tied to the Bitcoin Cash Network Posted on by Startup365\nOn June 1-3, 100+ coders gathered together for the ‘BCH Geek’ in Hangzhou, China, an event that focused on developers creating BCH-based apps in order to make “bitcoin cash available to all.” According to regional reports, the event was quite successful and there were a lot of cool applications built specifically to enhance the BCH network.\nAlso Read: Twitch Streamers Can Now Tip With Four Cryptocurrencies A Large Group of Developers at the BCH Geek Event Build Unique Applications Using the BCH Chain\nThere are a lot of applications being created for the Bitcoin Cash network and one hackathon, in particular, took place in Hangzhou, China to build more BCH-centric platforms. The BCH Geek event was held on June 1-3 and firms like Bitmain Technologies, Viabtc, and BTC.top were in attendance. According to local reports and BCH-focused forums , the hackathon featured 100+ programmers who produced solid research, prototypes, and applications built using the BCH blockchain. The BCH Geek event was initiated by the blockchain video portal Chongqing TED.CC, and other members of the BCH community. BCH-Based Browser Plugins, an Authenticator, and a Quiz App\nThere were more than 11 teams who consisted of developers from firms like Viabtc, and students from Chongqing University. This week on Reddit, a BCH Geek attendee stated the hackathon resulted in a “satisfactory way,” while detailing the platforms created by a few of the top teams who participated in the event. Three teams mentioned in particular were the groups Mempool, Viabtc, and Gon. According to the report, Mempool created a URL-paying browser plug-in based on bitcoin cash which integrates with the HTTP and Status Code 402 protocol. Image credits: Cindy Daily\nViabtc developers designed a BCH-based authenticator that can store data and synchronize across multiple devices. The application does not require a server and authentication data can be restored easily. Another team called Gon designed an application called Token Dice which is a decentralized on-chain 1v1 quiz application based on BCH. The Token Dice programmers used the OP_Code , ‘ OP_DATASIGNVERIFY,’ to build the quiz platform. Another application featured was called ‘ IF Password’ a password management software (ifpass.cash) that is tethered to the BCH blockchain. Image credits: Cindy Daily New BCH Apps to Appear in the Wild Soon\nAttendees also heard from speakers such as Edward Liu, the co-founder of Bitkan, and Jiang Zhuoer, the founder of BTC.top, who talked about the innovation being built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network right now. The industry luminaries also spoke about currently built platforms like Memo , Blockpress , and Cointext that are providing the on-chain ‘killer apps’ once heralded a few years ago. The BCH Geek event ended with great success and it’s safe to say quite a few bitcoin cash-infused platforms demonstrated at the event in Hangzhou will be released into the wild shortly.\nWhat do you think about the BCH Geek event held in China this week?

The BCH Geek event was held on June 1-3 and firms like Bitmain Technologies, Viabtc, and BTC.top were in attendance. According to local reports and BCH-focused forums , the hackathon featured 100+ programmers who produced solid research, prototypes, and applications built using the BCH blockchain. The BCH Geek event was initiated by the blockchain video portal Chongqing TED.CC, and other members of the BCH community. BCH-Based Browser Plugins, an Authenticator, and a Quiz App\nThere were more than 11 teams who consisted of developers from firms like Viabtc, and students from Chongqing University. This week on Reddit, a BCH Geek attendee stated the hackathon resulted in a “satisfactory way,” while detailing the platforms created by a few of the top teams who participated in the event. Three teams mentioned in particular were the groups Mempool, Viabtc, and Gon. According to the report, Mempool created a URL-paying browser plug-in based on bitcoin cash which integrates with the HTTP and Status Code 402 protocol. Image credits: Cindy Daily\nViabtc developers designed a BCH-based authenticator that can store data and synchronize across multiple devices. The application does not require a server and authentication data can be restored easily. Another team called Gon designed an application called Token Dice which is a decentralized on-chain 1v1 quiz application based on BCH. The Token Dice programmers used the OP_Code , ‘ OP_DATASIGNVERIFY,’ to build the quiz platform. Another application featured was called ‘ IF Password’ a password management software (ifpass.cash) that is tethered to the BCH blockchain. Image credits: Cindy Daily New BCH Apps to Appear in the Wild Soon\nAttendees also heard from speakers such as Edward Liu, the co-founder of Bitkan, and Jiang Zhuoer, the founder of BTC.top, who talked about the innovation being built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network right now. The industry luminaries also spoke about currently built platforms like Memo , Blockpress , and Cointext that are providing the on-chain ‘killer apps’ once heralded a few years ago. The BCH Geek event ended with great success and it’s safe to say quite a few bitcoin cash-infused platforms demonstrated at the event in Hangzhou will be released into the wild shortly.\nWhat do you think about the BCH Geek event held in China this week?

In my opinion, before they banned bitcoin they will look well also the advantages and the benefits that they can get. Their countries or government maybe afraid that they wont control people.

PUBLISHED: 22:11, Wed, Jun 6, 2018 | UPDATED: 22:19, Wed, Jun 6, 2018 0 GETTY Technical charts show that if Bitcoin moved above $7,780, it would spark a new trading boom\nEarlier today, the cryptocurrency was trading at $7,591 on the Bitfinex trading platform, which briefly shut down this morning following a cyber attack.\nBitcoin was on the defensive on Monday and it appeared the cryptocurrency could slump to a recent low of $7,040, courtesy of the price failing to have enough momentum to push through resistance in a move called a 'failed breakout'.\nA rising-wedge breakdown, the pattern that shows up in charts when the price moves upward with pivot highs and lows converging toward a single point, also contributed to Monday's activity.\nBut sellers ran out of steam at $7,372 on Monday and prices gradually moved back above $7,600 in Asian trading markets today. Related articles Bitcoin price: Trader thinks bitcoin price will soon RALLY\nThe popular cryptocurrency has plummeted more than 30 percent from a recent high of $9,990, meaning Bitcoin is currently firmly on the back foot.\nThe fear of getting trapped on the wrong side of the market may have forced traders to stay on the sidelines, and the cryptocurrency is still treading water as seen in the chart below (pictured).\nThe rising-wedge breakdown remains intact as long as Bitcoin continues to trade below its June 3 high of $7,780.\nIt means the downside is still in play and the sell-off could accelerate if the support at $7,372 is breached. COINDESK Despite hopes of a rise in price, Bitcoin is still treading water\nBreaking the $7,780 milestone could signal a bullish trend reversal.\nIn this case, prices would likely move to the 10-week moving average, currently standing at $8,310.\nA break below $7,372 would put the focus back on the rising-wedge breakdown and accelerate a drop to $7,040.\nBitcoin was released in January 2009 and according to research from the University of Cambridge, there were up to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet last year, most of them Bitcoin.

This prevents cheating, which can otherwise be done by replacing a transaction going to a merchant with one going to another or back to yourself.\nThe incentives model is derived from Proof-of-Work, which in combination with protocol and client settings creates the positive pull needed to ensure that it is always more likely that nodes will only accept the first transaction that they saw and record it in a block as soon as possible. Like everything in Bitcoin it can never be fully guaranteed, but it can be considered \"reasonable certain\", which is also what we see in practice.\nSources 1 , 2\nReplace-by-Fee being enabled by default in Bitcoin Core clients made 0-conf in particular much less secure on its chain, because the change of expectations that it brought in practice changed the \"first seen\" rule to a \"highest-bid-until-it-gets-into-a-block\" rule.\nSome have claimed Satoshi invented this form of RBF and that it was present in Bitcoin from the start. These are actually complete lies. Satoshi never supported such a feature. He had something vaguely similar in mind, but removed it to improve security. In a forum post he also explained that a replacement transaction must be the exact same as the original transaction except with a higher fee, which would of course not in any significant way allow tempering with the actual transaction order.\nSources 1 , 2\nBitcoin always had 0-conf. The first seen rule is essential to Bitcoin and the only way to have fast transaction speeds and immediately re-spendable coins; the security of which can then be improved on with a payment processor if one wants to or by waiting for the \"confirmation\" which will be \"computationally hard\" to reverse.\nSource\nSatoshi himeself was a big proponent of 0-conf payments and expected them to work fine for paying many if not most merchants. He just went out of his way to explain their drawbacks in a rather immature network and how they could be used more safely. He also did serious work to make them function as well as they could.\nSources 1 , 2 , 3\n0-conf transactions on Bitcoin Cash are safe enough for most use cases today, including commercial transactions. You can pay for digital goods online and have them delivered without having to for your transaction to confirm. It will eventually. In order to have close to zero risk, businesses can wait for 1 confirmation if they so choose. Earlier in Bitcoins history it used to be more than one and over time the risk will tend to decrease. This is all Satoshi stuff.\nIt should be noted that Satoshi did eventually temporarily limited the spending of unconfirmed transactions received from a different wallet in the reference client itself, since these — especially back then — were less secure by not yet being included in a block and passing them on too quickly risked breaking your wallet.\nSource\n submitted by /u/fruitsofknowledge\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://archive.is/5dl6l#selection-5031.0-5035.331", "http://archive.is/cFEk#selection-4065.0-4087.75", "https://archive.li/p2x8S#selection-489.0-489.393", "http://archive.is/Umec8#selection-4695.12-4695.47", "http://archive.is/LJ4W2#selection-65.1000-65.1117", "http://archive.is/jVkAA#selection-495.197-499.280", "https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-71.4-77.226", "http://archive.is/l545f#selection-2629.41-2629.358", "http://archive.is/LJ4W2#selection-65.0-65.195"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T19:36:00.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41d80f3f6af67cc5b090ebca82c3796483de5cde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqacbchqpOlAICA2ZhTIFqP3DrSwh3PpkR0cgWWCSNmXSaegfcuVd_JVFtKjQpmvB9YwLAitAiZz7z4LKYi4kUY689EL_.sn9EU", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Bitcoin ETF Dreams Kept Alive With New SEC Filing : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "Bitcoin ETF Dreams Kept Alive With New SEC Filing : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-07T00:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41d80f3f6af67cc5b090ebca82c3796483de5cde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqacbchqpOlAICA2ZhTIFqP3DrSwh3PpkR0cgWWCSNmXSaegfcuVd_JVFtKjQpmvB9YwLAitAiZz7z4LKYi4kUY689EL_.sn9EU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LiskFTW", "published": "2018-06-07T00:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin ETF Dreams Kept Alive With New SEC Filing : CryptoCurrency", "text": "submitted by /u/LiskFTW\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/bitcoin-etf-dreams-kept-alive-with-new-solidx-vaneck-sec-filing"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T19:34:45.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3745c8c2705142b11feb13129f75251a2b87b22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcdSmgWl06CPHhBQUOCiSXE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=56.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Gambling", "title": "FreeBitco.in - Win free Bitcoins every hour!", "title_full": "FreeBitco.in - Win free Bitcoins every hour!", "published": "2018-06-07T00:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3745c8c2705142b11feb13129f75251a2b87b22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcdSmgWl06CPHhBQUOCiSXE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jackg", "published": "2018-06-07T00:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "FreeBitco.in - Win free Bitcoins every hour!", "text": "Quote: from: Kakmakr on June 06, 2018, 03:59:11 PM ~\nCan I ask a silly question?

The Top Cryptocurrency Stories for June 6, 2018 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has denied a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for subpoenas related to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and the stable coin Tether. The FOIA request is for \"subpoenas issued to iFinex Inc. also known as Bitfinex and its subsidiary companies, as well as subpoenas issued [to] Tether Limited and its subsidiary companies.\" The financial services industry is speaking out against Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL ). Executives in the sector argue that Google's ban on cryptocurrency marketing is an unethical and ill-conceived notion. Philip Nunn of Blackmore Group said that the ban is clearly not based on concerns about criminal activity. \"I understand that Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB ) and Google are under a lot of pressure to regulate what their users are reading, but they are still advertising gambling websites and other unethical practices,\" he said. Nunn believes that the ban is really motivated by plans at both organizations to launch their own cryptocurrencies and stave off competition. The cryptocurrency startup Circle wants to register as a federally licensed bank in the United States, according to Bloomberg . It's also seeking to register with the SEC to operate as a brokerage and trading platform. Circle said it would likely seek SEC regulation before applying for a bank license. This is another bullish development for the crypto space, as it will bring in more money.

Advertisements\nThe proposed fund which they filed earlier today will apparently be physically-backed by actual Bitcoin. It will also be insured against the kinds of security comprises that have affected some crypto exchanges in the past. Could the Latest Filing Finally Create the First Bitcoin ETF?\nThe latest request for a Bitcoin ETF was filed earlier today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It was filed by VanEck and SolidX – two firms that are well-suited to create such a financial product. They’re hoping to apply what they have taken from a previous failed filing and become the first Bitcoin ETF sanctioned by the SEC.\nLast year, there was a lot of hype surrounding a potential Bitcoin ETF that the Winklevoss twins had put forward for SEC approval. However, this was knocked back by the financial regulators.\nExcitement once again grew at the end of the year following the successful launch of both the CME Group and CBOE Bitcoin futures contracts. However, earlier this year, the SEC denied around a dozen similar applications for ETFs. The financial regulators cited high volatility, lack of liquidity, and lack of regulation as reasons behind the rejections this January.\nVanEck and SolidX were amongst those to have a proposal rejected in January. However, according to today’s filing, the two firms have returned to the drawing board in an effort to directly address the concerns of the financial regulators. The CEO of SolidX, Daniel Gallancy, told Bloomberg via a telephone interview:\n“Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors… We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.”\nThe CEO went on to tell the publication that the proposed ETF would base their prices off regulated trading firms. It will also be physically-backed by Bitcoin and will be insured by a group of insurers that are still to be named. SolidX will reportedly handle the keeping of the Bitcoin itself. This would involve a cold storage solution so that private keys are at considerably less risk of compromise.\nFor those that don’t know, VanEck are a New York-based money management firm. They are in charge of over $45 billion in assets and have dealt with many exchange-traded products since their formation in 1955. Meanwhile, SolidX are also working out of New York city. They specialise in fintech and have developed cryptographic software as well as capital markets products. Clearly, this combination of firms makes them well suited to creating the first Bitcoin ETF. Also, both firms reportedly own Bitcoin themselves.

They’re proposing a physically backed bitcoin ETF, the Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust , and it just might be poised to break the losing streak of mainstreaming BTC on Wall Street. This time, they’re aiming at institutional investors by pricing it at $200,000 per share. Advertisements\nAlso read: Russian Farming Village: Local Crypto, Bitcoin Reserves, No Govt Money Van Eck and Solid X Team for Bitcoin ETF Priced at $200,000\nVan Eck CEO Jan van Eck cheered, “I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios. The Solid X team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.” The Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust will also offer itself as being insured against bitcoin lost or stolen.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports, “The firms also set a relatively high per-share price: $200,000. The price tag is designed to aim the product at institutional rather than retail investors.” And in “determining a marketing partner,” Solid X CEO Daniel H. Gallancy underscored, they “looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio. Van Eck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities.”\nThe two have in common being New York-based and the dubious honor of having been shot down by the SEC when they attempted individually to list a bitcoin ETF. The present filing, as of 6 June 2018, will be watched closely by the ecosystem. Jan van Eck expressed optimism at their latest tactic, “We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\nChicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and its BZX Equities Exchange is believed to be where such a fund, pending approval, would ultimately be listed. The Cboe market maker was the first to list Bitcoin Futures back in December of last year. Results have been decidedly mixed after ecosystem enthusiasm almost promised BTC would moon in response. Now, some have taken to blaming exchanges such as Cboe and its crosstown rival CME for retarding the BTC spot price, for essentially being Crypto Winter’s catalyst as it were. Could be the Right Combination at the Right Time\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” the Van Eck CEO stressed.\nIndeed, earlier this year, these pages reported how in a “ Staff Letter: Engaging on Fund Innovation and Cryptocurrency-related Holdings of 18 January, signed by newly appointed Director Dalia Blass from the Division of Investment Management, the SEC wrote to the Investment Company Institute and Asset Management Group Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) about the prospects of bitcoin ETFs.” It was a letter filled with admonitions and warnings and potential confusions. One thing was glaringly clear: any bitcoin ETF going forward must contend with its concerns.\nTwo months ago to almost the day, however, hopeful signs appeared to emerge. Presumably in response to a Cboe open letter plea for action from President and COO Chris Concannon, the SEC seemed to be moving along further than it had previously while it considered two fund candidates from Pro Shares. Comment portion of the process has just wrapped. The Journal quotes Mr. Gallancy of Solid X as reminding they “never had any intention of giving up.” Neither has the broader crypto investment community, showing how it is not content to just sit back and wait for permission. “Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on its recently launched index of ten digital assets,” News.Bitcoin.com explained. In further anticipation, “Okex, the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes,” we explained recently.\nAre Wall Street bitcoin ETFs around the corner?

Advertisement\nIn terms of price, there’s not much to say, except it has been a boring week. Opinions seem to be quite divided, although that is only natural as the market keeps moving side-ways.\nBoring as hell. What about technology? What’s new?\nIn terms of new and exciting developments happening on the bitcoin community, there are a few different ones I would like to discuss today.\nAgain, I’m not focusing in other projects like Iota or Eos, as their product is either in testnet, training wheels or was just released.\nWhat’s more important, to discuss how amazing new ideas will solve scalability, like PoS, DPoS and DAG’s, or to focus on what is being done at the bitcoin core development?\nBoth!\nYes, I agree there are many different projects worth mentioning and I will write an article discussing the ones I consider to be the most promising, their advantages and problems. But for now, let’s focus on Bitcoin. Not because of price, but due to adoption: no other cryptocurrency has as many users, developers and infrastructure support. Maybe Ethereum, which is closing in, but still Bitcoin is the most widely spread cryptocurrency and the base layer for the entire market.\nToday I will be discussing ways bitcoin is being improved and infrastructure changes happening in the near future, that can potentially help by lowering fees, by improving ease-of-use, by creating off-chain payments solutions or simply by adding more transactions to each block. There are ways of implementing each solution separately, but some core technology must be widely adopted, like Segregated Witnessing (SegWit) .\nThere will be three main topics I will approach today: batching, schnorr signatures and atomic swaps. I’ve been discussing the Lightning Network too much and I want to check different potential solutions, less prone to centralization.\nSpeaking of the devil , that’s definitely one of the features I believe we should be trying to avoid. Bitcoin’s purpose is to be fully decentralized, so any action, update or improvement that won’t go in that direction should be disregarded.\nReady for what’s coming? Batching\nAlthough this is obvious for techies, it doesn’t mean it’s an easy solution to implement on a massive scale.\nFirst we need to understand how bitcoin works.\nEach transaction is based on one input and multiple outputs. Meaning, with a single transaction you can transfer money to multiple people, for example.\nWhat’s really interesting is how data flows in the blockchain and what we can do with that information. Let’s say I create a transaction which weight is equal to 40 bytes and that said transaction only contains one input and one output. With batching you can aggregate transactions and literally save up space, so when I add an extra output, instead of the total weight of the transaction = 80 bytes (doubling down), it only adds, for example, 20 bytes more.\nThis means that instead of creating single transactions, you can do one with a series of different outputs. Plus, each additional output does not double down the total transaction weight, meaning there’s economies of scale at play.\nThese are very good news, as this feature can also be a way to help improving scaling. It won’t increase the number of transactions, but allows for a higher number of outputs per input.\nThis is what batching is: aggregating many different transactions into a single transaction, by adding multiple outputs per input.\nWould you like a more visual representation of the savings?\nAs you can see the number of bytes significantly reduces each time another payment (output) is added in a single transaction (for each input).\nIt’s really cool if you’re a business or someone who makes recurring transfers, like sending money abroad.\nWith batching there’s considerably more space in the block for more transactions with more outputs. Exchanges do this, of course; hopefully there will be tools available soon, so that single customers can easily select transaction outputs they would like to batch together on the same payment. How can this be used in real-life?\nImagine you have a company and you do cryptocurrency payments.\nInstead of doing 5 different transactions in order to pay salaries or suppliers, you could chose to batch all payments in the same transaction (input) and set 5 different outputs, which would allow you to pay way less fees and make the overall block smaller.\nYou already got it, right?\nThis is a very straightforward example, but it actually works pretty well. You still need to do it from a command terminal (I think), as there is no way to do it with most wallet apps or exchanges’ wallets (blockchain.info, coinbase, etc).\nStill, learning how to do it might be worth the effort if you send money to many different addresses. Schnorr Signatures\nThis subject might be a bit complex for the average non-technical reader and again, I’m not an expert. If you really want to get acquainted with the math behind it, check this video from a lead developer working on Schnorr Signatures. It’s still quite technical but, nevertheless, it’s the best explanation I’ve found so far.\nI’ll try to make this introduction as simple as possible, so you don’t run away. What are Schnorr Signatures? How can Schnorr Signatures improve scalability?\nRight, first things first;\nThis is the model you usually see to explain how transactions work, correct?\nBitcoin’s blockchain registers unspent transaction outputs; that’s all it does.\nWhen you send some bitcoin, you’re basically sending a message with an input which can be distributed between many outputs (as we’ve seen in batching). This is called the simple UTXO model.\nNow, there’s small features you can add, like allowing for different signatures to approve a transaction, for example.\nMulti-signature (or multisig) transactions require the participation (signature) of multiple participants. Each multisig transaction can only be posted if, and only if, the require signatures are present. This means that in order for any of the outputs to be used, they need to be unlocked.\nThe really cool feature introduced by Schnorr Signatures is that it aggregates the signatures needed into only one signature (or signature hash, to be more precise) which can be used as proof to unlock the transaction outputs.\nUsing Schnorr Signatures, the unlocking script would simply have 1 signature representing an aggregate of each participant’s signature. You can guess what happens: On-chain transaction size is reduced Faster validation for each transaction Improved privacy for participants of a Multi-Signature wallet\nThere are, of course, attack vectors that could potentially compromise a one signature scheme. I’m not going into details but you can check some more information here . Atomic swaps\nI absolutely love the concept of atomic swaps . To better explain it, we can use the usual example:\nLuke and Vader want to trade Rebel and Imperial tokens. As Luke is in Tatooine and Vader on the Death Star, it is difficult to do it physically, plus, Luke’s pretty sure he would be chased by Imperials enforcers, so he kind of wants to avoid that.\nLuke could send the Rebel token and hope Vader would send the Imperial token, or it could go the other way around.\nThis means the option would be for Luke and Vader to trust each other.\nThat’s also not happening as Luke can’t turn Vader to the Light side and Vader can’t turn Luke to the dark side. They’re basically at a cross-road.\nWhat to do, what to do?\nThe third option is to get an escrow, so someone both trust or an agency which holds the tokens. Only after both approve, the escrow sends tokens to Luke and Vader, which were previously locked.\nThe problem is that escrows are expensive and the trust problem does not get solved. Centralized exchanges, like Bittrex, Binance, etc are also escrows as they keep tokens in their own personal wallets. How can we fix it this problem?\nAtomic Swaps simply allow for some cryptocurrencies (based on the language SCRIPT, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Vertcoin, etc) to be automatically exchanged between one another.\nUsing the example above, Luke locks Rebels tokens in a digital box which only Vader can open with his digital signature, and Vader does the same thing. Immediately after Vader opens the box Luke will be able to open Vader’s box and get his Imperial tokens.\nThis works because opening one lockbox effectively gives the other party the ability to open the other lockbox. Because each lockbox requires both the key and the signature, both lockboxes are essentially secure.\nIn case something goes wrong or one party backs out in the middle of the process, the lockboxes are constructed in a way as to refund respectively both agents, if nobody opened the lockboxes in 48 and 24 hours respectively.\nAtomic swaps reduce on-chain privacy, as users transactions can be linked cross-chain. But this technology can also be used with off-chain protocols, like the Lightning Network, which can also help protecting privacy. Better yet, imagine this technology working with bitcoin to privacy coins. You could, potentially, use those coins privacy to mask your bitcoin transactions.\nIf you’re worried none of these improvements matter until we “fix” transaction throughput you might want to look at the problem from a different angle.\nI understand the current hype is more about “ how many transactions per second does your blockchain do, bro?! ”.\nSecurity, apparently, is not the main concern anymore.\nWHY?!?!\nDo you really think it’s easier to start-over and create a USD 11 billion dollar project like EOS, than fixing problems with the most used and adopted cryptocurrency out there? I’m not saying other projects shouldn’t be given a chance, especially considering they use different technology, have a different purpose and economic incentives.\nBut man, bluntly believing coin X or Y will fix everything because some smart dude said so, doesn’t seem a very productive use of your time.\nI hope most projects succeed as I have been investing full force in many of them, as well.\nThe question here is not about system performance (how many transactions per second).\nWhat we should be worrying about is network performance. How many people do we need to secure the entire network? How many people use this cryptocurrency on a daily basis? What’s the network reach? How can incentives be aligned with consensus in a long-term perspective?\nDo you really think any project that claims to do a gazillion transactions per second won’t have security issues?\nI’m pretty sure they will.\nIf you want to understand how serious you should be worried about security instead of performance, check this out . It shows how cheap it is to actually perform a 51% double spend attack on some blockchains by using Nice-hash, a cloud mining pool.\nMy goal here is not to trash other projects, as I’m definitely not a bitcoin maximalist.\nI want to share as much information as possible so that you too can critique and question other ideas. The more we learn, the more challenging it becomes to progress with improvements (seems contradictory, right?)\nI understand PoS seems unbreakable and much better (to some) than PoW, or that the DAG is the cure to all blockchain evilness and power-struggles.\nWant some advice I got from an old man?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@zosegal/a-short-explainer-of-atomic-swaps-by-jimmy-song", "https://bitcoin.org/en/development", "http://segwit.party/charts/", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20180522/1fc2d349/attachment-0001.pdf", "https://www.crypto51.app/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTsjMz3DaLs"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T02:53:39.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6cc7450a818ab1c4f3ee8c812802c0589ff2bc23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQVqV6X.kFq58YFKFXEB714uIvMTgeXinvrIizpiTZer1Uy1YXwqLaETSprcb0hBLuOf8lOoJ0VmKJ5ZHvsNMgj0b1WoFK1JyxsahcQyyTKYO6LsPp8XWmbVFSQX.14xNFfYenR0a1XA--", "site_full": "www.channelnewsasia.com", "site": "channelnewsasia.com", "site_section": "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/rss/latest_cna_frontpage_rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "tech", "social"], "section_title": "Latest News", "title": "Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "title_full": "Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "published": "2018-06-07T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/image/8695434/16x9/991/529/1b7112db0e9c1f0955584f733dc80877/Ii/technology.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6036, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6cc7450a818ab1c4f3ee8c812802c0589ff2bc23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQVqV6X.kFq58YFKFXEB714uIvMTgeXinvrIizpiTZer1Uy1YXwqLaETSprcb0hBLuOf8lOoJ0VmKJ5ZHvsNMgj0b1WoFK1JyxsahcQyyTKYO6LsPp8XWmbVFSQX.14xNFfYenR0a1XA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "text": "REUTERS: Asset manager Van Eck Securities Corp and blockchain company SolidX Partners Inc plan to launch a bitcoin-linked investment product that could be traded as easily as a stock, the two companies said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.\nThe exchange-traded product, called VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Shares, will be insured against theft, fraud and loss of access to the currency, according to the filing, which is subject to a review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAdvertisement The companies said they intend to buy and sell bitcoin in informally organised \"over-the counter\" bitcoin markets to cap transaction costs, while trading large blocks of the cryptocurrency.\nVan Eck, which had US$46 billion in assets under management, and several other fund managers had previously pushed for exchange-traded funds based on bitcoin futures instead of directly investing in the cryptocurrency.\nThis was to address concerns that bitcoin exchanges were not regulated by traditional financial market overseers, unlike the futures market.\nThe SEC has either denied or tabled all bitcoin ETF proposals received so far, joining a long list of regulators that have taken a tough stance against products and securities related to digital currencies.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Van Eck and SolidX hope to list the product on the Cboe exchange under the symbol \"XBTC\".\n(Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru and Trevor Hunnicutt in New York;

But the reality is that the time has not yet come to resume Bitcoin trading in the country.The cryptocurrency trading market in China has become associated with chaos since funds were raised illegally under the guise of cryptocurrency transactions in 2016. This led to stringent controls on the activity. On September 4, 2017, the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, banned fundraising for cryptocurrency ventures via initial coin offerings (ICOs). By April this year, Bitcoin trading platforms had virtually disappeared from the Chinese mainland. It is still too early for Bitcoin trading to be allowed back, despite the loosening of regulations for cryptocurrencies and ICOs in some countries such as South Korea last month. There are several reasons for this. First, it can be difficult to track or conduct effective supervision of ICOs. Although there are some similarities between ICOs and IPOs, an ICO is a form of fundraising that bypasses normal regulations. It is based on cryptocurrencies and the transactions can be anonymous and untraceable. Also, most ICO projects are at their initial stages, which means they are not mature enough for normal commercial operations. Information about their legal status, capital and risk control is generally inadequate. Also, since the technology behind it is so innovative and subversive, it is challenging for regulators to make a professional and reasonable assessment about the value and prospects of ICO projects.Second, levying a tax on cryptocurrencies and ICOs would not be effective. The transactions and trade verifications are conducted on the internet, so the regulatory watchdogs would have trouble tracking the flow of cryptocurrencies, let alone collecting tax on them. So far, there are no regulations for the Bitcoin transfer process in China and digital assets such as cryptocurrencies do not require any registration. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies and ICOs are often used for tax evasion and illegal purposes.Third, cryptocurrency transactions do not play a positive role in the real economy. For instance, Bitcoin trading exists in a network that is completely independent from the real economy. Unlike stocks, or derivatives that are pegged to certain tangible goods, the value of cryptocurrencies is not related to any tangible assets. Also, they are susceptible to speculation and criminal activities, and pose a threat to economic stability.There is currently no practical solution for taming and harnessing cryptocurrencies. Getting them onto a rational track and curbing speculation will require more regulations, information disclosure and a law for transfer of digital property. All of this should be done before cryptocurrency trading can be allowed to return. Even though it is too early for Bitcoin trading to make a comeback, the blockchain technology that supports it can be a helping hand for creating new operating formats, as well as reducing costs and improving payment and settlement efficiency in the financial sector.Instead of focusing on the reopening of cryptocurrency trading platforms, the main current issue is to pursue a better understanding of the underlying blockchain technology, and to explore its potential applications. Cryptocurrency trading will be resumed eventually. With the perfection of a regulatory and legal system, along with acceleration of the global economic integration process and a more mature market and investors, cryptocurrencies still have a future in China.
