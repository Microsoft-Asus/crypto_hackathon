Founder of the project, Gabriel Kurman says that he wants to show people how to “take advantage” of cryptocurrencies.\nThe van set out from Argentina’s capital Buenos Aires on 1 June, reaching the town of Chasomus, with a population of 30,000, some 120 kilometers away, to give a short lecture on blockchain and cryptocurrencies for the locals. Once leaving Buenos Aires province Bitcoineta will visit the regions of La Pampa, Santa Fe, and Cordoba. The team has said that it plans to extend their educational road trip to other parts of Latin America sometime in the future.\nThe visibility and profile of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Argentina are on the rise. It plans to become the world’s biggest player with pre-agreements to install 4,000 Bitcoin ATMs around the country as part of a new government plan to install 30,000 machines in the future. The South American country is currently home to more than 10 cryptocurrency exchanges. In May, one of the country’s banks, Banco Masventas, announced it would enable clients to use Bitcoin for international payments.\nBitcoin has been greeted in Argentina with enthusiasm partly because countries with histories of inflation and devaluation of their currencies see the digital currency as one that can conserve the value of user investments and savings. After President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s tightening of currency controls debased the Argentine peso (ARS) in 2012, Bitcoin has gained increasing popularity.\nThe post “Bitcoineta” Road Trip Hits Argentinian Highways With Bitcoin Story appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

Kundra, former co-owner of Rajasthan Royals IPL team, had reportedly invested in the virtual currency and profited from it. Kundra is suspected to be involved in money laundering, even though no case has been registered against him.\nKundra, who was questioned by officials till late-evening today, said, “ED called me as a witness. There’s an Amit Bhardwaj, who’s involved in some scam. He had purchased poker team from our poker league but didn’t make payment so we expelled his team. I’ve given my statement.” Kundra also said that Bhardwaj wanted to pay for the poker team in bitcoin which was not accepted and his team was eventually expelled. “We thought he is a respectable person so we alloted him a team. His contract was terminated after he failed to make the payments,” said Kundra while leaving the ED office at around 10pm on Tuesday.\nIn April, the Pune police had arrested Amit Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek, the alleged masterminds of the cryptocurrency scam. The Bhardwaj brothers, residents of Shahipur village in Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh area, are the founders and CEOs of Gain Bitcoin, GB Minors and GB21 firms through which they lured investors.\nREAD | Thane Police busts Rs 500-crore cryptocurrency racket; one held\nThe Delhi Police said that Bhardwaj introduced the first online retail marketplace accepting bitcoin in the country in 2014. A total of 10 people have been arrested in the case and have been booked under IPC Sections 406, 420, 34, provisions of the Information Technology Act and Prize Chit Fund and Money Schemes (Banning) Act. Police said that Bhardwaj had duped investors in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other cities in the state.\nREAD | Bitcoin scam: Probe spotlight on Nanded network of prime accused\nBhardwaj had set up an elaborate multi-level marketing (MLM) scam by luring investors to give him Bitcoins in return for promised higher returns, police said. Under the scheme, people were asked to invest one Bitcoin for a 10 per cent return. The contract would be valid for 18 months. Bhardwaj also allegedly offered to provide Bitcoin mining hardware to the investors. However, he never gave the returns and fled the country, police said.\nDuring the Budget session in March, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley clarified that Bitcoins or such cryptocurrencies were not legal tenders and those indulging in such transactions were doing it at their own risk.

As reported by TASS Monday, June 4, the decision came about after the court received an order from Russia’s Supreme Court in April to review the case.\n“The St. Petersburg City Court overturned the decision of the district court to recognize the information posted on the Bitcoininfo.ru website,” the city court was quoted by the news agency.\nThe press service of the City Court of St. Petersburg also reported that in July 2016 the St. Petersburg Vyborg District Court banned the website per the application of local prosecutors. The case was considered by the court without the website owners present.\nIn July 2016, the Vyborg district court of St. Petersburg ruled to block bitcoininfo.ru without allowing the site’s owners go through an initial trial. The basis of the ruling was that cryptocurrencies are “a means of virtual payment and accumulation,” and, thus, providing related information is illegal as it could undermine the country’s fiat currency.\nFollowing the ban, the St. Petersburg City Court also declined the site owners’ appeal to reconsider the case until the Supreme Court overturned the decision.\nThe website’s owner told the news agency that the St. Petersburg city prosecutor’s statements disclosed that about 100 cryptocurrency media sites had been blocked following the ruling.\nEarlier this year the City Court of St. Petersburg annulled a trial court’s previous decision to ban 40 Bitcoin-related websites in the Russian Federation. The ban was initiated because the sites were “spreading information” about digital currency that “is not backed by any real asset and does not provide information about its owners.”\nThe latest ruling comes as Russia is in the process of drawing up and passing a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry – one expected to be ready by summer of this year, as previously demanded by President Vladimir Putin.

it would, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of blockchain start-up Ripple, told CNBC in an interview that aired Tuesday.\nRipple is a San Francisco-based company that is developing a network for faster global financial payments. XRP is the digital token that financial institutions on the network can use to transact quickly. The currency and the company were founded by the same people.\nXRP is traded on cryotocurrency exchanges and one is currently worth 65 cents. Garlinghouse, who emphasized that Ripple is independent of the XRP token, said bitcoin will have a role in the future, but not one that will see it solve major problems, such as becoming a global currency.\n\"I think it's (bitcoin) not going to be the panacea that people once thought it would be, where it would solve all of these different kind of problems... Instead, you're seeing specializations of different kind of ledgers, different kinds of blockchains,\" Garlinghouse told CNBC at the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\nHe explained that the bitcoin blockchain, the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency, is \"quite slow,\" whereas XRP transactions are \"a thousand times faster.\"\nThe average transaction time for bitcoin was 42 minutes as of Tuesday, according to data tracked by Blockchain.info . XRP has a transaction time of four seconds, according to Ripple's website.\nWhile many see XRP as a rival to bitcoin, Garlinghouse said it's not necessarily a case of one digital coin versus another.\n\"Well, I don't really think about it as one versus the other. I mean, it's actually unfortunate, I think, that there's some people in this, the crypto space, the blockchain space — for them, it's almost a holy war of one versus the other. I don't look at that at all.\"\n\"I think that what we're seeing is the overall growth of this space and there will be many winners,\" he added.\nBitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In another recent interview with CNBC , Garlinghouse said that cryptocurrency prices are influenced by bitcoin, but that could soon change as people realize the differences between different digital coins.\nLawsuit claims 'outrageous' Elsewhere, Ripple has been hit with a class action lawsuit by a person who allegedly lost money buying and selling XRP. Ryan Coffey claims that Ripple violated U.S. securities law.\nIn 2013, Ripple Labs created 100 billion of the XRP coins in existence. Ripple owns about 60 percent of those 100 billion XRP, some of which are owned by the blockchain's founders. The lawsuit alleges that the founders \"earned massive profits by quietly selling off this XRP to the general public, in what is essentially a never-ending initial coin offering (ICO).\"\nshow chapters Ripple CEO: It's very clear XRP is not a security 2:35 AM ET Tue, 5 June 2018 | 01:34 An ICO is a way for a company to issue a new digital token in exchange for money in order to raise funds. Garlinghouse called the lawsuit \"outrageous.\"\n\"Here's somebody who held XRP for, I think, two weeks... and is making some claims,\" he said.\n\"Whether or not XRP is a security is not going to be dictated by one lawsuit... I think it's very clear that XRP is not a security, it does exist independently of Ripple the company. If Ripple the company is shut down tomorrow the XRP ecosystem would continue to exist. It's an independent, open-sourced technology.\n\"From an ownership point of view, owning XRP doesn't give you any ownership of Ripple equity. And also, as we just talked about, XRP has a lot of utility, so to me it's quite different than what a security you know looks like and I think ultimately we'll find that conclusion.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time?daysAverageString=7"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco-based", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T15:10:38.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bebbf698919cc7a7b1674ecc4ea0892de097feab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.YyO6OhKhkrFcqqHFPgZjjJxDf4PjPWJpWDDh3CNy4Xvk1oJurSjPb25mPrkDV6jS.0GOV69QPtHhvP4U17EZzFuCFEtu_0UpYkEGMpWOKI1eT0ZFQ34yUK130pT04K0XROiBGz7AQ--", "site_full": "www.khaleejtimes.com", "site": "khaleejtimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/services/rss/uaebusiness/rss.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "KT Mobile", "title": "Shilpa Shetty's husband summoned in bitcoin scam", "title_full": "Shilpa Shetty's husband summoned in bitcoin scam", "published": "2018-06-05T13:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.khaleejtimes.com/storyimage/KT/20180605/ARTICLE/180609613/AR/0/AR-180609613.jpg&NCS_modified=&imageversion=1by1&exif=.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7403, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bebbf698919cc7a7b1674ecc4ea0892de097feab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.YyO6OhKhkrFcqqHFPgZjjJxDf4PjPWJpWDDh3CNy4Xvk1oJurSjPb25mPrkDV6jS.0GOV69QPtHhvP4U17EZzFuCFEtu_0UpYkEGMpWOKI1eT0ZFQ34yUK130pT04K0XROiBGz7AQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T13:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Shilpa Shetty's husband summoned in bitcoin scam", "text": "Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra summoned in bitcoin scam PTI /Mumbai 01.01 pm Share\n(Picture via Twitter/@abpnewstv) He was arrested in April at Delhi airport. The ED on Tuesday questioned Raj Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, in connection with a money laundering probe related to a bitcoin transactions case, officials said. The businessman was summoned at the ED office here and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government, they said. There are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating. The Enforcement Directorate (ED), sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. It is alleged that about 8,000 investors lost about Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme. The ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier. Bhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals. The central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments. It is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state. Last year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there are no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the RBI has not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies The government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, saying they are like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/bitcoin-scam-case-ed-summons-shilpa-shettys-husband-raj-kundra-for-questioning/1194106/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "financial express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:10:53.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e5a60c11afe443367411ebe0a219389f8d2e2e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma0d_IfdRX.Qsaaii8E05gY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "factors that can make bitcoin stable", "title_full": "factors that can make bitcoin stable", "published": "2018-06-05T13:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.034, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e5a60c11afe443367411ebe0a219389f8d2e2e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma0d_IfdRX.Qsaaii8E05gY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ricardobs", "published": "2018-06-05T13:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "factors that can make bitcoin stable", "text": "Quote: from: annasadia on June 03, 2018, 09:51:49 AM If bitcon wants to stabe in the market they need to balance demand and supply position.

But the big story, without a doubt, is Woz’s undying commitment to the idea of bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Crypto Point-of-Sale Devices Begin Roll-Out in Indonesia Despite Ban Apple Co-Founder’s High Hopes for Bitcoin\nSteve Wozniak, the genius co-founder of Apple Computers, has once again spoken about his fascination with the tech and principles of bitcoin. “Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions,” he told CNBC. “Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that,” Woz added. Okex’s New Exchange Traded Tracker (ETT)\nOkex , the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes. It includes six coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS, and OKB) and requires USDT to subscribe. The minimum subscription for the instruments is 100 units.\nA couple of days ago, we reported that Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on an index of ten assets. Bitoasis Resumes Dirham Transactions\nLast month, Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitoasis enacted a suspension of deposits and withdrawals in UAE dirhams. This Monday, without explaining what was the cause of the issue, the company announced that transactions are reinstated. In a letter to its clients, quoted by Arabian Business , Bitoasis apologized for the inconvenience and said that now “users can deposit and withdraw their funds in AED as usual, without any interruption.”\n“In light of the recent inconsistency of service across our payment options, we will be revising and updating the options available to our customers on the platform to ensure continuity of our services,” the Bitoasis statement continued. “We will be notifying our customers with the update on our new payment options soon.” Myetherwallet Attack Blamed on Russian Hackers, Uneducated Users\nMyetherwallet (MEW), the web’s most popular client-side ethereum wallet, has been compromised by a DNS attack on April 24, 2018. Today the team behind the wallet issued a response to the event, further explaining what happened and detailing the steps taken to prevent its reoccurrence.\nThey say that the attack was carried out by a native Russian speaker, which was able to phish only about $150,000 worth of ether from MEW users. They quote Internet Security experts as explaining that the “financial resources required for such an attack likely exceeds the amount of funds taken.”\nThe team added that it is a lack of safety education that led some clients to fall for the fraud. “We hope that from this experience, every single person who interacts with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain will understand how important self-education is. In the end, you and only you are responsible for your security.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news? Is bitcoin going to be the world’s single currency in ten years?

In a recent interview with CNBC , the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years. “I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.” Wozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked. He also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.” “Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed. Wozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold. “Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.” This is not the first time Wozniak has been vocally positive about bitcoin. At a Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, the Apple co-founder lauded the cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology as stronger and more financially sound than both gold and USD. He stated that traditional currencies are “kind of phony,” as they are widely vulnerable to inflation, and that the problem with gold is that there is no fixed supply. “There is a certain amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,” he continued. “Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated, and nobody can change mathematics.” Wozniak also called for further regulation efforts , saying they were crucial to bitcoin’s survival. “Regulation is an essential element to the fintech transformation happening today,” he exclaimed. “Fairness, equality and truth is the foundation for good regulation and that will lay the groundwork for good development.” This article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin technology bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T11:28:10.047+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13139d68ed6b9b917ded8faa4a60ffe918befadc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCPcpycjmDsNbhbU0ZSOyabmUFu6lUd5tah3p.er2danEdYV9GV1Y62396IsV.FmA1Dhx8qq2MXGIwtR1wkCpd90UlRSIZWm0t", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "‘Big Four’ Australian Bank Beats Bitcoin… in Money Laundering", "title_full": "‘Big Four’ Australian Bank Beats Bitcoin… in Money Laundering", "published": "2018-06-05T13:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1528160896_18777655.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13139d68ed6b9b917ded8faa4a60ffe918befadc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCPcpycjmDsNbhbU0ZSOyabmUFu6lUd5tah3p.er2danEdYV9GV1Y62396IsV.FmA1Dhx8qq2MXGIwtR1wkCpd90UlRSIZWm0t", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T13:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘Big Four’ Australian Bank Beats Bitcoin… in Money Laundering", "text": "7 hours ago Crypto and Laws Bitcoinist 83 One of Australia’s “big four” banks, Commonwealth Bank (CBA), has agreed to pay Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) AUS$700M ($530M USD) in settlements for breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. During a period of 3 years, CBA had failed to report 53,506 bank transactions, improperly monitored 778,370 accounts for money laundering red flags, and filed 149 suspicious matter reports late. The scandal resulted in the departure of Chief Executive Ian Narev. CBA denies knowingly breaching AML laws, arguing that a single coding error had led to the failure to report the 53,506 transactions. However, they did admit responsibility for a lack of proper due diligence. “Our agreement today is a clear acknowledgment of our failures and is an important step towards moving the bank forward. On behalf of Commonwealth Bank, I apologise to the community for letting them down,” said CBA current chief executive, Matt Comyn. Illegal transactions: Fiat vs. Crypto This news is particularly ironic considering the accusations by the mainstream media (and Bill Gates ) that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used primarily for money laundering and funding terrorism. Studies conducted by Colombia University Economics professor Edgar Feige have already disproven these claims, citing that almost 50% of the world’s hard currency is utilized to make Illicit transactions like drug and arms trafficking. A recent panel held by the US Senate Judiciary on modernizing anti-money laundering laws also found that only a small percentage of illicit activity spending is done through cryptocurrency . The fact remains that cash is offline, and therefore more difficult to trace. Digital cash is recorded on a centralized database, where institutions with their own agendas can easily hide these transactions from the authorities. By contrast, the immutability of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain actually makes it harder to move money around without a trace. A recent study by Qatar University and Hamad Bin Khalifa University revealed that unmasking the users behind these transactions often requires nothing more than a wallet address and a Google search. Qatar University researcher, Husam Al Jawaheri, explained: The retroactive operation security of Bitcoin is low. When things are recorded in the blockchain, you can go back in history and reveal this information, to break the anonymity of users. The best drug traffickers can hope for at the moment is using coins like Monero to mask their transactions, however, even Monero has its vulnerabilities . CBA Implementing Blockchain? Just 2 years ago, the now-ousted CBA executive Ian Narev acknowledged blockchain’s potential to be “transformational” for customers and in reducing costs, while perhaps not also recognizing its capabilities as an immutable ledger for the Bank itself. It’s safe to say that a CBA ledger built on the blockchain would’ve made it much more difficult to conceal 53,506 transactions, saving AUSTRAC a lot of time and money investigating the breach. To date, CBA has spent more than $400 million on anti-money laundering compliance measures.

stance toward cryptocurrency to the extreme, and can’t help yourself when it comes to buying cryptocurrency, you may be addicted. That’s the view of experts at the Scotland-based Castle Craig Hospital, which expanded its rehab services to cover cryptocurrency addiction earlier this month.\nExperts have long compared the thrill of cryptocurrency to day trading, both of which entail high degrees of risk. You’re essentially gambling with your money with crypto and with day trading, and the thrill of massive returns — and the potential addictive effects — create an emotional dependence that is not much different from gambling addiction.\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler,” Castle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn says. “It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains & losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nSimilar to those that might be addicted to casino table games or slots, the addicted trader spends most if not all of their money on cryptocurrency, and will “chase” their losses in attempts to win back lost money. They may borrow excessively or even steal, or experience mood swings and obsessive thoughts and actions, the hospital says.\nCastle Craig plans to treat addicts using the same methods used for excessive gambling. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary tool, and teaches the person how to accept responsibility for their addiction and coping strategies, finding positive activities to replace the need for cryptocurrency trading, and most importantly how to manage their debts and finances appropriately.\nThe help is not cheap: according to WikiTribune, Treatments start at 2,975 British pounds (about $4,000) per week for a multi-occupancy room all the way up to 4,970 pounds (about $6,600) weekly for a private room. Considering most addiction programs are multi-step processes — Castle Craig’s is 12 — treatment could easily run into the tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nWhile most won’t be able to afford the treatment out-of-pocket, the company says it offers payment plans, and in some cases a portion of the cost might be covered under public or private insurance. The company also operates clinics in at least six other European countries, however it’s not immediately clear if the program will be offered at those locations.\nEditors’ Recommendations\nThe tech behind cryptocurrency could save lives by fixing medical records\nBecome a cryptocurrency master with these online Bitcoin courses\nAddicted to your smartphone?

But the big story, without a doubt, is Woz’s undying commitment to the idea of bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Crypto Point-of-Sale Devices Begin Roll-Out in Indonesia Despite Ban Apple Co-Founder’s High Hopes for Bitcoin\nSteve Wozniak, the genius co-founder of Apple Computers, has once again spoken about his fascination with the tech and principles of bitcoin. “Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions,” he told CNBC. “Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that,” Woz added. Okex’s New Exchange Traded Tracker (ETT)\nOkex , the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes. It includes six coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS, and OKB) and requires USDT to subscribe. The minimum subscription for the instruments is 100 units.\nA couple of days ago, we reported that Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on an index of ten assets. Bitoasis Resumes Dirham Transactions\nLast month, Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitoasis enacted a suspension of deposits and withdrawals in UAE dirhams. This Monday, without explaining what was the cause of the issue, the company announced that transactions are reinstated. In a letter to its clients, quoted by Arabian Business , Bitoasis apologized for the inconvenience and said that now “users can deposit and withdraw their funds in AED as usual, without any interruption.”\n“In light of the recent inconsistency of service across our payment options, we will be revising and updating the options available to our customers on the platform to ensure continuity of our services,” the Bitoasis statement continued. “We will be notifying our customers with the update on our new payment options soon.” Myetherwallet Attack Blamed on Russian Hackers, Uneducated Users\nMyetherwallet (MEW), the web’s most popular client-side ethereum wallet, has been compromised by a DNS attack on April 24, 2018. Today the team behind the wallet issued a response to the event, further explaining what happened and detailing the steps taken to prevent its reoccurrence.\nThey say that the attack was carried out by a native Russian speaker, which was able to phish only about $150,000 worth of ether from MEW users. They quote Internet Security experts as explaining that the “financial resources required for such an attack likely exceeds the amount of funds taken.”\nThe team added that it is a lack of safety education that led some clients to fall for the fraud. “We hope that from this experience, every single person who interacts with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain will understand how important self-education is. In the end, you and only you are responsible for your security.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news? Is bitcoin going to be the world’s single currency in ten years?

He was questioned in connection with a Rs 2000-crore Bitcoin scam that is being probed into. According to reports, Kundra’s name cropped up when accused Amit Bharadwaj was being interrogated in the case.\nThose dealing with bitcoins worth Rs 1 crore or more were recently sent notices by the Income Tax Department, and the names were also forwarded to ED. A probe was then initiated for possible money laundering and fraud. The nature of Kundra’s questioning is not yet clear. However, it is said that more names of Bollywood celebrities may crop up during further investigations.

His name was last involved in the infamous IPL betting scandal that led him to a life ban from all cricket-related activities. He filed a petition in Supreme Court challenging the decision in March 2018 hoping to revoke the ban. Moreover, the IPL cricket team co-owned by Kundra, Rajasthan Royals, was also banned for two years.\nIn January this year, he was involved in a Twitter war with Sachiin Joshi as they called each other a fraud and the Twitter thread to their fight became quite long. Raj, who launched Indian Poker League last year called Sachiin out over non-payment of dues. While Raj accused Sachiin of owing him Rs 40 lakh, Sachiin accused Raj of rigging the tournament. Their non-stop bickering over the social media platform had become the talking point at that moment.\nWatch this space for more updates… 3:44 pm Topics: Raj Kundra Bitcoin scam Shilpa Shetty summoned by ED Editor's Pick", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shilpa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shahid", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit bharadwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sachin joshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ipl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "income tax department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "varun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T14:19:48.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "290bd16b9d3ea9fe5961283765bff5242aebd037", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdECN6ydOKXLqa5c2esDdn_cTA.8PKS1y22HPnIKSYn1CZke.1H_A9kcSK9jnhLdEKl8HVqBVHGyGb_msoHaU.R3aX0BdYxo29NNYypG0Gow7eXWPa4pjm971CGWadloPoAg.N8DnztXBEqGSouKfFstnfgzOjGfyDA--", "site_full": "www.businesstoday.in", "site": "businesstoday.in", "site_section": "http://www.businesstoday.in/rss/rssstory.jsp?sid=100", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business Today| BIZ WRAP", "title": "ED questions Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra in bitcoin scam", "title_full": "ED questions Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra in bitcoin scam", "published": "2018-06-05T13:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://smedia2.intoday.in/btmt/images/stories/raj-kundra_505_060518034443.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11122, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "290bd16b9d3ea9fe5961283765bff5242aebd037", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdECN6ydOKXLqa5c2esDdn_cTA.8PKS1y22HPnIKSYn1CZke.1H_A9kcSK9jnhLdEKl8HVqBVHGyGb_msoHaU.R3aX0BdYxo29NNYypG0Gow7eXWPa4pjm971CGWadloPoAg.N8DnztXBEqGSouKfFstnfgzOjGfyDA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T13:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "ED questions Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra in bitcoin scam", "text": "ED questions Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra in bitcoin scam BusinessToday.In 22:27 IST\nThe Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday questioned businessman Raj Kundra, husband of Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty, in a bitcoin scam case. Kundra was summoned at the ED office in Mumbai and was asked questions about his involvement in a cryptocurrency trade - which is illegal in India. According to reports, some transactions were linked to Kundra and hence, he was asked to record his statement.\nEarlier, the probe agency had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. It is alleged that about 8,000 investors lost about Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nAccording to reports, Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state.\nThe ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police. The Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier. It was reported that Bhardwaj was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals.\nThe ED has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments.\nIn last few months, multiple cases of cryptocurrency fraud have been reported. This happened despite the Reserve Bank of India and Finance Minister's repeated warnings against the bitcoin trade. Earlier in April, the Central bank directed all regulated entities to stop dealing with individuals and businesses dabbling in virtual currencies.\nThe RBI said that virtual currencies raise concerns of consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering. \"... In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs,\" it said.\nThe RBI's statement came months after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that the government does not consider cryptocurrencies as legal tender and will take all measures to eliminate payments using them. Jaitley had once equated transactions in cryptocurrency to the ponzi scams.\n(With inputs from PTI)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vivek fro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pune police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kolhapur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanded", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T13:36:15.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a303af01e2f2d6b168d4f1f4a5be2723b39fd5b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz8ndnLXQy4mRjiKZvW2o0bo-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-05T13:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a303af01e2f2d6b168d4f1f4a5be2723b39fd5b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz8ndnLXQy4mRjiKZvW2o0bo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T13:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 5, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin price analysis: BTC/USD stays below $7500, as Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak express ...

I don’t want that kind of care in my life.”\nWozniak had an unfortunate experience with Bitcoin when he tried selling seven of the virtual coins to someone who cancelled the credit card transaction before it cleared, defrauding Wozniak. The credit card number turned out to be stolen.\nDorsey’s case for an internet-native currency rests on the inconvenience of the currently fragmented state of online payments. Square, his digital payments firm, allows for Bitcoin transactions.

The initial announcement came out in January when the Brisbane airport authorities announced plans to initiate the procedure of using cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange at all outlets within the airport premises.\nThe airport’s administration has quoted “the reduction of customer inconvenience due to the requirement of carrying multiple currencies and credit cards” as one of the major reasons behind this move. Amidst a period of Bitcoin’s downfall, this step is likely to push the cryptocurrency’s value up again. Last year, Bitcoin peaked out at more than $20,000 per coin, whereas as of now the value sits at roughly $7600.\nThe payment system has been developed by a Brisbane-based fintech startup, TravelbyBit. TravelbyBit reportedly received more than $85000 from a commercialization assistance fund, which helped them develop a system where customers can pay using Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency and merchants can choose which cryptocurrency or real currency they want to receive the money in.\nSpeaking to a local media outlet, the General Manager of Strategic Planning and Development of the airport said that this step has been taken keeping the number of crypto investors worldwide. Furthermore, he added that he’s proud of Brisbane airport for being the first global airport that has worked with a local startup to bring such a service to the table.\nTravelbyBit is also reported to be working on a “tourist map route” that lists all businesses that are currently accepting Bitcoin as a medium of exchange along the way to famous tourist spots in the country.\nCurrently, there are 30 outlets in Brisbane airport that are using the new system. Speaking to the media, the CEO of TravelbyBit commented that they will launch their service throughout the country gradually, wherein the only thing holding them back is the lack of trained staff of retailers.\nHe further added that their initiative can prove to be quite vital in establishing Bitcoin as a method of payment instead of “an asset”, which was a major reason behind Stripe withdrawing support for Bitcoin last year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "monitori", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T13:48:19.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34bf1af0ef6ef60000617ad112b6c56d52b04703", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8sVeYgLNtY4Jt.VIY8yv7rBY6SeqpHCcvF1MufzBz2I_jIKDCpZj2mBOmcTxaAzXEZyJ7Tr3SdPw--", "site_full": "www.visionmp.com", "site": "visionmp.com", "site_section": "http://www.visionmp.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Raj Kundra, husband of Shilpa Shetty, summoned by ED in connection with Bitcoin scam", "title_full": "Raj Kundra, husband of Shilpa Shetty, summoned by ED in connection with Bitcoin scam", "published": "2018-06-05T12:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.visionmp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/raj_kundra.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34bf1af0ef6ef60000617ad112b6c56d52b04703", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8sVeYgLNtY4Jt.VIY8yv7rBY6SeqpHCcvF1MufzBz2I_jIKDCpZj2mBOmcTxaAzXEZyJ7Tr3SdPw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "visionmp", "published": "2018-06-05T12:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Raj Kundra, husband of Shilpa Shetty, summoned by ED in connection with Bitcoin scam", "text": "\nMumbai: Businessman Raj Kundra was summoned and questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) here on Tuesday.

His name reportedly cropped up when Amit Bharadwaj, an accused in the case, was being questioned.\nThe Income Tax Department had recently sent notices to bitcoin users who were dealing in bitcoins worth Rs 1 crore or more daily. These names were also forwarded to ED and a probe into possible money laundering and fraud was initiated. It is learnt that many well-known names – especially those of Bollywood celebrities – may come up during investigations.\nWhile the nature of Kundra’s questioning is not yet clear, he is not new to controversies and was previously embroiled in the infamous IPL betting scandal. He is serving a life ban from all cricket-related activities.

Crypto-currency market. Apple Co-Founder Steve Woznaik Wants Bitcoin the World’s Single Currency Apple Co-Founder Steve Woznaik Wants Bitcoin the World’s Single Currency June 5, 2018\nBitcoin may rise up since a positive statement is rolling out. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak calls bitcoin to serve as the global digital currency. During the discussion with CNBC , Wozniak endorses Bitcoin. His statement goes as a response to the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who claimed Bitcoin to become the Internet’s native currency earlier this year.\nWozniak said, I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.\nThis is not the first time that Apple co-founder caught in crypto media, the tech analyst said blockchain is stronger than both gold and USD. However, he first purchased Bitcoin when the price was $700. Later he sold all his holdings except for one coin and two Ether. By selling this, that he never wanted to be an investor. Holding the only Bitcoin and two Ether, Wozniak intends to analyze the working plethora of cryptocurrency.\nDespite the number of cryptocurrencies, he chooses Bitcoin as a single currency. Moreover, he appeared praising Ethereum at the recent conference in Vienna. According to him, Ethereum has the potential to become “the new Apple”. Bitcoin is Pure – Wozniak encouraged\nFor him, “Bitcoin is something natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions”. He continued adding that,\nBitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just … growing and growing … and surviving,”\nHe sees a strong potential in Bitcoin and said all other virtual currencies tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted.

Reaching into other areas of hidden potential within language use by humans, he has been developing a system of software internet agents (like search engines use) and other proprietary processing methods to predict future events.\nThe software project, begun in 1997, captures near-real-time changes in language patterns within internet discussions. Then, employing radical linguistic techniques of his own devising, he develops a model which anticipates future events with some seeming accuracy. The processing has, at its core, a method of assigning emotional values to complex content and time carry-values to predict changes in future behavior based on how people are using language now.\nSince June 2001 when the work projected a major ‘tipping point’, that is a ‘life-changing event’ with aspects of ‘military and accident’ that would forever change the way we live to occur inside 90 days, the web bot project has continued to give archetype descriptors of future events such as the anthrax attack in Washington, the crash of American 587, the Columbia disaster, the Northeast Power outage, the Banda Aceh earthquake and most recently the flooding of the Red River. As a continuing project, reports are offered from the extracted archetype information at his web site, www.halfpasthuman.com.\nI host the Church of Mabus radio show and it is going on 8 years.

The digital coin fell to an intraday low of $7,474.04 in the afternoon, before experiencing a slight rebound towards the end of the session, which allowed it to finish the day at $7,514.47.\nHowever, Bitcoin saw another downturn in the early hours of today’s trading, sending its price well below the $7,500 area, to an intraday low of $7,397.00. The Bitcoin price has since edged a bit higher and is currently hovering around $7,460, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nMeanwhile, Cboe Global Markets has revealed that its Bitcoin futures product has enjoyed significant interest from investors last week.\n“At the Cboe futures exchange, the bitcoin futures (XBT) contract volume saw a big increase from the previous week,” Peter Lusk, senior instructor at Cboe wrote, as quoted by MarketWatch . “Monday was a U.S. holiday, so the market was closed, but on Tuesday, the front-month contract recorded an all-time high volume, with 8,373 contracts trading that day,” he added.\nThe average daily volume also increased in the shortened week to 5,755 contracts, from 4,490 contracts in the week prior.\nIn December, CBOE became the first major derivatives marketplace operator in the US to offer Bitcoin futures. The company’s Chicago-based rival CME Group followed suit later in the same month.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $7,465.42, as of 10:10 BST. The digital currency has lost 2% of its value in the past 24 hours, Coinmarketcap data shows. The coin’s total market capitalisation currently stands at nearly $127.5 billion.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-begins-the-week-on-a-sour-note-2018-06-04"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cboe global markets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T23:20:48.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26fe4ca66ff79b53a3f22b3d4e75d2ee87925cea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfJpPrM6pqmI76dUbzuCzpq1UmLH_C2PvMv.rWj_vJcJg-", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin pricing trend", "title_full": "Bitcoin pricing trend", "published": "2018-06-05T12:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26fe4ca66ff79b53a3f22b3d4e75d2ee87925cea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfJpPrM6pqmI76dUbzuCzpq1UmLH_C2PvMv.rWj_vJcJg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T12:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin pricing trend", "text": "Bitcoin pricing trend\n/u/HurtlingTurtle\nsubmitted by /u/HurtlingTurtle\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:27:27.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d429c62ce9db7576a6e10ab14f7b40cfecd7e711", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.slU54msvIVc83IhzV_eGkr3u5iA2kQclFiHevKQA4HBB", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin pricing trend", "title_full": "Bitcoin pricing trend", "published": "2018-06-05T12:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d429c62ce9db7576a6e10ab14f7b40cfecd7e711", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.slU54msvIVc83IhzV_eGkr3u5iA2kQclFiHevKQA4HBB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T12:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin pricing trend", "text": "Bitcoin pricing trend\n/u/HurtlingTurtle\nsubmitted by /u/HurtlingTurtle\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:27:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf4313268c80ec330afa08213e3c16c67e719b62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKKyIkA2j5ihp8n.CyJlkCk0clEaJXcYSsqC4al_VP9KoxOY5.gJyDxuy1GpqtdpWr3JqkUbnit90-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com", "site": "freelancer.com", "site_section": "https://www.freemarket.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["job_search", "hobbies_and_interests", "jobs", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freemarket.com -

Reuters\nLONDON — Renowned short seller Jim Chanos thinks cryptocurrencies are a product of the run-away global bull market and have little use beyond avoiding tax.\nChanos, known for predicting the collapse of Enron, addressed the topic of cryptocurrencies in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking.\nChanos, who runs New York-based Kynikos Associates, said investors are getting “a little bit jiggy with their capital” and are more “willing to take risks, willing to believe things” the longer the current bull market goes on.\n“So today we’ve got bitcoin and ICOs [initial coin offerings], which went ballistic in 2017,” Chanos said. “I suspect going forward we’re going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging.”\nAdvertisement\n“We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate. I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that,” he said.\nChanos expressed scepticism about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. Huge amounts of capital flowed into the sector last year, which peaked at over $800 billion in value in December.\nBitcoin’s original enthusiasts were drawn to the fact that the cryptocurrency was independent of any nation state or central bank, making it theoretically immune from things like quantitative easing. They also argued that its independence made it a more viable long-term currency.\nChanos said: “For those who believe it’s a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you’re going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it — for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!”\nThe interviewer then suggested bitcoin is a “libertarian fantasy,” to which Chanos replied: “That’s exactly what it is. And if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.”\nAdvertisement\nHe added: “Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.\n“This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy. Someone at Grant’s interest rate conference recently said that it was as if we had intentionally created a ‘monetary Somalia’.”\nYou can read the full interview here.
