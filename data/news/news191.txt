His forums have allegedly involved about 1,300,000 users from around the world, leading to massive fraud.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture\nStealing Even From the Moon\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant established the forums in 2008 and managed them until his arrest at the beginning of the month. The entrance to the forums was free of charge, but users could purchase a VIP status to receive stolen details of \"fresh\" credit cards, which are more likely to be still working. Additionally he published manuals and guides that provided information and tools on how to commit various computer offenses, remotely hacking computers and taking over remote computers or servers.\nHalmi also allegedly committed crimes of fraud against users of his own forums. The defendant would offer selling cell phones at discounted prices, but once a user transferred him money he would block the user from the site and take his money without providing compensation. He would then publish a message, supposedly in the name of the deceived user, in which he thanked the defendant for providing the cheap mobile phone.\nApparently trying to convince investigators his actions were not motivated by specific malice towards Israelis, many of which were his alleged victims, Halmi is quoted as saying: \"We are thieves, from wherever we can take money, we will take it – it does not matter where, from Israel, the US or even the moon, we will reach it and use it.\"\n1,071 BTC Seized According to the indictment, the defendant demanded that all payments to him be made through Bitcoin, to make it more difficult to locate him. In addition, Halmi acted consistently to disguise his identity by technological means, made many money transfers between different Bitcoin wallets for the purpose of covering his tracks, used online masking services to distance himself from his various accounts, and recorded parts of his property in the name of his relatives.\nThe Israeli State Prosecutor's Office attributes to the defendant money laundering of at least 1,071 BTC, estimated at NIS 31,000,000. During the interrogation, in a precedent-setting move, the defendant's Bitcoin wallet was seized and the amount found in it was transferred to a police wallet. The State Prosecutor's Office intends to confiscate all the contents of the defendant's Bitcoin wallets, if and when he is convicted. The case was investigated by investigators of the Israeli national cyber unit at Lahav 433.\nThe offenses with which Halmi is charged are: credit card fraud under aggravated circumstances (multiple offenses), receiving a thing fraudulently under aggravated circumstances, providing means for committing a crime, violating the Computers Law and money laundering.\nWhat should be the punishment for such an alleged crime?

There are 35 pending and completed enforcement actions nationwide since the beginning of May.\nMillennials are viewed as potential targets, as are consumers who are embracing products related to financial technology, or fintech.\nRegulators said millennials are both most likely to use fintech products (84%) and most at risk of fraud relating to some fintech schemes (41%), according to a survey released by the North American Securities Administrators Association in February.\nICOs and cryptocurrencies are viewed as high risks for fraud.\nInitial coin offerings are fund-raising programs that could be used to kick off a new cryptocurrency effort. But some of the ICOs can be nothing but frauds where con artists keep the cash.\nEven offerings that are legitimate should be viewed as highly risky.\n\"Not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution,\" said Joe Borg, president of the the North American Securities Administrators Association.\nWhy are people ponying up money after repeated warnings about the dangers of ICOs?\n\"People are afraid to miss out on the latest and the greatest,\" Borg said in a press conference on Monday in Washington, D.C.\nMany times, retirees and others can fall for these schemes because they're trying to make up for lost time and rebuild underfunded nest eggs, said Borg, who is the Alabama Securities Commission Director.\nSome consumers who never recovered from the stock market crash in 2008-09 can be lured into sending money — even using digital currency — on nothing but the promise of quick, sizable returns.\nRegulators said \"Operation Cryptosweep\" has uncovered roughly 30,000 domain names relating to cryptotocurrency. Many were registered in the past year as the price of Bitcoin went bonkers.\nBitcoin — which had been valued around $1,400 in early May 2017 — rose above $19,000 by December.\nBitcoin has since dropped significantly in value to around $8,400 on May 21 but the buzz continues to build.\nIn some cases, fraudulent websites have used photos of popular personalities. The Texas State Securities Board shut down one initial coin offering site in early May that regulators claim used photos of Jennifer Aniston and other celebrities as part of fake endorsements.\nJoe Rotunda, NASAA Enforcement Section vice chair and director of Enforcement for the Texas State Securities Board, said fraudsters often use false claims that a well-known public figure or a celebrity is associated with an initial offering as a way to encourage potential investors to send money.\nOne fraudulent effort, he said, even used a photo of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to sell cryptocurrency.\nRead more:\nBe wary of Bitcoin mania; risks still exist\nWall Street fear index carries heavy risk\nSome signs of a scam: Promoters promise lucrative returns tied to cryptocurrencies but manipulate photographs, possibly using stock photos available elsewhere online, in seemingly professional, polished presentations online.\nChristopher Gerold, NASAA Enforcement section chair and New Jersey Securities bureau chief, said state regulators used some old-fashioned detective work, including undercover tactics, to try to address the proliferation of cryptocurrency schemes.\nGerold said most, if not all, promoters do not have the proper licenses for selling such investments.\nMichigan consumers are encouraged to contact the state Securities and Commercial Licensing Bureau, which can run a registration check on any investment adviser, broker-dealer, professional, or product.

That's about as much power as the entire country of Ireland uses in energy — and it's expected to reach the same consumption level as Austria. In the next six months, we may see bitcoin using as much electricity as a major industrialized nation. At this point, mining bitcoin requires such intensive, specific hardware that the only way for most people to get in on the crypto game is to simply purchase the coin via an exchange. But that doesn’t mean mining has slowed down. Rather, the opposite has been happening, giving environmentalists (and anyone but the most adamant cryptobros) cause for concern.\nBetween cooling fans, manufacturing hardware, and the outrageous, ever-rising energy costs needed to operate a bitcoin mining rig, the world’s bitcoin network is expected to use as much as 7.67 gigawatts of power by the end of 2018, according to new research and models . That’s one two-hundredth of all the electricity used on the planet. And that’s terrible.

His forums have allegedly involved about 1,300,000 users from around the world, leading to massive fraud.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture Stealing Even From the Moon\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant established the forums in 2008 and managed them until his arrest at the beginning of the month. The entrance to the forums was free of charge, but users could purchase a VIP status to receive stolen details of “fresh” credit cards, which are more likely to be still working. Additionally he published manuals and guides that provided information and tools on how to commit various computer offenses, remotely hacking computers and taking over remote computers or servers.\nHalmi also allegedly committed crimes of fraud against users of his own forums. The defendant would offer selling cell phones at discounted prices, but once a user transferred him money he would block the user from the site and take his money without providing compensation. He would then publish a message, supposedly in the name of the deceived user, in which he thanked the defendant for providing the cheap mobile phone.\nApparently trying to convince investigators his actions were not motivated by specific malice towards Israelis, many of which were his alleged victims, Halmi is quoted as saying: “We are thieves, from wherever we can take money, we will take it – it does not matter where, from Israel, the US or even the moon, we will reach it and use it.” 1,071 BTC Seized\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant demanded that all payments to him be made through Bitcoin, to make it more difficult to locate him.

As of now the question should be the effect of altcoin on bitcoin since many coins now are appearing and the market is now crowded.\nBut if you properly see the fiat currency trading in altcoins then their is more fluctuations in fiat trading in altcoins then in bitcoins. So now i think users are now mostly trading in fiat currency in altcoins. So i think bitcoin affect is getting less as now cryptocurrency are even traded through fiat currency.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:34:54.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38b986e3bfc7912782be562539f5452fa0eea5c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va74_0Y1ClSYztsmopIjVltqkZdnDpIsItYZmmPhKCiSftGre3mad1DGZJt.gLXIjxmoMiBhdO1kt4HIvGR2jTTV8MnWu81M7.CM8vYHA6oPkuEsCsEzEJRXk-", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "What is the significance of Bitcoin Pizza Day, and when is it celebrated?", "title_full": "What is the significance of Bitcoin Pizza Day, and when is it celebrated?", "published": "2018-05-22T00:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "38b986e3bfc7912782be562539f5452fa0eea5c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va74_0Y1ClSYztsmopIjVltqkZdnDpIsItYZmmPhKCiSftGre3mad1DGZJt.gLXIjxmoMiBhdO1kt4HIvGR2jTTV8MnWu81M7.CM8vYHA6oPkuEsCsEzEJRXk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Murch", "published": "2018-05-22T00:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is the significance of Bitcoin Pizza Day, and when is it celebrated?", "text": "up vote 1 down vote\nBitcoin Pizza Day commemorates Laszlo's purchase of two pizzas in exchange of 10,000 BTC (about $41 then).

In fact, every transaction consists of a top-level message call which in turn can create further message calls.\nAny company offering completely free trials, particularly if they require payment info, is most likely a scam. You just need to purchase a sum of Hash Rate. Since miners utilize a substantial quantity of electricity, you wish to get one that converts the most quantity of power into bitcoins. The aforementioned graph summarizes the entire quantity of funding raised by the Bitcoin companies founded in a particular calendar year. The success of a particular coin bitcoin is dependent on the strength of cloud community it creates. To find that massive market cap, it needed to be viewed as cloud-mining-profit an exceptional store of value, thus the financial modeling imitating historical successes.

Nearly 680,000 contracts have been traded since the launch across five settlements, representing a notional value of more than $6.85 billion. The most recent settlement price was $8.238.49. That’s all good news, but volume growth on the XBT futures exchange hasn’t been monumental. As well, Bitcoin pricing hasn’t exactly exploded either.\nStill, in late April the CBOE saw its highest-ever trading volume for futures contracts. During the same period, CBOE announced they want to lower their Bitcoin futures increments on contracts from 10 points ($10) to 5 points ($5). A letter proposing this rule amendment was sent to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on April 17, with the intention that it would go into effect sometime on or after May 1, though the final decision has not yet been announced.\nThough the new amendment would only impact single transactions, it’s still a significant move. Dong Yanfgan, co-founder of ZAN Chain says the effect of reducing BTC’s increment price per future contract should increase market participation and improve competition. He notes that the decision for CBOE to initiate this change was supported by the data collected by the company since the contract was launched in December. ”I believe the effect of reducing BTC’s increment price per future contract should increase market participation and improve competition. That is the main purpose of CFE to promote this change,” says Yangfan.\nMathias Goldmann, advisor to Constellation, a horizontally scalable platform protocol, points out that CBOE Bitcoin futures have not seen as much trading volume, nor garnered as much attention as some would have hoped when futures trading in the most popular cryptocurrency first started.\n“Trading volume ranges between 50-100m USD daily. Given that the total BTC marketcap is roughly $145 billion and today’s BTC trading volume alone is $6.6 billion, this number is quite small. Compared to the S&P futures daily trade volume, BTC futures only have less than 5% of that trade volume on the CBOE.”\nGoldmann believes lowering the minimum increments serves two purposes: Pricing becomes more accurate and thus moves closer to the underlying asset’s own price. Which in turn leads to more precise price discovery. He speculates that this request may have come from institutional players hoping to narrow the price increments.\n“Most established future pricing increments range across cents (e.g 5, 25,50 cents). For comparison, on older and more established BTC futures exchanges like Bitmex and Okcoin, BTC futures are already priced in 1 USD increments. Generally tighter price increments means a lower spread. That will likely attract new participants and money in the BTC futures market.”\nTransparency, Liquidity, Efficient Pricing\nLowering the Bitcoin futures entry point may also push the price higher in the short-term points out Gabriele Giancola, co-founder and CEO of blockchain-powered loyalty ecosystem qiibee , However, the longer term impact on prices is harder to predict, he says. Nevertheless, a boost in Bitcoin prices, even over the shorter time, will further push its acceptance as a valid asset class.\nSuccessful Bitcoin futures trading that takes place via regulated—and trusted—public exchanges gives people who were previously skeptical about the lack of regulation the confidence to invest.\nThere’s also the belief that Bitcoin futures provide transparency, liquidity and efficient pricing to the sector, enabling investors to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without actually having to own the cryptocurrency itself. While Bitcoin remains unregulated, Bitcoin futures can be traded on regulated exchanges, which is good news for those concerned about the risks related to the industry’s still fluid regulation.\nIt’s Giancola’s view that long-term future pricing options have been touted as a vote of confidence for the virtual currency economy, potentially paving the way for lower market volatility, which would further increase investment over time. So, the CBOE’s move to lower the Bitcoin futures increment is actually quite a significant step towards ensuring that Bitcoin becomes more widely accepted.\nNot everyone agrees though. Rob May, CEO of BotChain, a decentralized identity registry for bots, says it’s too soon to gauge the significance of this move, particularly in terms of industry-wide impact. However, he sees the request for reduction of minimum increments as a reflection of the industry’s rapidly growing market liquidity.\nStill a Learning Curve Eiland Glover, CEO and co-founder of Kowala, an autonomously stabilized cryptocurrency, also believes this change should increase trading. As Glover sees it, the CBOE is still learning about its own new product. Since their futures trading product was just launched in December, CBOE is likely still gathering data even as they continue fine tuning the details. It would be expected that they’ll continue reviewing results in order to see what still needs to be altered.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://qiibee.com/", "https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/filings/ptc/18/04/ptc041718cfedcm001.pdf", "http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cboe-conducts-may-settlement-of-cboe-bitcoin-futures/", "https://www.zanchain.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cboe global markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T16:20:13.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82e02031edd027419dba1cff25f8f5d4ed4c601c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA7fS1gD7_R4TANyktPXV0bfEGzwcdQw3r13HmXJNhJAkn9EH1ESfPo5rhtLS0QKNJTR06tcuKTsEQmGBjqf1uWIawRUxp.psxzib4T4WeJe3YDA3LOaXAXJd6qOcPeLwN8WNc7DAJ6zT3e_ss2cmFeQ--", "site_full": "www.forbes.com", "site": "forbes.com", "site_section": "http://www.forbes.com/real-time/feed2/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forbes Real Time", "title": "Bitcoin Won't Encourage Cryptocurrency For Real Estate, But Cryptoeconomics Will", "title_full": "Bitcoin Won't Encourage Cryptocurrency For Real Estate, But Cryptoeconomics Will", "published": "2018-05-22T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F1073648201%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 208, "comments": 0, "shares": 208}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82e02031edd027419dba1cff25f8f5d4ed4c601c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA7fS1gD7_R4TANyktPXV0bfEGzwcdQw3r13HmXJNhJAkn9EH1ESfPo5rhtLS0QKNJTR06tcuKTsEQmGBjqf1uWIawRUxp.psxzib4T4WeJe3YDA3LOaXAXJd6qOcPeLwN8WNc7DAJ6zT3e_ss2cmFeQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rachel Wolfson", "published": "2018-05-22T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Won't Encourage Cryptocurrency For Real Estate, But Cryptoeconomics Will", "text": "As Bitcoin enters the mainstream economy, a number of homebuyers and sellers are starting to use the cryptocurrency to conduct real estate transactions.

Moreover, the token economics approach in the real estate industry is also intended to incentivize title “miners” and government agencies adoption, encouraging widespread use of digital tokens for every participant involved in the process. .\nFor example, the state of Vermont just announced the launch of a pilot project with Propy to utilize blockchain technology to record real estate conveyance documents. The pilot demonstrates how blockchain technology can secure real estate transactions by storing land management data across a blockchain-based network.\nThe announcement of a pilot project to utilize blockchain technology in real estate transactions is emblematic of Vermont’s long history of innovating business, insurance, and financial technology. We are fortunate to have a cutting-edge statutory framework that enables the use of blockchain technology, and we will continue to work with the legislature to ensure Vermont remains at the forefront of these innovations, said Michael Schirling, the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary.\nMoreover, blockchain’s growing presence in the real estate industry can provide a solution for creating more efficient cross-border transactions. Between 2009 and 2016, demand for cross-border real estate transactions increased from $65 billion to $217 billion. Chinese citizens are currently among the largest groups of foreign investors in the U.S. real estate market, owning over $28 billion in U.S. residential properties. However, the total value of the U.S. residential real estate market is over $29 trillion. Foreign investment in the U.S. residential sector could potentially be equal to hundreds of billions of dollars if foreign investors were able to conduct real estate transactions online.\nWhile the use of Bitcoin for real estate transactions is certainly gaining traction, an incentive based approach for using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology within the real estate industry will drive adoption moving forward. Cryptoeconomics demonstrates the real-world value that blockchain technology can bring to the real estate industry, which in turn will lead to the mainstream use of cryptocurrencies being applied to conduct real estate transactions. In the meantime, adoption will continue to progress slowly.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.housingwire.com/articles/41352-texas-brokerage-closes-states-first-ever-bitcoin-home-purchase", "https://tokensale.propy.com/", "https://propy.com/property/5aea694419b0090ec40518cc/featured", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-vermont-city-tests-blockchain-technology-for-property-deals-1517351207", "https://www.ethereum.org/foundation", "https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/198667-0"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "southeby’s international realty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canter companies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T19:32:40.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a604c3dae7de0972227e218e36308b14f317ad35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCWNISscUZnvRy1hWGkVpdzY5etKIvUe_6O3L8moYU7LrUNMPn6S0m8JWHNWcDb1jCn_PMUfXe.selyJibEB9Nc3k8n561uJ4l", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture", "published": "2018-05-21T23:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526908113_10488218.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a604c3dae7de0972227e218e36308b14f317ad35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCWNISscUZnvRy1hWGkVpdzY5etKIvUe_6O3L8moYU7LrUNMPn6S0m8JWHNWcDb1jCn_PMUfXe.selyJibEB9Nc3k8n561uJ4l", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T23:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture", "text": "5 hours ago International Bitcoin.com 78 The upcoming implementation of a major regulatory push by the European Union to control how companies can operate on the Internet has killed another venture in the cryptocurrency sphere. This story, astrology-based financial investment, and many more feature in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief. Also Read: Marvel, The Simpsons Go Crypto Parity Shuts Down ICO Passport Service The team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check. The reason for the closure is a new EU dictate called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is meant to bring a new set of “digital rights” for EU citizens and guard their personal data. The regulation that will come into force this Friday has already killed other services in the crypto space such as the P2P exchange Cointouch and has forced others to change the way they do business such as Localbitcoins . The Parity team explained that: “GDPR creates new and untested challenges when storing personal information on the blockchain. These challenges make running a service like PICOPS more difficult. We are looking at ways of resolving the uncertainty and making PICOPS compliant with GDPR while keeping it useful. However, as things stand, the solutions we have identified restrict the service to a very limited set of features. Because of this, the significant resources required to make PICOPS GDPR-compliant, and the fact that PICOPS is not part of our core technology stack, we have decided to discontinue the service, despite overwhelming market needs and demand.” Indian Ban Case Shifts to Supreme Court The Supreme Court of India has taken over the cases of Coin Recoil and others challenging the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) ban on local banks from dealing with bitcoin companies. The n ext hearing of this now combined case is planned for July 20, 2018. Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co., commented: “The Supreme Court has recently transferred the entire batch of petitions pending at High Court level with respect to the contentious issue of RBI effectively banning transactions in cryptocurrencies. This decision highlights the importance of this issue at a national level from not just a legal, but also an economic standpoint. We strongly believe that the RBI’s circular to effectively discourage the business of cryptocurrency exchanges is an arbitrary decision against the freedom of the right to trade guaranteed by the Constitution. We are hopeful that justice will be meted out at the Supreme Court level.” Written in the Stars Astrology-based financial investment is apparently a thing, and many practitioners are using it to navigate the tumultuous seas of the cryptocurrency markets. This is according to a Marketwatch report that cited a number of astro-investors and even a professional astro-analyst talking about the practice as well as their predictions. This matter came into the forefront recently after ex-NFL star Ricky Williams shared his use of the of study of celestial objects with CNBC . “When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight. The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus,” he explained. Roboforex to Compete with Wallets Roboforex, an IFSC (International Financial Services Commission of Belize) licensed financial firm offering crypto CFDs , has introduced a new service for its clients to buy BTC with fiat directly from the broker. The company believes that its regulated status will convince users to use their accounts over existing wallets. Denis Golomedov, Chief Marketing Officer at Roboforex, said: “Providing the ability for clients to deposit into their accounts in Bitcoin is not only an additional service, which expands clients’ opportunities, but also a standalone product, which significantly dominates over its market counterparts. Security has become very significant issue recently, as more and more information appears about hacking cryptocurrency exchanges and stealing users’ assets. Using the cryptocurrency is much more convenient and safer for clients within the framework of their trading and investment activities, using products and services provided by a regulated broker”.

Government authorities and Regulators are doing everything possible to reduce the occurrence of these nefarious acts by criminals. Hackers and scammers are flooding the crypto industry, with almost every hacker now focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum . The increased crypto-related criminal activities could be one of the reasons why many influential personalities are against the rise of cryptocurrencies. According to a post by Bill Harris, the founding CEO of PayPal and Personal Capital, “cryptocurrency is best suited for one use – criminal activity.” This is because transactions can be anonymous thereby making it difficult task for law enforcement agents to trace those who buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Recently, an advertising firm was suspended by the Bureau of Meteorology following an ad that is connected to a scam report about Bitcoin that was displayed on the official website in January and February respectively. Both scandals that link the Australian weather bureau firm to cryptocurrency are being said to be a mere coincidence. However, the firm’s offices in Melbourne were later raided by law enforcement agents from the Australian federal police in February over allegations that two of the company’s staff were using the company’s supercomputers to mine cryptocurrencies. The Bureau of Meteorology director, Dr. Andrew Johnson, told a Senate hearing of the case on Monday that there was ”no connection whatsoever” between both events. He said that the probe into data mining by the ads firm had been going on for long before the Australian federal police decided to go into action in February. But he was unable to give answers to the questions raised by the Center Alliance senator about the progress that has been recorded so far from the investigation. Dr. Johnson confirmed that the advertising company responsible for the fraudulent ads in January and February is still suspended because of the concern of its ability to stop such activity from reoccurring in the future. The ads are connected to a news story concerning Tesla boss Elon musk about a bogus CNN look-alike website which connects users to scam most bitcoin sites. He further said that it was a consistent battle against those that have malicious intent but that the Federal Bureau of Meteorology used a four-phase review policy to help monitor adverts from other organizations. The website generates about $4 million annually from advertisements. The post Australian Weather Bureau Linked To Two Bitcoin Scams appeared first on CryptoPotato .

Redditors have thronged the thread trying to crack the code and win the prize. The post is currently one of the trending topics on the Bitcoin subreddit. Details of the Puzzle The puzzle is an image with words, numbers, the Bitcoin logo, and other symbols. Within the image are possible clues. Most users on Reddit seem to believe the clues reveal the seed key or the private key of the Bitcoin wallet containing the 1 BTC prize. Others think that the solution is based on color while some think that the “notdef glyph” adjacent to the Bitcoin logo is of particular significance. As part of the puzzle, the poster offered the following message: This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry. The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work. Cryptogreetings also promised to provide helpful hints to that will help people solve the puzzle. So far, seven tips have been released. There are also consolation prizes to be won in addition to the 1 BTC prize. Cryptogreetings also provided the BTC address of the prize for authenticity. So far, no one has been able to crack the code. Some people have put forward different approaches, but it appears nobody is any closer to solving the puzzle. The consensus on the Reddit thread is that the puzzle is especially difficult with one user joking that he/she was better equipped “to sell a kidney for $9K” than to solve the picture puzzle. Coded Art-themed Puzzles are Becoming a Bitcoin Trend Puzzles hidden in artwork predate the emergence of Bitcoin . Grand art masters of hallowed antiquity usually incorporated coded messages in their works, many of which remain unsolved today. For a technology built on cryptography, it is not surprising to see coded crypto-themed artworks becoming a trend. Earlier in the year, a couple finally solved a three-year-old Bitcoin puzzle, claiming the 5 BTC prize that was worth $50,000 at the time. Will you attempt to solve the visual puzzle?

The RSK project is continuing the legacy of Bitcoin pioneers by building Turing-complete smart-contract capabilities for the Bitcoin blockchain. By partnering with iExec, RSK pushes these capabilities further by allowing its decentralized applications to access on-demand and scalable cloud computing resources. Smart contracts are coming to Bitcoin The world of smart contracts has emerged in recent years and is disrupting how modern business and trade are conducted across the globe. These self-executing virtual agreements have been popularized by Ethereum, but developers quickly saw the potential to enable them on the most famous blockchain platform as well: Bitcoin. While the traditional purpose of Bitcoin is to establish itself as a payment alternative, the developers under RSK aim at adding value and functionality to its ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, near instant payments and higher scalability. RSK is therefore the first general purpose smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin network. The RSK platform uses Bitcoin as its native currency, thanks to a 2-Way Peg system that ensures a fixed conversion between BTC and SBTC (1 SBTC = 1 BTC). iExec’s smart contracts deployed on RSK Meanwhile, iExec is developing the first blockchain-based decentralized cloud computing network. This marketplace allows participants who need computing power to meet those who own computing power, thus supporting the most compute-intensive blockchain applications. iExec’s technology relies on Ethereum smart contracts and allows the building of a virtual cloud infrastructure that provides high-performance computing services on demand. However, decentralized apps will ultimately rely on the execution of multiple smart contracts, across multiple blockchains, which has led iExec to adopt a blockchain-agnostic stance. RSK will allow developers around the globe to create decentralized personal and corporate solutions that work in the safest and most popular blockchain protocol, with low transaction costs that fit an ample range of needs. For these reasons, iExec has successfully deployed its V1 smart contracts on RSK as well. This SDK allows developers to build applications that will benefit from scalable and free cloud computing capabilities. The next steps of the partnership On May 29, 2018, iExec will release its V2, the most-awaited component of iExec. This release consists of a decentralized marketplace for trading cloud resources and marks the very beginning of the possibility of monetizing one’s cloud resources in a peer-to-peer market. Once V2 is made compatible with RSK as a next milestone, RSK applications and their smart contracts will be able to access the same decentralized cloud that Ethereum dapps make use of. Compute-intensive applications in the fields of fintech, artificial intelligence, scientific research or gaming will be able to leverage these resources, making RSK and iExec the backbone of the Bitcoin ecosystem. About RSK RSK is the first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merge-mining, allowing them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution. RSK goal is to add value and functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts, near instant payments and higher-scalability. About iExec iExec aims to decentralize the cloud computing market by building the future of the Internet infrastructure. We are developing the first blockchain cloud computing platform, to support the most compute-intensive applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, big data, fintech, cryptography, or 3D

The RSK project is continuing the legacy of Bitcoin pioneers by building Turing-complete smart-contract capabilities for the Bitcoin blockchain. By partnering with iExec, RSK pushes these capabilities further by allowing its decentralized applications to access on-demand and scalable cloud computing resources. Smart contracts are coming to Bitcoin The world of smart contracts has emerged in recent years and is disrupting how modern business and trade are conducted across the globe. These self-executing virtual agreements have been popularized by Ethereum, but developers quickly saw the potential to enable them on the most famous blockchain platform as well: Bitcoin. While the traditional purpose of Bitcoin is to establish itself as a payment alternative, the developers under RSK aim at adding value and functionality to its ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, near instant payments and higher scalability. RSK is therefore the first general purpose smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin network. The RSK platform uses Bitcoin as its native currency, thanks to a 2-Way Peg system that ensures a fixed conversion between BTC and SBTC (1 SBTC = 1 BTC). iExec’s smart contracts deployed on RSK Meanwhile, iExec is developing the first blockchain-based decentralized cloud computing network. This marketplace allows participants who need computing power to meet those who own computing power, thus supporting the most compute-intensive blockchain applications. iExec’s technology relies on Ethereum smart contracts and allows the building of a virtual cloud infrastructure that provides high-performance computing services on demand. However, decentralized apps will ultimately rely on the execution of multiple smart contracts, across multiple blockchains, which has led iExec to adopt a blockchain-agnostic stance. RSK will allow developers around the globe to create decentralized personal and corporate solutions that work in the safest and most popular blockchain protocol, with low transaction costs that fit an ample range of needs. For these reasons, iExec has successfully deployed its V1 smart contracts on RSK as well. This SDK allows developers to build applications that will benefit from scalable and free cloud computing capabilities. The next steps of the partnership On May 29, 2018, iExec will release its V2, the most-awaited component of iExec. This release consists of a decentralized marketplace for trading cloud resources and marks the very beginning of the possibility of monetizing one’s cloud resources in a peer-to-peer market. Once V2 is made compatible with RSK as a next milestone, RSK applications and their smart contracts will be able to access the same decentralized cloud that Ethereum dapps make use of. Compute-intensive applications in the fields of fintech, artificial intelligence, scientific research or gaming will be able to leverage these resources, making RSK and iExec the backbone of the Bitcoin ecosystem. About RSK RSK is the first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merge-mining, allowing them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution. RSK goal is to add value and functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts, near instant payments and higher-scalability. About iExec iExec aims to decentralize the cloud computing market by building the future of the Internet infrastructure.

In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.”\nDavis argued that bitcoin should not be classified as money, because although it could qualify as a unit of account and medium of exchange it is not an effective store of value. Moreover, he said that its current valuation is based purely on speculation rather than economic fundamentals.\nQuote: :\n“The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use.”\nHe further warned investors against allocating even a small percentage of their assets to bitcoin, as this will reduce their exposure to “tried and true asset classes” in favor of an asset class whose investment case is “hardly compelling.”\n“As innovation quickens and competition increases, the majority of networks (and their associated cryptocurrencies) may be rendered obsolete, leaving many cryptocurrencies like tulip bulbs in 17th-century Holland—soaring to incredible heights before the speculative bubble pops,” he said, parroting a common-but-dubious analogy. “And, unlike tulips, they don’t look very nice in a vase.”\nDavis isn’t the first Vanguard executive to disparage bitcoin as an investment and cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Last year, Vanguard Group founder John Bogle advised investors to “avoid bitcoin like the plague” since it has no underlying rate of return. “When it gets back to $100, we’ll talk,” he said.\nOther asset managers, however, are beginning to warm to the nascent cryptocurrency industry. Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch a bitcoin trading operation , and even JPMorgan — whose CEO, Jamie Dimon, has long been one of bitcoin’s most outspoken opponents — may soon help its clients invest in cryptocurrency.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nThe post ‘Decent Probability’ Bitcoin Price Goes to Zero: Vanguard Economist appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "",

According to a letter published today in the energy journal Joule by financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, the Bitcoin network is consuming roughly 2.55 gigawatts annually, at the absolute minimum. To put that in context, that’s nearly the same amount of energy consumed by the entirety of Ireland. That’s just the conservative current estimate; De Vries predicts that by December, the Bitcoin network could be using almost triple that.\nBitcoins cost energy to “mine,” because mining is just a computer running calculations; the longer Bitcoin is around, the more energy it takes to mine each subsequent unit (it takes four times as much energy to mine a single Bitcoin now as it did when the currency launched in 2009). There is a finite amount of Bitcoin, and the most recent projections show it will take about another 120 years to mine all 21 million Bitcoins. There is also, theoretically, a tipping point somewhere in there where the amount of energy it takes to mine a piece of Bitcoin is more valuable than the Bitcoin itself, though it all depends on the market value. But Bitcoin transactions, not just mining, require electricity (one transaction could currently power a home for a week ), so the more widely used it is, the more carbon we are pumping into the atmosphere.\nThere’s been a considerable amount of debate over the last couple of years surrounding the extent of the energy impact of Bitcoin (for instance, is it pretty bad , or r eally really bad ?), not least because energy use in most parts of the world contributes carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change. But in the wake of Bitcoin’s wild valuation ride throughout most of 2017 up to nearly $20,000 per coin, cryptocurrency mining doesn’t seem likely to slow down anytime soon. Researchers need concrete answers before it becomes far too late enact institutional restrictions and regulations on the practice, writes De Vries.\nDe Vries’ figure doesn’t even include the energy expenditures of other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Ripple . The altcoin market’s potential for comparably sky-high energy consumption levels is unfortunately all too serious. According to the Digiconomist’s Ethereum Energy Consumption Index (which is technically still in beta), Ethereum production already makes up .09 percent of the world’s total energy consumption. While this may seem like a relatively small amount, it’s not. It’s already more than the total yearly energy consumption of countries like Iceland, Jordan, and Cuba. And given that Ethereum is only just getting started (ugh), this figure will likely only rise. [ more ]\nBitcoin is consuming as much energy as the country of Ireland\nABSTRACT: The electricity that is expended in the process of mining Bitcoin has become a topic of heavy debate over the past few years. It is a process that makes Bitcoin extremely energy-hungry by design, as the currency requires a huge amount of hash calculations for its ultimate goal of processing financial transactions without intermediaries (peer-to-peer). The primary fuel for each of these calculations is electricity. The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts). Economic models tell us that Bitcoin's electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.\nBitcoin's Growing Energy Problem ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paris martineau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:35:09.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "631b91d3cbbd692bf00998f1a83fa9b5459d2ddb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSqNuCiWPP_kFHbfXWpTWnVc4_XUsjbqfk.7IESSu_kbq9B8hXLnB2YFK8sSTzZHY7Q1GSV8_UOKoYLjGkxiPUL0PApDMBDid4K7LBJ5RbCDQ5jWbmoEgqggPI3B4bOWlHZNjY4JvMl5594MJ9KU35PMwo0hd_rAYw-", "site_full": "justbitcoinnews.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://justbitcoinnews.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation – JUST BITCOIN NEWS", "title": "The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation", "title_full": "The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation", "published": "2018-05-21T23:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "631b91d3cbbd692bf00998f1a83fa9b5459d2ddb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSqNuCiWPP_kFHbfXWpTWnVc4_XUsjbqfk.7IESSu_kbq9B8hXLnB2YFK8sSTzZHY7Q1GSV8_UOKoYLjGkxiPUL0PApDMBDid4K7LBJ5RbCDQ5jWbmoEgqggPI3B4bOWlHZNjY4JvMl5594MJ9KU35PMwo0hd_rAYw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JUST BITCOIN NEWS", "published": "2018-05-21T23:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation", "text": "As reported earlier by The New York Times (NYT) and Bitcoin Magazine, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is developing an online trading platform that would allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly.

Speaking then on the CNBC channel, he presented another aspect of the use of cryptobodies, speaking of “another version of human behavior.\nIt’s glamorous (for people). It is more psychological than something that could be explained by the IT department. ” Of course, he admitted that some investors have won a lot of money from the digital coinage.

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the content below.\nLyon, France, May 21, 2018: The RSK project is continuing the legacy of Bitcoin pioneers by building Turing-complete smart-contract capabilities for the Bitcoin blockchain. By partnering with iExec, RSK pushes these capabilities further by allowing its decentralized applications to access on-demand and scalable cloud computing resources. Smart contracts are coming to Bitcoin\nThe world of smart contracts has emerged in recent years and is disrupting how modern business and trade are conducted across the globe. These self-executing virtual agreements have been popularized by Ethereum, but developers quickly saw the potential to enable them on the most famous blockchain platform as well: Bitcoin.\nWhile the traditional purpose of Bitcoin is to establish itself as a payment alternative, the developers under RSK aim at adding value and functionality to its ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, near instant payments and higher scalability.\nRSK is therefore the first general purpose smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin network. The RSK platform uses Bitcoin as its native currency, thanks to a 2-Way Peg system that ensures a fixed conversion between BTC and SBTC (1 SBTC = 1 BTC). iExec’s smart contracts deployed on RSK\nMeanwhile, iExec is developing the first blockchain-based decentralized cloud computing network. This marketplace allows participants who need computing power to meet those who own computing power, thus supporting the most compute-intensive blockchain applications.\niExec’s technology relies on Ethereum smart contracts and allows the building of a virtual cloud infrastructure that provides high-performance computing services on demand. However, decentralized apps will ultimately rely on the execution of multiple smart contracts, across multiple blockchains, which has led iExec to adopt a blockchain-agnostic stance.\nRSK will allow developers around the globe to create decentralized personal and corporate solutions that work in the safest and most popular blockchain protocol, with low transaction costs that fit an ample range of needs. For these reasons, iExec has successfully deployed its V1 smart contracts on RSK as well. This SDK allows developers to build applications that will benefit from scalable and free cloud computing capabilities. The next steps of the partnership\nOn May 29, 2018, iExec will release its V2, the most-awaited component of iExec. This release consists of a decentralized marketplace for trading cloud resources and marks the very beginning of the possibility of monetizing one’s cloud resources in a peer-to-peer market.\nOnce V2 is made compatible with RSK as a next milestone, RSK applications and their smart contracts will be able to access the same decentralized cloud that Ethereum dapps make use of. Compute-intensive applications in the fields of fintech, artificial intelligence, scientific research or gaming will be able to leverage these resources, making RSK and iExec the backbone of the Bitcoin ecosystem. About RSK\nRSK is the first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merge-mining, allowing them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution. RSK goal is to add value and functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts, near instant payments and higher-scalability. About iExec\niExec aims to decentralize the cloud computing market by building the future of the Internet infrastructure. We are developing the first blockchain cloud computing platform, to support the most compute-intensive applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, big data, fintech, cryptography, or 3D

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers. A cryptocurrency mining computer equipped with cooling fans is displayed at a computer mall in Hong Kong, China May 17, 2018. Picture taken May 17, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n“Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400. PROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n“Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation 2330 (TSMC), the world’s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator’s apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,” according to mainland media reports. MARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan’s deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX ( DCC.AX ) and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE.V ).\n“Its not your everyday investment world,” said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalisation of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favoured for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n“We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,” Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE’s second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan’s smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n“The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,” said Kenetic’s Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan’s IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan’s IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan’s industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.\n($1 = 6.3700 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Alun John and Jennifer Hughes; additional reporting by Sijia Jiang and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by Gerry Doyle", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://twitter.com/ReutersIndia", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://www.facebook.com/india.reuters/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T03:57:48.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c3801823a8faa813d4bfb35d6c6699578c97d25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqamhWUYnko64oDrjj.AeLc4hGBEH8VDYYLBq.wLHcHfBuUF35PvQp4XrIf0SxXjKndwdhdA4tYA8MtDxY2PGW4t8wgOYFhMg9d", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Has Bitcoin Futures Trading Affected the Bitcoin Price?

A Remarkably Easy to Understand Introduction to Cryptocurrency\"\nImagine if you had a resource that you could give to anyone - your uncle, your aunt, your mom, your coworker, whoever - that explains the basics of Bitcoin in a way that almost anyone can understand -- easily and near-instantly!\nYou don't need to imagine: it's here.\nHello everyone. I wrote this article with the express intention of creating an introduction to Bitcoin which is extremely straightforward. It's purposefully not technical at all - like it or not, an enormous part of the world is not interested in the technical aspects of Bitcoin. Many of these people are intelligent, as well - you can be a genius and still not have a lot of patience for technical details.\nWith that said, my belief is that being uninterested in technical details should not bar you from learning about Bitcoin and how it is going to change the world.\nIf you want to tell your friends about Bitcoin, this is how you do it -- even if they aren't technically minded. Take a look now and let me know what you think - hopefully this helps some people out!\nMalcolm\n submitted by /u/MalcolmRoseGaming\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://rosecrypto.com/What-Is-Bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T17:52:11.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b1d516b293086dcf9ba9da7bfc3a6d92508c49c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY0KS6UlVN8mNm6pxh_o5tc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "How much are you willing to sell your bitcoin?", "title_full": "How much are you willing to sell your bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-21T22:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b1d516b293086dcf9ba9da7bfc3a6d92508c49c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY0KS6UlVN8mNm6pxh_o5tc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jombrangs", "published": "2018-05-21T22:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "How much are you willing to sell your bitcoin?", "text": "Actually, I cant give or I cant say what are the exactly amount Im willing to sell my bitcoin\nbecause as of now Im just looking forward to the good chance that the value of it is reach the unexpected value in the market that makes me profitable enough then I will gladly to sell it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:07:19.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "304dcce8aff0d20e9bd14f3cd99f5fb1a62fb785", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRE8l6tXhiMVwIIpqS0.8Xs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-21T22:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.653, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "304dcce8aff0d20e9bd14f3cd99f5fb1a62fb785", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRE8l6tXhiMVwIIpqS0.8Xs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kelampok ijo", "published": "2018-05-21T22:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "text": "know little about why the bitcoin is negative to the media crew, Because the government thinks that Bitcoin has no formal basis and regulatory authority, bitcoin is prone to be misused for illegal transactions, money laundering, and financing of terrorism.

Martin is talking about blockchain all the time, mentioning it numerous times, without explaining exactly what it is. Admitting that he had never heard of blockchain \"until last week\", he says: \"I mined some bitcoin with my computer, and then the value went through the roof\" and adds: \"Now I act like I'm an expert on it!\"\nOnce players completed this task, they are also be asked to encourage three youngsters to mine bitcoin on their computers.\nWhat is this: hidden advertising or another irony of the authors?\nsubmitted by /u/technotec_int\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T22:41:34.008+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 13109, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=19100", "requestsLeft": 471}
