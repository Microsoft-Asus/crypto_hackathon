Meanwhile, a new study has shown that the mood of investors, rather than economic indicators, actually determines the value of cryptocurrencies.

Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, the internet security expert predicted in a post on the microblogging platform Twitter this week. McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said in his tweet . He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,” the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads.\nMcAfee was probably referring to several recent announcements indicating possible developments in that direction. Earlier this month, reports suggested that Goldman Sachs is going to launch a bitcoin trading operation to buy and sell bitcoin futures on behalf of institutional clients. More recently, US crypto exchange Coinbase announced new services meant to attract big money players such as crypto hedge funds. The plans include the launch of a crypto custodian service and a suite of tools specifically designed for institutions called Coinbase Prime. The San Francisco-based company has also discussed with regulators the possibility to apply for a banking license.\nHowever, McAfee’s optimistic prognosis coincides with the return of the bears to the cryptocurrency market. The price of bitcoin (BTC) has just dropped below the $8,000 mark, hitting a month’s low. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading at over $1,000 (at the time of writing). John McAfee has previously predicted that the price of bitcoin will reach $1 million USD by the end of 2020. Study: Investors’ Mood Determines the Value of Cryptocurrencies\nAccording to a new study published by Warwick Business School, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined primarily by the mood of investors and not so much by economic factors or indicators. Assistant professor of finance Daniele Bianchi has found that the price patterns of the 14 largest cryptocurrencies reflect past returns of investors, combined with the hype and emotion experienced as they watch the value climb or fall. The research is titled “Cryptocurrencies as an Asset Class: An Empirical Assessment,” the Independent reports.\nAccording to the author, this behavior can be attributed to the fact that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fall outside the remit of governments or financial institutions. Investing in digital currencies is therefore more similar to buying equity in a high-tech firm rather than a normal currency, he notes. Bianchi also points out that the study shows limited similarities between bitcoin and gold. At the same time, because of the high volatility of the prices of the biggest cryptocurrencies, they can hardly be seen as a reliable savings instrument. CFO: If Bitcoin Gets ‘Better’, Paypal Will Support It\nJohn Rainey, the Chief Financial Officer of Paypal, has stated in a recent interview that the payment platform will proceed with a bit more caution towards cryptocurrencies. At the same time, he admitted that if cryptocurrency stabilizes in the future and becomes “better currency”, his company will “certainly support that”. Rainey added that the volatile crypto swings threaten the viability of the businesses Paypal is working with.\n“If you’re a merchant and you have, let’s say, a 10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction,” Paypal CFO told CNBC . “You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that,” Rainey elaborated.\nDespite Paypal’s current position on cryptocurrencies, a recent patent filing revealed that the payment provider might be considering expanding its exposure to the crypto ecosystem. Reports came out in March this year that Paypal has filed a new patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for an “expedited virtual currency transaction system”. Back in 2016, it was reported that the company had applied for another crypto-related patent – one that envisages the development of a payment module accepting bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, he predicted in a tweet. Meanwhile, a new study has shown that the mood of investors, rather than economic indicators, actually determines the value of cryptocurrencies. Also, do you want to know when Paypal will support crypto payments?\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Crypto Revolution Starts Reshaping Global Politics Institutional Investors to Pump Billions in Crypto\nJohn McAfee expects a bull run on cryptocurrency markets in the near future. Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, the internet security expert predicted in a post on the microblogging platform Twitter this week. McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said in his tweet . He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,” the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads.\nMcAfee was probably referring to several recent announcements indicating possible developments in that direction. Earlier this month, reports suggested that Goldman Sachs is going to launch a bitcoin trading operation to buy and sell bitcoin futures on behalf of institutional clients. More recently, US crypto exchange Coinbase announced new services meant to attract big money players such as crypto hedge funds. The plans include the launch of a crypto custodian service and a suite of tools specifically designed for institutions called Coinbase Prime. The San Francisco-based company has also discussed with regulators the possibility to apply for a banking license.\nHowever, McAfee’s optimistic prognosis coincides with the return of the bears to the cryptocurrency market. The price of bitcoin (BTC) has just dropped below the $8,000 mark, hitting a month’s low. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading at over $1,000 (at the time of writing). John McAfee has previously predicted that the price of bitcoin will reach $1 million USD by the end of 2020. Study: Investors’ Mood Determines the Value of Cryptocurrencies\nAccording to a new study published by Warwick Business School, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined primarily by the mood of investors and not so much by economic factors or indicators. Assistant professor of finance Daniele Bianchi has found that the price patterns of the 14 largest cryptocurrencies reflect past returns of investors, combined with the hype and emotion experienced as they watch the value climb or fall. The research is titled “Cryptocurrencies as an Asset Class: An Empirical Assessment,” the Independent reports.\nAccording to the author, this behavior can be attributed to the fact that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fall outside the remit of governments or financial institutions. Investing in digital currencies is therefore more similar to buying equity in a high-tech firm rather than a normal currency, he notes. Bianchi also points out that the study shows limited similarities between bitcoin and gold. At the same time, because of the high volatility of the prices of the biggest cryptocurrencies, they can hardly be seen as a reliable savings instrument. CFO: If Bitcoin Gets ‘Better’, Paypal Will Support It\nJohn Rainey, the Chief Financial Officer of Paypal, has stated in a recent interview that the payment platform will proceed with a bit more caution towards cryptocurrencies. At the same time, he admitted that if cryptocurrency stabilizes in the future and becomes “better currency”, his company will “certainly support that”. Rainey added that the volatile crypto swings threaten the viability of the businesses Paypal is working with.\n“If you’re a merchant and you have, let’s say, a 10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction,” Paypal CFO told CNBC . “You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that,” Rainey elaborated.\nDespite Paypal’s current position on cryptocurrencies, a recent patent filing revealed that the payment provider might be considering expanding its exposure to the crypto ecosystem. Reports came out in March this year that Paypal has filed a new patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for an “expedited virtual currency transaction system”. Back in 2016, it was reported that the company had applied for another crypto-related patent – one that envisages the development of a payment module accepting bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

Katlego Marite, 13, was dragged into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank, a town in the eastern province of Mpumalanga, on Sunday afternoon, police spokesman Leonard Hlathi said. “They demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,” he told news channel eNCA. “(The parents) don’t even know what these bitcoins are. They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak.” Although police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first.

It went live on January 1, 2018, with block 501,888 – granting every bitcoin holder the same amount of BPA. Bitcoin Ore (BCO)\nBitcoin Ore (BCO) is aiming to be a less wasteful and more environmentally friendly version of Bitcoin. Based on Proof of Capacity, it enables to be mined more efficiently, thereby saving the environment. It started to be operational on January 28, 2018, granting each bitcoin holder the equal amount of BCO. Bitcoin Faith (BTF)\nBitcoin Faith (BTF) brings a built-in intelligent contract, larger block size and zero-knowledge proof for privacy. Forked from block height of 500,000, on December 19, 2017, it granted every bitcoin owner an equal amount of BTF. Oil Bitcoin (OBTC)\nBy “drilling the oil from digital currency,” Oil Bitcoin (OBTC) aims to issue rewards by using Proof of Stake consensus mechanism to enhance trading speed and equity distribution. With Autonomous Community, Safeguard Privacy and Replay Protection it was issued on December 12, 2017, granting each bitcoin holder an equal amount of OBTC. Super Bitcoin (SBTC)\nImplementing the proposals recommended by the community, Super Bitcoin (SBTC) aims to provide zero-knowledge proofs to safeguard privacy and expand the block size to 8MB. Furthermore, support Turing-complete smart contracts it enables more functionality, increasing BTC scalability. It was forked on December 12, 2017, with the block 498,888, granting every Bitcoin holder the equal amount of SBTC. Bitcoin Hot (BTH)\nCreated at block height 498,848 with a new Proof of Work algorithm – BTHash, Bitcoin Hot (BTH) aims to reduce the cost of transfers while increasing the speed. It holds larger supply than bitcoin, making it more affordable for everyone. Every bitcoin owner can claim their BTH with a ratio of 100 BTH for every bitcoin they hold. The block size is 16MB, and the project was established in December 2017. Advertisement advertisement Big Bitcoin (BBC)\nBig Bitcoin or BBC claims to operate at “extremely high speed with considerably powerful technology” while being one of the “most in-depth hard forks of the Bitcoin blockchain ever seen.” BBC has a shorter block time (2.5 minutes), bigger block size (16 MB) and adapts a difficulty adjustment algorithm while supporting SegWit and Lightning Network . BBC was forked at block height 508,888, and the supply is fixed at 210 million. Bitcoin Clean (BCL)\nBitcoin Clean (BCL) is another attempt to make Bitcoin clean and green again with a tagline “Mine bitcoin solely using renewable energy.” It employs ‘Proof of Greenness Protocol’ to ensure miners use only renewable energy.\nForked at block height 518,800 on April 18, 2018, it granted every bitcoin holder the same amount of BCL. The team behind it claims to work nonstop to make this fork a genuinely viable alternative to Bitcoin and curb the pollution being generated due to mining . Bitcoin File (BIFI)\nAiming to create a global decentralized file system, Bitcoin File (BIFI) combines IPFS file systems and the Bitcoin settlement network. Fully self-monitored and decentralized, it offers 21 billion tokens, among which 17 billion were airdropped to the bitcoin holders with the ratio of 1000 BIFI for every bitcoin held. It claims to be a more stable, fair and green alternative to BTC. Bitcoin Candy (CDY)\nThe newest fork out there – Bitcoin Candy (CDY) combines a Proof of Work algorithm with a two-minute block time for increased transaction speeds. Claiming to be safer with total supply adjusted to 21 billion, it was distributed with block 512666.\nThe distribution took place on January 13, 2018, on the Bitcoin Cash chain with a ratio of 1000 CDY for every 1 BCH. Furthermore, the coin conducted an additional hard fork on May 15, 2018 ( along with Bitcoin Cash ), incorporating some significant upgrades to the chain. Conclusion\nWhile some take it as a great sign that many bitcoin forks are trying to solve existing problems, others argue they are all distractions from the bona fide version; there will only be room for one form of sound, honest money and the network effects backing bitcoin make it the strongest contender.\nThe only requirement for receiving the forked coins is to own bitcoins at the time of the fork while storing it on a separate, non-exchange wallet. Every bitcoin fork (even those ridiculous) could be a great way to make additional money, but many are scams designed to enrich their founders or steal your funds.\nWhile the number of bitcoin forks since Bitcoin Cash is at 44 presently, this number could easily reach 100 by the end of 2018 as ‘fork mania’ persists.

If they were speculating they wouldn’t have donated to my campaign in Bitcoin. They didn’t HODL, they donated to my campaign in Bitcoin because they believe in the technology.”\nForde, who formerly advised the Obama administration on crypto and headed MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, is a stalwart crypto advocate, leading Bloomberg to dub him “the crypto candidate for Congress.” According to Bloomberg, his campaign has attracted support from the likes of crypto community giants Mike Novogratz and the Winklevoss brothers . His opponent Min on the other hand is a former SEC attorney and current professor of law at the University of California, Irvine.\n“While [Min’s] ad disparages a technology he clearly doesn’t understand, the United Nations uses it to address human trafficking,” Forde told Bloomberg, referring to a UN initiative for a blockchain-based digital identity system designed to combat child trafficking globally. “We need more rational scientists and technologists in congress armed with evidence-based policymaking, not politicians making irrational decisions based on their emotions,” he stressed.\nAs VICE notes, back in 2014 the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) ruled unanimously in favour of allowing political action committees to accept BTC donations, provided donors identify themselves. New Hampshire was the first US state to implement the FEC 2014 rulings, with Colorado suggesting it will follow suit just this week.\nThe FEC currently treats Bitcoin contributions to campaigns as as in-kind donations, meaning that candidates have 10 days to put the BTC raised into their official campaign depository. As Cointelegraph has reported , the FEC has been assessing whether to amend its regulations so that virtual currencies would in future be treated like cash.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5kpxb/cryptocurrency-attack-ad-brian-forde-bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/michael-novogratz", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/cryptocurrency-candidates-politicians-embrace-bitcoin.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-colorado-proposes-accepting-cryptocurrency-for-political-campaigns", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/bitcoin-s-candidate-for-congress", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/un-partners-win-to-fight-child-trafficking-with-blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/winklevoss-twins", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/pro-bitcoin-us-congressional-candidate-starts-accepting-bitcoin-donations-for-2018", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-white-house-advisor-elimination-of-double-spend-is-bitcoins-true-innovation"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave min", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital currency initiative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:45:03.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "580c1d97180c12bf6ab809161b4a25480f3b23c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTxUopMuZO6WS_rEWqJspkUhKG884vSEvCC9jUG9LIxl7xzaQElENem_pa5xy7ByvPVGM6.2FWepbaOfza_iqHZB6fbdeBQ5YgSftPGfF.McA--", "site_full": "bizwatchnigeria.ng", "site": "bizwatchnigeria.ng", "site_section": "http://bizwatchnigeria.ng/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "BizWatchNigeria.Ng", "title": "Bitcoin Scores Below $8,000 at the Start of Trading Session", "title_full": "Bitcoin Scores Below $8,000 at the Start of Trading Session", "published": "2018-05-23T13:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bizwatchnigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bitcoin.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 56938, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "580c1d97180c12bf6ab809161b4a25480f3b23c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTxUopMuZO6WS_rEWqJspkUhKG884vSEvCC9jUG9LIxl7xzaQElENem_pa5xy7ByvPVGM6.2FWepbaOfza_iqHZB6fbdeBQ5YgSftPGfF.McA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Victor Okeh", "published": "2018-05-23T13:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Scores Below $8,000 at the Start of Trading Session", "text": "Bitcoin Scores Below $8,000 at the Start of Trading Session Bitcoin Scores Below $8,000 at the Start of Trading Session 0\nBitcoin’s price has slipped below $8,000 to hit a 35-day low.\nJust an hour after the May 23 trading session began, data from CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index shows the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency started to fall, dropping to its lowest point since April 18.\nAfter steadily climbing up to nearly $10,000 on May 6, bitcoin’s price has been on a gradual decline since then towards a current low at $7,876, reflecting a 20 percent drop over the past two weeks.\nThe price has bounced back slightly to $7,910 as of press time.\nThat said, the current price still shows a 30 percent premium over bitcoin’s lowest point this year at $5,947 seen on Feb. 5.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin’s price drop also coincides with a wider market sell-off.

Notably, the 5-month moving average (MA) has rolled over in favour of the bears and looks set to cut the 10-month MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover for the very first time since June 2014. If that occurs it might be a worrying sign for the long-term cost outlook. Back then, following an identical crossover at June 2014, the cryptocurrency then dropped by 70 percent (from $580 to $166) from the seven months leading up to January 2015. This time around, the bearish crossover will probably happen at the conclusion of the month, if bitcoin expands the present decline towards the $7,000 mark, also would open the doors to get a deeper sell-off towards the $5,000 mark. Monthly chart\nPresently, the 5-month MA is seen at $8,916 along with the 10-month MA is situated at $8,379, according to Bitfinex data. In the mean time, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,820 – down nearly 5 percent in the last twenty five hours. Daily chart\nThe observed lower-highs and lower-lows pattern (marked with circles) along with the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs suggest a bearish setup. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 10-day and 50-day MAs. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (from the bearish territory), but holding well above 30.00 (oversold territory), indicating enough space to get a sell-off towards $7,000. Weekly chart\nAcceptance beneath the 50-week MA, now seen at $7,620, would only strengthen the already bearish daily chart technicals and increase the probabilities of the bearish five-month/10-month MA crossover. The 50-week MA worked as a strong support in Apr, so a break below that level could yield a sharp sell-off. View\nBTC risks deeper pullback towards $7,000. In this case, the five-month MA will cross the 10-month MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover and opening doors to get a drop to $5,000. Bullish scenario: A solid rebound from the 50-week MA at $7,620 and a convincing break above $8,644 will signal that a bullish reversal.\nDown arrow picture via Shutterstock\nThe leader at blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the greatest abides by a ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T21:57:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61d7c950491c785d69f806ba7ed9ad9f293c1f80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQk2igMtszHgJsSpR5V9j.aHjA6_Gq10AMAEWD_6xRIgdfdh2.0W76GThqHQIPSCuKorXHplJ4K5eSRitnRJ0FDCgLZOX2SML09OL.SR9bSQ--", "site_full": "africanavblog.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://africanavblog.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "MUSIK-AFRICANA's  VBLOG", "title": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager – Police", "title_full": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager – Police", "published": "2018-05-23T13:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61d7c950491c785d69f806ba7ed9ad9f293c1f80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSQk2igMtszHgJsSpR5V9j.aHjA6_Gq10AMAEWD_6xRIgdfdh2.0W76GThqHQIPSCuKorXHplJ4K5eSRitnRJ0FDCgLZOX2SML09OL.SR9bSQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "biodun olukoye (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T13:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager – Police", "text": "\nA criminal gang in South Africa which kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday is demanding a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency of nearly 120,000, dollars police said.\nParade of suspected vicious and notorious kidnappers/armed robbery gangs, terrorizing Abuja–Minna and Abuja–Kaduna highways, at Dikko, Near Suleja, Niger State by CSP Jimoh Moshood, Force Public Relations Officer, yesterday.

First, it made a stupendous rise in value, making many of its earliest investors well-off in hardly any time at all. Then there came a backlash which saw it lose a good chunk of the value that it had gained. What followed that was a seemingly endless series of ups and downs that would make even the heartiest investor go running for the antacids. Hence Bitcoin and volatility are usually mentioned in the same sentence, often in the same breath, by people trying to make sense of it all. Many wonders whether investing Bitcoin is worth all of the volatility-induced agitation.\nYou should not make that same mistake, because Bitcoin is certainly worth at least a little bit of your investment capital. If you need some help in making sense of it all, you can benefit from a trading program, such as Bitcoin Loophole , that utilizes artificial intelligence to get the job done. What you have to do if you’re planning to invest in Bitcoin is to figure out a plan for dealing with its inherent volatility. And the best way to do that simply ignores that volatility altogether. Here is how to make that happen.\n1.In or Out\nWhen you are deciding whether or not to include Bitcoin into your investment world, you shouldn’t complicate it. Either you believe in the coins, which are used in place of cash or other currencies and boast transactions that are incredibly efficient, transparent, cheap, and rapid, or you think that they are either going to die out or are simply not ever going to reach the peaks in value they once did. It’s a simple yes or no proposition. The Strategy\nIf you don’t want in, simply leave it be. But if you have faith in Bitcoin, then you should pick a price that’s comfortable for you and the amount of capital you wish to spend. Once you make that commitment, your job is essentially done. That’s because you shouldn’t even worry about what Bitcoin is doing from that point forward, whether it is rising or falling in the short term. You have already decided that it is for you, so no small sample size turnabout should dissuade you from that. The Outcome\nIf you believe in Bitcoin, you should be thinking about the long term. That means that you will be holding on to it in terms of years rather than months and days. Bitcoin has great potential, not just as the flavor of the month, but as something that can potentially alter finance over a long period of time. When it reaches that point, all of the rising and falling that it took to get to that point won’t matter.\nVolatility is something that should be left for the day traders to mull over. For the long haul, buying Bitcoin and holding it should serve you well.

They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak.” Although police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first.

To see our extensive list of cryptocurrency sectors, read this post at https://www.tradingheroes.com/cryptocurrency-sectors-cheatsheet/ . How do You Buy Cryptocurrencies? First have to go to an exchange or service that will allow you to purchase cryptocurrencies. Some of the bigger exchanges are: Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase . Poloniex at https://poloniex.com/ . CEX at https://www.tradingheroes.com/cexio . Bittrex at https://bittrex.com/ . Bitfinex at https://www.bitfinex.com/ .\nBinance at https://www.tradingheroes.com/binance . LocalBitcoins at https://localbitcoins.com/ . Many of them will allow you to use a credit card or link a bank account. As much as possible, do not store your cryptocurrency at the exchanges because they can be hacked. See the cold storage section in this post for details on how to store you coins safely. It’s easy to get Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. But if you want the smaller altcoins, you will have to do an exchange. How to Buy Altcoins. First buy Bitcoin or Ethereum because those are the coins that are most easily transacted against the smaller altcoins. When in doubt, buy Bitcoin. If you want $10 of Bitcoin for free, use this link at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase (while supplies last). Then find out where the altcoin that you want is traded. Go to Coinmarketcap at https://coinmarketcap.com/ and click on the coin you want to buy. Next, click on the Markets tab for that coin. For example, here’s where you can get NEM. The Source column will show you the exchanges where this coin is being traded. Notice how most of them are traded against Bitcoin or Ether. Open an account at the most reputable exchange on the list. Once you are in your account, find the “deposit” wallet address for the altcoin you want to buy. Here’s an example from Poloniex. Copy this wallet address.\nNext, login to the account where you bought your Bitcoin or Ether. If you bought it from Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase , then you can go to: Accounts then Send and paste the deposit address into that field. Enter the amount you want to send, then click the send button. It may take some time for the transaction to go through, so be patient. Then you see the balance in your destination exchange account, you are now ready to buy altcoins. Here’s what it would look like when you have a Litecoin balance at Poloniex. This can be found in Balances > Deposits and Withdrawals in Poloniex. Now go to the Exchange area of the website. In Poloniex, it would look like this. Then click on the BTC tab. These are the currencies that you can exchange for Bitcoin. Click on the altcoin that you want to trade. Here’s and example from Civic (CVC). Next, scroll down and look for the buy/sell box. Enter the amount of altcoin that you want to buy. If you want to trade all of your Bitcoin, click on the link at the top with your total balance. Click the Buy button and you are all set. The trade might not happen right away, so check your Orders then My Open Orders page to see the status. The exact process will be different at different exchanges, but the basic idea is the same for all exchange.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T12:39:49.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e3439d1019cd5af82559598b7b9b4e2bb325d9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSP66Dzdw0sommoEnWbpKCPFQPba1ltJdyblrTf1ipLaOqqiD6kD9kmS8mJCVD48ou2y9YQQcMjt8PtfTLicMvA8fZH_u8Bmcg-", "site_full": "www.vatlive.com", "site": "vatlive.com", "site_section": "http://www.vatlive.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Avalara VATLive", "title": "India to levy 18% GST on bitcoin Jul 2018", "title_full": "India to levy 18% GST on bitcoin Jul 2018", "published": "2018-05-23T12:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.vatlive.com/wp-content/uploads/VATlive-breaking-news.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e3439d1019cd5af82559598b7b9b4e2bb325d9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSP66Dzdw0sommoEnWbpKCPFQPba1ltJdyblrTf1ipLaOqqiD6kD9kmS8mJCVD48ou2y9YQQcMjt8PtfTLicMvA8fZH_u8Bmcg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Admin", "published": "2018-05-23T12:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "India to levy 18% GST on bitcoin Jul 2018", "text": "VAT news Asia India India to levy 18% GST on bitcoin Jul 2018 India to levy 18% GST on bitcoin Jul 2018 Wed 23rd May 2018\nIndia’s Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs is considering a proposal to make digital currency trading subject to Goods and Services Tax at 18%. The new liability may fall due from 1 July 2018.\nIn this case, India would be classifying cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, as a physical asset rather than as a currency for the exchange of goods and services. This would therefore mean any sales would be considered a taxable supply for indirect tax. The place of supply would be considered the Seller’s location.\nThe rational is that the tax authorities are anxious to prevent virtual currencies being used by criminal gangs to launder money. The Indian Central Bank has already refused to extend official regulation to digital currencies.

Its price has stabilized around $1,300 range today. The BCH coin hit $1,800 mark a few days ago before falling back to $1,100 on last Friday.\nThe downside volatility in Bitcoin Cash price was unexpected. The market participants were expecting BCH coin to hold the momentum instead of losing all the gains in few days. The selloff was only driven by broader market volatility and traders profit-taking strategy.\nThe entire cryptocurrency market has been under immense pressure since investing icons have raised genuine concerns about cryptocurrencies fair value and acceptability as the medium of exchange . But TRON Isn’t Following Industry Trends\nTRON is making surprising movements despite the broader market selloff. The coin price rose 12% today following similar gains during the weekend trading. It is up more than 60% in the last month alone. The upswing in its price guided it to rank at 9th spot in cryptocurrency ranking.\nJustin Sun, Tron Foundation founder says , “ Our next goal is to become one of the top 6 cryptocurrencies in the world. We have actually achieved top 6 briefly on January 5, 2018 during TRON’s outstanding sprint out the gate.

There is a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $8,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may well correct higher in the short term towards the $8,100 and $8,160 resistance levels. Bitcoin price broke key supports near $8,200 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD may continue to face selling interest near $8,100 and $8,200.\nBitcoin Price Analysis Yesterday, we discussed about a major support near $8,240 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair failed to hold the stated $8,240 support and even broke the 100 hourly simple moving average. It opened the doors for more losses and the price broke the $8,160 support level. Sellers took control and pushed the price below the $8,000 handle. A low was formed below $7,900 at $7,860 where buyers defended further losses.\nAt the moment, the price is consolidating above $7,850. An initial resistance is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,253 high to $7,860 low. Above this, there is a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $8,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. More importantly, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,253 high to $7,860 low is at $8,057. Therefore, if the price moves above $8,000, there are many hurdles near $8,100, waiting to cap upsides.\nLooking at the chart , the price clearly broke a key support at $8,160, signaling a short-term downtrend. There could be recoveries towards $8,100 and $8,200. However, as long as the price is below $8,200, it is likely to remain under selling pressure.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is mostly placed in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving higher from the oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $7,850\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,100\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Breakdown Looks like Real Deal appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T12:19:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b81423c1517f571596c00a4c39cfd3fd1cf1d6ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr7Qlc0TFRNdXypbPNtivbdRH8K4SgJljiWKS3ohYm.NUeXkyAS_9VcvNDqHdo_t.YQZ.sxLY5JlIFwTtLAS5qAbuvdgQUzaiJZbt4xcB7iRHQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Roger Ver talks Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Purse, Marco Coino with Ryan Charles", "title_full": "Roger Ver talks Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Purse, Marco Coino with Ryan Charles", "published": "2018-05-23T12:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b81423c1517f571596c00a4c39cfd3fd1cf1d6ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr7Qlc0TFRNdXypbPNtivbdRH8K4SgJljiWKS3ohYm.NUeXkyAS_9VcvNDqHdo_t.YQZ.sxLY5JlIFwTtLAS5qAbuvdgQUzaiJZbt4xcB7iRHQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-05-23T12:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Roger Ver talks Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Purse, Marco Coino with Ryan Charles", "text": "Roger Ver talks Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Purse, Marco Coino with Ryan Charles May 23, 2018\nThe ‘Four Seasons Hotel’ in Hong Kong with a spectacular view reaching out to Victoria Harbour and its beautiful nightlife surrounding the grand city was the ultimate place for Roger Ver’s Weekly video feed, featuring Ryan Charles the CEO of yours.org and moneybutton.com.\nThis video project was started a month ago as he claims ‘Bitcoin Cash to have room for everyone who is willing to invest in a decentralized digital exchange platform like this, owning up to a bigger market capital’.\nThey discuss the current scenario in the crypto-space with reference to the ‘Coingeek Conference 2018′ that was held in Hong Kong, which focused mainly on developments like ‘ Bcash ’, BCH and the new innovations taking place on the network.\nBitcoin Cash was built on the Bitcoin Network last year, ever since which the company has improved their marketing strategies by paying their employees through Bitcoin Cash, by default.\nRoger Ver on his Twitter claims:\nAll the new innovations are taking place on Bitcoin Cash and not Bitcoin core which is highly unreliable because of the change in the economic core, which is the heart of it all, says Mr. Ver.\nIn terms of liquidity, Bitcoin Cash is the most trusted digital asset exchange as of now. The two developers also mention their interests in buying items and making business transactions on Amazon and Purse.io as they now accept payments using Bitcoin Cash.\nBCH has slowly made its way through the growing e-commerce market with the logic that ‘miners support the most profitable coins in the market’, hence, leaving behind Bitcoin Core [BTC]. Roger Ver’s video\n‘Open Bazaar’ on the other hand was highly critiqued by the two men for its benefits on being a decentralized market platform. Mr. Ver also made sure to put his store merchandises like t-shirts, caps, etc. from Bitcoin.com on OpenBazaar.\nMoneybutton.com is also making possible pressing a button to make Bitcoin Cash micro-payments. Ryan claims that the prototype is already ready for testing but not for mass use. Apps like Marco Coino, that helps users find nearby Bitcoin Cash merchants has also gained considerable recognition in this video.\nOne Reddit user supports the App saying:\n“ As more merchants are listed, Marco Coino becomes an ever more useful resource, prompting more people to use it and list more of their local merchants.

There aren’t a lot of people who understand bitcoins. That means the Venn diagram of people who understand both is likely to have a pretty small slice that contains both. The people in the slice are telling the rest of us it’s time to buy bitcoins because is moving from Aires to Taurus and that’s a good sign for cryptocurrency. The people who don’t know their crypto from their Taurus are saying, “Wait … what?”\n“Uranus is the planet of innovation, invention, change and technology. Whenever it does something big in the sky like change signs, we know something exciting and unexpected is about to happen.”\nIn an article in Market Watch , Annabel Gat, an International Society for Astrological Research-certified astrologer, tells why Uranus moving (if you just giggled, grow up!) is a zodiac change that could be a good sign for technology. But why bitcoins in particular? The answer to that comes from someone who sits right in the middle portion of the astrology/cryptocurrency Venn diagram – Marcus Thomas, an investor who has been making money using astrological signs to guide his investments since 2008.\n“I knew then that astrology may not be an exact science but it has the ability to predict trends by casting a big net focusing on certain themes in present day. Uranus in Taurus — until 2026 [represents] revolutionary innovations in areas of finance, climate, banking, farming and other earth-related things.”\nOkay … but why did Thomas switch to bitcoins in 2017? For that answer, you have to create another Venn diagram of people who understand astrology, people who understand bitcoin, people who won the Heisman Trophy, played in the NFL and played minor league baseball. No, not Tim Tebow. That tiny dot in the Venn diagram is Ricky Williams , the pot-smoking one-time star running back for the Miami Dolphins and other NFL teams.\n“When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight. The insight that got me interested in bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus. [Uranus] is about revolution; it’s about a change in the way we do things; it’s about innovation, [Taurus] is about resources and finances.”\nWilliams added that, at the same time, Pluto is passing through Capricorn, which “is about our structures, like banks for instance.” Put that all together and it explains why Williams invested $50,000 in bitcoins and Marcus Thomas invested $11,000.\nStill skeptical about a connection between investing and astrology? Maybe Merriman Market Analyst can help.\n“Working from the premise that all human activity works in conjunction with certain immutable laws of time and space, The Merriman Market Analyst (MMA) utilizes advanced research techniques to uncover patterns and trends that you can use to understand the present; and, from this method of understanding, gain valuable insight into the future.”\nAstrologer-investor Richard Merriman, president of MMA, notes that the last time Uranus was in Taurus was in 1944, when the Bretton Woods Agreement tied the dollar to the price of gold. And in the late 90s and early 200s, Uranus was in Aquarius at the same time as the dot-com boom. Then Uranus oved to Pisces, matching the oil boom.\nWill Uranus in Taurus trigger a bitcoin boom?\n“In the next few years, there are going to be major changes in currency valuations and leadership, and new forms of currency.”\nIs that a yes or a no? Merriman is astrologically predicting that bitcoins will drop in price between now and March 6, 2019, when Taurus finally moves out of Aries. He’s advising his clients to with until the price drops to 77% of its high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017, 0r around $4,500. One bitcoin is worth $8,100 today.\nWhat will happen on March 6, 2019? Merriman estimates that 20% of investors make decisions based on their horoscopes and over half of young adults believe astrology is a science. Then again, a lot of people like that lost their shirts (literally and figuratively) in the Age of Aquarius .\nThis review is not meant to endorse astrological investing so don’t blame us if you lose your bitcoins out Uranus. We’re looking at you, Ricky Williams. Tags astrology bitcoin Paranormal Paul Seaburn Paul Seaburn is one of the most prolific writers at Mysterious Universe.

A note with a Bitcoin (BTC) address was left at the scene specifying that a ransom of BTC 15 should be paid if the parents wanted to see their kid again.\nAs of this writing, the ransom is worth USD123,000. It appears to be the first known case in South Africa’s history where criminals demanded a ransom to be paid with cryptocurrency.\nAccording to reports, the boy was playing with two friends on Frangipani Street when a gold Toyota Corolla pulled up. A man dressed in black with a green jacket grabbed the boy and drove off, and the boy’s friends ran home and told their mother who called the police.\nIt is unclear why the boy was specifically targeted. The parents were not even aware of Bitcoin or how to use it, so this kidnapping did not appear to target a stash of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin can provide a degree of anonymity when sending money, which is speculated to be the reason the kidnappers chose the currency. All they had to do was leave their Bitcoin address behind with no other identifying information. This is unlike Western Union, MoneyGram, or banks where identifying information is required to accept payments.\nRealistically, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, in general, are the only private payment methods that can be used to transact from a distance. Except for its physical nature, cash is technically more anonymous than banks and payment providers like Western Union, since a normal cash transaction requires no identifying information.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.enca.com/south-africa/kidnappers-demand-ransom-for-katlego-marite", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5757983/Kidnappers-demand-bitcoin-ransom-S-African-teen.html", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://t.me/bconews"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "katlego marite", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "witbank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T12:31:48.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a269ec001deb3ded9eb82343652eedc6fd913323", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhCx0SC4TAWw8atBlUen1QUI-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-23T12:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a269ec001deb3ded9eb82343652eedc6fd913323", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhCx0SC4TAWw8atBlUen1QUI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T12:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 23, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin price analysis: BTC/USD dives under $8000; Vanguard economist believes it will go to zero FXStreet Bitcoin's price action is to the downside today.

The service is set to be available to send payments between 50 countries; each transaction will be executed in 24 hours or less.\nThe move is a result of a partnership with Bitex, a crypto exchange startup targeting Latin American users. Banco Masvestas is believed to be the world’s first bank to use Bitcoin as an international payments standard, similar to the SWIFT clearing network.\nHelp us to make Finance Magnates better!\nAn informational page about the new service on Masvestas’s website explained that “the service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks [serving] as intermediaries.” (Translated quote.)\nThe initiative was reportedly inspired by the bank’s desire to build up its digital services and to lower costs. Masventas’ principle shareholder, Jose Dakak, added that the partnership is also intended to serve the bank’s international customers: “one of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad.” The Customer “Doesn’t See the Bitcoin”\nDakak continued by saying that customers won’t even necessarily know that Bitcoin will be involved in their international transactions at all. “The customers will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the bank uses Bitex as a provider,” he said. “For the customer, it’s transparent, they don’t touch, they don’t see the bitcoin. We are a provider for them, and they are not touching bitcoin.”\nHis vision echoes the sentiments put forth by Litecoin creator Charlie Lee in an exclusive interview with Finance Magnates last week. Lee described his vision for the future of crypto as “a future where people don’t even have to know that they’re using cryptocurrency . They’ll just be sending payments [through a platform] to another person or to a merchant.”\nArgentina’s blockchain and crypto industries have been steadily growing–the Argentinian government has been relatively welcoming to the new technology relative to some neighboring countries.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRisHN0415X-E5Ru16ORunEn_qNxIuhGgZIlFqtW8ul0HEpg/viewform?usp=sf_link", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/nobel-economist-argues-cryptocurrency-nothing-new/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/argentinas-largest-futures-trading-market-may-add-crypto-roster/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/interview/charlie-lee-trouble-litepay-way-pumped/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "argenti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masvestas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose dakak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco masvestas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:45:17.053+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b36ac044a2a06375a13369f63cc4d6a36ad27e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYjDdV5kECMXtbytu4E6cJ8osUWbXD.Te0Y6FJbN.NTFlVMFcStZ6jL4XsBeSIuxytuDCxno1EZB2_XApS5D13oRfUdUGECNk8zIoHWfq41A--", "site_full": "loanbuster.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://loanbuster.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Loans and Finance", "title": "Shock Horror: Bitcoin Holders Learn That Bitcoin Can Go Down As Well As Up", "title_full": "Shock Horror: Bitcoin Holders Learn That Bitcoin Can Go Down As Well As Up", "published": "2018-05-23T12:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b36ac044a2a06375a13369f63cc4d6a36ad27e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYjDdV5kECMXtbytu4E6cJ8osUWbXD.Te0Y6FJbN.NTFlVMFcStZ6jL4XsBeSIuxytuDCxno1EZB2_XApS5D13oRfUdUGECNk8zIoHWfq41A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ken Frost (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T12:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Shock Horror: Bitcoin Holders Learn That Bitcoin Can Go Down As Well As Up", "text": "Bitcoin Closing on Long-Term Bear Indicator Not Seen Since 2014....\n...as it slides below 8K, over 60% from its peak https://t.co/CTT9EgpmOC\n— Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) May 23, 2018 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nouriel roubini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T13:09:23.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d12eb154af9c319293afcf37e1c41d86ffc86b17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQq3coW3.zjc4UMPj15ahfuEwb3_iYmMlpnJF2UmN23RfTFEKllVdgT5BIErebCbzQDUGORJ0PdDX8e0RV0LCEiVUPilGXJF_4V757idJ6otw--", "site_full": "www.naijagistblog.com", "site": "naijagistblog.com", "site_section": "https://www.naijagistblog.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Naija Gist's blog", "title": "Kidnappers Demand Ransom In Bitcoin To Free Teenager", "title_full": "Kidnappers Demand Ransom In Bitcoin To Free Teenager", "published": "2018-05-23T12:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d12eb154af9c319293afcf37e1c41d86ffc86b17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQq3coW3.zjc4UMPj15ahfuEwb3_iYmMlpnJF2UmN23RfTFEKllVdgT5BIErebCbzQDUGORJ0PdDX8e0RV0LCEiVUPilGXJF_4V757idJ6otw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Becky Johnson (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T12:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kidnappers Demand Ransom In Bitcoin To Free Teenager", "text": "A criminal gang in South Africa which kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday is demanding a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency of nearly 120,000, dollars police said.\nPolice spokesperson Leonard Hlathi said, Katlego Marite, 13, was dragged into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank, a town in the eastern province of Mpumalanga, on Sunday afternoon.\n“They demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,” he told news channel eNCA.\n“(The parents) don’t even know what these bitcoins are.

We soon realized this was relatively uncharted water. […] There were a couple of mosques abroad that also announced they were going to accept cryptocurrency. It looks like we may be the first in Britain to do so. Dealing With ‘Incompatible’ Crypto\nAs Britain’s only Turkish-owned mosque, Shacklewell is in a unique situation in terms of Ankara’s perspective on cryptocurrency.\nLate last year, Bitcoinist reported on how government advisors had determined that Bitcoin and altcoins were “not compatible” with Islamic tradition and were thus unsuitable for Muslims.\nIn response to a civil request, Turkey’s Directorate of Religious Affairs, also known as the Diyanet, said:\nBuying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation, they can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance.\nCountering the suspicion, however, Singh pointed out that Western capitalism had produced its worst crashes specifically due to the presence of the speculation to which some Islamic scholars object.\nSingh added:\nWould we have had […] the granddaddy of them all, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, if speculation was not standard practice in our conventional, Western banking system?\nWhat do you think about Shacklewell Lane Mosque’s decision to accept Bitcoin?

A landmark occasion for the burgeoning technology at the time, the transaction proved the digital currency worked and could be utilised for a real-world exchange. The current value of those coins is around $80,000,000, but rather than be remembered as a sad day for the guy who made the exchange it is celebrated as a great step for financial freedom by the community. For Bitcoin itself, it was another concerning day of far below average trading volumes, and a very worrying time indeed for bulls. A lack of speculation and thin liquidity potentially leaves the price very exposed to any bearish shocks, and if the longer term trend is still intact from the start of the year, this means a large sell order coming in, could do serious damage to the price. A lack of fundamental news may be contributing to the slowdown, but with no economic cycle like conventional FX it isn’t clear when the drought will be over Bitcoin prices could dip further to $7500\nThe technical picture looks more bearish the longer that it takes for the price action to turn bullish, and as a result, each day that passes below $9000 would appear to strengthen negative sentiment. Omkar Godbole, an analyst at Coindesk released his daily report, and now believes that a key support is now in danger of giving way,\n“BTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and drop to $8,000 in the next 24 hours. A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,000 would signal a revival of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990. In such a case, bitcoin could suffer a deeper sell-off towards $7,500.”\nIf Mr. Godbole’s bearish convictions were wrong, it seems plausible that the market script could be flipped, and the analyst highlights $8800 as a price point to watch,\n“On the higher side, a move above $8,408 would open the doors to $8,858 (100-day moving average). A daily close above that level would signal a bullish trend reversal and could yield rally to $10,000.”\nGiven how low volatility has gotten, a move some $500 higher would be a fairly dramatic event and it is hard to see what might drive an increase in volume. Regulators have gone quiet, arguably with bigger fish to fry, and technological advancements and adoption stories have not yet proven significant enough to change the dialogue. For now, large investors may remain sidelined to avoid liquidity costs in this thin environment. François Auré Traded Forex for 6 years.

Accordingly, one congressional candidate in California is now catching heat in an opponent’s attack ad for accepting bitcoin donations. The attack is seemingly the first of many as election seasons are poised to foster pulpy mischaracterizations of the original cryptocurrency.\nJoin the Bitsonline Telegram channel to get the latest Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and tech news updates: https://t.me/bitsonline\nAdoption Milestone?\nBack in February, Bitsonline noted how bitcoin donations, though still a meager trickle, were on the rise in the arena of American politics by both Republicans and Democrats.\nAs such, it was only a matter of time before the bipartisan “race-to-the-bottom” art of attack ads caught such growing bitcoin use in its crosshairs.\nNow, then, that first bitcoin-based political attack is upon us. That’s per Motherboard reporter Daniel Oberhaus, who obtained a screenshot of a new attack ad against crypto-friendly Californian congressional candidate Brian Forde .\nForde’s retweet of Oberhaus’ article and the screenshot.\nDevised by the campaign of Dave Min, who is vying against Forde for the Democratic nomination to represent California’s 45th congressional district, the ad portrays Forde’s received bitcoin donations in a hyper-stereotypical light.\nContext of the Ad\nForde, a former leader of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative and adviser to the Obama White House on crypto-assets, began accepting political contributions in bitcoin after a former MIT colleague refused to donate in fiat.\nSince then, the candidate has raised thousands of dollars worth of BTC and now welcomes donations in ether, too.\nForde’s donation page – both BTC and ETH accepted.\nMin’s attack ad focuses in on Forde’s embrace of cryptocurrencies , with its narrator linking bitcoin trading as pure speculation and arguing the crypto’s supporters “oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nIn responding to the ad, Forde’s indignance was clear, remarking that Min was partaking in a cheap shot that misrepresented what his supporters stood for:\n“These comments about my supporters are sensationalist, wildly inaccurate, and in line with my opponent’s lack of understanding of the technology. If they were speculating they wouldn’t have donated to my campaign in Bitcoin. They didn’t HODL, they donated to my campaign in Bitcoin because they believe in the technology.”\nFirst of More to Come\nWith bitcoin in its crosshairs, Min’s attack ad certainly won’t be the last.\nThat’s due to the nature of American politics. In recent years, many observers have noted the increasingly unsportsmanlike nature of intra-party and inter-party attack ads in the U.S. political arena.\nIn other words, everyone’s going for the jugular in campaign season — Democrats vs. Democrats and Republicans vs. Republicans during the primaries, and then the consolidated sides against one another during general election season.\nTo this end, making spurious, over-hyped insinuations is the name of the game when it comes to trying to link your political opponent, whoever they may be, to scandal. Almost anything goes — even if ridiculous under scrutiny.\nMin’s bid was and is to make it seem like Forde is turning a blind eye to what amounts to a rampantly immoral caricature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

It’s about kicking up as much dust as you can and causing your opponents a headache with whatever rock you can chuck.\nAlas, the bitcoin attack ads are surely just beginning as crypto sees rising use in political contributions.

In the second half of 2017, it climbed dramatically to nearly $20,000, but descended rapidly starting in mid-December. The peak price coincided with the introduction of bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. Rather, it is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.\nBitcoin is a “cryptocurrency”—a digital currency that is not backed by any tangible or intangible assets of intrinsic value. After its launch in January 2009, the dollar price of a bitcoin remained under $1,150 until February 22, 2017, when it increased exponentially for about 10 months, as shown in Figure 1. This explosive growth ended on December 17, 2017, when bitcoin reached its peak price of $19,511. Notably these dynamics aren’t driven by overall market fluctuations, as shown by comparison with the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. Figure 1 Bitcoin prices and S&P 500 stock index Source: Bloomberg.\nThe peak bitcoin price coincided with the day bitcoin futures started trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). In this Economic Letter , we argue that these price dynamics are consistent with the rise and collapse of the home financing market in the 2000s, as explained in Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012). They suggested that the mortgage boom was driven by financial innovations in securitization and groupings of bonds that attracted optimistic investors; the subsequent bust was driven by the creation of instruments that allowed pessimistic investors to bet against the housing market. Similarly, the advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics. What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin with a capital B is a decentralized network that relies on a peer-to-peer system, rather than banks or credit card companies, to verify transactions using the digital currency known as bitcoin with a lowercase b. The first bitcoin was “mined” in 2009 after the anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto published a proof of concept for a currency that uses cryptography, rather than reliable third parties (Nakamoto 2008). Blockchain, the underlying infrastructure and ledger of bitcoin, provides a secure platform for two parties to do business with one another (Chiu and Koeppl 2017 and Berentsen and Schar 2018).\nBitcoin miners contribute computing resources to verify bitcoin transactions and hence maintain blockchain. They are compensated for sharing their computing resources with new bitcoins. The total numbers of bitcoins to be mined has been arbitrarily set at 21 million. When this volume is reached—estimates suggest in 2140—miners will be compensated by transaction fees rather than new bitcoins (Nian and Chuen 2016). Bitcoin price dynamics from the end of 2017 to early 2018 When discussing the price of a currency or an asset like bitcoin, it is useful to separate transactional demand, which arises from using bitcoins in transactions such as purchases of goods and services, from speculative demand, which arises when people are buying bitcoins in the hope that their value will increase. Speculative demand is basically a bet on the price of the underlying asset or currency increasing, because the investor does not need the asset itself. For most currencies and assets, investors have ways to bet on the increase or decline in their value using a variety of financial instruments based on the asset or a currency, so-called financial derivatives.\nBefore December 2017, there was no market for bitcoin derivatives. This meant that it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline in bitcoin price. Such bets usually take the form of short selling, that is selling an asset before buying it, forward or future contracts, swaps, or a combination. Betting on the increase in bitcoin price was easy—one just had to buy it. Speculative demand for bitcoin came only from optimists, investors who were willing to bet money that the price was going to go up. And until December 17, those investors were right: As with a self-fulfilling prophecy, optimists’ demand pushed the price of bitcoin up, energizing more people to join in and keep pushing up the price. The pessimists, however, had no mechanism available to put money behind their belief that the bitcoin price would collapse. So they were left to wait for their “I told you so” moment.\nThis one-sided speculative demand came to an end when the futures for bitcoin started trading on the CME on December 17. Although the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) had opened a futures market a week earlier on December 10, trading was thin until the CME joined the market. Indeed, the average daily trading volume the month after the CME issued futures was approximately six times larger than when only the CBOE offered these derivatives.\nWith the introduction of bitcoin futures, pessimists could bet on a bitcoin price decline, buying and selling contracts with a lower delivery price in the future than the spot price. For example, they could sell a promise to deliver a bitcoin in a month’s time at a lower price than the current spot price and hope to buy a bitcoin during the month at an even lower price to make a profit. With offers of future bitcoin deliveries at a lower price coming through, the order flow necessarily put downward pressure on the spot price as well. For all investors who were in the market to buy bitcoins for either transactional or speculative reasons and were willing to wait a month, this was a good deal. The new investment opportunity led to a fall in demand in the spot bitcoin market and therefore a drop in price. With falling prices, pessimists started to make money on their bets, fueling further short selling and further downward pressure on prices.\nFigure 2 shows the three largest bitcoin price declines in 2017. We scale the three series so that the peak values are equal to 100 on the peak event days. Hence, each point on the figure can be interpreted as a percent of the peak value. The horizontal axis represents the number of days before and after the peak dates. The price decline following the issuance of bitcoin futures on the CME (red line) is clearly larger than in the previous two reversals. Additionally, the two earlier decreases in prices returned to pre-crash levels in about a month. As of late April, the bitcoin price had not returned to its pre-futures peak. Figure 2 Comparison of three largest bitcoin price declines in 2017 Source: Bloomberg, authors’ calculations.\nThis is not the first time that markets observed a turning point following the introduction of a new instrument, as Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012) show for the more complex mortgage-backed securities market. The mechanism they describe hinges on the same driving force of optimistic and pessimistic traders.\nWhy, then, did the price of bitcoin fall somewhat gradually rather than collapse overnight? The answer to this is difficult. It could be that pessimistic investors lack the attention, willingness, or ability to enter the market on the first day or week of trading. Consistent with this assertion, the total volume of transactions in the CME futures market started very low, with an average trading volume of contracts promising to deliver approximately 12,000 bitcoins during the first week of trading, relative to the estimated spot market turnover of 200,000 bitcoins. Is there a fundamental price of bitcoin? So where is the price of bitcoin going? This is a very difficult question, and we do not pretend to be able to forecast bitcoin prices, nor will we offer any guesses. Instead, we outline a few factors that may affect the fundamental price of bitcoin, which is where we would expect the price to go in the long run, once speculative demand by optimists and pessimists balances out.\nThe supply of bitcoins is determined by the volume of bitcoin currently in circulation and the additional volume to be mined. The decision to mine a bitcoin depends on the cost and benefit from mining. Hayes (2015) estimated a bitcoin mining cost in 2015 of around $250, which was close to the bitcoin price at the time. More generally, however, the mining cost of bitcoin should not affect its value any more than the cost of printing regular currency affects its value—basically not at all.\nGiven that there is no actual asset that backs the value of bitcoin and it doesn’t provide a natural hedge as insurance against sharp moves in any other asset’s value, what will eventually determine the “fundamental” price of bitcoin is transactional demand relative to supply. We know that bitcoin is used as a means of exchange in a number of markets. The amount of bitcoins needed for these markets to function constitutes transactional demand. The supply growth of bitcoin is becoming more limited as the mining price increases. If transactional demand grows faster than supply, we would expect the price to grow.\nTransactional demand in turn depends on a number of factors. One is the availability of substitutes. If a different cryptocurrency becomes more widely used as a means of exchange in the markets currently dominated by bitcoin, demand for bitcoin may drop precipitously because these tend to be winner-takes-all markets. Second, if traditional financial institutions become more willing to accept bitcoin as collateral, a means of payment, or a direct investment, demand may increase substantially. Finally, official recognition and regulatory acceptance of bitcoin as a means of payments would increase its circulation, while regulatory constraints or introduction of transaction fees may reduce it. Conclusions We suggest that the rapid rise of the price of bitcoin and its decline following issuance of futures on the CME is consistent with pricing dynamics suggested elsewhere in financial theory and with previously observed trading behavior. Namely, optimists bid up the price before financial instruments are available to short the market (Fostel and Geanakoplos 2012). Once derivatives markets become sufficiently deep, short-selling pressure from pessimists leads to a sharp decline in value. While we understand some of the factors that play a role in determining the long-run price of bitcoin, our understanding of the transactional benefits of bitcoin is too imprecise to quantify this long-run price. But as speculative dynamics disappear from the bitcoin market, the transactional benefits are likely to be the factor that will drive valuation. Galina B.

I called it nothing more than an “ insidious currency scam .”\nLo and behold, one of the most prominent Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, disappeared this week.\nLike a thief in the night, it moved offices, shuttered its Twitter account and closed down its website – without any explanation.\nAnd just like that, every sucker who owned any Bitcoins on the exchange lost everything.\nLike Erik Voorhees, the man behind Bitcoin-sharing website, Coinapult.com. He had over 550 Bitcoins on Mt. Gox, worth almost $300,000. As he conceded, “I will never get any of that back.”\nNo. You won’t.\nIf you’re also among the unlucky ones, don’t say I didn’t warn you.\nHeck, don’t say the Bitcoin insiders didn’t warn you, either.\nBack in April 2013 – in an incredibly tragic twist of irony – Mark Karpeles, Chief Executive of the now-defunct Mt. Gox, said, “If you buy Bitcoins, you should [keep] in mind that the value could be zero the day after.”\nWell, thanks to you, Mr. Karpeles, that day has officially arrived.\nAs a result, ex-Federal Reserve Bank examiner, Mark T. Williams, says that the “high-profile collapse could trigger a Lehman Brothers-type chain reaction throughout the Bitcoin market.”\nI couldn’t agree more… Stolen Goods\nTo be fair, trouble has been brewing at Mt. Gox, which once handled 80% of all Bitcoin trading, ever since it halted customer withdrawals on February 7. But that was supposed to be a temporary move, whereas this one appears permanent.\nI say that because, in the aftermath of the sudden closure this week, documents surfaced revealing that Mt. Gox held just 2,000 Bitcoins, while customer deposits totaled almost 625,000 Bitcoins.\nThe reason for the discrepancy? Theft!\nAs a result of a technological vulnerability, hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins, worth more than $300 million, were stolen. The size of the heist represents about 6% of all the Bitcoins in circulation.\nMaking matters worse, the theft went “unnoticed for several years.” That means Mt. Gox has been operating as a sham this whole time.\nIt also means there’s no chance that the masses will ever put any trust in Bitcoins. How can they after a development like this? Damage Control\nIn the immediate aftermath of the news, the remaining Bitcoin exchanges and prominent early-stage investors went into full-on crisis management mode, issuing bold statements to “reassure investors of both Bitcoin’s viability and their own security protocols,” as Reuters described.\nThey couldn’t possibly be biased, now could they?\nMy personal favorite defense comes from Voorhees: “Let me suggest that the lesson is not that Bitcoin is broken. Bitcoin is fine. We are building a new financial order, and those of us building it, investing in it, and growing it, will pay the price of bringing it to the world… Devastation will befall us repeatedly.”\nUmmm, where do I sign up to be a part of that? No thanks! Regulators, Mount Up!\nAll the reassurances in the world aren’t comforting anyone.\nCase in point: The downward trend in average Bitcoin prices, excluding the Mt. Gox exchange, continues to this day.\nUltimately, the failure of Mt. Gox proves that self-regulation doesn’t work. Even diehard Bitcoin believers realize this.\nLast month, Jeremy Liew, a leading Bitcoin investor at Lightspeed Venture Partners, vigorously opposed regulation. Now he thinks it’s an absolute must for mainstream adoption.\nAnd yet, freedom from regulation is the whole point of the Bitcoin experiment, right? That’s how all the early adopters pitched it, at least. But we can go ahead and flush that pipedream down the toilet. When There’s One Cockroach…\nLike good opportunists, the two largest remaining exchanges, BTC-e and Bitstamp, are trying to fill the void left by Mt. Gox. But, as the saying goes, when there’s one cockroach, there are many more.\nOr as Williams asserts, “The problems at Mt. Gox are not isolated; they are systemic to the Bitcoin industry.”\nIndeed. What happened at Mt. Gox could happen anywhere else. Hackers are that good. And with Bitcoin prices still above $500, more than enough incentive exists.\nOn a more practical level, in the wake of the Mt. Gox failure, are you really ready to wire money to Bulgaria or Slovenia or Cyprus and trust it will be handled securely? And are you willing to wait several days for Bitcoin trades to settle? Because that’s what investing in Bitcoins requires.\nAnd are you really ready to put your trust in a cryptocurrency with a Vice Chairman on its foundation who was recently accused of money laundering?\nBottom line: Bitcoin’s days are numbered. Literally. Williams predicts that Bitcoin “will trade for under $10” by June 30, 2014. A bold prediction, no doubt. But the point is clear – Bitcoin doesn’t stand a chance at ever gaining widespread adoption. Or as Dennis Gartman says bluntly, Bitcoin is “nothing more than a scam of the first order.”\nMy advice? The same as Gartman’s: “Utter and complete avoidance of all things Bitcoin related.”\nIf you’re absolutely dead set on throwing away some money, consider technology blogger extraordinaire John Gruber’s approach: “In lieu of Bitcoin, I’ve stuck to flushing $100 bills down a toilet. I’m deep in the red, but at least I understand exactly what’s going on.”\nAhead of the tape,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "louis basenese", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik voorhees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark karpeles", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:50:42.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be48aa56df8e5294b7dccf8f63d73e264f3ea8d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_93VOWqUBRKjottPlWXYAa5OOCTT9ULoas_j.nRah.7_mgt3eEdXaKaVNSEND_iM4ji6CTqYYbtulI0AXdhX.6_IXVQL3Bqy8OxsKwA0MpVw--", "site_full": "www.netnewsledger.com", "site": "netnewsledger.com", "site_section": "http://www.netnewsledger.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NetNewsLedger", "title": "Using the Bitcoin Investment Vehicle to Your Advantage", "title_full": "Using the Bitcoin Investment Vehicle to Your Advantage", "published": "2018-05-23T11:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be48aa56df8e5294b7dccf8f63d73e264f3ea8d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_93VOWqUBRKjottPlWXYAa5OOCTT9ULoas_j.nRah.7_mgt3eEdXaKaVNSEND_iM4ji6CTqYYbtulI0AXdhX.6_IXVQL3Bqy8OxsKwA0MpVw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Abel Anderson", "published": "2018-05-23T11:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Using the Bitcoin Investment Vehicle to Your Advantage", "text": "Bitcoin – The virtual currency could very well change the shape virtual financial dealings in the upcoming years\nNEW YORK – The term “ bitcoin investment vehicle ” is reasonably new. The result of that is that a lot of people use it without really understanding what they mean. When bitcoin first started, it was possible for people to purchase them quite cheaply, hoping that they would be able to grow their value over time. That is precisely what an investment vehicle does.\nHowever, Bitcoin and other digital currencies were first launched in 2009 and they are now wholly different from what they were then. In 2009, mining a bitcoin was incredibly easy, meaning that the Queen was also almost worthless. It wasn’t until the network became larger and more people became interested in Bitcoin that the value grew as well. With interest in cryptocurrency growing, the price also increased with the greatest increase happening between 2010 and 2013. Indeed, in the latter year, the value grew to $1,163 . After that, it’s started to slowly drop again.\nThe Bitcoin Investment Vehicle\nBetween 2014 and 2015, the price of Bitcoin dropped slowly but surely, even though more and more merchants started to accept it as a form of payment. Additionally, an increasing number of businesses started to launch digital wallets. According to many financial experts, this was the beginning of the end for bitcoin. Yet, the opposing school of thought was that this was a clear beginning of a new era in which digital currency would disrupt the existing markets. Some even said that it Harold the beginning of the end for fiat currencies.\nFinancially speaking, cryptocurrencies went through a bubble and bubble burst. This seems to happen with all types of Investments come up with most of us remembering the housing bubble burst of 2007 and 2008. That is a good analogy because although the housing market crashed, people continued and will always continue to require housing. Hence, although the value of Bitcoin crashed, it certainly did not mean the end of the cryptocurrency.\nToday, Bitcoin continues to be an incredibly interesting investment vehicle. Cryptocurrencies have changed the the way that people perceive money because it has planted a thought provoking and the positive seed of doubt. Considering the Great Recession is still fresh in many people’s minds, it stands to reason that people are looking at creative and innovative ways to improve the economy. Because bitcoin is fully decentralized and highly transparent, while at the same time being nearly fully anonymous, it seems to be the exact solution that everybody has been waiting for.\nOne of the key benefits of Bitcoin is that it does not operate within the modern financial system. While this is precisely what governments find so frightening about it, the reality is that it allows underbanked nations and individuals to access currencies so long as they have an internet connection. As such, bitcoin is also about global social improvement, something that many would say is the exact opposite of what other currencies are about. When you invest in bitcoin, therefore, you may just help to make the world a better place.\nThe Article Using the Bitcoin Investment Vehicle to Your Advantage by Abel Anderson first appeared on NetNewsLedger - News at the Speed of the Internet ©\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:23:02.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42e5f3cdf69e44a9b73585df90c3306a2d307f03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1raBHtW2ClcpvuAMeoNgfL0", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager", "title_full": "kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager", "published": "2018-05-23T11:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42e5f3cdf69e44a9b73585df90c3306a2d307f03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1raBHtW2ClcpvuAMeoNgfL0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T11:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager", "text": "17 hours ago kidnappers demand ransom in bitcoin to free teenager A criminal gang in South Africa which kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday is demanding a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency of nearly 120,000, dollars police said.
