There were just 89 lightning payment channels on 19 January 2018, but now there are over 6,600 .\nThe lightning network is a scalability solution for Bitcoin that can massively reduce transaction fees while drastically increasing transactions per second. The lightning network was developed and launched during a time when Bitcoin transaction fees hit all-time highs of nearly 60 USD , making it practically unusable as a currency. The high fees were the result of people sending more transactions than the network could handle, over a quarter million transactions were unconfirmed and sitting in the mempool on 22 December 2017 .\nA payment channel on the lightning network is created when two users send Bitcoins into a multi-signature wallet, and the transaction opening the channel is stored on the blockchain. The users can then send bitcoins back and forth to each other completely off-chain, using smart contract technology. A ledger is kept by both parties, and after each lightning network transaction between the parties, they sign an updated ledger with their private keys.\nUsers can send an infinite amount of transactions through a lightning network channel without paying any transaction fees, and all the payments occur within a fraction of a second rather than the average of 10 minutes that it takes for transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain to confirm.\nEither party involved with a lightning network channel can broadcast the last valid ledger which was signed by both parties to the blockchain, at which point the bitcoins locked up in the multi-signature address will be disbursed to both parties according to the final ledger entry. This is designed so that neither party in a channel can back out of a payment that has already been agreed upon and mutually signed.\nEssentially, when using the lightning network there are only two transactions ever recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain for each payment channel; the transaction which creates the channel and the transaction which ends the channel, and all transactions in-between are off-chain.\nThis has the potential to allow for many orders of magnitude more Bitcoin transactions per second than the blockchain can handle by itself. Right now there are less than 10 Bitcoin transactions per second, but the lightning network could handle millions or billions of transactions per second , blowing Visa out of the water.\nThe lightning network still has some development to undergo before it is perfected and made impervious to hacks, but the fact that there are thousands of payment channels now open is a good indicator that it is functional. The lightning network will provide the framework for solving Bitcoin’s scalability problem over a long term. It will allow Bitcoin to be useful as a currency no matter how high the price or transaction volume gets, and therefore the lightning network is essential for Bitcoin becoming a widely adopted global currency.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews Image Source: Pixabay", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "https://medium.com/@argongroup/bitcoin-lightning-network-7-things-you-should-know-604ef687af5a", "https://lightning.network/", "https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,1y", "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8m6wfd/lightning_20180119_89_channels_20180524_6600/", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:37:56.086+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8877bc3509965e3e194b00538878627484ea025", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTRRboFdfE01_bBAYebJhYE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin will silence its haters...", "title_full": "Bitcoin will silence its haters...", "published": "2018-05-28T03:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8877bc3509965e3e194b00538878627484ea025", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTRRboFdfE01_bBAYebJhYE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gledek", "published": "2018-05-28T03:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin will silence its haters...", "text": "I think only people who do not know the bitcoin that hates bitcoin.

All markets are bleeding value for nearly five full months now. There are various factors which may contribute to this ongoing decline. Besides potential market manipulation, a few other trends are also worth taking into account. The Negative Cryptocurrency Trends Perhaps the most common trend comes in the form of technical analysis. While an interesting metric, it doesn’t always tell the entire story. Even so, a lot of industry experts swear by TA, and the outlook is not looking all that great. It seems no major changes should be expected, which means the price declines will carry on for some time to come. As is always the case, cryptocurrency price trends can change on a whim’s notice. The overall interest in cryptocurrency jobs also seems to bottom out. Fewer companies have Bitcoin or other crypto-related job offerings. This is in stark contrast to the blockchain-oriented job openings, which do not suffer from this same decline. This seemingly further confirms the separation between blockchain and cryptocurrency is imminent. How that will play out exactly, is anybody’s guess at this point. Additionally, the overall Google Search Trend for cryptocurrency has also taken a big dip. In late 2017, the global interest in cryptocurrency sparked all of a sudden. Given the price increases at that time, it was only normal. However, this year has been pretty different, and the Google Trends are following the price trend as of right now. Lower interest in cryptocurrency usually results in lower prices. The Positive Trends in Cryptocurrency Despite all of the negativity, not everything is doom and gloom. Overall interest in cryptocurrencies by financial institutions is on the rise. Ever since CBOE and CME begun offering Bitcoin futures, other service providers have been looking into this option as well. While no services have been officially launched, various banks mull launching a cryptocurrency trading desk. Secondly, people are leaving Wall Street in favor of cryptocurrency ventures. This “exodus’ has become a lot more apparent over the past few months. People are leaving high positions to venture into cryptocurrency with no real guarantees. A remarkable decision, although an intriguing one. This further confirms Wall Street experts have high hopes for the cryptocurrency industry moving forward. Last but not least, cryptocurrencies make a lot of positive headlines. Verge’s partnership with Pornhub got a lot of attention from the media. There’s also the Rumor about TRON creator Justin Sun buying BitTorrent Inc. Plus, Silicon Valley’s current season had paid a lot of attention to various aspects about cryptocurrency. All of this seems to hint at bigger and better things to come.

When BTC is fumbling in the market like in the current market times, every other coin and token also fumbles. This is because BTC dominates the total market capitalization by occupying 38.4% of the current total market cap of $326.6 Billion at the moment of writing this.Coincidentally, this was just hours before the BTC futures started being offered by the CME group amidst lots of fanfare and delight of crypto-traders who saw this as a sign of crypto joining the mainstream of investing. However, a few traders were wary of Wallstreet getting into the business and warned that the ‘big shots’ in the big investment firms, will probably find a way to short BTC and any other crypto out there. Coincidentally, the value of BTC and the entire market capitalization started to depreciate after the CME Bitcoin futures started being offered.These type of manipulations can only be done by institutional investors, large-scale traders and any other large entity that can do this. If it is possible for the same institutional investors to manipulate Wallstreet with all its regulations, then the crypto-market would be stealing candy from a child for them. Such moves of manipulation have been popularized by Hollywood movies such as Wallstreet (1 2), The Big Short and Margin Call. Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service.

Even if there are announcements supportive of individual cryptos as Bitcoin , we are not seeing any strong movement on the charts. Only lower lows and negative gains across the board is what we see. Despite everything, news of US DoJ and CFTC looking into possible market manipulation is a good thing for investors desirous of smooth volatility. From the News\nStraight from Argentina’s Banco Masventas to Czech Republic’s Prazska Plynarenska, there is a changing tide on the horizon guys! It’s a monitoring tide, that which could lift cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin hopefully to new levels.\nIn a bid to remain relevant and not to be perceived as “old” by the young people of Czech Republic, their energy giant distributor Prazska Plynarenska will from June 2018 begin accepting payment in Bitcoin . It came as no surprise though. The country is a host of several Bitcoin ATMs and several eCommerce platforms accept payment in Bitcoin. However, while elaborating, the company was categorically stating that they won’t be holding any Bitcoin themselves. Instead what would happen is that every time a customer settles their electricity bill in Bitcoin, conversion to fiat-national reserve currency Koruna-will be immediate. Moves like these buoy the cryptocurrency market and in the future-and following the lead of Argentina and Japan, more countries would follow suit and legitimize cryptos.\nWhile this was happening, the US DoJ is looking into what appears to be collective pump and dump efforts. For the keen eyed, this is something that is needed and of course, eyes will be popping soon considering the unregulated nature of cryptos. In the crypto world, especially for traders trading against BTC, wild moves are common. As a matter of fact, it’s not a surprise to see Bitcoin prices swinging more than $1,000 within some few minutes. This worries many and now, together with the CFTC, the DoJ are investigating to check the level of this manipulation and fraud they are sure exists in the market. Efforts of spoofing-where unscrupulous traders place and pull different orders simultaneously or wash trading activities will in the coming days attract the keen eyes of the justice department.

This mirrors the decline in the valuation of bitcoin and most other digital assets during this timeframe. On December 14, almost half a million BTC transactions were recorded in a single day. By February, this figure was averaging below 200,000 a day. On April 24, the number peaked at 254,000, but has since declined, reaching a low of 158,000 on May 26, according to Bitinfocharts.com .\nIn early April, the median BTC transaction fee dropped to under 10 satoshis per byte before rising to almost 40 sats by the end of the month. As of yesterday, May 26, the median fee was back below 10 sats/byte once more.

They now stand at $0.0038 per transaction, a significant increase in the space of a month but still three times cheaper than bitcoin core, at $0.113. When fees are unusually low, shrewd BTC holders use the opportunity to consolidate their unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This is done by sending all of the dust in their wallet to a BTC address they control. That way, when bitcoin core fees inevitably rise again, they’ll be able to save money on fees because each transaction will contain less UTXOs, making it smaller and thus cheaper.\nDo you think BTC fees will stay low, or is this just a temporary dip?

He explained :\nEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive.\nNevertheless, the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been hurting this month. After reaching highs of roughly $20,000 late last year, Bitcoin has fallen more than 50 percent in 2018 — and worries remain that the hemorrhaging is far from over. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $7,220.00, with some analysts fearing prices below $6,000 are likely on their way.\nStill, Bogart remains bullish on Bitcoin. He told CNBC:\nBut when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing. Could bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely. Altcoins Are ‘Over-Promising and Under-Delivering’\nBogart’s bullish sentiment does not extend to altcoins, however. He told CNBC that the majority of cryptocurrencies available to trade are “over-promising and under-delivering,” adding:\nMeanwhile, you have a few [cryptocurrencies] that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\nThe venture capitalist also told CNBC that he recommends selling fan favorites Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), IOTA, (MIOTA), and NEO (NEO). “A lot of those tokens are overvalued,” Bogart explained. “They could be go [sic] up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.”\nThe partner at Blockchain Capital is also cautious in regards to Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and dominant launchpad for initial coin offerings (ICOs). Bogart explained that the sheer amount of ICOs built on top of Ethereum is cause for concern, particularly if those ICOs don’t succeed.\nOn the other hand, Bogart recommends holding the other major players like Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and EOS (EOS) under current market conditions.\nDo you share Bogart’s belief that Bitcoin is still a strong buy? Do you think investors should be unloading their altcoins, or do you think such a move would be foolish at this point?

On April 24, the number peaked at 254,000, but has since declined, reaching a low of 158,000 on May 26, according to Bitinfocharts.com .\nIn early April, the median BTC transaction fee dropped to under 10 satoshis per byte before rising to almost 40 sats by the end of the month. As of yesterday, May 26, the median fee was back below 10 sats/byte once more. Median fees are taken as being a more useful metric than looking at average fees, for as Coinmetrics.io explains , “Median figures are generally much more informative for data like fees or transaction value since the data is normally extremely (positively) skewed”. The number of daily BTC transactions has been dropping BCH Is Still 3x Cheaper Than BTC to Send\nOn May 24, the number of BTC transactions utilizing Segwit reached an all-time high of 38%. This will have contributed to reducing median fees, although many believe that Segwit’s role in doing so has been overstated, with one assessment pointing out the role that transaction batching has played in fee reduction. Median BTC fees are at their lowest in years\nOn the bitcoin cash network, fees reached their three-month low on April 2, hitting a median of $0.0018. They now stand at $0.0038 per transaction, a significant increase in the space of a month but still three times cheaper than bitcoin core, at $0.113. When fees are unusually low, shrewd BTC holders use the opportunity to consolidate their unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This is done by sending all of the dust in their wallet to a BTC address they control. That way, when bitcoin core fees inevitably rise again, they’ll be able to save money on fees because each transaction will contain less UTXOs, making it smaller and thus cheaper.\nDo you think BTC fees will stay low, or is this just a temporary dip?

With the crypto market place dropping 18% due to the fact May possibly 20, trader sentiment has been wavering more than the previous few weeks. There are, on the other hand, numerous reasons to continue being bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum and the entire set of cryptocurrencies. Here’s why: Regulation\nThe regulations on Bitcoin and other cryptos across the world are now being passed explicitly and there’s only a little room for ambiguity. This helps to encourage big-money, institutional investors to get involved in the space. Fran Strajnar, CEO of Brave New Coin , explained to Forbes :\n“Bitcoin is trading upwards for a number of reasons. The U.S. is stepping in to regulate security tokens instead of commodity assets (utility) and we are seeing major value investors stepping into buy as a result […] As the Soros’ and the Rockefellers’ of the world move into this ecosystem, this asset class is legitimized and trending in an extremely positive direction.”\nIn fact in April, Soros Fund Management’s Adam Fisher has received internal approval to trade digital currencies, which has since sparked Bitcoin’s full-blown recovery. Adoption Prices Are On a Surge\nCryptocurrency adoption is currently accelerating at a higher level. The full sum of active Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets have significantly improved , info obtainable from BitInfoCharts assembled by Chris McCann suggests that the total range of lively Bitcoin wallets is steadily rising at around $24 million.\nEqually, the overall variety of Ethereum addresses is developing fast, tripling since the beginning of 2017.\nA the latest study performed by Finder reveals that above 16.3 million Americans at present personal some type of cryptocurrency, over 8% of the full US inhabitants. A similar report released by Lendingblock in March 2018 found that 55% of study respondents imagine that cryptocurrency buys will be commonly readily available in retail suppliers within the next 7 a long time.\nOne particular of the key boundaries to mainstream buyer adoption is arguably the separation involving cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, crypto debit cards supply a alternative to this concern, but have turn into much less extensively-employed subsequent to the early 2018 culling of Visa-backed crypto cards. Scalability\nScalability continues to be a pivotal difficulty in the enhancement of cryptocurrencies, the present transaction capability of Ethereum and Bitcoin is still significantly from payment platforms these types of as Visa or PayPal. Scaling solutions for both equally networks, even so, are near to implementation, opening the doorway to common adoption and big-scale dispersed applications.\nEthereum’s scaling alternative has been beneath progress for quite a few years now and is commencing to yield results. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin just lately unveiled a small sharding protocol initiative that lets developers to generate and take a look at infrastructure applying compounds of the sharding option. Enterprise-Scale Adoption is Accelerating\nThe underlying technological innovation that drives cryptocurrencies is beginning to seize the awareness of business companies. Major Fortune 500 corporations are now investing greatly in blockchain technological innovation. Outlier Ventures, a United kingdom-dependent enterprise agency, maintains an lively company investigation tracker that lists about 280 providers that are at the moment conducting intense investigate into distributed ledger technology, which include Boeing, IBM, Amazon, and Western Union. The ICO Paradigm Shift\nThe preliminary coin featuring ecosystem has turn out to be a double-edged sword for cryptocurrencies in common, concurrently raising all round awareness of cryptocurrencies and the electronic asset sector although delivering a system for fraudsters in what is a mostly unregulated ecosystem.\nThe latest investigation signifies that pretty much 20% of all ICOs are cons, demonstrating the will need for reform in the ICO sector.\nIt’s hugely very likely that the “new normal” of token distribution will target strictly on the institution of network consequences, shifting to airdrops in buy to achieve quick effect and swift progress.

The subway gets more than 1.6 million people in daily foot traffic and is one of the busiest metro systems in Europe. The General Bytes machines are located at Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nádraží. Moreover, General Bytes provides a detailed map and description of each location on the website.\nA map of the ten Prague Metro machines manufactured by General Bytes.\nThe new machines will likely get some use in the region as Prague is considered a booming cryptocurrency hub, as the area is filled with quite a lot of crypto-enthusiasts. For instance, the area is home to the Crypto Anarchy Institute, Paralelní Polis , and a few cryptocurrency businesses including the ATM manufacturer General Bytes. General Bytes Has Manufactured 27% of the World’s Bitcoin ATMs\nThe Czech government is relatively friendly towards cryptocurrencies and politicians haven’t regulated virtual currencies or defined them as a currency or commodity like other nation states. However, the subject is being discussed among tax officials and the Czech National Bank wrote a paper last year called “Don’t be Afraid of Bitcoin.” Last year the well known online retailer, Alza, added cryptocurrency payments and installed two Bitcoin ATMs in the company’s showroom. Just three days ago one of the largest energy suppliers in the Czech Republic, Pražská Plynárenská, announced it was accepting BTC for payments.\nCzech Republic map of cryptocurrency ATMs.\nWith the ten new machines, the Czech Republic will now have a total of 46 Cryptocurrency ATMs and 27 of those devices are located in Prague.

In response, cryptocurrency researcher and analyst Willy Woo explained that a 2014-like fall to the $3,000 region is unlikely, given the difference in the market structure between now and three years ago. Consolidation Period\nBrandt’s bold call is based on the likelihood of consolidation below the $6,000 mark that would resonate with the most prominent correction of bitcoin’s history in 2014. Sponsored Links\n“The question to ask is whether we can unwind from December 2017’s mania in the $6,000 – $7,000 range, or that fails, and we’re forced to consolidate lower like in 2014. This was the moment of truth in 2014. When support broke, and we were forced to unwind at the lower levels,” said Woo . The Ecosystem has Come a Long Way Since 2014\nHowever, Woo emphasized that in 2018, he does not see similar weaknesses the cryptocurrency market had in 2014. Over the past four years, significantly large sums of capital have flown into the cryptocurrency market. The daily trading volume, market infrastructure, and market valuation of cryptocurrencies have significantly improved and are not comparable to 2014.\nMore importantly, over the past five months, the cryptocurrency market has endured three sizeable corrections, starting with an initial correction in early February. Every succeeding pullback recorded smaller sell-offs than previous corrections, suggesting that bears are being squeezed out and traders are not comfortable liquidating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at current levels.\nBased on a variety of indicators such as the NVT ratio, fractal patterning, and fundamental factors, and the entrance of institutional investors and retail traders as portrayed by the abrupt decision of major banks such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to enter the cryptocurrency market, Woo noted that the price of bitcoin might drop to $6,000 in the worst scenario.\n“Through the industry grapevine, there’s lots of money on the sidelines waiting to scoop up cheap. Huge buy demand on the OTC markets. Institutional money awake to the BTC and preparing to enter. So yeah, $3.5k-$4.4k maybe, but I’m thinking we’ll hold up higher, I think $5.5k-$6k region at worst. Just a guess, not a model,” Woo added.\nFrom a technical standpoint, crypto traders have been comparing the path of the market to bitcoin’s long-term decline in 2014-2015, suggesting the same fractal pattern is playing out, but perhaps in a quicker fashion. Will Institutional Investors Enter in 2018?\nIn early May, former Goldman Sachs executive and regulated bitcoin futures market founder LedgerX Paul Chou stated that the institutional demand for bitcoin as of recent has been unprecedented.\nChou stated that the cryptocurrency market has not seen such demand from large-scale investors in the past and suggested that the significant decline in the price of bitcoin from its peak near $20,000 is alluring investors into the market.\n“The industry is seeing unprecedented institutional interest for the first time in Bitcoin’s history. I’ve been amazed that the strongest believers in cryptocurrency often start out the most skeptical. It’s a healthy skepticism. But at some point the perception shifts, and for many institutions — I think we’re finally there,” Chou told Nathaniel Popper of The New York Times .\nSo far, most institutional investors have not committed to the cryptocurrency sector apart from a handful of firms that created funds exclusive to the cryptocurrency market. The next strong rally of bitcoin could be fueled by the allocation of tens of billions of dollars from institutional investors into the leading cryptocurrencies, and analysts like Chou and Woo believe that institutional investors will assist bitcoin in mid-term recovery.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter brandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willy woo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:58:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6f62cb289366e4b0d544661d02004bc2d75f3b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNRYM0rGph5dVJlrD0n37lX8jMNv8vtmuVFcFoCZWv70FKmqL_NPBlnepRYplud68lRX9m4IZC92qQfs5wttSu2N", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Consolidating Above $950 | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Consolidating Above $950 | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.389, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/02/07025501/Bitcoin_Cash_Price_BCH_USD4.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c6f62cb289366e4b0d544661d02004bc2d75f3b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNRYM0rGph5dVJlrD0n37lX8jMNv8vtmuVFcFoCZWv70FKmqL_NPBlnepRYplud68lRX9m4IZC92qQfs5wttSu2N", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Consolidating Above $950 | NewsBTC", "text": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Consolidating Above $950 Aayush Jindal | May 28, 2018 | 4:08 am Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Consolidating Above $950 Aayush Jindal | May 28, 2018 | 4:08 am Key Points Bitcoin cash price is struggling to move above the $1,000 and $1,050 resistances against the US Dollar. There is a connecting bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,010 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently consolidating above the $950 level and is preparing for the next move.\nBitcoin cash price is consolidating in a range against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past $1,010 and the 100 hourly simple moving average for more gains. Bitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThere was no major movement during the weekend above $1,050 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price tested the $950-960 support zone on a couple of occasions. There was no downside break below $950 and the price remained confined in a range. There were a couple of swing moves, but upsides were capped by the $1,020 resistances and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nThe recent swing low was $976 with an upside move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,042 high to $976 low. However, there are many barriers on the upside waiting to prevent gains above $1,010 and $1,040. An immediate resistance is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,042 high to $976 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,010 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is facing a tough challenge near the trend line, $1,040 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A break above $1,010 and $1,040 could open the doors for more gains towards the $1,100 level in the near term. On the downside, the $950 level is an important support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is mostly flat in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is struggling to move above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,040 Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Consolidating Above $950 was last modified: May 28th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "newsbtc bitcoin cash price analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T07:15:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a98da3781457875d7ef185622dcbb2092733a3cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmV3Ib5cnSt65NRJA6h7qI7NLyZSzEiCYLJ45EisG70Vvc_HYV1NHn3xbJ58hBdO4mrn7PpRWylzTMxC.fgb7LDqNp6S49SdDtDM.ITjnoKjzQHMtypg3Yd9Jo8d5GxitQykQcoJS2_sG0-", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "PR: Cryptocurrency Payment Service Platform Sopay Launches Crowdfunding on the LEEKICO Platform - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "PR: Cryptocurrency Payment Service Platform Sopay Launches Crowdfunding on the LEEKICO Platform - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.1, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Banner.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a98da3781457875d7ef185622dcbb2092733a3cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmV3Ib5cnSt65NRJA6h7qI7NLyZSzEiCYLJ45EisG70Vvc_HYV1NHn3xbJ58hBdO4mrn7PpRWylzTMxC.fgb7LDqNp6S49SdDtDM.ITjnoKjzQHMtypg3Yd9Jo8d5GxitQykQcoJS2_sG0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin.Com Pr", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "PR: Cryptocurrency Payment Service Platform Sopay Launches Crowdfunding on the LEEKICO Platform - Bitcoin News", "text": "Copyright © 2014 - 2018 by Bitcoins Channel .

Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCT) countries are those nations which have taken insufficient measure to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other threats to the international financial system. The countries included in the list has been compiled by inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on money laundering.\nThe 11 nations that are included in the list in addition to North Korea are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ethiopia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Vanuatu and Yemen. Advertisement\nAccording to the announcement made by Bithumb, the measures took effect on 27th May and is no longer accepting new users from the nations included in NCCT initiative. Accounts of existing customers will be disabled from 21st June which will allow them to transfer their funds.\nBithumb is Korea’s largest and world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency exchange that witnesses an average daily volume of over $400 million. The ban on NCCT countries should have a very minimal impact on the daily volumes front and profitability of the exchange.\nIn addition, the Korean cryptocurrency giant has also said that it has updated its anti-money laundering policies by implementing the recommendation from South Korean governmental authorities and Korean Blockchain Association, a self-regulatory industry working group. It issued a number of measures and policies for preventing market manipulation and insider trading.\nA spokesperson for Bithumb added:\n“We will strictly enforce our own rules and protect our investors while we actively cooperate with local authorities.”\nSouth Korean authorities have recently turned the heat on cryptocurrency exchanges reversing its earlier position of a crypto- friendly economy. Earlier this month, it has hinted that it is in the process of drafting a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies which is expected by the end of July.\nLiked what you read?

As more people adopt the cryptocurrency, the digital currency has exhibited cracks in its ecosystem, mainly due to the scalability issues. While the rapid growth of the community is one of the contributing factors, the major issues are said to lie with the Bitcoin Core development team and their inability to rapidly introduce scaling solutions. The conflicting views of the developers and mining community have further exacerbated the situation.\nAs the Bitcoin Core community struggle to score the necessary consensus to improve the protocol, various teams have decided to take the matter into their own hands to preserve the “legacy” of Bitcoin by creating improved hard forks of Bitcoin blockchain. Advancing in this sphere is Lightning Bitcoin, a Bitcoin hard fork by the Lightning Team. The Lightning Bitcoin, LBTC, in short, is forked at Block 499,999 of the Bitcoin blockchain and adopts a more efficient Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism instead of the native Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism.\nWith the implementation of DPOS, the platform includes the best of two strong cryptocurrency networks — Bitcoin and EOS. The use of DPOS, not only increases the security but with 2MB block size, it also increases the speed of transactions and optimizes smart contract support. The DPOS consensus mechanism has already been successfully implemented with BitShares and EOS platforms which has further increased the confidence in LBTC’s capabilities.\nWhile the POS consensus mechanism has been hailed by many for its various obvious advantages, including the low processing power requirements and cost-efficient minting solution, it has also shown a fair share of vulnerabilities including the susceptibility to attacks and the possibility of node desynchronization with malicious intent. The Delegated Proof of Stake mechanism implemented by LBTC overcomes most of these vulnerabilities, but still being a synchronous network module exhibited potential loopholes.\nTo overcome the issue, the LBTC developers have introduced DPoS consensus mechanism which can not only provide the benefits of a DPoS blockchain but also presents a Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol which can eliminate the possibility of node dissynchronization due to UTXO. By doing so, LBTC is on its way to position itself as the best cryptocurrency blockchain for not just transactions, but also dApps development.\nMore information about Lightning Bitcoin is available at – http://lbtc.io Lightning Bitcoin Implements DPoS, Set to Become the Best Blockchain Protocol was last modified: May 28th, 2018 by Guest Author Related Posts ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T22:50:25.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f70874de43c74cfc6494fbcc5ff8c26d4c55350", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1MigDyQmuTqb2V8fvqPiqc-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "I sell bitcoin combo list", "title_full": "I sell bitcoin combo list", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f70874de43c74cfc6494fbcc5ff8c26d4c55350", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1MigDyQmuTqb2V8fvqPiqc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "I sell bitcoin combo list", "text": "I am selling a big bitcoin combo list (mail : password)\nPerfect to check accounts on Coinbase and other wallets\nI listen offers on litecoin and dogecoin.\n# Tox ID:\nA99EBF22E8E3792A51E5D539660B9F6FBAEBBCAAF31241DCCC7450ED7F2CB30E35D4F22ED903", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T09:54:48.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6467a9ad3bd7b621266909e4225f536100e1d019", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.tyVjVJq1RvKN7xpj3X2k0-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "title_full": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6467a9ad3bd7b621266909e4225f536100e1d019", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.tyVjVJq1RvKN7xpj3X2k0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite new users and get 0.3 BTC!

That fine line between obsession and irrational exuberance is probably best exemplified in wild price fluxuations, furious buying and selling. At least one historic county in Scotland, Peeblesshire (Siorrachd nam Pùballan), believes they’ve identified bitcoin addicts, and are beginning to treat them in the same manner as those with similar attractions to gambling. Castle Craig Hospital Bitcoin Addicts are a Thing in Scotland\nCrypto addicts could do worse, and that’s for sure: Scotland’s Castle Craig Hospital addiction treatment center is a bucolic, sprawling campus seemingly designed to induce calm and reflection. It’s also home to a first of sorts, according to regional press: a concentrated program set to dealing with a growing phenomenon, cryptocurrency addiction.\nThe hospital’s creative writing coordinator and gambling therapist, Christopher Burn, explains how the “high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.” Christopher Burn\nMr. Burn can be temporarily excused from jumping his lane into speculative finance; a good guess is literally no one seeks him out for economic analysis. But the rest of his point can be valid in the sense of popular anecdotes. At what time in the journey from regular, functional adult to 21 year old Canadian living in a car to save money in order to buy lesser-known crypto, … is it an addiction? What if the example does not involve a ballsy single dude; instead, it’s a family of five with three children, parents in their late 30s, who’ve sold their house in hope of riding the-then booming bitcoin core (BTC) price? Are these examples of addiction or are they simply badass pioneers who know something the rest of us do not? Is Crypto Just Gambling in Disguise? Tony Marini\nTony Marini, on site therapist, and someone who has also struggled with cocaine and gambling addictions himself, details , “Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem. I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they’re not alone.”\nA recurring word, “escape,” permeates both explanations, still admittedly fuzzy in the way of a solid definition. Nevertheless it does seem if crypto occupies too great (?) a space in a person’s mind, to a point where they chronically ignore real, ongoing life around them, they just might have a problem. And since speculative markets very often evidence fast fortunes gained and lost, and gained and lost again, there must be properties of problem behavior similar to gambling addictions (which have been well-documented).\nExperienced in treating addictions such as traditional alcohol and drug problems, Castle Craig Hospital has begun addressing addictions involving cryptocurrency. Indeed, they’re using techniques in the course developed from successful gambling addiction methods. Though more than ten million people worldwide are said to be trading and dealing in cryptocurrency, no firm numbers or percentages exist regarding the amount of people with addictive symptoms.\nDo you think crypto addiction exists?

This is a near $200 drop over the last 24 hours, and the bears are still having their way.\nThe current sentiment is that bitcoin could fall to as low as an even $7,000 over the next few days. The currency has been dropping gradually since Sunday May 13, after it spiked to a new high of roughly $9,800. Maybe bitcoin just doesn’t like Mother’s Day…\nStill, others remain skeptical that bitcoin will stay at the $7,000 position or spike soon after that. Willy Woo, for example, is a cryptocurrency and digital currency analyst. He believes bitcoin could potentially fall below the $6,000 mark in the short term, and test both the $5,700 and $5,500 marks respectively. He cites a high NVT signal, continuously high volatility, an overly high standard NVT, and a volume profile cliff below $6,800 as the four main reasons for his prediction.\n“NVT signal is still too high,” he explains. “We need more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price, or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. To drive up transactional activity in a bear slide is very unlikely. Furthermore, volatility is still too high. I’m looking for a sustained low band of volatility, which tends to be a signal for the end of the detox and the next accumulation phase. It’s still got some time to ride down.”\nNVT signal is a trading indicator that Woo, himself, developed. It is a standard NVT ratio-network valuation divided by transaction value on the blockchain. The figure is then smoothed out using a moving average, which is then applied to the transaction value, creating a more responsive chart.\nWoo did mention, however, that bitcoin isn’t likely to strike the bottom half of the $5,000 range, and that a price correction as steep as the one witnessed in 2014 would not happen. He further stated that a cryptocurrency bull rally would occur again, though not until the third quarter of 2018.\n“So, in summary, my best guess – slow bleed down to $6,800, then a steeper slide to $5,700, then a leveling out of the drop, then a flat zone,” he explained. “This is an educated guess based on volume profile and fundamental data framing the rate of movement.”\nIt’s hard to accept the idea of bitcoin suddenly sinking into oblivion when so many countries are beginning to explore its technology and benefits. Great Britain, for example, has recently published a working paper on the subject, while the Bank of England’s governor Mark Carney states that the institution is open to the idea of a central bank-issued digital currency.\nThis marks a massive change in sentiment, as prior to the G20 Summit in Argentina last March, Carney had been very vocal about the negative side of bitcoin , repeatedly calling the currency a “failure.” He also said that it needed to be “held to higher standards,” and that cryptocurrencies were part of “speculative mania.”\nCarney now believes a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could potentially heighten the region’s presence in the crypto space and assist Britain’s economy.

The last time we have heard about ZClassic, we could have witnessed a strong case of price pumping in the market revolving around ZCL as there have been rumors that another fork is yet to turn the tables for ZClassic.\nWhatever Happened to ZClassic: The Fork Rumors\nRumors can be dangerous for those who have faith, and so it was the case about the false allegations that there is a dev team ready to take over ZClassic and the mentioned fork. The fork didn’t happen and wasn’t planned to happen in the first place and the last time we have heard from the ZCL was on April 26 th , via their official page on Twitter. Is ZClassic dead and has anyone expected this case scenario back when ZClassic was forked out of ZCash?\nThe first time the team behind ZCL addressed the public on this matter was back at the beginning of March with the tweet that was originally posted on March 7 th .\nIn this tweet, posted on the official ZClassic Coin Twitter page, the team addresses the issue of the having rumors going around that ZClassic is having a fork while having this blockchain foundation linked to the Bitcoin Private.\nFurthermore, the initial rumors stated that the Bitcoin Private team will be taking over the ZCL project and that the mentioned team behind this Bitcoin fork is planning on developing the ZClassic project further from that point.\nTo clarify all the misleading information, the team behind ZCL has gone forward with publishing an official press release on Medium where they talked about the future of ZClassic.\nThe Future of ZClassic: A Digital Burial of a Promising Fork\nEven if you weren’t a fan of ZClassic, in case you have read the official release on the future of ZCL, you probably felt uncomfortable knowing that once a promising currency could meet its end as soon as it did.\nIn their official release, the team behind the ZCL wanted to address the problem of the rumors about the new fork waiting for ZClassic. Immediately at the beginning of the topic, they have stated that all allegations that a new dev team is taking over ZClassic are false.\nThey further added that there will be no forks and no new developments and that they are stopping with any further actions regarding the ZClassic network, which means that the team has started to have abandoned this blockchain fork.\nThey have also stated that Bitcoin Private won’t be taking over their project and that the Bitcoin Private Treasury will no longer be in support of their project as Bitcoin Private now demands the funding support of its Treasury.\nThat means that ZClassic has stopped receiving support as of April 1 st , as stated in the official release that was posted back at the beginning of March.\nSo, what does this all mean for ZCL holders?\nApparently, although the team has stated that the ZCL nodes are to be shut down by the beginning of April, which occurred nearly two months ago, they have added that there will be DNS seeder remaining so that the system could acquire a functional level of self-maintaining.\nThe official Electrum wallet for ZCL was shut down at the same time on April 1 st , while ElectrumX peer discovery immediately became available for ZCL users.\nThe team claims that they hold no responsibilities for the integrity of ElectrumX peer discovery, nor they are responsible for the maintenance of the mentioned servers.\nHowever, although it seems that everything is slowly being shut down, while ZCL seems to be dying out among the crypto community, there is a hope that someone will still take over the project after all.\nThat is why the current team of ZCL has opened ZClassic Project Proposal hub where all interested teams can send their proposals on the further development of ZClassic.\nThe interested parties will need to know everything about ZClassic and zk-SNARKS and will need to deliver their proposals in written forms, while the process will be closed for all teams on June 1 st when the hub will be shut down and all submitted proposals reviewed by the current team.\nHopefully, there could be a team among these proposals that might be worthy of taking over this blockchain project and revamping it for the crypto community.\nSo, it seems that not everything looks so lost for ZCL after all, at least until there is a hope for ZCL holders that a prominent team will appear to take over their favorite fork.\nZCL once again made an announcement via Twitter on April 26 th , reminding the public not to believe in the rumors on any mentioned forks or new dev teams taking over ZClassic for further development.\nHow is ZClassic doing at the Current Moment?\nRanked as a far 205 th coin on the global coin ranking list, ZCL is not entirely lost as it still competing in the market.\nFollowing the latest change in the market, ZCL is dropping against the dollar alongside with the majority of top currencies, while going down in the red by -3.81%.\nAfter the most recent change in its value, ZClassic is now worth 11.80$ per one unit as it is still waiting for a dev team that might never come in the worst case scenario.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Theories Emerge Over Rogue BCH Nodes\nAs shown by Coin Dance and uploaded to social media by cryptocurrency commentator Ben Verret Sunday, Bitcoin Cash has so far failed to gain full support for its new fork, which split off from the main chain May 15. 13% of BCash nodes are still not following the new hardfork. https://t.co/AlKs8CyuFB pic.twitter.com/oJecVQ39hX\n— Ben Verret ⚡ (@verretor) May 28, 2018\nThe statistics present fresh controversy around Bitcoin Cash for certain cryptocurrency users, commentators this week also picking up on how Bitcoin (BTC) has outperformed the altcoin for the past week on network cost, and now has lower transaction fees.\nWhen it came into being in August 2017, Bitcoin Cash proponents stated one of its essential features was to provide cheaper transactions than Bitcoin.\nDebating with Verret, however, others suggested the 87% incorporated all nodes still being maintained, claiming the nodes not following the majority consensus were de facto dormant.\n“If they would have any economic value they would continue mining unforked chain,” one response reads. A Tellingly Quiet Disagreement?\nMeanwhile, a similar report on the lack of consensus in Bitcoin Cash post-fork focused on the lack of publicity it received.\nBitcoin core developer Kalle Alm noted that 16-17% of nodes were not following the new chain May 16, adding “everyone would explode” if a similar phenomenon occurred on the Bitcoin network, whose nodes are running at 100 percent with the consensus rules.\n“You can tell BCH is not bitcoin by looking at how not everyone is losing their shit all over the place,” he wrote.\nImagine if 20% of BTC nodes failed consensus? Everyone would explode. And there would be forks as miners are not just one dude running a farm.\nBitcoinVPC creator grubles had gone further, describing the hard fork as “an epic screw up for a network marketed as a store of value and a medium of exchange.”\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin Cash nodes’ inability to form consensus?

Almost 10 years ago, an anonymous hacker known under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto launched this crypto as the first digital coin ever. A couple of years later, there came new coins which followed by having over 1500 ICOs issued and launched over the mentioned period. As we all know, all currencies have their dev teams and CEOs, however, Bitcoin doesn’t.\nSo, how come its price has spiked up to the previous record of around 20.000$ per one unit, if Bitcoin can be marked as an abandoned project with over forty different forks derived from its system as basically, anyone with the matching tools can create a fork out of Bitcoin, and that is how we got Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and even Bitcoin God and Bitcoin Pizza.\nAs much as crypto enthusiasts appreciate the first coin ever to be launched, the Department of Justice in the United State is interested in finding out who is behind the price of Bitcoin. That is why they have announced an investigation that would be conducted in the following period in order to trace the person or a team who stands behind the price of Bitcoin.\nThe US Justice Department: Is Bitcoin Going Under Pump-and-Dump?\nAlmost anyone who is following up with the crypto market knows about a notorious market scheme called pump-and-dump.\nApparently, some holders have acquired this technique in order to have their holding units pumped up to the maximum in the market with having a price that is usually off the charts of the realistic price of the given coin.\nOnce the pumping part is done and the coin has reached a flattering value, the pumpers then dump their coins, which means that they are selling the coins that have been pumped, and then selling them back to the interested traders while collecting profit.\nMoreover, the US Justice Department believes that the signs of spoofing and possibly wash trades could also be discovered in the process of the mentioned investigation.\nSpoofing is another way of pumping the market value of a certain coin. This is conducted in a way that a holder of a certain coin, in this case, BTC, goes ahead and opens an active trade.\nThe great turn out of events that makes up for spoofing lies in the fact that the active trade is never meant to be. So, a holder can open a trade, which consequently affects the price of the given coin to rise up, while the trade never actually occurs, which is considered to be a fraudulent action.\nThat is exactly why the US Justice Department is trying to come to the bottom of this story, which should allow them to discover the great mystery of who stands behind the price of Bitcoin.\nCanada and the United States Investigating Beyond Bitcoin: Operation Crypto Sweep\nThe US Justice Department along with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and The Government of Canada are joining forces with a single project called Crypto sweep.\nWhile SEC is conducting their own investigation on different ICOs that are suspected of violating securities laws, the SEC is in support of the newly announced project Crypto sweep, that way supporting the US and Canada in their investigation.\nBesides from announcing an investigation on who stands behind the price of Bitcoin, the US Department of Justice is going to partner up with Canada with the goal of battling toxic ICOs and scam coins.\nThe US Justice Department will notify the public on their future progress regarding the Bitcoin investigation as well as their progress on Crypto sweep whether they joined their forces with Canada in an attempt to stop all fraudulent actions in the crypto market.\nHow is Bitcoin doing at the Current Moment?\nBitcoin has definitely seen better days, as we can see it at a pretty low price in oppose to its value in April and at the beginning of May.\nAs BTC is now worth around 7500$ per one unit, many reporters are linking this massive fall to the most recent announcement from the US Justice Department that there will be an investigation revolving around Bitcoin, however, if you go ahead and check the stats on CoinMarketCap or Coin Gecko, you will easily notice that the price of BTC went down before the original announcement.\nFollowing the latest change in the market, BTC is up by barely over 1% at this moment, on May 26 th , which means that the first crypto ever and number one on the global coin ranking list can be traded at the price of 7560$ per one unit, as it lost over 15% of its value in the course of the last month.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

MMA Champ Teams up with Bitcoin Cash Canadian Bellator welterweight world champion Rory McDonald , who is an outspoken devotee of cryptocurrency, has made his connection with Bitcoin Cash public in a 30-second video he tweeted out showing him hitting a water bag wearing in a Bitcoin Cash T-shirt. Big fans of yours over here @BitcoinCom Amazing to see you wearing our swag, we’re definitely going to hook you up with some more! @rory_macdonald #bitcoin #BitcoinCash #bch https://t.co/GvAYOK111E — Bitcoin.com Official (@BitcoinCom) May 27, 2018 McDonald has had connections with cryptocurrency since he was introduced to it by a former coach. He has had an ongoing sponsorship deal with Dash and even cites that partnership as his reason for leaving the UFC to fight in Bellator. Calling the move a great opportunity for not only himself but all fighters to improve their stake through pairing with cryptocurrency McDonald contends it’s not just talk, that he truly believes in the movement. He told the media during a phone interview at the start of his Dash partnership “This will be hopefully the first of many sponsorships with Dash and me, it’s not just for me but it’s going to a big opportunity for many other fighters and even Bellator itself … there’s tons of fighters interested in it,” adding at the end; “with cryptocurrency, there’s so many different possibilities as a fighter now that you can get into these different markets and get yourself out there, other than just being in a cage and wearing a uniform and being like everybody else.” The fighter who has in the past requested his purse by paid out in Bitcoin hasn’t announced an end to his connection with Dash but the recent publicity he’s been giving to Bitcoin Cash may mark the end of the deal and the beginning of a new one. Crypto and MMA are a Solid Match MMA and cryptocurrency share the same struggle as a disruptive underdog bucking the odds to gain validity against established if outdated institutions. McDonald is not the first fighter working to bring the two together. Conor Mcgregor , arguably one of the greatest MMA fighters ever and certainly one of the most flamboyant, has made it known that he would like to see UFC accepting cryptocurrency. John Fitch a UFC welterweight contender has also been pushing the league to not only accept but also to pay out in Bitcoin. McDonald feels that Bellator is better positioned to implement cryptocurrency into their structure since they have no binding brand partnerships. The fact that the league is based in Montreal which he calls a very cryptocurrency friendly place is a solid start to what he sees as the future of for both the league’s and his own ongoing relationship with cryptocurrency.

Mzee Jomo at the official opening of Mombasa Branch in 1972 (source; CBK)\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a puzzle especially for regulators. Over the last 4 years our dear Central Bank Governor, Dr. Patrick Njoroge has consistently been opposed to the idea of cryptocurrencies. He issued 2 damning public notices warning the public to stay away and another circular expressly requesting banks to choke any value transfer activity related to cryptocurrencies.\nAs per the Central Bank of Kenya Act, he is well within his right. A bank is a regulated private business. You cannot compel a bank to take you as a customer or take your business. Thus, every once in a while, the governor pulls out his trump card to remind us who is boss.\nBut mounting pressure has pinned the old man against the wall, forcing him to revisit his dogmatism. An article from the Standard dated May 23rd titled “CBK Warms Up to Cryptocurrencies” read\n“CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge said the regulator was open to introducing cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as alternative payment vehicles with the opportunity to reduce fraud.”\nWhile in the past, all the the financial instruments that intermediary companies use for fund transfers were based on fiat currencies, in the forms of cash, bank deposits and electronic money – it is no longer the case with the advent of Bitcoin.\nRather than fight change, the Central Bank of Kenya now seems to be reconsidering its stance on cryptocurrencies as a radically new way of high-speed, low-cost value transfer independent of traditional financial intermediaries.\nSome Background\nIn Kenya, we have what is called the National Payment Systems Act 2011 that birthed the National Payment Systems Regulations 2014 . Both Act and regulations fall under the mandate of the Central Bank, demarcating what counts as an act of payment or circulation of money, who is authorized to move money within and out of the country and all the prerequisites to become a regulated payment service provider.\nFor example A “payment instrument” means any instrument, whether tangible or intangible, that enables a person to obtain money, goods or services, or to otherwise make payment A “payment system” means a system or arrangement that enables payments to be effected between a payer and a beneficiary, or facilitates the circulation of money, and includes any instruments and procedures that relate to the system; A “ payment service provider” means:— (i) a person, company or organisation acting as provider in relation to sending, receiving, storing or processing of payments or the provision of other services in relation to payment services through any electronic system; (ii) a person, company or organisation which owns, possesses, operates, manages or controls a public switched network for the provision of payment services; or (iii) any other person, company or organization that processes or stores data on behalf of such payment service providers or users of such payment services; or (iii) any other person, company or organization that processes or stores data on behalf of such payment service providers or users of such payment services;\nTo become one of these providers, one must apply to the Central Bank of Kenya.\nThe Bone of Contention\nThe emergence of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies set the cat amongst the pigeons by creating platforms that replace the role of institutional actors with a distributed public accounting service and a native financial instrument – virtual currency. Virtual currencies act as a medium of exchange, enabling applications such as: International payments and remittances (alternative to correspondent banking) Online payments Settlements between financial service institutions Domestic and Cross border payments Machine to machine payments Foreign exchange\nSo on the one hand, Central Bankers feel threatened by a super efficient payment network over which they have no control nor oversight.\nOn the other hand, Bitcoiners are caught in a bind every time they need to exchange in and out of traditional fiat currency via bank deposits or mobile money. It’s doubly worse for startups like Bitpesa who see an opportunity to leverage cryptocurrency payment networks to help diaspora send money into Kenya, or Kenyan merchants pay their suppliers in China or Nigerian parents pay school fees for their kids studying in Kenya or young Kenya freelancers get paid for online work or young Africans make payments online with ease – at a fraction of the cost of traditional payment channels.\nThere is a long list of use cases that are not possible because, to complete these transactions, a bank or mobile money account is required on either or both ends. And, the Central Bank of Kenya has a final say on who can use the banking system for moving money.\nA circular to Kenyan banks by the Central Bank of Kenya in December 2015, dashed hopes of building out formal cryptocurrency payment services.\n“The purpose of this circular therefore is to caution all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive will lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank.”\nIn the same year, Safaricom, the largest provider of mobile money gateway services Mpesa, denied services to any payment company dealing in virtual currencies. A subsequent High court case brought against Safaricom for suspending Mpesa access to Bitpesa was upheld by a High Court Judge Onguto.\nSo, till today, while informal workaround exists, there are no formal gateways for cryptocurrency payment services via mobile money and bank.\nA Middle Ground\nBut perhaps there is a middle ground that satisfies both the Central Bank of Kenya and Bitcoin startups.\nThis report by Consult Hyperion for FSD Africa titled Blockchains, Distributed Ledgers and Funds Transfer: An African Overview sheds light on how a public cryptocurrency blockchain like Bitcoin, or Bitcoin cash or others could exist as financial instrument and as a platform for cross-border, high-speed, low-cost value transfers for consumers, businesses and international agencies. The image above is an example of a third-party enabled Bitcoin based remittance model.\nThe National Payments Systems Act presents a window of opportunity for a compromise under Part II that states\n“The Central Bank may, by notice in the Gazette, designate a payment system for the purposes of this Act”\nIt is this section that the Central Bank Governor Dr. Patrick Njoroge alludes to when he proposes cryptocurrency alternative payments systems. As the regulating authority, the bank can use or modify the existing framework it or craft a new framework to allow third-party companies that use cryptocurrency blockchains to be authorized as payment service providers.\nHow it Would This Work?\nSay you are a merchant in Kenya who wants to pay a supplier in Nigeria but feel that the banking payment network is too slow for your liking. In the near future, you could walk up to a company like Bitpesa, sign up as a customer and make a request to wire 100 million KES to your Oga supplier.\nUnder this new regime, Bitpesa would be a regulated digital payment service providers using Bitcoin as an alternative payment network. Thus, they could use a Kenyan bank account to accept funds and a bank account in Nigeria to cash out these funds.\nInter-mediating these two bank accounts, Bitpesa would convert your Kenya shillings to Bitcoin or Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash or whatever cryptocurrency payment rails they saw fit to transmit value on a super fast network to Kenya. Under 30 minutes.\nFor this service, Bitpesa would charge a flat 4% fee for the service with no hidden forex fees and an assurance your suppliers bank account in Nigeria will be credited within hours.\nOn the Nigerian end, Bitpesa would use their pool of funds in a Naira bank account, or from a banking partner and immediately pay out an equivalent amount less 4% into your supplier’s account; thus completing an end to end payment transaction where the parties on both end are KYCd and known.\nAt least half of this new type of virtual currency payment service – what was previously a fiat settlement network – is now made possible by Bitcoin as a settlement network. The merchant and supplier never have to know what happened or how it happened. All they care about is A transparent flat fee is charged for the service A faster money service than traditional banking wire transfer mechanism No volatility risk ( it is all absorbed and taken care of by BitPesa) Bitpesa is a regulated entity They got paid!\nMainstreaming Cryptocurrency Payment Systems for East Africa\nI am confident about this model as a way to mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for real world use cases in the financial industry.\nI do not need to reiterate the high cost of sending money within the continent, even between neighbors like Ghana and Nigeria. Much has been written about the cost in fees, time and lack of transparency in cross border payments in the form of B2B payments, online payment and remittances.\nI suspect this is how the Central Bank of Kenya and Governor Njoroge plan to rein in cryptocurrencies under their oversight.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T22:19:08.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bdcc32ba8aee1828d0c63b64c7df835791d1629d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE50eapSUTXU2bBiGupkw7z6PhFaEknthBadRftWKYpubA_r8YGD2J0.Ryzpg.efmNUPD2efdDo5Y", "site_full": "themerkle.com", "site": "themerkle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Drops to $7,200 – The Merkle", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Drops to $7,200 – The Merkle", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/daily-hcart-2.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90224, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bdcc32ba8aee1828d0c63b64c7df835791d1629d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE50eapSUTXU2bBiGupkw7z6PhFaEknthBadRftWKYpubA_r8YGD2J0.Ryzpg.efmNUPD2efdDo5Y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Drops to $7,200 – The Merkle", "text": "29 May\nAt press time, bitcoin has fallen by another $100, and is now trading for $7,200.

News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

Despite the fact that bitcoin has dropped below the $8,000 and has suffered its worst three-week performance since Q3 2017, now’s not the time to retreat. Bogart, a former equity analyst, told CNBC that investors are getting it wrong and instead of unloading BTC should be kicking overbought altcoins to the curb.\n“If the story erodes and it’s not there, then I’m not going to be bullish on bitcoin. But the long-term thesis is very much intact,” Bogart said, adding that while bitcoin could face some headwinds in the short-term, his minimum horizon for bitcoin trading higher is one year.\nBogart admits that he can’t predict how the bitcoin price is going to unfold in the short-term, and he’s in good company, as bitcoin bulls had been predicting a rally by now. But looking out into the next year or two, the use cases for bitcoin become clearer. For instance, he points to a one-two punch comprised of the institutionalization of bitcoin coupled with currency crises that are unfolding in countries like Venezuela as the catalysts for bitcoin’s longevity.\nAnecdotal signs of bitcoin’s future include the robust turnout during blockchain week in mid-May as well as the major banks that are looking to implement blockchain into their operations in some way including supporting trading in the leading digital currency for clients. Bogart’s Book\nWhile Bogart is bullish on bitcoin, he doesn’t place a rating any higher than hold on the leading altcoins and in fact believes that certain coins are a “sell”. He rates Ethereum a “hold” and points to potential headwinds surrounding the ICO coins that are linked to the network. “Those tokens are overvalued,” he said, noting how ether is the fuel to power the Ethereum network.\nIn addition to ETH, Bogart also attaches a “hold” rating on Ripple, Roger Ver’s favorite coin Bitcoin Cash and EOS. He believes that Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO are overbought and therefore has a “sell” rating on those altcoins. TRON is nearing its migration away from the Ethereum blockchain and onto its own MainNet. What Gives?\nIf there’s one thing that bitcoin has proven in its short history is that it’s a volatile asset. Market participants who have been around since the early days can tell you the recent pricing pressure is nothing new. But what sets this bear market apart, as CNBC panelists pointed out, is the $314 billion market cap for the broader cryptocurrency market. A key difference in this market downturn, Bogart noted, is that market participants no longer have to be reassured that bitcoin isn’t going anywhere.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bogart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain capital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T19:45:57.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "358257c0cacf33216f8fb2844fc20632e16224af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf_PXxyYGWqBrgh4JYgnq2V_3SaCQBdvBs9hnhjmlzGwZJ6Nou.y7WhrFAFVT.zKh..cpNwi6iGzqUK4lDPze3N4-", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Indian Businessman Conned $130,000 in Bitcoin Purchase Scam", "title_full": "Indian Businessman Conned $130,000 in Bitcoin Purchase Scam", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.157, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bitcoin-India-rupee.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "358257c0cacf33216f8fb2844fc20632e16224af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf_PXxyYGWqBrgh4JYgnq2V_3SaCQBdvBs9hnhjmlzGwZJ6Nou.y7WhrFAFVT.zKh..cpNwi6iGzqUK4lDPze3N4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Indian Businessman Conned $130,000 in Bitcoin Purchase Scam", "text": "Inside Fintech • Nov. 29-30, 2018 Inside Fintech Conference & Expo explores Fintech 3.0, including Blockchain technology and other decentralized solutions for financial processes, and its impact on the global financial ecosystem.

Feel free to copy and share this with your friends and family.\nBitcoin’s immense value has some people perplexed . How is an entirely digital currency worth more than an ounce of gold? Moreover, why is there so much interest in Bitcoin?\nThis guide will hold your hand as you enter the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies . Want to know what mining is? Don’t understand what a wallet is? Unsure if Bitcoin is right for you? Here’s everything you need to know in one convenient article. 1. What Is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is a distributed digital cryptocurrency. Unlike regular fiat currency, there is no central Bitcoin bank to print and regulate the flow of currency. Bitcoin is held by users linked together by a central ledger. The ledger is a core Bitcoin feature known as the blockchain What Is Blockchain in Simple Terms and How Does It Work? What Is Blockchain in Simple Terms and How Does It Work? What is blockchain technology and how is it changing the face of the internet? We provide simple answers to your blockchain questions. Read More . The blockchain records every single transaction made using Bitcoin, validating transactions and ensuring the integrity of the network.\nThe idea of a distributed digital currency isn’t especially new. Bitcoin concepts were discussed in cypherpunk mailing lists long ago. Then in 2009, mysterious programmer Satoshi Nakamoto Satoshi Nakamoto Unmasking, Spotify Echo, Vine Porn, Cortana Leak [Tech News Digest] Satoshi Nakamoto Unmasking, Spotify Echo, Vine Porn, Cortana Leak [Tech News Digest] Bitcoin is (allegedly) unmasked, Spotify acquires The Echo Nest, Facebook (finally) settles on its new News Feed design, Vine bans pornography, Microsoft's Siri-alike leaks, and LG releases the creepiest commercial of all time.

Initial uptake was slow The First Bitcoin Was Mined 9 Years Ago Today The First Bitcoin Was Mined 9 Years Ago Today On January 3, 2009, a person by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin. And the rest, as they say, is history... Read More . The first Bitcoin transaction was for two pizzas costing 10,000 BTC (a cool $190,000,000 at the high point of 2017).\nBitcoin has since morphed from a fledgling digital currency into an asset or commodity. In fact, Bitcoin somewhat straddles the median. Its use a currency is limited, it is too volatile to be considered a solid asset, and it is traded similarly to regular stocks and shares.\nBitcoins trade in decimal places. That means you do not have to buy an entire Bitcoin to start using the cryptocurrency. With prices for an individual Bitcoin at times reaching into the tens of thousands of dollars, there are not many who can afford to buy outright. Instead, budding users buy part of a Bitcoin.\nFor example, you have $1,000 and want to buy some Bitcoin. At the time of writing, $1,000 nets you 0.11 BTC. If the price of Bitcoin rises, so does the amount you have, and vice-versa when it falls. 1.1 Who Uses Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is a currency. Some owners use Bitcoin to pay for services. There are a number of online services that accept Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) in place of regular cash. While Bitcoin started small, some major retailers and international companies now accept it as payment, including Microsoft, Expedia, Newegg, Overstock, and UK company CeX. Furthermore, a vast number of VPN and hosting sites accept Bitcoin.\nBitcoin has also seen heavy uptake on the so-called darknet. Because Bitcoin is decentralized and with a little effort is also fairly anonymous, some nefarious sites use the cryptocurrency instead of fiat currency. The anonymity and decentralization mean Bitcoin is ideal for places where regular banking is an issue.\nFor instance, during civil unrest throughout Venezuela, citizens turned to Bitcoin as their regular currency devalued because of massive inflation. Similarly, some African nations use Bitcoin instead of local currency because of the uncertainty in price, while Bitcoin is by-and-large pegged to the US dollar.\nThe real answer is that anyone who wants to use Bitcoin can. They just need to buy some first. 1.2 Using Bitcoin: Pros and Cons\nAs with most pieces of technology, there are pros and cons to using Bitcoin. I’m going list a few of each, with some short explanations as to my reasoning.\nPros to Using Bitcoin Freedom: Users can send and receive Bitcoin anywhere in the world, irrespective of local currency. Decentralized: There is no central bank to control new Bitcoin. As we’ll explore in a moment, users mine new Bitcoin using computers, meaning the users are in control of the network. Transparent: The blockchain ledger underpinning Bitcoin is available to anyone who wishes to download it ; it currently stands at over 145GB. There are, however, numerous sites that allow us to double-check transactions, while personal information remains hidden. Privacy: While there are ways to trace Bitcoin transactions back to their source, Bitcoin is largely anonymous. In addition to privacy, Bitcoin transactions protect against identity theft and credit/debit card fraud by using only digital wallet IDs, never your actual details. Supply: There is a finite supply of Bitcoin; only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist. Several million are already presumed irretrievably lost, increasing demand for the rest. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is the baseline almost all other cryptocurrencies measure against. Protection: Unlike regular currency, you cannot counterfeit Bitcoin. Sure, there are scams out there to steal Bitcoins, and unscrupulous individuals will try and sell fake Bitcoin, but you cannot actually fake a Bitcoin.\nCons to Using Bitcoin Fees: In the early days, Bitcoin transaction fees were minimal. In December 2017, the average transaction fee peaked at $55, up from November’s high of $19. Fees could continue to rise, too. While $55 is extremely high and likely involved a large sum of Bitcoin, many balk at general fees. Instability: Price instability makes Bitcoin difficult to use as currency. Many vendors are unwilling to risk their incoming payments decreasing in value by the time it processes. Unlike a regular U.S. dollar, the value of your Bitcoin could disappear overnight, leaving you with nothing (jibes at centralized currency, quantitative easing, and inflation aside). Refunds: One of the positives of Bitcoin is payment privacy. Unfortunately, is also a downside. If you send money to the wrong Bitcoin address, there is no way to claim it back. Similarly, if you purchase something using Bitcoin and it never arrives, there is no charge-back function. Competition: Some argue that competition is healthy for the cryptocurrency markets, and I agree. Bitcoin holds the most value and is still the most attractive investment opportunity, but other cryptocurrencies offer more in terms of privacy, security, and functionality. They cost less, and could eventually overtake Bitcoin. Unregulated: Similar to the lack of refunds, some Bitcoin-related scams 5 Common Cryptocurrency Scams and How to Avoid Them 5 Common Cryptocurrency Scams and How to Avoid Them If you're interested in investing in the somewhat risky world of cryptocurrency, there are a few common scams you should be aware of. Here's how to avoid being caught out. Read More are essentially impossible to recover from. Law enforcement can do nothing once your coins are gone, other than commiserating and filing a report. Loss: It is possible to irretrievably lose Bitcoins, be that through destruction, encryption, or similar. Uptake: For most of the reasons above, Bitcoin has low uptake among businesses, and will continue to struggle for many years. In conjunction, Bitcoin is slow to process payments, processing a theoretical maximum of seven transactions per second (compared to regular banking systems like Visa that processes thousands every second). 1.3 What Is the Blockchain?\nThe blockchain is the revolutionary technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin blockchain contains details of every Bitcoin transaction, past and present, recording them as they take place. So how does it work?\nLet’s use an example. You want to send Bitcoin to your friend. When you hit the Send button, your transaction is added to a block.\nWhen your block amasses enough transactions, it broadcasts to every connected node in the network. The nodes “mine” the block, verifying the transactions (as well as collecting transactions fees for their troubles). Once verified, the block adds to the chain, and your funds arrive with the recipient.\nDigital currency is simply data. It is ones and zeroes. One major problem for digital currencies is double spend. That is, users attempting to dupe vendors by spending the same digital currency in two locations. Blockchain technology stops that issue by requiring that the network verifies every transaction.\nOnce a majority of nodes confirm that the transactions in the block are unique, it is added to the blockchain. Each new block is linked to the previous to ensure a chain of accepted transaction history, thus protecting the network, users, and vendors alike. But the nodes aren’t just doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. No, there is a financial incentive to for nodes to verify the blocks.\nEach block carries a reward. The current block reward is 12.5 BTC. In 2020, the reward will halve, dropping to 6.25 BTC. Approximately five years after that, it will halve again, to 3.125 BTC. The halving process will continue until the year 2140 when, by most estimates, the Bitcoin mining process will complete. 1.4 What Is Bitcoin Mining?\nMining is another way of referring to, and is intrinsic to, the block verification process. Every ten minutes or so, a block containing pending Bitcoin transactions releases to the network. The block can contain thousands of individual transactions. Miners compete to verify the transactions contained in the block.\nWhile some people say miners “solve difficult mathematical equations,” that isn’t strictly true. Transactions are verified by matching a 64-digit hexadecimal hash. The first miner to match a hash and verify 1MB of transactions is eligible for the aforementioned block reward. This system is known as proof of work and, unfortunately for the vast majority of individuals, means it is simply impossible to solo mine Bitcoin.\nBut why?\nWell, it takes a staggering amount of computing power to generate hashes at a high rate. To mine successfully, you need a high hash rate, in turn requiring a huge amount of electricity. This is why there are concerns about the overall power consumption of Bitcoin Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption: Where's All the Power Going? Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption: Where's All the Power Going? The future of Bitcoin is bright -- but its energy consumption is terrible. Will Bitcoin mining really consume all of the world's power by 2020? Read More and other cryptocurrencies. Hash rates are measured in megahashes per second (MH/s), gigahashes per second (GH/s), and terahashes per second (TH/s).\nIn the early days of Bitcoin, it was possible to mine using a regular CPU. Now Bitcoin mining requires specialized hardware: either high-spec GPUs contributing to a mining pool (more on this later) or an ASIC miner. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty\nTo stick to the mining algorithm and block halving timeframe, the Bitcoin network aims to release a new block every ten minutes. But if there are more miners, there is a higher chance of someone matching the correct hash in a shorter timeframe. That’s where mining difficulty comes into play.\nAs the total hash rate power increases, so does the difficulty level of the mining process. After every 2016 blocks, the network difficulty changes. If the block discovery time is less than 10 minutes and the hash rate high, the difficulty level increases. If the block discovery process takes longer than 10 minutes, the same protocol decreases difficulty. 1.5 What Is a Bitcoin Fork?\nAnother common Bitcoin term is fork . Unlike the fork you eat with, a cryptocurrency fork is more akin to a fork in the road . Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency) forks take place for many reasons, but usually boil down to: Differing ideals and approaches to the original coin implementation A major issue or security fault with the technology behind the coin\nForks are also soft or hard. A hard fork typically introduces a radical change to the existing protocol, usually creating an entirely new cryptocurrency in the process. Some major hard fork examples include: Bitcoin XT : One of the first notable hard forks, Bitcoin XT aimed to boost the Bitcoin network to 24 transactions per second by increasing the block size from 1MB to 8MB. SegWit : Seg regated Wit ness reduces the size of each Bitcoin transaction, in turn allowing more transactions per block, which allows for faster and cheaper transactions. Technically a soft fork, SegWit mobilized other developers to complete their own hard forks. Bitcoin Cash : One of the most controversial hard forks, Bitcoin Cash split from the “main” branch to protect against future changes. (Indeed, Bitcoin Cash is undergoing its own hard fork in 2018.) Bitcoin Gold : Aimed to restore mining functionality to GPUs rather than specialized mining equipment.\nCertain forks have seen the price of a single Bitcoin surge as investors and speculators pile in. Newly created Bitcoin-based currencies have no set initial value, either. 2. How to Buy Bitcoin\nSo now that you know the basics of Bitcoin, it is time to buy some. 2.1 Where to Buy Bitcoin?\nThere are several trusted and secure places to buy Bitcoin. There are also a vast number of places that are not trusted and are thoroughly insecure. Here are the three most secure places to purchase your first Bitcoin. Coinbase\nCoinbase is one of the biggest Bitcoin currency exchanges. It brokers the exchange of the fiat currencies of 32 countries into Bitcoin, (as well as Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin). In November 2017, Coinbase reported some 13 million active users. However, this was before the price of Bitcoin soared in December, allegedly adding up to 300,000 users per day at its peak.\nUser numbers aside, Coinbase makes purchasing Bitcoin extremely easy. All you need is your bank account details and an account. Coinbase understandably restricts initial purchase limits until the user verifies their account using a phone number or photo identification.\nCoinbase transactions are, for the most part, extremely fast. In the US and some EU countries transactions using debit or credit cards process immediately, and you’ll receive your Bitcoin instantaneously. LocalBitcoins\nLocalBitcoins is a site of peer-to-peer Bitcoin vendors, spread throughout the world. Unlike the majority of other Bitcoin/fiat currency exchanges, LocalBitcoins is decentralized, like the currency itself. Prices change as the market fluctuates, and sometimes there is a chance to buy Bitcoin at slightly lower prices than usual.\nThe biggest bonus to LocalBitcoins is the range of available payment methods. Most other sites restrict payments to verified bank accounts and credit cards. LocalBitcoins allows payment using Amazon gift card codes, Western Union, PayPal, cash in person, Google Wallet, and more—so long as the seller has the option listed. LocalBitcoins is currently active in 249 countries around the globe.\nIn addition, you need very little personal information to purchase Bitcoin using LocalBitcoins. The website doesn’t demand heaps of information and, depending on your payment choice, only the vendor will see your account details. Gemini\nGemini is one of the most secure fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges available to those new to Bitcoin. One of the biggest positives to using Gemini is the FDIC-insured deposit scheme. Furthermore, Gemini is licensed and registered in New York and is operated by Bitcoin billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (AKA the Winklevoss twins).\nGemini is well-respected throughout the crypto world. Aside from offering insured holdings, digital assets are put into cold storage to maintain security and, unlike many other large exchanges, Gemini actually has decent customer support. Better still, if your order is big enough, Gemini will offer a price discount. Other Options for Buying Bitcoin\nThese three are by no means the only fiat-to-Bitcoin exchanges.

Police seized an amount of Bitcoin worth over $600,000. UK Judge Sentences Hacker to 10 Years, Police Seize Over $600,000 in Bitcoin\n26-year old Grant West, a computer hacker from Kent, United Kingdom, was described as a “one man cybercrime wave” for having stolen the personal data of approximately 165,000 people through a “phishing” scheme. The prosecution stated that he profited over £180,000 (approximately $240,000) from the scam and converted the proceeds into Bitcoin, which would then be stored in multiple accounts.\nWest would send emails pretending to be from Just Eat, an online food order and delivery service, to extract credit and debit card details from his victims. He was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison after admitting charges, which included conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offences. Judge Michael Gledhill presided over the trial.\nCryptocurrencies have been increasingly used as means of payment and store of value by criminals, as cases brought to justice seem to prove. In March 2018, a Ukranian-Russian cybercriminal gang was caught after allegedly stealing up to €1 billion from banks in Spain, which then were converted into Bitcoin.\nAs these activities prove that Bitcoin is regarded as a safe store of value, criminals are also increasingly targeting the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In Malaysia, a criminal gang of nine members was arrested for stealing Bitcoin mining equipment , of at least 58 machines. In February 2018, the first Bitcoin robbery in Taiwan was attributed to four men who posed as potential Bitcoin buyers in order to steal the equivalent of $170,000.\nMasquerading as Just Eat, Grant West offered a voucher in return for answering questions between July 2015 and December 2015. The phishing scam cost the firm over £200,000 (approximately $267,000), but there is no evidence their servers were hacked by West, according to the prosecution. Other high profile hack victims include British Airways, Barclays, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Uber, Argos, Coral.\nThe Police seized £25,000 (approximately $33,000) in cash and £500,000 (approximately $666,000) in Bitcoin. Judge Michael Gledhill said £1.6 million (approximately $2.3 million) worth of cryptocurrency is unaccounted for.\n“When such inadequate security is confronted with a criminal of your skills and ambition it is totally unfit for purpose and worthless. This case should be a wake-up call to customers, companies and the computer industry to the very real threat of cybercrime.”\nOnce the hacker had a set of customer details, he would then sell them on Alpha Bay, an online dark web market 10-times larger than Silk Road which was taken down by the authorities in July 2017.\nImage from Shutterstock British Hacker Sentenced to 10 Years For Stealing $600,000 in Bitcoin was last modified: May 28th, 2018 by Ricardo Esteves ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T15:30:12.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e7e8c7eb39206df0b066c8c7f6033a46968f1b45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UNDr6tmLRKZx5M3ZG6Bu8h9", "site_full": "helpscoin.cryptograbber.com", "site": "cryptograbber.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "We've got to maximize opportunities and minimize risks in fintech – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "title_full": "We've got to maximize opportunities and minimize risks in fintech – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.038, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/helpscoin.cryptograbber.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/weve-got-to-maximize-opportunities-and-minimize-risks-in-fintech.jpg?fit=600%2C600", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e7e8c7eb39206df0b066c8c7f6033a46968f1b45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UNDr6tmLRKZx5M3ZG6Bu8h9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "We've got to maximize opportunities and minimize risks in fintech – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "text": "by HELPSCOINADMIN · May 28, 2018\nFintech firms are less likely to participate in government programs that backstop consumer deposits such as those provided by the Canadian Deposit … You may also like...

These gatherings of likeminded enthusiasts bring thousands of people together around the world. Their power to attract people transcends borders so much that enthusiasts actually look for these meetups when they fly abroad. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency fans, in many cases, would rather check the local crypto scene out than go into a museum or go on a guided tour of the city they are traveling to. Vertex knows this, and as a project that is deeply rooted in this sense of camaraderie and community that transcends borders, it decided to launch it very own Bitcoin meetup competition: the Battle of the Meetups! Battle of the Meetups Sponsored by Vertex\nThe Battle of the Meetups is simple. Vertex will go through all the Bitcoin meetups registered on meetup.com and will proceed to do the following: Select 25 meetups to sponsor. Sponsor those meetups throughout a period of 5 months. Give the selected meetups a list of criteria that Vertex will use to select the top 2 meetups over this period. Proceed to give the two winners an amazing prize. Criteria to Participate in the Battle of the Meetups\nThe criteria that Vertex established to determine the winner of Battle of the Meetups is also quite simple. There are 4 vectors along which meetups can score points every time they meet. At the end, a final tally will determine the 2 winners. The following is the point system: The meetup that accumulates the most Facebook likes since the start of the Battle of the Meetups until the end, will be awarded 3 points.

Having gotten into mining in 2009, early enough to make a fortune, he accidentally threw away the hard drive holding thousands of Bitcoins.\n“I mined more than 7,500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” the IT worker turned crypto investor told New York Post. “Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my Bitcoin private keys. I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the Bitcoin information.”\nHe’s not the only one with such bad luck: Atlanta-based software developer Syl Turner mined two Bitcoins in 2010 and forgot about it. When the price started rising from November on, he found that old computer in the attic, but also found that he had overwritten his private key.\nMeanwhile, Howells is still struggling to get his coins back. He’s even offered the town of Newport 10% of the Bitcoins’ value if they’ll let him excavate the landfill. So far, they’ve denied his requests. Still, he considers his coins to be perfectly safe there: “Nobody else can get in there and take my hard drive,” he said. “It’s like having [millions] in the bank, but you cannot get into the bank account.” Follow us on Twitter or join our Telegram ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T15:40:22.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe7a18fb475e1d90aa647cc544380dfa10d303ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TWLtuz6nKj9vneCX1Xhn2x.9JAPkZimcNNmHuGzjc7qcso7bMaGjat2LjAYnFD1nWHxgkwxBce4CDX70Q0JCr53P0EM5e0miOKRrCoWNbBe8yNhyp_ewn.", "site_full": "about-bitcoin.com", "site": "about-bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Paid in Crypto for Watching Movies With a New Blockchain Platform - About Bitcoin", "title_full": "Get Paid in Crypto for Watching Movies With a New Blockchain Platform - About Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/about-bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/get-paid-in-crypto-for-watching-movies-with-a-new-blockchain-platform.png?fit=733%2C447", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe7a18fb475e1d90aa647cc544380dfa10d303ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TWLtuz6nKj9vneCX1Xhn2x.9JAPkZimcNNmHuGzjc7qcso7bMaGjat2LjAYnFD1nWHxgkwxBce4CDX70Q0JCr53P0EM5e0miOKRrCoWNbBe8yNhyp_ewn.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Paid in Crypto for Watching Movies With a New Blockchain Platform - About Bitcoin", "text": "Search for: Get Paid in Crypto for Watching Movies With a New Blockchain Platform\n“Watch movies and get paid” — the blockchain job with this promising motto appeared in the Cannes festival in May, aiming to interrupt the cinema business, particularly independent theatre.

Today it ranks 35th out of 49 European nations by population, but in some respects Lithuania still punches above its weight. ICO Watchlist places Lithuania fifth for European crowdfunding, based on the number of projects to have launched within its borders; Bankera alone raised $150 million, and it has been reported that 10% of all ICO money raised last year went to the Baltic country.\nIt’s not the only nation in that part of the world to have embraced the crypto revolution; neighboring Latvia and its neighbor Estonia have are also cryptocurrency hotbeds, while adjacent Belarus recently legalized crypto and declared zero tax for cryptocurrency firms until 2023. Lithuania’s love affair with crypto is partially a regional thing, then, though its penchant for all things digital and decentralized seems stronger even than that of its peers. Anecdotally that certainly seems to be the case; attend any crypto conference this year and the odds are you’ll have met more Lithuanians than you did Russians, Ukrainians, and Estonians combined. The Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. Education, Independence and Fast Internet\nBescouted is a Steemit-based photography and creative casting platform that’s poised to launch its own crowdsale and native token. Its founder, Deividas Leilionas, believes that Lithuanians were primed to adopt cryptocurrency long before bitcoin was even a thing, explaining: “Historically Lithuania has always maintained high standards for education. After getting back their independence, Lithuanians were contracted to build software solutions for western companies, and hence developed a vast number of skilled engineers. The government is also very tech oriented and assisted with developing an excellent IT infrastructure. For a while, Lithuania was running the fastest internet per capita in the world.” Vladas Jurkevičius, the CEO of Lithuanian digital identity startup Safein , echoes this sentiment, adding: “Lithuania doesn’t have a track record of world-famous tech startups, and we didn’t have access to large VC funds. ICOs and crypto communities remove boundaries so that no matter where you are located, only the team, technology and idea matters. In addition, the blockchain community is very strong within Lithuania; people share their ideas and experience freely. The country is famous for its regulatory framework for fintech companies as well, and when blockchain technology was on the rise, a lot of projects received support from the government.” Cryptocurrency Is a Great Leveler\nOne of the greatest things about cryptocurrency is that it gives nations a chance to compete on an even keel. It doesn’t matter what your GDP is, or how many nukes are locked in your bunker: on the internet, everyone’s equal. This has given countries that have traditionally lagged industrially and economically a chance to make amends. From tiny islands to humble nation states, a series of global outposts have made it known that they’re open for crypto business. In terms of cryptocurrency adoption, for example, the UK has long been synonymous with bitcoin. (It’s even been speculated that Satoshi may have been British on account of his spelling and colloquialisms.) But the UK government has been glacially slow to capitalize on cryptocurrency, allowing European nations such as Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Malta, and Lithuania to steal a march. Malta is another unlikely small where crypto innovation has been encouraged\nJoao Martins is head of business development for Birdchain , a Lithuanian tokenized advertising and rewards platform. He moved to the country two years ago from his native Portugal and has been smitten with it ever since. Joao speaks of sensing “the beating pulse of a whole generation embracing this adolescent energy [of cryptocurrency] with a voracious hunger and drive to prove their worth to the world”. Like Be Scouted’s Deividas, he praises the country’s internet quality and notes: “Since they became part of the EU, there has been a clear path of investment in technological infrastructure and education…Lithuania is also a small society where entrepreneurs get in touch with their peers and openly exchange experiences. Blockchain and cryptocurrency hit Lithuania at the right moment and was gratefully seized”.\nCryptocurrency is an alien aircraft, crashing landed in a pasture, and global governments are the startled cows trying to make sense of it. Some are spooked, and some oblivious, while others walk right up, give it a lick, and decide they like what they see. Right now, Lithuania and its neighboring territories are at the head of that herd.\nWhat other small countries do you think are over-achieving when it comes to cryptocurrency innovation?

Daily chart\nOn the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, indicating a short-term bearish setup. A series of lower highs and lower lows also indicates the bears are in control.\nThe relative strength index (RSI) is holding slightly above 30.00, signaling just enough room for another $200 drop in BTC prices. Weekly chart\nThe first weekly close below the 50-week MA in nearly three years only validates the argument that the long-term bull market has ended.\nThe relative strength index (RSI) has also rolled over in favor of the bears, while the 5-week MA is set to cross the 10-week MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover.\nClearly, BTC is on the defensive, still, there is merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency created a small doji candle on Sunday (as seen in the daily chart) at the key 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $7,209, indicating bear indecision in the marketplace. Thus, a minor corrective rally could be in the offing if bitcoin posts gain today (bullish doji reversal). View BTC looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000. Acceptance below that level would expose the April 1 low of $6,425. An unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800–$8,000. Only a convincing move above the weekly 50-MA would abort the bearish view. Meanwhile, a break above $9,990 (May 5 high) would imply a bullish reversal.\nChart image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

It came as no surprise though. The country is a host of several Bitcoin ATMs and several eCommerce platforms accept payment in Bitcoin. However, while elaborating, the company was categorically stating that they won’t be holding any Bitcoin themselves. Instead what would happen is that every time a customer settles their electricity bill in Bitcoin, conversion to fiat-national reserve currency Koruna-will be immediate. Moves like these buoy the cryptocurrency market and in the future-and following the lead of Argentina and Japan, more countries would follow suit and legitimize cryptos.\nWhile this was happening, the US DoJ is looking into what appears to be collective pump and dump efforts. For the keen eyed, this is something that is needed and of course, eyes will be popping soon considering the unregulated nature of cryptos. In the crypto world, especially for traders trading against BTC, wild moves are common. As a matter of fact, it’s not a surprise to see Bitcoin prices swinging more than $1,000 within some few minutes. This worries many and now, together with the CFTC, the DoJ are investigating to check the level of this manipulation and fraud they are sure exists in the market. Efforts of spoofing-where unscrupulous traders place and pull different orders simultaneously or wash trading activities will in the coming days attract the keen eyes of the justice department. Bitcoin Price Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Weekly Chart by Trading View\nIf we pull Bitcoin statistics then we see a gloomy situation. Bitcoin prices are down 12 percent in the last seven days but pretty stable in the last 24 hours shedding 3 percent as I type this. It has been mild but what we should be looking at is the close of each candlestick and the extent of losses within that week. Notice that relative to previous bars, last week depreciation was steep and saw Bitcoin prices slicing though $8,000. At this rate, trend traders should be looking for sell opportunities this day now that our close is below our previous support line at $7,800. Because of this predisposition, Bitcoin sell targets should be at February lows at $6,000. Daily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nTo get a perspective of possible trend, May 22 and 23 candlesticks should paint a better picture. During these two days, there was a literal doubling of trade volumes with prices sinking below $7,800. After that, the follow through has been fair in volumes but then prices are not recovering safe yesterday’s weak attempts of buy shore.\nIn my view, taking shorts anywhere between $8,000 and $8,800 would present with better trade opportunities with targets at $6,000. This is only valid if and only if there is a short covering. Accompanying this appreciation would be light and below average volumes.\nOn the flip side though, if there happens to be sharp spikes in trading volumes and a bullish engulfing edging past May 23 candlestick, then it will be above time to exit shorts and buy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T04:23:25.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98fce6bf3feda84ee0cdbfd739b900b47be07acf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjgbnHEymdah_llLsowy0iNFAw8LQ3HJqOd34jix._8wKecrCF4l7frJ4rKkEpXHnUHZMX8SHxx6OJVdssUG7B6mx0IDF8i8-", "site_full": "globalcoinreport.com", "site": "globalcoinreport.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple still deserve real fondness, here is why - Global Coin Report", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple still deserve real fondness, here is why - Global Coin Report", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://globalcoinreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin_Litecoin_Ripple.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98fce6bf3feda84ee0cdbfd739b900b47be07acf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjgbnHEymdah_llLsowy0iNFAw8LQ3HJqOd34jix._8wKecrCF4l7frJ4rKkEpXHnUHZMX8SHxx6OJVdssUG7B6mx0IDF8i8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ali Qamar", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple still deserve real fondness, here is why - Global Coin Report", "text": "May 28, 2018 By Ali Qamar 498 Views 0 Comments Spread the love April was fantastic for cryptocurrency trading. All coins went up. Things seemed just peachy. But last week was not that good as most coins lost some value against the USD. Take Bitcoin . It’s currently at $7365 against the dollar when it was beyond $8500 just a week or so ago. It is its lowest point since last April 18th when it was close to breaking the ten thousand barrier, and the market was all about rising prices. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is now at 126 billion, and it remains the biggest slice of the pie with a thirty-nine percent dominance.\nFears about Bitcoin are just identical as with all other main crypto coins such as Litecoin (LTC) or Ripple (XRP) . XRP has gone down by 0.34% over the last twenty-four hours, and 13% in the last week so it’s now at $0.60. Litecoin has found itself in a similar situation as it’s lost 0.18% in the last day, and 15.29% for the week – so it’s now at $117.9 USD. The Consensus 2018 conference a couple of weeks ago was supposed to prompt a market comeback that has not happened yet. Even as this is happening, observers are still predicting a market rally that will see Bitcoin and other digital assets reach new historical highs. Projections, studies, and analyses all agree on that, so investors should not be worried about the current lows, but financial markets have never been driven by rationality anyway. It seems we’ll just have to wait until the wind changes again, and we can all ride the bear back to the top. Even in the current context, there are good reasons to stay optimistic about Litecoin, Ripple, and Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC): The power of permanence Bitcoin has the name. It was the first cryptocurrency ever and it remains the one coin that holds the greater status, value, and demand. It’s been criticized by governments and observers, it’s been at the center of most scandals in the crypto world, it’s slow, the transfer fees are too expensive and, even when you take all into account, Bitcoin is still Bitcoin. It’s been around the longest, and it’s most certainly here to stay. Every other cryptocurrency owes its existence, at least to a point, to Bitcoin and it remains the safest option around. Besides the fact that it can be used for payments and for storing value, BTC has shown incredible resilience, it always recovers its value back, which is why Wall Street is getting involved with it. If cryptocurrency apocalypse were to happen today, there’s a ninety percent chance that Bitcoin would stick around anyway. So don’t bet against Bitcoin. It is going to stay around as long as there’s a crypto market. It has demand and as its network is scheduled for an upgrade. It can only become more valuable. Litecoin (LTC): Growing quietly but steadily Whatever else is happening with other alt-coins, LTC retains some kind of charm that is allowing it to be increasingly accepted everywhere around the planet. As Bitcoin becomes more of a means to store wealth, Litecoin is becoming a retail payment currency the world over. As more businesses accept it as a payment option and more people use it to buy goods and services, its demand and value can only increase. Ripple’s XRP: Partnerships matter From all three coins mentioned in this article, Ripple’s XRP is the one having the hardest time. Questions remain about Ripple Lab’s role in controlling (or not) the coin’s performance, and there’s the issue of the lawsuit (is it a security or not?) that could affect every coin in the crypto world. But the fact remains that, even in that context, Ripple is the one cryptocurrency that has proved it has practical value in the real world as at least seventy-five banks in the world are now using it to do their international transactions. There is every chance that the financial world will radically change because of Ripple’s technology and Ripple’s coin. Ripple’s xRapid has gained acceptance among many big players in the financial sector (Western Union is one of them). It’s shown it can make international payments quicker, cheaper and more reliable. This is making XRP entrenched in the real world. There’s demand for it and Ripple’s technology customers need it. Last thoughts The market is down at the moment; there’s just no doubt about that. But it will bounce back for sure and when it does these three coins will be leading the way to recovery. So don’t panic, just wait a bit.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

It was the combination of the large number of families sending a father, mother, brother or sister to work overseas to send money home and as most Filipinos remain unbanked, it made the market ripe for a fast, secure and cheap international money transfer option.\nTraditionally remittance companies like Western Union owned this space but the cost of sending money from overseas back to the Philippines could sometimes cost a weeks worth of budget for the local Filipinos.\nWith companies like Coins.ph making it easy for the family of these overseas foreign workers (OFWs) to receive bitcoin (BTC) on their phones and withdraw from a regular ATM, people switched and appreciated the costs savings.\nUnfortunately, with the problems of Bitcoin Core and their focus on higher fees, its forced the people in the Philippines , like other developing countries to return to Western Union and other remittance companies.\nDeveloping nations need tools to develop and BCH is one that will allow OFWs to send money home to their families with fees that are a fraction of what the traditional remittance companies.\nThe speakers for the night were Eilon Arad\nfrom CoinPoint and ShinyLeaf.com who explained why his company decided to accept BCH as a payment method and the benefits in terms of saving for retailers. Because of the cost savings, using BCH, Arad and his company will give a 20% rebate to anyone who makes a purchase at ShinyLeaf.com. Next, we had Dale Dickins\n(@MadinMelbourne) who talked passionately about her love for the original Bitcoin and now how shes fallen in love with Bitcoin Cash (BCH). She talked about her latest project the BCH Jeepney (local Philippines public transit vehicle). The Jeepney is covered from bumper to bumper in Bitcoin cash colours and logos, and it will be the first public vehicle in the Philippines to accept payments in BCH. Our final speaker was Billy Yuen\nfrom the CoinGeek.com sponsored StackTrek initiative StackLab. Yuen shared his passion for uplifting societies through education and shared details of his blockchain coding in Ilio ilio. His group finds second tier cities and helps the best and brightest receive world class training that otherwise be unavailable to their people. We plan on holding more events, more often.

With one of the most reliable news teams in the industry, Bitcoinist provides up-to-date news and insightful analysis. For more follow the link below.\nThe cryptocurrency market has taken a decidedly bearish turn over the month of May, but one venture capitalist believes that only makes for a better buying opportunity — for Bitcoin, that is. ‘The Story Is Very Much Materializing’\nOver the past few weeks, sellers have remained firmly in control of the cryptocurrency market — but venture capitalist Spencer Bogart claims current market conditions only make for a better buying opportunity.\nOn Friday, the Blockchain Capital partner told CNBC’s Fast Money that Bitcoin’s increased number of use cases, coupled with the massive amount of institutional interest, means the market leader is still worth investing in. He explained :\nEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive.\nNevertheless, the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been hurting this month. After reaching highs of roughly $20,000 late last year, Bitcoin has fallen more than 50 percent in 2018 — and worries remain that the hemorrhaging is far from over. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $7,220.00, with some analysts fearing prices below $6,000 are likely on their way.\nStill, Bogart remains bullish on Bitcoin. He told CNBC:\nBut when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing. Could bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely. Altcoins Are ‘Over-Promising and Under-Delivering’\nBogart’s bullish sentiment does not extend to altcoins, however. He told CNBC that the majority of cryptocurrencies available to trade are “over-promising and under-delivering,” adding:\nMeanwhile, you have a few [cryptocurrencies] that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\nThe venture capitalist also told CNBC that he recommends selling fan favorites Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), IOTA, (MIOTA), and NEO (NEO). “A lot of those tokens are overvalued,” Bogart explained. “They could be go [sic] up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.”\nThe partner at Blockchain Capital is also cautious in regards to Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and dominant launchpad for initial coin offerings (ICOs). Bogart explained that the sheer amount of ICOs built on top of Ethereum is cause for concern, particularly if those ICOs don’t succeed.\nOn the other hand, Bogart recommends holding the other major players like Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and EOS (EOS) under current market conditions.\nDo you share Bogart’s belief that Bitcoin is still a strong buy?

There are two bearish trend lines formed with resistances at $7,400 and $7,510 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair remains at a risk of more losses if it breaks the $7,150 support level.\nBitcoin price is moving further into the bearish zone below $7,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must remain above $7,000 to avoid a sharp decline. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThere were a couple of rejections noted around $7,500 level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair started a downside move and declined below the $7,400 and $7,300 support levels. It even settled below the $7,400 pivot and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,260 low to $7,648 high. It opened the doors for more losses and the price declined below the $7,260 low.\nThe current price action suggests a downside break below $7,260 with a bearish angle. At the moment, the price is testing the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $7,260 low to $7,648 high. If the price breaks the $7,150 level, there could be more losses towards the $7,000 level. The 1.618 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $7,260 low to $7,648 high is at $7,020 to act as a support. Further below this, the price could decline towards $6,800. On the upside, there are two bearish trend lines formed with resistances at $7,400 and $7,510 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price may struggle to break the $7,300 and $7,400 resistance levels. Only a close above $7,500 could clear the path for a bullish trend in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now well below the 40 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,020\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,400 Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Upsides Remain Limited was last modified: May 28th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T12:01:42.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c3e77ecf5810a1ff9f07e38403421470fa8512a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4W_WUzYmXf6dMMeF2pY_BivjqXdVuozDk3ZvBC7WKm9k.gDjoav9tkAjL3fsTzmeD0jlwKzAiMYXGsQ7zEFWQJj8202LmzS7JzqSwZfRoNKuA.Fzn7gwgop.nscbveLCNufmIF70zpPc", "site_full": "www.fool.com.au", "site": "fool.com.au", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Litecoin sink lower | Motley Fool Australia", "title_full": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Litecoin sink lower | Motley Fool Australia", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitcoin-Crush-16.9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45571, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0c3e77ecf5810a1ff9f07e38403421470fa8512a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4W_WUzYmXf6dMMeF2pY_BivjqXdVuozDk3ZvBC7WKm9k.gDjoav9tkAjL3fsTzmeD0jlwKzAiMYXGsQ7zEFWQJj8202LmzS7JzqSwZfRoNKuA.Fzn7gwgop.nscbveLCNufmIF70zpPc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James Mickleboro", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Litecoin sink lower | Motley Fool Australia", "text": "James Mickleboro | May 28, 2018\nUnfortunately for crypto traders there wasn’t much to smile about this weekend.

Please read our Financial Services Guide (FSG) for more information.\nUnfortunately for crypto traders there wasn’t much to smile about this weekend. The entire value of the market has continued to slide and since Friday is down over 3.5% to US$324 billion according to Coin Market Cap.\nHere is the state of play on Monday morning:\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) price has fallen 2.6% since this time yesterday to US$7,340.94 per coin, reducing its market capitalisation to US$125.25 billion. News of potential price manipulation of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. has weighed heavily on trader sentiment over the past few days. As did news of similar developments in South Africa over the weekend.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price has plunged 6% over the last 24 hours to US$565.10 per token. This has cut Ethereum’s market capitalisation down to US$56.3 billion. This latest decline means ETH has lost around 22% of its value in the space of a week.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has dropped 2.5% over the period to 60.7 U.S. cents, leaving the popular alt coin with a market capitalisation of US$23.8 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has fallen 4.5% since this time yesterday to US$985.43. The Bitcoin spin-off has been left with a reduced market capitalisation of US$16.9 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price is off 2.3% over the last 24 hours to US$12.39 per token, giving it a market capitalisation of US$10.9 billion.\nOutside the top five it was much of the same with the top 25 cryptocurrencies all in the red.\nThe Litecoin (LTC) price is down 3.1%, the Stellar (XLM) price is off 5%, the Cardano (ADA) price is 4.6% lower, the TRON (TRX) price is down 6.8%, and the IOTA (MIOTA) price is 4.7% lower.\nWhat’s next?\nAs it is nearly impossible to place a fair value on Bitcoin and its peers, technical analysis and sentiment play a big role in their performances. Unfortunately, with both looking very bearish at the moment, it seems inevitable that Bitcoin will sink through the US$7,000 level in the coming days and drag the rest of the market down with it. I would suggest readers resist the temptation to invest and just watch on from the safety of the sidelines.\nInstead, readers might want to consider this major investment opportunity before it takes off.\nOne of the world's richest people is sounding the alarm on what could be a trillion-dollar technology.\nEveryone is talking about the artificial intelligence revolution.\nHarvard Business Review calls it, \"the most important general-purpose technology of our era.\"\nOne Google Insider predicts AI, \"will be as transformative as the discovery of electricity.\" And it already is transforming industry after industry.\nAfter all we have been hearing about AI for years...but it never really lived up to the hype...so what's finally unlocked this huge tidal wave of innovation?\nClick here to learn more!\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Image Source: Cointelegraph\nExperts told the Evening Standard that crypto trading can become a form of behavioural addiction, with traders obsessively glued to “minute-by-minute” market fluctuations. The devised treatment program is therefore closer to existing methods for treating gambling addictions, rather than to substance abuse programs.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was quoted by the Evening Standard as saying:\n\"The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.\"\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center’s new treatments. Marini told the Standard that “introducing life structure is key,” adding:\n\"I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don't like the world they're in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they're not alone.\" Castle Craig said that there are currently no figures for the number of ‘crypto addicts,’ but “around 13 mln” people worldwide are trading in the system.\nLast year, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his home as collateral for a $325,000 equity loan, in pursuit of making a mid-term profit on the cryptocurrency. Crypto community members, evidently viewing his investment mindset as equivalent to gambling , remarked that the move was “almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.”\nFrom another perspective, there has been some discussion in the UK as to whether declaring your crypto trading to be gambling could help to avoid taxes with the British tax authority HMRC, which generally deems crypto profits as subject either to income or capital gains tax laws.

The digital currency is now trading at $7,220 as of 12 PM EST. BTC/USD Dips Down Near $7,000\nThe recent price movements indicate that Bitcoin bears are still winning the battle. Today, Bitcoin price fell to as low as $7,142, which means that BTC/USD dropped below its 50-week moving average (MA) support for the first time since 2015 .\nAt the moment, Bitcoin is on another bearish run, looking to test a support at $7,200. The current price action suggests a downside break below $7,250. Should it move further down to $7,100, then a further decline toward $7,000 or even $6,800 could surface.\nOn the upside, there is also a bearish trend line forming near the major resistance level at $7,300. However, the chart indicates that Bitcoin may struggle to break above that in the short term.\nSource: Tradingview\nAs for the technicals, there is a bearish signal shown by both the MACD and RSI indicators. On the bright side, Bitcoin is still in oversold territory.

The current countdown available online shows that we are less than a week from the launch. Back in Mid April, EOS managed to edge out Litecoin (LTC) from the number 5 spot according to coinmarketcap.com. This happened around the 11th of April, EOS jumped by 31% in value to trade at $8.76 and taking the number 5 spot from Litecoin. EOS has since held on to that position with a market capitalization lead over LTC that is now at $4.2 Billion. The next contender for EOS on the list on coinmarketcap.com is Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The coin is holding on to the number 4 position with a market cap of $17.623 Billion at the moment of writing this. The gap between BCH and EOS is of a market cap worth $6.563 Billion. To catch up with BCH and edge the coin out of the number 4 spot, EOS will have to be valued at $20. EOS had reached this value and surpassed it on the 29th of April this year when it peaked at $21.46. But many crypto-enthusiasts believe that EOS has its sights on a ‘bigger fish’ in the name of Ethereum. Many believe that EOS will be the Ethereum killer in terms of being the platform of choice for developers creating decentralized apps and even in terms of market capitalization. To note is that the Ethereum network has been hit by issues with regards to its security and scalability. The ETH network has been found to have over 34,000 vulnerable smart contracts with the most famous being the Parity incident that leftover $200 Million in ETH locked up indefinitely in a smart contract. The Ethereum platform has also been recently clogged due to Crypto-kitties and other DApps such as Pepe the Farmer and Shrimp farming. The current backlog in transactions stands at over 27,000 in the Ethereum network and according to Etherscan. This then gives EOS the chance to prove itself in terms of providing a secure and more scalable option to that of Ethereum. The current Technical Paper of EOS available states that EOS will be a new blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This will solve the transactions per second issue seen in Ethereum. In terms of security, EOS has introduced a time-based security option where certain actions must wait a certain time before being executed. The rest of the capabilities of EOS can be read on the whitepaper . Another option will be to wait for the MainNet launch on the 2nd of June that is sure to bring some action in terms of boosting the value of EOS in the markets.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space. He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi (a blockchain company) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office.

Bitcoin Core Becomes a Thing When Bitcoin Cash was first hard-forked back in November 2017, it resulted in two coins: Bitcoin Cash and the short-lived ‘ Bitcoin Clashic . ’ The latter being the legacy, albeit tongue-n-cheek, chain that did manage to mine a few blocks at the time. But the chain didn’t wither away . A few developers have been quietly maintaining it and have managed to rebrand it to Bitcoin Core – yes, the exact same name as Bitcoin’s (BTC) most popular software client implementation used by over 94% of all Bitcoin users.\n— Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) (@BitcoinCore_) May 28, 2018 Confused yet? Hold on, it gets even weirder. On its official website , BTCC is described as a “fork of Bitcoin” and too claims to be “Satoshi’s vision” just like Bitcoin Cash. The description reads: Bitcoin Core (BTCC) is open source, peer-to-peer electronic cash. Bitcoin Core is a fork from Bitcoin $BTC, Bitcoin Core $BTCC was nourished through a labor of love, in preparation for this mission. Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) is an upgrade of Bitcoin Clashic. The true vision of Bitcoin Core is to compliment Bitcoin, and run along side it, by acting as an express lane for core values, speed and privacy. Unlike Bitcoin Clashic, however, the Bitcoin Core currency might have legs. It is already being traded on the Crypto Bridge and Bisq exchanges at a volatile price of about $10 USD and with 33 nodes at time of writing and its own version of the ‘Bitcoin.org’ domain: thebitcoincore.org . According to the website, the coin will be listed on mcap.info and coinmarketwatch.com , and is supported by a software wallet and comes with a block explorer as well. The open-source code of Bitcoin Core can be found on GitHub . Tit-for-Tat Trolling The Bitcoin Clashic developers and the Bitcoin community responsible for the revival of Clashic appear to have fully embraced the term, often used by one of the biggest Bitcoin Cash supporters, Roger Ver, who deliberately refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as Bitcoin Core while maintaining that Bitcoin Cash is ‘Bitcoin.’ Roger and Fast Money crew loves us #BitcoinCore $BTCC Thanks for the publicity 👍 pic.twitter.com/Q9ZHGY7gin\n— Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) (@BitcoinCore_) May 28, 2018 In fact, the deliberate misnaming of Bitcoin Cash as ‘BCash’ and Bitcoin as ‘Bitcoin Core’ has been the go-to tactic of both communities ever since the acrimonious Bitcoin (BTC) hard fork that occurred on August 1st, 2017 gave birth to Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nBitcoin Cash’s Roger Ver frequently refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as ‘Bitcoin Core’ because he believes that Bitcoin Cash — which he refers to as the ‘real’ Bitcoin — follows the ‘true vision’ of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n“Roger Ver and CNBC’s Fast Money seem to be one of our best advocates,” a person involved with the BTCC project who wished to remain anonymous told Bitcoinist.\nMeanwhile, the online shopping platform Purse.io released ‘bcash’ just last week emphasizing that it is not a cryptocurrency but a software implementation for Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nNow it appears that the developers behind BTCC have done the exact opposite, launching a cryptocurrency under the name of Bitcoin Core to differentiate it from Bitcoin’s Bitcoin Core software client.\nThe reasoning is likely that Bitcoin Cash proponents would no longer be able to deliberately misname their arch nemesis, i.e. Bitcoin (BTC) as Core, since BTCC is now a real thing, and a completely different cryptocurrency.\nIs the launch of BTCC merely trolling or can it become a legit cryptocurrency?
