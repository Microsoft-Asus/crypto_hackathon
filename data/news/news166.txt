Thomas Lee has been the biggest public advocate and brand ambassador of the next “bull run”\nWith the current drop, many argue the potential of Bitcoin breaking below $7500 and heading down to $6900, its previously held strong position.\nThis drop could be due to a massive sale off, “Data from multiple exchanges show huge buying volumes present below the $7500 price point, it is highly unlikely Bitcoin would break that unless a whale probably sold all his coins which could then push the prices down much lower than we are all prepared to take in” said bitcoin Trader.\nThis current drop has baffled many investors like Luke Thomas who believes there is no media hype around this to push prices down so much.\n“I’m really surprised by the way it is dropping, this is what you expect when the old Mr. Warren Buffet says something negative, maybe a whale just dumped all his portfolio.

This means that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse. \\n\nThe 100 SMA also seems to have held as dynamic resistance and would likely keep further gains in check in another pullback. The gap between the two moving averages is also widening to reflect strengthening bearish pressure. \\n\nRSI is pointing down to confirm that sellers are in control and could further weigh on bitcoin price. Similarly stochastic is on the move down to show that bearish momentum is present. In that case, bitcoin price could make it all the way down to the bottom of the range. \\n\nHowever, both oscillators are also nearing oversold conditions to reflect bearish exhaustion. If buyers return as the oscillators pull up, the middle of the range could attract some buyers and lead to a bounce back to the top. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nFOMC member Neel Kashkari had some negative remarks on the cryptocurrency industry this week, and the lack of positive catalysts left these altcoins vulnerable to selling pressure. He noted: \\n\nIt\\u2019s a clever idea that some people came up with, but now it\\u2019s being taken to ridiculous extremes.\\u00a0The barrier to entry to creating a new cryptocurrency is zero. \\n\nFurthermore Kashkari mentioned: \\n\nIf you can dupe enough people to buy it, you can pretend that you\\u2019ve launched something. And you can say, \\u2018Look, I\\u2019m a billionaire because I sold you one. And I own the other 999 million of them, so that means I\\u2019m a billionaire!

The mentioned $1,220 level acted as a hurdle for buyers, resulting in more declines. The price declined further, settled below the $1,200 level, and broke the $1,150 support level. The recent downside break below $1,150 has opened the doors for more losses in the near term. \\n\nThe decline was such that the price even broke the last swing low of $1,133. It is now well below $1,150 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like the price is heading towards the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $1,133 low to $1,315 high at $1,090. It means the price may perhaps break the $1,100 support and accelerate declines towards $1,050. If sellers remain in control, the price might test the 1.618 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $1,133 low to $1,315 high.

One of them, depending on your view, is the rumor that there are solid plans of replacing SWIFT with the Bitcoin Network in Argentina. Well, this is definitely a BTC shot in the arm. However, the question is: Will the central bank and other dominant banks allow this? I expect a battle between affordability, transparency and decentralization and centralization, lags and inefficiency. \\n\nAs things warm up, critics often assert their views whenever there is a BTC slide. Statistics shows that Bitcoin prices are down two percent in the last 24 hours and four percent in the last week. Now, despite being moderate losses, it\\u2019s fodder for critics.

crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nThe chairman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association, Meni Rosenfeld, has continued the debate surrounding the providence of “imitation” blockchain projects and altcoins. Exploiting ‘Invisible’ Features\nIn a series of tweets on May 21st, Rosenfeld added to the “cargo cult” narrative which first appeared at the Consensus 2018 conference last week. Rosenfeld began:\nThe reason ‘Blockchain’ is so susceptible to cargo cult mentality is that the fundamental features that make it what it is are, in a sense, invisible, and inseparable from how the technology works. 1/10 The reason \"Blockchain\" is so susceptible to cargo cult mentality is that the fundamental features that make it what it is are, in a sense, invisible, and inseparable from how the technology works.\n— Meni Rosenfeld (@MeniRosenfeld) May 21, 2018\nCriticism of products and services claiming to use blockchain has returned to the cryptocurrency industry after Consensus gained criticism from some of Bitcoin’s best-known names.\nStemming from a heated panel featuring a JPMorgan executive and Bitcoin educator Jimmy Song, Song led straight-talking appraisals of the executive’s newly-unveiled blockchain tool, telling the audience he had heard “nothing but buzzwords.”\nOn social media thereafter, as Bitcoinist reported , Bitcoin core developer Johnathan Corgan called time on blockchain becoming a fresh example of “cargo cult engineering”– the belief innovation will generate prosperity by definition. Corgan warned:\nUnrestrained incantation of buzzwords and feel good hype does not a successful business plan make. Consumers Will Suffer Only When It’s Too Late\nMeni’s comments appear to incorporate not only dubious business proposals incorporating blockchain technology without use cases, but also spin-offs of Bitcoin itself, using its blockchain to create a new product, the downsides of which can only be understood with proper knowledge of “how, why, and when blockchains work.”\nWhile not naming specific examples, the allusion appears to be to the controversial Bitcoin Cash hard fork . Meni Rosenfeld continued:\nEven without using any of Bitcoin’s innovation, I can create a system that, to the end user, will appear indistinguishable from Bitcoin – greatly outperform it, in fact.\nIt will allow receiving tokens and sending to anyone, easily and quickly, with little to no fees. Of course, it will be completely centralized, and with it will come the associated risks – The system might one day shut down, or start charging high fees or apply censorship.\nBut these are things that might happen in *the future*. They’re not things you can observe now.\nLike Song, Rosenfeld also highlighted that a lack of consumer knowledge was driving the financial success of such projects.\nWhat do you think about Meni Rosenfeld’s take on Blockchain?

Kaitlyn Flannagan for Observer\nFollowing last summer’s fateful ‘Unite the Right’ Charlottesville rally—wherein a white supremacist murdered an innocent counter-protestor and many others were injured—a slew of New Right figures touted cryptocurrency over Periscope, Patreon and Twitter, rebranding their movement alongside Bitcoin’s ascent into the mainstream. Do you own Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency?\n— Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) February 4, 2018 Bitcoin really has them all scared doesn’t? https://t.co/WY4FltMZw3\n— Jack Posobiec🇺🇸 (@JackPosobiec) November 28, 2017\nAs Bitcoin climbed to a nearly five-fold high last summer, conversations over white nationalism dominated headlines. The two seemed, to many, intrinsically linked following Charlottesville— The Washington Post ran a December feature titled “ Bitcoin’s boom is a boon for extremist groups .”\n“In the months since demonstrators carried flaming torches and chanted ‘Jews will not replace us,’ Bitcoin has quadrupled in value,” wrote the Post . “The digital currency began trading on several mainstream financial markets this month, pushing the price of a single Bitcoin at times above $19,000. It was worth $16,000 at one point Tuesday.”\nWhite nationalist Richard Spencer claimed Bitcoin was “the currency of the alt-right,” while The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) noted how the decentralized currency was used to fund hate groups.\nAfter Charlottesville, New Right figures—who previously identified with the alt-right before the movement became openly defined by white supremacy—distanced themselves from hate groups, while embracing Bitcoin’s rise as a political statement. Whereas Bitcoin once found favorability in white supremacist networks to fund illicit activities through the dark web, Bitcoin post-Charlottesville became an opportunity for messaging on transparency.\n“It’s countercultural,” New Right personality Mike Cernovich, who is monitored by SPLC, told Observer. “Cryptocurrency is actually a very populist idea.”\n“I thought it was funny when Richard Spencer tried to claim he was into Bitcoin,” added Cernovich. “Whatever people think is hot, he tries to latch onto and make it seem like he’s somehow connected.”\nSpencer did not respond to Observer’s request for comment.\nDuring the 2016 election, MAGA supporters launched their own Trump cryptocurrency. TrumpCoin , as we noted in March , can be dished out to investors and then forwarded to Trump as anonymous donations.\n“Let’s make crypto great again,” says a voice at the end of the cryptocurrency’s promotional video .\nOther New Right figures to hype Bitcoin include conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, podcaster Stefan Molyneux and Dilbert creator Scott Adams—all of whom command massive pro-Trump audiences on social media. As Coindesk observed, Adams announced his website would embark on an initial coin offering (ICO) last fall. It’s great that the price of bitcoin is fluctuating, because that means people are selling some, making some money, and talking about it with their friends – thus raising the profile of next-generation currency.\n— Stefan Molyneux (@StefanMolyneux) December 10, 2017 Scott Adams gives you the idiot’s guide to blockchain – the technology that will change everything https://t.co/PdB2oFcxBu\n— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) October 28, 2017\n“[The New Right’s interest in Bitcoin] goes back pretty far, but it really took over when Bitcon was at the $8,000 mark and climbing very rapidly,” Jared Holt, a research associate at Right Wing Watch, told Observer. “Everybody was trying to hop aboard and urging their supporters to get in on it. It became one of the many pet causes these folks took in post-election.”\n“If you’re just a fucking oddball, then you’re going to find your way to fringe topics and that’s going to include cryptocurrency,” added Cernovich. “Crypto is an oddball fucking thing…”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/935581972738596864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/31/bitcons-nearly-five-fold-climb-in-2017-looks-very-similar-to-tech-bubble-surge.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A0KzoFuOLQ", "https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/924366637691691008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/StefanMolyneux/status/939904705840472064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/959956131392118784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/bitcoins-boom-is-a-boon-for-extremist-groups/2017/12/26/9ca9c124-e59b-11e7-833f-155031558ff4_story.html?utm_term=.e86c565a7437", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1367265.0", "https://t.co/WY4FltMZw3", "http://blog.dilbert.com/2018/05/09/all-of-the-dilbert-comics-on-blockchain-bitcoin-or-cryptocurrency/", "https://t.co/PdB2oFcxBu", "https://www.splcenter.org/bitcoin-and-alt-right"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaitlyn flannagan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "patreon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike cernovich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack posobiec", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the washington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:58:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8af69548da0e0f5425d284ffd66ceeb9749eb9a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc4eOlqi.tGktiiM7r8L52FR", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ -

IGST will be levied on cross-border supplies.”\nThe move is not the first targeting taxation of cryptocurrency in India.

The BTC\\/USD pair failed to hold the stated $8,240 support and even broke the 100 hourly simple moving average. It opened the doors for more losses and the price broke the $8,160 support level. Sellers took control and pushed the price below the $8,000 handle. A low was formed below $7,900 at $7,860 where buyers defended further losses. \\n\nAt the moment, the price is consolidating above $7,850. An initial resistance is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,253 high to $7,860 low. Above this, there is a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $8,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. More importantly, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,253 high to $7,860 low is at $8,057. Therefore, if the price moves above $8,000, there are many hurdles near $8,100, waiting to cap upsides. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price clearly broke a key support at $8,160, signaling a short-term downtrend. There could be recoveries towards $8,100 and $8,200. However, as long as the price is below $8,200, it is likely to remain under selling pressure. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is mostly placed in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is moving higher from the oversold levels. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $7,850 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $8,100 \\n\nThe post

A lot of the news around Bitcoin has to do with its value rising and falling. Many have decided to invest with hopes its value goes up. While the total number of those with Bitcoin is just a fraction of the world’s population, some of them happen to live in Fresno. FM89’s Laura Tsutsui reports that some of these users aren’t necessarily hoping to strike it rich, but instead are trying to understand how cryptocurrency could be a part of our lives in years to come. Anthony Yang is a researcher and content developer in Downtown Fresno. He’s the kind of person who listens to YouTube videos at the twice the normal speed so he can learn a lot in a short amount of time. Something he’s decided to start learning about in the last year is Bitcoin. “I probably will check it maybe once or twice a week,” says Yang. “If I do check, it's to check where Bitcoin is at, and then once in a while I’ll Google and see if there are any updates or huge changes in the cryptocurrency news.” Yang holds up his \"cold wallet.\" It looks like a flash drive, but it's not. Bitcoin enthusiasts say devices like these are safer when it comes to storing digital currency. Credit Laura Tsutsui / Valley Public Radio Yang isn’t into Bitcoin to get rich. He’s exploring it because he wants to understand how this might affect his life in the coming years. He’s not the only one trying to figure it out. Once a month in the basement of the Bitwise South Stadium, a group of Bitcoin enthusiasts meet to talk about the latest cryptocurrency news. It’s hard to know how many Bitcoin users actually live in Fresno, but the group boasts 300 members, and about 15 showed up. Kurt Arisohn started the group over a year ago. “It’s so much going on. You can spend a day, and you can spend the next year researching this stuff and still be lost in it all,” says Arisohn. “Every single day there’s new updates, there’s new things happening. And you think ‘Oh, I’ve figured this all out,’ and you wake up one day and you think, I don’t understand any of this, and you start from scratch.” Arisohn says that the conversations end up getting philosophical very fast. “You really start to question, what is value, and what is my bank providing for me?” He says that Bitcoin users challenge traditional financial institutions because Bitcoin isn’t owned or managed by any one person or government. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized money, tracked on a meticulously kept ledger. So, someone could exchange their dollars for bitcoin, watch the price fluctuate, and if the price is up, maybe end up with more dollars than they started with. And since it’s decentralized, someone can transfer money to someone else without the oversight of a bank or expensive wire transfer fees.

Indirect Taxes is considering applying the 18 percent tax to exchange operations, which it would view as “intangible goods.”&t/strong&t&t/p&t\n&tp&t“Purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies should be considered as supply of goods, and those facilitating transactions like supply, transfer, storage, accounting, among others, will be treated as services,” the publication reports in a summary.&t/p&t\n&tp&tIndia has so far refrained from issuing regulations on cryptocurrency, despite efforts by its central bank to reduce the ability of businesses and citizens to interact with them.&t/p&t\n&tp&t&tstrong&tIn April, the Reserve Bank of India &ta href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/petition-to-reverse-indian-central-banks-crypto-ban-gains-17000-signatures\"&tformally forbade&t/a&t domestic institutions from servicing cryptocurrency businesses in a move which has so far &ta href=\"https://qz.com/1279288/despite-indias-crackdown-on-bitcoin-new-cryptocurrency-exchanges-are-still-coming/\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\"&tfailed to curb&t/a&t the proliferation of new exchanges.&t/strong&t&t/p&t\n&tp&tIf the taxation rule goes ahead, it would signal a move towards legitimacy of the industry in the continued absence of hard-and-fast legislation.&t/p&t\n&tp&t&tem&t&tstrong&t“If buyers and sellers are in India, the transaction would be treated as a supply of software and the buyer’s location will be the place of supply,”&t/strong&t&t/em&t Bloomberg continues, noting elsewhere that:&tstrong&t “Transactions beyond the Indian territory will be liable for integrated GST, and would be considered as import or export of goods. IGST will be levied on cross-border supplies.”&t/strong&t&t/p&t\n&t/blockquote&t\n&tp&tThe move is not the first targeting taxation of cryptocurrency in India. In February, &ta href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-media-creates-panic-over-2-month-old-crypto-tax\"&tletters&t/a&t were sent to around half a million traders demanding they report profits on exchange activities.&t/p&t\n&tp&tMeanwhile, &ta href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-markets-tumble-losses-as-high-as-10-bitcoin-price-dips-below-8k\"&tCoinTelegraph notes&t/a&t a new report issued by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, &ta href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-it-ministry-2017-saw-peak-investment-in-domestic-blockchain-industry\"&treiterated&t/a&t the &tstrong&tChinese government’s concerns about “certain risks that cannot be ignored” in regards to ICOs, pyramid schemes, and fraud,&t/strong&t with a new government-led study &ta href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-govt-study-detects-421-fake-cryptos-outlines-key-features-of-fraud\"&tdetecting&t/a&t 421 fake cryptocurrencies in China’s crypto space.&t/p&t&timg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~4/BKRg5BialE4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&t\nhttp://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge...-india-tax ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "china crackdown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:51:00.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e84c1667ecb8a81e2e6e27b92e4aec361d80cc6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhZzq0jo.zMuJ2fDmftVfh4_vY6qWolu24zV7ABaHy0iiCYNbslNefPMIViyXSWvptW5URZZJut7qz_KxV3iYdWnIarrZAZOAy2XmPQL_bKNaE2WEnaqe.sSHhWiH2OGsjR_1tw4bkRd3", "site_full": "southafrica.trendolizer.com", "site": "trendolizer.com", "site_section": "http://southafrica.trendolizer.com/atom.xml", "site_categories": ["travel", "africa"], "section_title": "South Africa", "title": "South Africa: Gang Kidnaps 13 Year Old Boy, Demands Ransom of 15 Bitcoins", "title_full": "South Africa: Gang Kidnaps 13 Year Old Boy, Demands Ransom of 15 Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-23T19:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://southafrica.trendolizer.com/images/caption_8810076.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 63018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e84c1667ecb8a81e2e6e27b92e4aec361d80cc6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhZzq0jo.zMuJ2fDmftVfh4_vY6qWolu24zV7ABaHy0iiCYNbslNefPMIViyXSWvptW5URZZJut7qz_KxV3iYdWnIarrZAZOAy2XmPQL_bKNaE2WEnaqe.sSHhWiH2OGsjR_1tw4bkRd3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maarten Schenk", "published": "2018-05-23T19:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa: Gang Kidnaps 13 Year Old Boy, Demands Ransom of 15 Bitcoins", "text": "South Africa: Gang Kidnaps 13 Year Old Boy, Demands Ransom of 15 Bitcoins on cointelegraph.com The kidnappers of a 13-year-old boy in South Africa have demanded a “non-negotiable” ransom of 15 BTC, worth around $120,000.

By the end of 2018, the study estimates that Bitcoin could use as much as 7.67 gigawatts of power -- almost as much energy as it takes to power the country of Austria.\n“With the Bitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, this means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018,” writes de Vries, adding, “Bitcoin has a big problem, and it is growing fast.”\nRequires a large amount of computational power Concern about the energy usage required to “mine” Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is based on the large amount of computer processing power it takes to verify the transactions that create the coin, as well as add them to the public ledger.\nAn army of computers are needed to timestamp transactions along the blockchain, a system which prevents duplicate spending of coins through a process known as “proof-of-work.”\nWhile there’s no question that mining Bitcoin is energy intensive, some experts say we don’t currently have enough data to draw a definitive conclusion on Bitcoin’s energy usage.\nExperts unsure Jonathan Koomey, a professor at Stanford, says the way de Vries calculates the value of energy used in Bitcoin, and the price paid for that energy, may be problematic. He adds that he’s unsure where de Vries is getting the two numbers he uses for those values.\n“For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing,” Koomey told NBC News . “My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.”\n“The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,” Koomey continued. “There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.”\nDe Vries says that because cryptocurrency mining doesn’t seem to be slowing down, researchers must work on finding out what the currency’s impact is before it becomes too late to enact institutional restrictions and regulations on the practice.\n\"We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed,” de Vries said in a statement. “Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.”\nThe research has been published in the energy journal Joule .\nStay up to date with important consumer news: Oops! something went wrong, mind trying again?

Photo: Reuters Last year, for the first time, bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies took the world by storm. In fact so strongly that everyone wants to get a piece of that action. Whether you already own cryptocurrencies or plan to get some, sooner or later you’ll want to know how much the crypto coins are worth when converted to your currency of choice. Later, you may want to know whether to hang onto your coins or to sell them—hopefully making a little profit in the process.\nAnalysing price charts and understanding trading terms from the financial world can be rather daunting, especially for a beginner. Today we look at the story of the price movement of cryptocurrencies for you to get a sense of how to go about investing in them.\nThe discovery phase (2009-2010)\nBitcoin was not traded on any exchanges in 2009. The first recorded price was in 2010. Technically, bitcoin was worth $0 in 2009, during its very first year of existence. Price of bitcoins never topped $1 in 2010 and the highest price for the year was just $0.39\nThe acceptance phase (2011-2016)\nJust two years old, bitcoin achieved parity with the dollar on the Mt Gox exchange in February 2011. Bitcoin reached the top of first ‘bubble’ at $31, followed by the first major price drop. It dropped to as low as $2 by December 2011, eroding more than 95% of its value. By this time, many notions about how to improve bitcoin appeared, but not all of them could be implemented. Some people from the community started their own projects and altcoins came into existence. Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. A majority of altcoins are forks of bitcoin with small uninteresting changes. Coins such as ripple, litecoin, primecoin and namecoin came into existence. It is in this period that the value of bitcoin started rising at a consistent level from $2 in December 2011 to an all-time high of $1,242 in November 2013 and it fell to $750 by November 2016. However, this rise did come with extreme volatility at multiple support levels. For instance, bitcoin went up from the levels of $150–$200 in October 2013, rising to $1,242 on November 2013. After this rise, the price crashed to $600, bouncing back to $1,000 level and crashing again to the $500 range in just two months.\nThe meteoric rise (2017)\nEven the most casual observer of the digital currency scene will be aware that 2017 was a record year in terms of price movement. Bitcoin was the marquee attraction for new investors given its incredible rise from $900 in January 2017 to $20,000 by December 2017. Bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency to shine in 2017. The price of ethereum rose by over 9000% in 2017. The market valuation of ethereum recorded a 64-fold increase from $700 million to $45 billion, officially becoming the best performing cryptocurrency in the market year-todate. Starting from $8 in January, ethereum reached a high of $450 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, ripple started the year at $0.0063 and ended the year above $1 fetching returns to unheard tunes of 36000%. The world sat down and took notice of these unheard percentage rise in 2017 and started looking at cryptocurrencies as an asset class which could not be ignored.\nThe sustenance phase (2018)\nThis year, everyone has started questioning the longevity of cryptocurrencies and its usage. Originally launched as a way to transact digitally, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become a form of an asset class. However, bitcoins will continue facing high volatility for multiple reasons. Market participants will become increasingly demanding to see real use cases of the much-hyped blockchain technology and the related role of the cryptocurrencies to power this technology. Governments across the countries will be stepping in with regulatory frameworks for conduct of cryptocurrency exchanges, which can affect the price movements in either direction.

Photo: Reuters Last year, for the first time, bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies took the world by storm. In fact so strongly that everyone wants to get a piece of that action. Whether you already own cryptocurrencies or plan to get some, sooner or later you’ll want to know how much the crypto coins are worth when converted to your currency of choice. Later, you may want to know whether to hang onto your coins or to sell them—hopefully making a little profit in the process.\nAnalysing price charts and understanding trading terms from the financial world can be rather daunting, especially for a beginner. Today we look at the story of the price movement of cryptocurrencies for you to get a sense of how to go about investing in them.\nThe discovery phase (2009-2010)\nBitcoin was not traded on any exchanges in 2009. The first recorded price was in 2010. Technically, bitcoin was worth $0 in 2009, during its very first year of existence. Price of bitcoins never topped $1 in 2010 and the highest price for the year was just $0.39\nThe acceptance phase (2011-2016)\nJust two years old, bitcoin achieved parity with the dollar on the Mt Gox exchange in February 2011. Bitcoin reached the top of first ‘bubble’ at $31, followed by the first major price drop. It dropped to as low as $2 by December 2011, eroding more than 95% of its value. By this time, many notions about how to improve bitcoin appeared, but not all of them could be implemented. Some people from the community started their own projects and altcoins came into existence. Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. A majority of altcoins are forks of bitcoin with small uninteresting changes. Coins such as ripple, litecoin, primecoin and namecoin came into existence. It is in this period that the value of bitcoin started rising at a consistent level from $2 in December 2011 to an all-time high of $1,242 in November 2013 and it fell to $750 by November 2016. However, this rise did come with extreme volatility at multiple support levels. For instance, bitcoin went up from the levels of $150–$200 in October 2013, rising to $1,242 on November 2013. After this rise, the price crashed to $600, bouncing back to $1,000 level and crashing again to the $500 range in just two months.\nThe meteoric rise (2017)\nEven the most casual observer of the digital currency scene will be aware that 2017 was a record year in terms of price movement. Bitcoin was the marquee attraction for new investors given its incredible rise from $900 in January 2017 to $20,000 by December 2017. Bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency to shine in 2017. The price of ethereum rose by over 9000% in 2017. The market valuation of ethereum recorded a 64-fold increase from $700 million to $45 billion, officially becoming the best performing cryptocurrency in the market year-todate. Starting from $8 in January, ethereum reached a high of $450 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, ripple started the year at $0.0063 and ended the year above $1 fetching returns to unheard tunes of 36000%. The world sat down and took notice of these unheard percentage rise in 2017 and started looking at cryptocurrencies as an asset class which could not be ignored.\nThe sustenance phase (2018)\nThis year, everyone has started questioning the longevity of cryptocurrencies and its usage. Originally launched as a way to transact digitally, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become a form of an asset class. However, bitcoins will continue facing high volatility for multiple reasons. Market participants will become increasingly demanding to see real use cases of the much-hyped blockchain technology and the related role of the cryptocurrencies to power this technology. Governments across the countries will be stepping in with regulatory frameworks for conduct of cryptocurrency exchanges, which can affect the price movements in either direction. Also, 2018 might witness a fierce competition between bitcoin and other competent crypto currencies for dominance.\nPraveenkumar Vijayakumar is chief executive officer and founder, Belfrics Global\nFirst Published: Wed, May 23 2018. 11 05 AM IST", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T08:42:08.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3deb9a2a7219f8f39bf31d82b65dcac91536de11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3yro4IWJBFr91xVmdZIkFXd.gjRMIeAhxUh9hiem2k5GNbcMw_z9FetQvug_eWYfZA--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "South Africa: Gang Kidnaps 13 Year Old Boy, Demands Ransom of 15 Bitcoins", "title_full": "South Africa: Gang Kidnaps 13 Year Old Boy, Demands Ransom of 15 Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-23T19:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3deb9a2a7219f8f39bf31d82b65dcac91536de11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3yro4IWJBFr91xVmdZIkFXd.gjRMIeAhxUh9hiem2k5GNbcMw_z9FetQvug_eWYfZA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T19:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa: Gang Kidnaps 13 Year Old Boy, Demands Ransom of 15 Bitcoins", "text": "Home » bitcoin » crypto » crypto news » news » South Africa: Gang Kidnaps 13 Year Old Boy, Demands Ransom of 15 Bitcoins South Africa: Gang Kidnaps 13 Year Old Boy, Demands Ransom of 15 Bitcoins bitcoin , crypto , crypto news , news #bitcoin #invest #money\nThe kidnappers of a 13-year-old boy in South Africa have demanded a “non-negotiable” ransom of 15 BTC, worth around $120,000. The kidnappers of a 13-year-old boy in South Africa have demanded a ransom of 15 bitcoins (BTC) - around $120,000 - for his release, The Guardian reported Tuesday, May 22. Local police stated that on Sunday, May 20, three gang members pulled up in a car near to where the teenager, Kathlego Marite, was playing with two friends close to his home in the town of Witbank. Witnesses said the men dragged him into the vehicle, leaving their ransom note at the scene. The “non-negotiable” note reportedly threatens to kill the boy if the demands are not met, with the first deadline for payment passing on Monday. Local media quoted Brigadier Leonard Hlathi as saying that the family is “going through trauma”: \"They don’t even know what this Bitcoin is. They’re devastated and you can see they’re worried and asking themselves, 'where’s our son?'\" The Guardian reports that the case is the first ransom demand for cryptocurrency in the country’s history. Late last year, Pavel Lerner, the managing director of crypto exchange EXMO was released after a $1 mln ransom in Bitcoin was paid to a gang who had abducted him while he was leaving his office in Kiev, Ukraine. That same month, the perpetrator of an attempted package bombing in Germany sent a note via DHL demanding a €10 mln ransom to be paid in Bitcoin.\nBitcoin has also allegedly been an increasingly popular form of ransom demanded by cybercriminals, with widespread fears of the high-profile WannaCry ransomware causing companies globally to “stockpile” the cryptocurrency preemptively last year.

an International Payment Option May 23, 2018 at 15:55 // News Author Coin Idol\nPopular banking institution Banco Masventas (BMV) has recently announced in a statement that it has enabled customers to use bitcoin as an international payment option. As the bank revealed, clients can send virtual coins to more than 50 countries using Bitex.\nBMV is considered to be the world’s first bank that accepts blockchain-based Bitcoin as an option for performing a payment. Bitex, a Latin American crypto exchange, has contributed a lot to the development of such an option. It allows sending crypto coins within 24 hours, however, with a fee of 3% + VAT. BMV vs. Ripple\nActually, the working mechanism used by BMV is almost identical to that of Ripple, only with Bitcoin instead of XRP. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that Bitcoin is more expensive and sluggish to send than XRP, due to its costly fees and slow processes of transfer.\nGiven low fees and small processing time, Ripple moves a customer transaction as soon as it appeared, while BMV and Bitex are bound to send payments in big batches. To send every transaction powered by bitcoin technology at once is too expensive, as it costs around $1.30 on average. What is next?\nAs for the future of these cross-border payments on the cryptocurrency market, the big decision is to be made by top international banks, which are using digital currency as well as fiat currency. The successful combination of these two money systems creates the most beneficial result for clients.\n\"The customers will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the bank uses Bitex as a provider. For the customer, it's transparent, they don't touch, they don't see the bitcoin. We are a provider for them, and they are not touching bitcoin,\" said Bitex chief marketing officer Manuel Beaudroit to CoinDesk.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/bank-argentina-just-added-bitcoin-cross-border-payments/", "https://www.bancomasventas.com.ar/bitex-principal"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "international payment option bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T23:07:08.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c98837383d85d59a0cf3d26130dcfcf94975c051", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcsW1d9.PXEaxVOA2FWJ8Hw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Criminals and Bitcoin", "title_full": "Criminals and Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-23T18:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c98837383d85d59a0cf3d26130dcfcf94975c051", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcsW1d9.PXEaxVOA2FWJ8Hw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "stripewhite", "published": "2018-05-23T18:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Criminals and Bitcoin", "text": "The US dollar is used by criminals.

last week, and bounced, Bitcoin has broken back below it - to six-week lows - as the entire crypto-space is under pressure following China crackdown headlines and news that India is considering a major crypto tax.\nIt's a sea of red across cryptos...\nSo much for Blockchain Week...\nAnd the entire cryptospace is accelerating lower...\nWhile it is never clear what the driver of price action is, news from China and India appear to major potential catalysts in the last 24-48 hours... CoinTelegraph reports that India is working on proposals to make cryptocurrency transactions subject to goods and services tax (GST), sources told Bloomberg May 23.\nAccording to the anonymous parties with “direct knowledge” of the plans, the government’s Central Board of Indirect Taxes is considering applying the 18 percent tax to exchange operations, which it would view as “intangible goods.”\n“Purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies should be considered as supply of goods, and those facilitating transactions like supply, transfer, storage, accounting, among others, will be treated as services,” the publication reports in a summary.\nIndia has so far refrained from issuing regulations on cryptocurrency, despite efforts by its central bank to reduce the ability of businesses and citizens to interact with them.\nIn April, the Reserve Bank of India formally forbade domestic institutions from servicing cryptocurrency businesses in a move which has so far failed to curb the proliferation of new exchanges.\nIf the taxation rule goes ahead, it would signal a move towards legitimacy of the industry in the continued absence of hard-and-fast legislation.\n“If buyers and sellers are in India, the transaction would be treated as a supply of software and the buyer’s location will be the place of supply,” Bloomberg continues, noting elsewhere that: “Transactions beyond the Indian territory will be liable for integrated GST, and would be considered as import or export of goods. IGST will be levied on cross-border supplies.”\nThe move is not the first targeting taxation of cryptocurrency in India. In February, letters were sent to around half a million traders demanding they report profits on exchange activities.\nMeanwhile, CoinTelegraph notes a new report issued by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, reiterated the Chinese government’s concerns about “certain risks that cannot be ignored” in regards to ICOs, pyramid schemes, and fraud, with a new government-led study detecting 421 fake cryptocurrencies in China’s crypto space.

L'OPINION For Small Lenders, Bitcoin Is a Moneymaker Christina Rexrode 23 Mai 2018 à 17h40 Most big banks are avoiding cryptocurrencies. To a few small lenders, that means more business for them Virtual currencies remain unpredictable, defined by wild price swings, increasing regulatory scrutiny and a relative lack of transparency.\nTo many banks, bitcoin and other digital currencies are a mania, or worse. But to a handful of small lenders, they are a moneymaker.\nTake Silvergate Bank, a three-branch lender that until recently focused mostly on local businesses in the San Diego area. Last year, its assets nearly doubled to $1.9 billion from $978 million, largely because of business flowing in from crypto-related companies.\nBig banks’ decision to largely shun the crypto world has left an opening for smaller lenders such as Silvergate, Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp. in New York and Cross River Bank in Fort Lee, N.J. In part their decision reflects an environment where community banks often struggle to differentiate themselves, given larger firms often can offer consumers and businesses largely unmatchable conveniences with their geographic reach and deployment of mobile and other technology.\nAs bitcoin has emerged from the underground world of nerds and criminals to become a mainstream investment, the risk of hacks and scandals has also blossomed. What's a government to do? The WSJ's Steven Russolillo travels the world (sort of) to see how regulators are responding to the remarkable rise of cryptocurrencies.

Muslims are asked to give away 2.5 per cent of their wealth during the 30-day festival as part of zakat.\n“We are trying to appeal to a wider audience with the new money,” Erkin Guney, the chairman of the board of trustees, told The Hackney Gazette .\n“It’s big in the Islamic world, and we have set up a platform for wealthier Muslims outside our community to support and donate to our mosque.”\nYou do not have access to view this Atom. Last month, Muhammad Abu-Bakar of Blossom Finance in Indonesia explored the functionality of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to determine whether they fit with Islam’s strict definitions of money.\n“Several recent fatawah issued by prominent Muslim scholars offered incomplete or contradictory opinions on the topic,” said Matthew Martin, CEO of Blossom Finance.\n“With all the confusion out there, we wanted to offer clear guidance supported by solid research that benefits both laypeople and practitioners of Islamic finance.”\nThe conclusion of his study was that bitcoin is permissible in principle as it is accepted by a wide variety of global merchants.\nThe bitcoin wallet address used by the mosque to receive the cryptocurrency has so far only received one donation, worth just over £100 at today’s prices.\nGurmit Singh, founder of blockchain startup Combo Innovation who helped advise the mosque on setting up the bitcoin wallet, is hopeful for more donations.\n“If Muslims, who make up a quarter of the world’s population, hold just 1 per cent of bitcoins – or £1.04 billion – then £26 million in Zakat contributions is due,” Mr Singh said.\n“It is likely the actual figure is much higher. Currently hardly any mosques or Islamic charities accept Zakat in cryptocurrency.

He touched on their complexity and the fact that they are connected with a yearning for social revolution.\nRobert Shiller is an esteemed Nobel prize winning economist who is known for his warnings about the dot-com and the housing bubbles. In an interview for CNBC, the professor at Yale University expressed his rather negative sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, saying:\nTo me it’s another example of faddish human behavior.\nShiller’s opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also consolidated in a blog post that he published on May 21 st . Apples and Oranges\nShiller lays down his take on cryptocurrencies, bringing forward what he believes are comparable examples of other failed attempts to replace conventional fiat currency.\nHe touches the so-called Labor Theory of Value , as well as John Pease Norton’s proposition of introducing a dollar, the value of which was backed by electricity. Both of those examples attempted to replace the gold standard, which, for the US, meant that 40% of its notes had to be backed by gold. This ended in 1933 when the country abandoned the gold standard, severing the connection between gold and the dollar.\nAs it is painfully obvious, both those examples proposed new models during an existing, pre-determined standard. They attempted to disrupt what was currently existing and replace it with something new – money backed by labor and electricity, respectively, and not by gold, which was the merit at the time these propositions came to light. As Shiller notes:\nEach of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story, […] But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, does nothing of the kind. It’s not backed by any actual asset like gold, silver, or time. All Aboard the Bitcoin Revolution!\nApparently, Shiller thinks Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were introduced by some sort of anti-governmental villains, a community of aspiring entrepreneurs who “hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\nLet’s break that down. Bitcoin was introduced by an anonymous person or a group of people going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Up until this moment, Bitcoin’s founder(s) remain anonymous, so it’s hard to say that they are holding themselves above any government.\nAnother leading project in the field is Ethereum, the founder of which is well-known – Vitalik Buterin . While he’s particularly active on social media, never has he touched that digital currencies are to overthrow any government, let alone to cause some sort of social revolution. Ambiguity Levels Over 9000!\nAs it is with quite a lot of people who stand to refute the merits of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, Shiller also goes on to say that he doesn’t mean to “dismiss it.” He also lightly touched on the fact that “some smart people got into this (Bitcoin) and some other cryptocurrencies.” So which is it?\nAs a matter of fact, whole countries are jumping on the cryptocurrency wagon, assembling teams to create their own virtual currencies – China and Iran are prime examples. Major companies from different sectors are launching their own blockchain-based projects. Cases in point: JP Morgan , Facebook , LG , Microsoft , Oracle , HTC , and many more.\nEven the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US launched a mock crypto project to help spread awareness and to advocate caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies, essentially recognizing that they are here to stay.\nYet, Shiller’s merits lie within what seems to be a rather old sentiment:\nPractically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal, […] None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.\nIt’s probably safe to say that there is something a lot more measurable than “mystery” and “revolutionary zeal” when countries are assembling task forces and working hard towards regulating a field. If anything, it speaks that institutions have recognized what this new field has to offer and that they are attempting to work out a way to incorporate it into our everyday lives.\nDo you agree with Professor Shiller that Bitcoin’s mysterious glamor is all there is to it?

#money Robert Shiller, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2013, holds that Bitcoin, amongst other cryptocurrencies, might be just another failed experiment. He touched on their complexity and the fact that they are connected with a yearning for social revolution.\nRobert Shiller is an esteemed Nobel prize winning economist who is known for his warnings about the dot-com and the housing bubbles. In an interview for CNBC, the professor at Yale University expressed his rather negative sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, saying:\nTo me it’s another example of faddish human behavior.\nShiller’s opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also consolidated in a blog post that he published on May 21 st . Apples and Oranges\nShiller lays down his take on cryptocurrencies, bringing forward what he believes are comparable examples of other failed attempts to replace conventional fiat currency.\nHe touches the so-called Labor Theory of Value , as well as John Pease Norton’s proposition of introducing a dollar, the value of which was backed by electricity. Both of those examples attempted to replace the gold standard, which, for the US, meant that 40% of its notes had to be backed by gold. This ended in 1933 when the country abandoned the gold standard, severing the connection between gold and the dollar.\nAs it is painfully obvious, both those examples proposed new models during an existing, pre-determined standard. They attempted to disrupt what was currently existing and replace it with something new – money backed by labor and electricity, respectively, and not by gold, which was the merit at the time these propositions came to light. As Shiller notes:\nEach of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story, […] But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, does nothing of the kind. It’s not backed by any actual asset like gold, silver, or time. All Aboard the Bitcoin Revolution!\nApparently, Shiller thinks Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were introduced by some sort of anti-governmental villains, a community of aspiring entrepreneurs who “hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\nLet’s break that down. Bitcoin was introduced by an anonymous person or a group of people going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Up until this moment, Bitcoin’s founder(s) remain anonymous, so it’s hard to say that they are holding themselves above any government.\nAnother leading project in the field is Ethereum, the founder of which is well-known – Vitalik Buterin . While he’s particularly active on social media, never has he touched that digital currencies are to overthrow any government, let alone to cause some sort of social revolution. Ambiguity Levels Over 9000!\nAs it is with quite a lot of people who stand to refute the merits of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, Shiller also goes on to say that he doesn’t mean to “dismiss it.” He also lightly touched on the fact that “some smart people got into this (Bitcoin) and some other cryptocurrencies.” So which is it?\nAs a matter of fact, whole countries are jumping on the cryptocurrency wagon, assembling teams to create their own virtual currencies – China and Iran are prime examples. Major companies from different sectors are launching their own blockchain-based projects. Cases in point: JP Morgan , Facebook , LG , Microsoft , Oracle , HTC , and many more.\nEven the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US launched a mock crypto project to help spread awareness and to advocate caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies, essentially recognizing that they are here to stay.\nYet, Shiller’s merits lie within what seems to be a rather old sentiment:\nPractically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal, […] None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.\nIt’s probably safe to say that there is something a lot more measurable than “mystery” and “revolutionary zeal” when countries are assembling task forces and working hard towards regulating a field. If anything, it speaks that institutions have recognized what this new field has to offer and that they are attempting to work out a way to incorporate it into our everyday lives.\nDo you agree with Professor Shiller that Bitcoin’s mysterious glamor is all there is to it?

He posted the mail, along with a follow-up tweet which had a poll asking his followers if he should take up Google’s offer.\nIn his original tweet, Vitalik failed to hide the recruiter’s name, email address or profile photo. It was a short mail, and a part of it was broken in the screenshot he posted. It said, “I hope you are doing well and enjoying the weekend!” and continued “Google make sense for you now or in the near future”.\nThe poll received more than 2,000 votes, with more than 50% saying he should not take the job. However, a little more than 40% of them felt he should drop Ethereum and work for Google. A few hours later, Buterin decided to delete the tweet, probably because he failed to censor the recruiter’s information.\nIt is highly unlikely for Vitalik to drop everything he’s achieved with Ethereum and work for Google. Vitalik is seen as the face of Ethereum and him leaving would have an immediate impact on Ethereum’s price. It is likely he posted the screenshot as a joke that Google would try hiring him of all people.\nVitalik Buterin has been hard at work for the past few months with important Ethereum updates like the implementation of Proof-of-stake protocol, Casper and Sharding. He’s also been an advocate for blockchain and cryptocurrencies by making an appearance and giving talks at multiple international events.\nGoogle, on the other hand, entirely banned Cryptocurrency and ICO ads on their search engine in March this year. However, in the same month it was revealed that Google was working on its own blockchain product: a distributed digital ledger that third parties can use to post and verify transactions. Google may have been interested in hiring Vitalik for this project, or even an unannounced one. Google is also an investor in multiple blockchain companies like Ripple, LedgerX and Veem.\nFeatured image from Flickr/TechCrunch.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vitalik buterin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buterin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitalik", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T02:00:24.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "740b3817f11fefb22935442611ad6ece36519113", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pkqpI5eP.I3.XIvqPg0bPva5UgpyrBDlOgULA1Kv8LSATvIfB4ilLUkDLdJVe4r8z4CviVnJqBvE-", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin Falls Below $8,000 for First Time Since Mid-April", "title_full": "Bitcoin Falls Below $8,000 for First Time Since Mid-April", "published": "2018-05-23T18:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1200x675-1024x576.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "740b3817f11fefb22935442611ad6ece36519113", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pkqpI5eP.I3.XIvqPg0bPva5UgpyrBDlOgULA1Kv8LSATvIfB4ilLUkDLdJVe4r8z4CviVnJqBvE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-23T18:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Falls Below $8,000 for First Time Since Mid-April", "text": "Bitcoin Falls Below $8,000 for First Time Since Mid-April by 0\nBitcoin fell to the lowest level in a month, as a two-week selloff dropped the cryptocurrency’s price below $8,000 for the first time since mid-April. Bitcoin slumped 3 percent to $7,868.71 as of 8:10 a.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg composite pricing.\nIt’s now down almost 20 percent since a May 4 peak.
