He broke his explanation down into two parts; A) BCH has outperformed Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple in the last month, and B) A new fund started by BCH miners is going to be used “ to build stuff on top of bitcoin cash ,”\nKelly , founder and CEO of BKCM, an investment firm focused on digital currencies, had his digital chart out to show BCH’s 6% rally over the last month has made it a leader among the top cryptocurrencies. BCH was at a low of almost $600 in mid-April from where it increased dramatically through to early May when it topped $1,800 and has steadily lost value to where it trades today at $1,235 according to livecoinwatch.com.\nFor Kelly, the important aspects of BCH’s performance are the overall 6% gain and the fact that it has held support over $1,000 since April 20.\nThe one-month performance of the coin coupled with the news that BCH miners are planning to take some of the money from their rewards and reinvest into the BCH blockchain is the news to buy according to Kelly who told the panel on Fast Money ,\n“That’s how blockchains gain value, you’re going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash.”\nKelly concluded that a good looking chart like the one BCH has shown over the last month paired with a catalyst like the announcement of a fund to add value to the coins blockchain “ That’s a place I want to buy ,”\nBitcoin Cash has Seen it’s Ups and Downs This Month\nBitcoin Cash spiked and lost over the last month due to two major factors that many predicted would first create a pump and dump and then just a pump. Namely Consensus 2018 and the fact that Bitcoin Cash went through a hard fork on May 15.\nIt was likely the anticipation of the hard fork, which was scheduled to increase the block size to 32mb among other changes, that brought the coin up over the $1,000 hurdle and sent it to $1,800 in early May. But it was declining long before the hard fork deadline and has remained relatively steady since even when most of the market took a loss through Consensus week.\nAs bulls like Tom Lee called for Bitcoin to get a big spike from the annual gathering of the crypto clan in New York last week, it actually dumped by 6% through the festivities taking BCH which lost 15% with it. Still, that dip of about $200 wasn’t enough to bring down its one month gain.\nImage from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john mcmahon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "crypto bul", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc crypto bull", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly calls bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bkcm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:12:42.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e87108adb8080b75dc2f755dff0fcbab321fe4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_tehq4EG1FsU2IVxvyw.j7d2chxxAJp4h5n26yoPNWjrKgsdC5mZaxoaH.g9qX3HKDh_PZRP6xu6rw4uS7oH.YFb1QsgZ440LwiPXbFKVGcyXfF9a0oON0l8kNjuHkoahf4La8yVOsYw--", "site_full": "www.kitco.com", "site": "kitco.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert - Price Downtrend Remains In Place - May 22 | Kitco News", "title_full": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert - Price Downtrend Remains In Place - May 22 | Kitco News", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.191, "main_image": "http://www.kitco.com/news/2018-05-22/images/Bitcoin_0522.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7841, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e87108adb8080b75dc2f755dff0fcbab321fe4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_tehq4EG1FsU2IVxvyw.j7d2chxxAJp4h5n26yoPNWjrKgsdC5mZaxoaH.g9qX3HKDh_PZRP6xu6rw4uS7oH.YFb1QsgZ440LwiPXbFKVGcyXfF9a0oON0l8kNjuHkoahf4La8yVOsYw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Http", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert - Price Downtrend Remains In Place - May 22 | Kitco News", "text": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert - Price Downtrend Remains In Place - May 22 Jim Wyckoff Tuesday May 22, 2018 08:12\nKitco News\nShare this article:\nEditor's Note: Welcome to Kitco's new Bitcoin Daily Technical Alert.

Not just the cryptocurrency’s world, but Bitcoin has been consistently the talk of the town, specially with the bitcoin price, which keeps surprising everyone, with the high’s and low’s associated.\nBitcoin bulls come to advocate and make bullish claims that the bitcoin price may have its little dips here and there but it is inevitably mean to rise. While some of them may sound shallow, most of them have the correct reasons and we believe the bitcoin price to rise. Here’s why. Clarity from regulators\nThe regulations on Bitcoin across the world are now being passed explicitly and there’s only a little room for ambiguity. This helps to encourage big-money, institutional investors to get involved in the space. Fran Strajnar, CEO of Brave New Coin , explained to Forbes :\n“Bitcoin is trading upwards for a number of reasons. The U.S. is stepping in to regulate security tokens instead of commodity assets (utility) and we are seeing major value investors stepping into buy as a result […] As the Soros’ and the Rockefellers’ of the world move into this ecosystem, this asset class is legitimized and trending in an extremely positive direction.”\nIn fact in April, Soros Fund Management’s Adam Fisher has received internal approval to trade digital currencies — which has since sparked Bitcoin’s full-blown recovery. Wall Street Companies Coming Forward\nThis month, with the onset of Goldman Sachs announcing to having its own Bitcoin operational platform, other Wall street companies didn’t wait too long to jump on the band wagon.

All of the top currencies are in the deep red right now, with some of them suffering bigger setbacks compared to others. The Bitcoin Cash price, for example, has dropped below $1,200 once again, yet it remains to be seen how long this negative trend will remain in place. The Bitcoin Cash Price Decline\nWith all major cryptocurrencies on the decline, it is only normal Bitcoin and other altcoins will suffer from this pressure. In the case of BCH, the value has declined in the past few hours, and it seems the Bitcoin Cash price will face a big struggle to remain close to the $1,200 level first and foremost. So far, the value has dipped below $1,200 already, but it seems things may improve moving forward.\nOver the past seven days, the Bitcoin Cash price has dropped for over $1,400 all the way down to $1,150. Ever since that time, the value bounced back to nearly $1,300, but holding on to that momentum has proven to be far more difficult than speculators imagined at first. With the Bitcoin Cash price now dropping below $1,200, an interesting trend is forming, which may push the value down to $1,150 once again.\nDue to this 5.61% decline in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash is one of the bigger “losers” of the day so far. There is also a 3.13% decline in the BCH/BTC ration over the past 24 hours, which is only making things worse. Recovering value in either department will be pretty difficult for Bitcoin Cash, but nothing is impossible in the world of cryptocurrency.\nEven the Bitcoin Cash trading volume is on the decline over the past 24 hours. With the volume dropping to just over $602m, things are not looking all that great for BCH. Even so, the overall cryptocurrency trading volume has continued to decline as well, pushing the number down to under $16bn.Turning that situation around will not be easy, as this week is off to another rocky start.\nLooking over the exchanges ranked by trading volume, OKEx is still clearly in a dominant position. HitBTC is not far behind, and EXX takes the third spot. Lbank and OKEx’s BTC pair complete the top five. There are no fiat currency pairs in the top five for BCH right now, which could explain why the USD value is dropping at an accelerated pace.\nFor the time being, Bitcoin Cash speculators will have to contend with this ongoing bearish pressure. It is evident things will not necessarily improve later today, although stranger things have happened in the world of cryptocurrency. Until the Bitcoin price recovers in a significant manner, altcoins will continue to suffer. When that recovery process will take place, remains to be determined at this stage.\nCoinCapPrice CoinCapPrice – Cryptocurrency Market Capitalizations, The latest Bitcoin price for today (up to the minute).

The Handcash platform allows users to send BCH in a contactless manner using near field communication (NFC) technology.\nAlso read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards Nchain Acquires a Majority Stake in the BCH Platform Handcash\nThis week the firm Nchain Group announced they had “closed a deal” that gives the company a large stake in the Handcash platform . According to Nchain, the deal was facilitated through the company’s investment arm Nchain Reaction. News.Bitcoin.com reported on Handcash this past February when the team launched its bitcoin cash beta client for Android phones. The Handcash app allows users to transact with BCH using NFC technology and the platform was created by two developers from Spain, Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane.\n“Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash — So we wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash,” Alejandro Agut explained during the announcement.\nThat gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender’s mobile device close to the recipient’s device. The Nakasendo SDK\nEarlier this month, the Handcash development team also revealed they were allowed to use the Nchain software development kit (SDK) Nakasendo before it was publicly released. News.Bitcoin.com spoke directly with Agut about how the new partnership with Nchain what the BCH community expect from Handcash going forward.\n“It certainly opens up new collaborations with other apps and services from the Nchain family right away, so we can put our protocols there and vice versa,” Agut details. “We are already working with a “Magic Protocol” that will be able to connect your Handcash wallet to third-party services — It uses the Nakasendo SDK — Also, we are going to be first in line to test upcoming SDKs for a few new features we want to adopt in the future.”\nIt has been very easy to work with them. And in the end it’s all about human connections — and they do a great job with managing with all dev teams and projects. User Interfaces Need to Become Better and Easier\nNchain says that the application Handcash make it easier to send BCH in a contactless fashion without any of the processes of copying an address or scanning a QR code.\n“For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use — We are impressed with Handcash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach,” Nchain Group’s CEO Jimmy Nguyen stated during the acquisition.\nNchain is thrilled to support Handcash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nOver the years there have been a couple attempts of NFC cryptocurrency wallets but nothing has really gained traction. There’s been a long wait for a cryptocurrency platform that delivers smooth and effortless cryptocurrency transactions combined with NFC technology, and BCH proponents hope this partnership delivers on its promises.\nWhat do you think about Nchain acquiring a large stake in Handcash?

EOS uses a proof-of-stake (POS) protocol while Ethereum uses a Proof-of-work protocol.\nInterestingly, the difference in the consensus system of the two coins is influencing how investors and traders perceive them. For instance, The price of EOS cryptocurrency has jumped 107% this year while Ethereum has lost 10% in the same period.\nHowever, for the average cryptocurrency trader/investor, not much effort has been placed into explaining the key similarities and differences, and why such distinctive features could influence your trading and investment decisions. This piece examines the key features of proof-of-stake VS proof-of-work. Proof-of-work\nThe proof-of-work system works like an international math competition where competitors (called miners) are required to provide solutions to unsolved problems (called blocks). Any of the competitor that first solves the problem is rewarded a prize (called block reward). The competitor (miner) that solves the problem (block) first is required to provide a proof of his solution (proof of work) and the proof is then posted for everybody involved in the competition to see (block established in the blockchain).\nIn applicable terms, blockchain based transactions happen in a trustless environment – they don’t need the input of a third-party to verify, authorize, or facilitate transactions. When you conduct a transaction such as sending $100 to a friend in a traditional financial institution – you are essentially instructing your bank to debit your account with $100 and credit your friend’s account with $100. The money doesn’t actually move, only the records are changed, and the money remains with the bank until your friend makes an actual withdrawal.\nIn the blockchain ecosystem, you don’t need banks or any other financial institutions to make/edit records. The decentralized peer-to-peer nature of cryptocurrencies creates a situation where transferred funds actually move from your account into the recipient’s account. Nonetheless, the transactions are protected with encrypted algorithms that must be solved/decrypted to verify the authenticity of the transactions. Miners provide the processing power of their mining rigs to solving the encrypted algorithms for transactions and the transactions once validated are stored on the blockchain. Limitations\nA popular proof-of-work coin is Ethereum; others include Bitcoin, Monero, and Litecoin. One of the major limitations of the PoW is the increased possibility of a selfish mining attack in which an attacker chooses to reveal mined blocks to waste computational processing resources. It requires a 51% of the network’s computing power to gain control of a PoW network, while such an attack is impossible on established blockchains such as Bitcoin, a committed and resourceful attacker can pull off a majority attack on small blockchains. Proof-of-stake\nIt is somewhat hard to explain a proof of stake in non-technical terms; so, I’ll use same analogy of solving maths problems. In the proof of stake system, all miners (called forgers in Proof of stake) are competing to solve the encryption algorithms that validate transactions. However, instead of having all miners delve in the question-solving activity to see who solves the question first, miners who have a much money to enter the competition (stake) for a longer period get a preference in solving the problem over newer miners who haven’t invested as much money in the competition – yea, it doesn’t really sound like a competition again.\nSo, imagine playing the lottery – now your chances of winning the lottery increases with the more tickets you buy (stake) – but in the case, how long you’ve been buying tickets also influences your odds of winning.\nIn a proof-of-stake consensus, forgers are chosen to build new blocks based on the size of their stake in the blockchain and the age of such stake in the network. For instance, 600,000 units of the EOS cryptocurrency will give you a better chance to create the next block over someone that has 200,000 EOS. More so, having 600,000 EOS for one year will improve your odds over another forger that has held 600,000 EOS for 2 months.\nIn a PoS concept, forgers are rewarded for their troubles with the transactions levied on the trade since they don’t get have any reason to compete with other miners to record transactions. Some notable examples of PoS coins include EOS, QTUM, Ardor and Cardano. One of the key selling points of the PoS system is that it is inherently defended against the 51% majority attack that besets Proof-of-Work systems. Limitations\nThe key limitation of the proof-of-stake system is that it could be potentially hard to achieve consensus because forgers don’t have anything to lose by voting, making it hard to reach a consensus if they vote on multiple blockchain histories. Another problem with the PoS system is that the only way to own coins is to buy/acquire them from someone that already owns them. Since no new coins are mined, the token supply is mostly controlled by the people that bought it after the original coin distribution and they could easily manipulate prices if they corner enough tokens to move the markets.

Organized on Bitcointalk forum , Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, traded a British man 10,000 bitcoins for two Papa John’s pizzas. The market value of the Papa John’s pizza at the time was $25.\nAt 2010’s value, those two pizzas cost Mr. Hanyecz around $41.\nAt today’s value, those two pizzas cost Mr. Hanyecz more than $80 million.\nFrom CoinDesk : “ Though limited to 16 slices of pizza, the era of bitcoin-powered commerce had begun – not to mention the silent wincing over spending millions of dollars for two pizzas .” “Bitcoin Pizza Day”, celebrated annually on May 22 nd , is not so much about the number of bitcoins spent or the product involved. It is a celebration of the adoption of cryptocurrency and the transaction that had taken place. Digital currency and the blockchain have come a long way since Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned a financial system based on a technology called blockchain in 2008. Since then, Bitcoin has gained worldwide attention and penetrated trading and investment firms across Wall Street.\nFrom Ledger : “ Bitcoin was just a fun hobby project for me 8 years ago ,” said Laszlo. “ When I paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas I had no idea that Bitcoin would eventually become as popular as it is today, with people using it for real world transactions every day .” CoinDesk: Current Bitcoin Price Index of Today’s Value ABOUT THE DIGITAL CURRENCY AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY PRACTICE GROUP\nThe firm’s Digital Currency and Blockchain Technology Practice Group is comprised of members of the firm’s White Collar Criminal Defense & Internal Investigations; Intellectual Property; Tax Controversy and Litigation; and Business & Finance groups.\nThis group advises clients across all industries related to transactions involving virtual currency and related technologies.

Today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief showcases how that promise is starting to materialize in different fields, including the future of elections and geopolitics.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture Iran and Russia Consider Bitcoin to Skirt Sanctions\nIranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. Mohammad-Reza Pourebrahimi, who chairs the Iranian Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs, raised the idea during a recent meeting in Moscow with Dmitry Mezentsev, the Chair of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy. He explained that the Russians “share our opinion. We said that if we manage to move this work forward, then we will be the first countries that use digital currencies in the exchange of goods.”\nIran’s government-owned media Press TV reports that the country’s leadership “specifically started to look at bitcoin as an alternative monetary means to be used in trade after it became clear that European companies were failing to trade with Iran over fears that they would fall afoul of US primary sanctions.” It should be noted that the Iranian government is trying to stop its citizens from having access to global markets it seeks for itself, banning banks from dealing with crypto and even traditional foreign currency exchange shops . Still, Iranian citizens have reportedly sent more than $2.5 billion out of the country to purchase cryptocurrencies with. US Politician Raises $100k From Crypto Community\nCongressional candidate Brian Forde has celebrated on Monday in San Francisco his campaign raising $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations. A former head of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative and Obama’s Senior Technology Advisor, he is considered to be a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile his main Democratic opponent, a former SEC enforcement attorney, has attacked Forde for his work in cryptocurrency, referring to his donors in an ad as “bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nThis contested race is shaping up to be a major example of cryptocurrency impact on electoral politics in America. It is also nice to see that the matter is now getting bipartisan support in the US. As we recently reported, on the other side of the country and the opposite side of the aisle , a Trump-supporting Republican and a bitcoin enthusiast is running to be the next New York Attorney General . Liberation Through Radical Decentralization\nVitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled “ Liberation Through Radical Decentralization .” In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work.\nThey remind us that: “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in particular emerged directly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of the traditional financial system, with ‘The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks’ carved indelibly into Bitcoin’s genesis block. That said, the decentralized technologies behind cryptocurrencies have potential applications far beyond finance.” Real Products, Real Adoption\nWith all the recent news about so many ICOs being outright scams or just failures, it’s good to remember that there are actual projects in the cryptocurrency space that are delivering real services to real users. Two recent examples are Brave and Steemit, coincidentally two different attempts to change how online content monetisation works.\nThe Brave browser recently passed 5 million downloads for the Android operating system and now boasts over 2.3 million monthly active users and over 14,000 verified publishers. And recently the one millionth account was created on the Steem blockchain, which now sees around 60,000 unique accounts transacting each day, and over 250,000 unique daily visitors for the site.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates and what they mean for the future?

Canaan to Launch Biggest Bitcoin IPO Ever\nBejing based Canaan inc., the worlds second largest Bitcoin mining hardware supplier increased its overall profits seven times in 2017 during the soaring Bitcoin price craze selling its products under the AvalonMiner brand. Since those halcyon days, the profitability of mining Bitcoin has steadily declined. Today Bitcoin is worth less than half of what it was in December 2017 and mining them is 60% less profitable.\nThis begs the question, why is this Bitcoin mining rig maker launching an IPO with a $2 billion goal when the profits of and demands for its products are in little demand? According to inside sources who spoke to Reuters about the move Canaan will present itself as a chip designer which focuses on artificial intelligence and blockchain technology development instead of a Bitcoin mining company.\n“ Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company, ” Said one of the unnamed sources Reuters spoke to.\nCanaan produces what are known as ASIC chips designed for the singular purpose of mining Bitcoin. Its customers have historically been large-scale mining operations incorporating thousands of machines working twenty-four hours a day.\nIronically increasing competition since the development of ASIC mining rigs has hit the profit margins of mining outfits hard. Experts estimate that mining revenue in 2018 is just 37% of what it was in 2017. This downshift in mining profits led the worlds largest manufacturer of chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), to cut it’s full-year sales target, citing uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market as its reason. In a Mining Boom Sell Shovels\nThese same factors could be the reasons investors will buy into an IPO by Canaan, as the old adage goes the best way to make money in a gold rush is to sell shovels. A sentiment iterated by Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong-based blockchain and cryptocurrency investment firm who told Reuters,\n“Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,”\nThough crypto mining has been under serious regulatory pressure by the Chinese government and earlier rumors of Canaan’s proposed IPO had the chip maker looking to Hong Kong or Singapore it seems they have gotten approval to go ahead in the country. Last month when China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang visited their factory and said publicly, “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,”\nImage from Shutterstock Mining Company Seeks $2 Billion in Largest Ever Bitcoin IPO was last modified: May 22nd, 2018 by John McMahon ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mcmahon", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "largest ever bitcoin ipo mining company", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bejing", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T11:06:38.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "90d41c824fb7300a93691aeb3c66debdbc93c052", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT5lnHuyWCVlUuBftlW3SCmj4EW9k99vLrNf5eo8CH_ER36JkMVZf3U39p7HpE.vk7pD1B_fyIusalyRjC3pj8NNcyoviBLLuzPOWbc_p_OBA--", "site_full": "bravenewcoin.com", "site": "bravenewcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Privacy 3.0: Encryption tools for the decentralized web | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Privacy 3.0: Encryption tools for the decentralized web | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.804, "main_image": "http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/FillWyI0MDAiLCI0MDAiXQ/security-cover-bnc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "90d41c824fb7300a93691aeb3c66debdbc93c052", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT5lnHuyWCVlUuBftlW3SCmj4EW9k99vLrNf5eo8CH_ER36JkMVZf3U39p7HpE.vk7pD1B_fyIusalyRjC3pj8NNcyoviBLLuzPOWbc_p_OBA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Privacy 3.0: Encryption tools for the decentralized web | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "Inside Fintech • Nov. 29-30, 2018 Inside Fintech Conference & Expo explores Fintech 3.0, including Blockchain technology and other decentralized solutions for financial processes, and its impact on the global financial ecosystem.

CoinDesk Releases 'Bitcoin Pizza Day' Price Tool - CoinDesk", "text": "He Paid How Much? CoinDesk Releases 'Bitcoin Pizza Day' Price Tool ANNOUNCEMENT Stan Higgins May 22, 2018 at 12:00 UTC\nEight years ago today, the first reported exchange of bitcoin for a consumer product - a pair of Papa John's pizzas - took place.\nAt a total cost of 10,000 bitcoins, it was a milestone for the adoption of cryptocurrency and one that has since been commemorated though the celebration of May 22 as \"Bitcoin Pizza Day.\"\nYet even the most cursory observation of Bitcoin Pizza Day isn't complete without a calculation of precisely how much, in dollar terms, those two pizzas cost. With that, CoinDesk is today releasing a new widget that provides a real-time calculation that you can add to any website .\nAs of press time, that's about $83.7 million for the two pies, or just shy of $42 million apiece.\nBut why does this matter? To understand, one needs to wind back the clock to 2010.\nIn mid-May of that year, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz sought to exchange some of his hard-earned bitcoins for pizza - several days later, he was able to do so with the aid of a fellow user of the Bitcoin Talk online forum, then a central hub for discussion around cryptocurrency.\nA deal was struck: 10,000 BTC for two Papa John's pizzas. That eye-watering amount was worth a mere $25 at the time, or a fraction of a penny apiece.\nYet at the time, it wasn't so much the number of bitcoins spent or the product involved - the event was a milestone simply because the transaction had taken place. Though limited to 16 slices of pizza, the era of bitcoin-powered commerce had begun - not to mention the silent wincing over spending millions of dollars for two pizzas.\n\"It wasn't like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\" Hanyecz said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times , adding:\n\"No one knew it was going to get so big.\"\nStill, the tradition lives on, with the purchase being used to track other notable bitcoin milestones.\nIndeed, it was Hanyecz himself who would later participate in what might one day be known as \"Lightning Pizza Day\" after he used the next-generation technology, now in development, to purchase a pie in February .\nPizza image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

In January, at its peak, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market nearly reached a trillion dollars as blockchain projects still in their infancy and testnets such as Tron and EOS surpassed $17 billion.\nSince then, the price of most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Ripple have more than halved. Naturally, as the valuation of the cryptocurrency market fell by large margins, an increasing number of investors have started to lose interest in the market and confidence in the short-term rally of both major and emerging cryptocurrencies. But, regardless of the massive correction, big investors are still extremely optimistic and bullish. Many analysts expect that the bitcoin price will experience long-term growth as Wall Street investors grow more comfortable with the asset class.\nEarlier this month, CNBC Fast Money contributor and BKCM founder Brian Kelly emphasized that he was shocked the market did not react to the entrance of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and JPMorgan into the cryptocurrency market. If the two major institutions had entered the market in January, when the cryptocurrency market was at an all-time high, it likely would have pushed the cryptocurrency market beyond the $1 trillion mark.\nMore institutional investors, retail traders, financial institutions, banks, stock markets, and governments are involved in the cryptocurrency sector than ever and the market is nearly at a yearly low. While most individual investors and newcomers see a sell-off period in a highly volatile time frame like this, large-scale investors see an accumulation period and an opportunity.\nErik Voorhees, the CEO at ShapeShift, stated:\n“I’m all for financial companies getting involved in crypto. Crypto as a monetary unit is transparent and legitimate because it’s market-based, as opposed to what they do now, which is handling fiat, which is not transparent and not market-based.”\nAccording to Salzman, Voorhees emphasized that it is inevitable cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether will replace fiat currencies like the US dollar in the future. Voorhees also noted that he does not believe financial companies will attempt to sidetrack the effort as ultimately, businesses chase money. “That’s the point. t’s pulling them in,” Voorhees added. Future\nIn the short-term, the bitcoin price could dip below the $8,000 mark, potentially into the lower end of $7,000. It also could demonstrate a sudden increase in momentum and bounce back to the $9,000 region and eventually to $10,000.\nNo investor or analyst could predict where the price of bitcoin goes in the short-term with absolute certainty. But, big investors are convinced cryptocurrencies are here to stay and will compete with traditional currencies and assets such as the US dollar and gold, and that is what really matters.\nImages from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avi salzman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "barron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:50:17.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21eaf3cf27a72573bbd973f5f8d34e56bcb6c79b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYr8ndUg8MeJ0qojbQBxPlqYobXMP8sVrY3zEZ8uaZ26Of932tp.9hgd4bUoK0.aiRk6R.EdGHQ0pjJbydt2g2tIPBX386CWs56Q1jlaJz7A--", "site_full": "cryptocurrencynews.com", "site": "cryptocurrencynews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Joe Davis | Vanguard Economist, Predicts Bitcoin Price Will Crash to Zero", "title_full": "Joe Davis | Vanguard Economist, Predicts Bitcoin Price Will Crash to Zero", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "https://cryptocurrencynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/Why-Does-Vanguard-Economist-Predict-Bitcoin-Price.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21eaf3cf27a72573bbd973f5f8d34e56bcb6c79b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYr8ndUg8MeJ0qojbQBxPlqYobXMP8sVrY3zEZ8uaZ26Of932tp.9hgd4bUoK0.aiRk6R.EdGHQ0pjJbydt2g2tIPBX386CWs56Q1jlaJz7A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Siraj Sarwar", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Joe Davis | Vanguard Economist, Predicts Bitcoin Price Will Crash to Zero", "text": "Ad Joe Davis; Vanguard Economist, Predicts Bitcoin Price Will Crash to Zero\nJoe Davis; Vanguard economist believes that Bitcoin price (BTC) will crash to zero, and it will never emerge as reliable currency.\nBitcoin price remains range-bound after falling 15% from three months high of $9,900 level. The bearish trend has been receiving support from influential icons. The debate over the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is also contributing to the sell-off.\nBitcoin price trades around the $8,300 level today. Altcoins are in the red after a short rally at the beginning of the week. The total cryptocurrency market hovers in the range of $380 billion, down from $465 billion it hit a few days ago.\nJoe Davis, the chief economist for $5.1 trillion asset management firm Vanguard, thinks cryptocurrencies aren’t the alternative of fiat currency. His stance is similar to PayPal CFO and Warren Buffet – who already has rejected the possibility of using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange. Why Does Joe Davis Predict that Bitcoin will Crash to Zero?\nThe economist of the $5.1 trillion asset management firm warned investors that Bitcoin price is likely to crash to zero. He suggested investors keep their focus towards “ tried and true asset classes”. He believes that allocating even a small portion of the investment portfolio to cryptocurrencies could turn out to be a big mistake.\nHe said , “ The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them . “\nThe economist further argued that cryptocurrencies could be used as a medium of exchange, but they don’t have a store of value. Market Reaction was Strong Against Joe Davis’ Argument\nAlthough the majority of market participants believe the higher level of volatility in cryptocurrency prices makes it harder for the global community to use it as a medium of exchange, they think the market needs some time and more regulation clarity for complete stabilization.\nTwitter users reacted strongly against Joe Davis arguments. Cryptocurrency followers are comparing Bitcoin and other virtual currencies with the early age of internet and the Dow Jones.

When EOS moves up, the rest of the markets have followed on, indeed, this was the case through April and the start of May. Likewise, when EOS moves down, a similar reaction occurs.\nOf course, they may be speculation based, however, as things look at the moment, with EOS making pace downwards and Bitcoin Cash following, are we about to enter a steeper decline, before we see things level out?\nIs this steeper decline, going to be the start of the next bull run, as we saw in the middle of April?

Its chief economist made the argument that the value of bitcoin could go to zero.\nJoseph Davis, the global chief economist and global head of Vanguard Investment Strategy Group, wrote in answer to the question “What do you think about bitcoin?”:\nI’m enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible. In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.\nIt is a stunning criticism of the largest cryptocurrency based on market value. Davis’s primary reason is that central banks could begin to regulate bitcoin and the trading methods that make its existence possible.\nDavis also argued that the value of bitcoin is not based on any real-world factors:\nThe investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use.

But to a handful of small lenders, they are a moneymaker.\nTake Silvergate Bank, a three-branch lender that until recently focused mostly on local businesses in the San Diego area. Last year, its assets nearly doubled to $1.9 billion from $978 million, largely because of business flowing in from crypto-related companies.\nBig banks’ decision to largely shun the crypto world has left an opening for smaller lenders such as Silvergate,\nMetropolitan Bank Holding Corp.\nin New York and Cross River Bank in Fort Lee, N.J. In part their decision reflects an environment where community banks often struggle to differentiate themselves, given larger firms often can offer consumers and businesses largely unmatchable conveniences with their geographic reach and deployment of mobile and other technology.\nThese banks are taking a calculated risk to embrace an untested new market that is associated with a variety of hazards, itself a striking stance in the staid world of banking. Virtual currencies remain unpredictable, defined by wild price swings, increasing regulatory scrutiny and a relative lack of transparency that banks in a postcrisis world tend to shun.\n“They’re taking on a risk, and going against the inherent view (of crypto) that ‘It’s all evil over there, don’t touch that stuff,’” said\nBrian Stoeckert,\na partner at consulting firm Stratis Advisory, which specializes in crypto businesses. “But then there’s also a view of, ‘OK, well, they’ve got to get banked somewhere.’”\nSo far, the Main Street banks have landed customers that are well-known in the crypto world, including the exchanges Coinbase, BitFlyer and Kraken, which allow users to buy and sell digital currency.\nMany Wall Street banks, meanwhile, are resisting the idea of trading crypto. Others have restricted customers from using credit cards to buy digital currency. Bitcoin has dropped by more than half since its December record high.\n“Banking in this ecosystem,” said Silvergate Chief Executive\nAlan Lane,\n“is not for the faint of heart.”\nMr. Lane, 56 years old, said he became interested in cryptocurrencies several years ago, after reading some predictions about how they would replace the need for banks. Along the way, he learned about crypto exchanges and related companies that, despite a proposition that is largely anti-bank, still need bankers. Silvergate, which is privately held, said it now banks about 250 crypto companies.\nMr. Lane said he isn’t conflicted about being a banker to crypto businesses. “At what point as a banker do you pull your head out of the sand?” he said. “Every banker should be learning about the technology.”\nThe business can take several forms. Exchanges that let customers buy and sell virtual currency need a place to store their customers’ money and a way for them to convert crypto to dollars. Other crypto companies call banks for help with normal expenses like rent and payroll.\nSilvergate says it has also lured hedge funds, family offices and other institutional investors that want to invest in crypto but can’t get their primary bank, such as\nBank of America ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin - top", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metropolitan bank holding corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silvergate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silvergate bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cross river bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.j", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T21:31:22.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "210cf278744b90457def15271df0ea10d4c47b67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJjaYQvi_vaD990tr6GeJbsZGGm.EFqByxA2za.wlvYp1VFeigD0ky_rRTThTe78MKqaxEDFwQ2SBVfFtQPleF.R635WKhllFDtbhin8HechLewFZZslSj", "site_full": "coinsnews.com", "site": "coinsnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 4 of 4", "title_full": "How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 4 of 4", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "210cf278744b90457def15271df0ea10d4c47b67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJjaYQvi_vaD990tr6GeJbsZGGm.EFqByxA2za.wlvYp1VFeigD0ky_rRTThTe78MKqaxEDFwQ2SBVfFtQPleF.R635WKhllFDtbhin8HechLewFZZslSj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Https", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 4 of 4", "text": "Subscribe\nWe dont spam our loyal customers , you can unsubscribe anytime Latest Cryptocurrency News Today!

According to Nchain, the deal was facilitated through the company’s investment arm Nchain Reaction. News.Bitcoin.com reported on Handcash this past February when the team launched its bitcoin cash beta client for Android phones. The Handcash app allows users to transact with BCH using NFC technology and the platform was created by two developers from Spain, Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane.\n“Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash — So we wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash,” Alejandro Agut expla i ned during the announcement.\nThat gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender’s mobile device close to the recipient’s device. The Nakasendo SDK\nEarlier this month, the Handcash development team also revealed they were allowed to use the Nchain software development kit (SDK) Nakasendo before it was publicly released. News.Bitcoin.com spoke directly with Agut about how the new partnership with Nchain what the BCH community expect from Handcash going forward.\n“It certainly opens up new collaborations with other apps and services from the Nchain family right away, so we can put our protocols there and vice versa,” Agut details. “We are already working with a “Magic Protocol” that will be able to connect your Handcash wallet to third-party services — It uses the Nakasendo SDK — Also, we are going to be first in line to test upcoming SDKs for a few new features we want to adopt in the future.”\nIt has been very easy to work with them. And in the end it’s all about human connections — and they do a great job with managing with all dev teams and projects. User Interfaces Need to Become Better and Easier\nNchain says that the application Handcash make it easier to send BCH in a contactless fashion without any of the processes of copying an address or scanning a QR code.\n“For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use — We are impressed with Handcash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach,” Nchain Group’s CEO Jimmy Nguyen stated during the acquisition.\nNchain is thrilled to support Handcash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nOver the years there have been a couple attempts of NFC cryptocurrency wallets but nothing has really gained traction. There’s been a long wait for a cryptocurrency platform that delivers smooth and effortless cryptocurrency transactions combined with NFC technology, and BCH proponents hope this partnership delivers on its promises.\nWhat do you think about Nchain acquiring a large stake in Handcash?

Picture taken May 17, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip More By Alun John and Jennifer Hughes HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers. Why, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date? Canaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin. “Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public. The offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment. The Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand. But the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed. Businesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along. Alvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. \"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district. The change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242] Bitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400. PROMISED LAND To some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment. \"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm. Canaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock. However, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens. Fast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain. Cryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval. Visiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports. MARKET TEST Bitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal. Although the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion. Story Continues A lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software. Last year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain. \"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold. HIVE, with a market capitalization of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favored for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power. \"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager. Other companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. \"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list. People involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months. While soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal. In Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.

The RBZ further stated that domestic digital currency operations had sixty days to become compliant. Local reports now reveal the Zimbabwe-based cryptocurrency exchange Golix plans to take the central bank to court for banning digital assets, as the firm emphasizes that the RBZ has no authority to ban cryptocurrencies across the country.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 4 of 4 Reserve Bank Of Zimbabwe Faces Legal Backlash\nLast week cryptocurrency enthusiasts and businesses in Zimbabwe got some bad news as the central bank decided to ban all digital currency activities . The RBZ warned about the ‘risks’ involved with cryptocurrencies and told financial institutions not to deal with digital asset businesses. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe released a circular which effectively banned cryptocurrencies this month.\nThe ban would affect Localbitcoins trades within the region alongside the country’s three exchanges Golix , Bitfinance, and Styx24. News.Bitcoin.com spoke with Golix representative Tawanda Kembo last month when the exchange installed a Bitcoin ATM. Our newsdesk also received an email from the Golix exchange shortly after the ban.\n“On Friday, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe issued a statement to all banks instructing them to stop providing bank accounts to cryptocurrency companies within the next sixty days,” the Golix exchange explains.\nThis means that unless the central bank changes its position prior to the expiry of the sixty-day window, you will not be able to send or receive fiat currencies for cryptocurrency trades. According to the regional publication Zimeye.net, Golix is taking the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to the High Courts. Golix Files a Lawsuit Against the RBZ with the High Court\nShortly after the email, the regional publication Zimeye.net reported that Golix was now planning to “slap a lawsuit” against the RBZ for issuing a countrywide cryptocurrency ban. Golix says they are taking the central bank to the High Court and state that the RBZ governor has no experience with managing a local currency giving him no right to ban it. The exchange argues that the central bank has no authority to ban digital currencies and only parliament has the means to make such laws.\n”I submit that the ban in effect outlaws and classifies as illegal Applicant’s operations,” a Golix official said to the Zimeye publication.\nThe respondents are in fact purporting to classify the trade in cryptocurrency as illegal. That will amount to law making, a function that belongs to the legislature and not the respondents. Respondents are thus clandestinely usurping Parliament’s law making powers. Golix Has Yet to Receive Instructions From Their Bank — Continues Business as Usual\nNews.Bitcoin.com reached out to Golix for further information on this lawsuit but has yet to hear back from the exchange. According to other reports, even though the RBZ has issued a ban in its circular to banking institutions concerning virtual currencies, Golix is still organizing an initial coin offering (ICO) . “Thus far we are yet to receive instructions from our bank as to what will happen, if at all anything. Once we do, we will update,” an official from the Golix exchange detailed.\nWhat do you think about the Golix exchange slapping a lawsuit against the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe?

This is especially true when it comes to exchanges and trading platforms which share client information with the government. After the recent Coinbase-IRS debacle, it now seems Bitfinex is handing over a lot of customer information to the authorities as well. Bitfinex Stirs the pot While there are good reasons for a cryptocurrency exchange to be in active talks with a government, developments like these usually cause some negative backlash. In the case of Bitfinex , it seems the company is actively cooperating with the government of the British Virgin Islands. This move is the direct result of allegations that cryptocurrency had been used for tax evasion purposes, among other nefarious activities.\nIn a way, this is a commendable course of action by the Bitfinex exchange. Criminals who obtain cryptocurrency in any shape or form will often rely on exchanges to convert their balances to fiat currencies. However, exchanges perform thorough KYC and AML checks, which makes them far less appealing for criminals.\nEven so, users of the Bitfinex exchange may not be all that transparent about why they use this particular trading platform. It appears that tax evasion is a very big concern for the exchange right now, which is why working with the British Virgin Islands government simply makes sense. Customers of the exchange have already received a request for their tax information.\nThe company explained its decision as follows:\nUnder the laws of the British Virgin Islands (which are applicable to entities organized in the British Virgin Islands, including us), we are required to report certain account information to the [British Virgin Islands] government. The government of the [British Virgin Islands] may then exchange that information with the tax authorities of the customer’s country of residence.\nWhile some people may oppose this decision by Bitfinex, the company is taking this action for the right reasons. Protecting cryptocurrency users at all times is the number one priority for every exchange and trading platform in the world. This also means thwarting any tax evasion effort taking place through these centralized trading platforms. It will not be easy to do so, but cooperating with the local authorities can make big things happen fairly quickly.\nIn the long run, developments like these will make a positive impact on the cryptocurrency industry. Bringing more legitimacy to Bitcoin and altcoins is an ongoing struggle, yet the situation is fast improving. The latest effort by Bitfinex will help legitimize this industry even further, even though the company may lose a few trades in the process.

In an interview with the newspaper in 2013 , Hanyecz didn’t sound too broken up about the deal.\n“It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz said.\nStill, those coins would be worth $US82 million at bitcoin’s Tuesday price of $US8,200 a coin, according to Markets Insider data . There’s a Twitter account that provides a daily update on how much the pizzas would have cost based on the latest price of bitcoin. Twitter/@bitcoin_pizza\nBitcoin gained worldwide attention at the end of last year as it soared close to $US20,000 a coin and infiltrated trading and investment firms across Wall Street. But its origins trace back to 2008 and an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, whose vision was to create a rival financial system based on a technology called blockchain.\nStill, many merchants are wary of accepting bitcoin because of its spine-tingling volatility. Last year, Morgan Stanley described the lack of places to buy goods with bitcoin.\n“The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is striking,” the analysts wrote .\nThat hasn’t kept Wall Street away. Several top trading firms are active in crypto markets, including DRW and Virtu Financial. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch a bitcoin-trading operation , and Morgan Stanley has been looking to beef up its equity-research unit with crypto experts .

Today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief showcases how that promise is starting to materialize in different fields, including the future of elections and geopolitics. Iran and Russia Consider Bitcoin to Skirt Sanctions Iranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. Mohammad-Reza Pourebrahimi, who chairs the Iranian Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs, raised the idea during a recent meeting in Moscow with Dmitry Mezentsev, the Chair of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy. He explained that the Russians “share our opinion. We said that if we manage to move this work forward, then we will be the first countries that use digital currencies in the exchange of goods.”Iran’s government-owned media Press TV reports that the country’s leadership “specifically started to look at bitcoin as an alternative monetary means to be used in trade after it became clear that European companies were failing to trade with Iran over fears that they would fall afoul of US primary sanctions.” It should be noted that the Iranian government is trying to stop its citizens from having access to global markets it seeks for itself, banning banks from dealing with crypto and even traditional foreign currency exchange shops . Still, Iranian citizens have reportedly sent more than $2.5 billion out of the country to purchase cryptocurrencies with. US Politician Raises $100k From Crypto Community Congressional candidate Brian Forde has celebrated on Monday in San Francisco his campaign raising $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations. A former head of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative and Obama’s Senior Technology Advisor, he is considered to be a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile his main Democratic opponent, a former SEC enforcement attorney, has attacked Forde for his work in cryptocurrency, referring to his donors in an ad as “bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”This contested race is shaping up to be a major example of cryptocurrency impact on electoral politics in America. It is also nice to see that the matter is now getting bipartisan support in the US. As we recently reported, on the other side of the country and the opposite side of the aisle, a Trump-supporting Republican and a bitcoin enthusiast is running to be the next New York Attorney General . Liberation Through Radical Decentralization Vitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled “ Liberation Through Radical Decentralization .” In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work.They remind us that: “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in particular emerged directly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of the traditional financial system, with ‘The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks’ carved indelibly into Bitcoin’s genesis block. That said, the decentralized technologies behind cryptocurrencies have potential applications far beyond finance.” Real Products, Real Adoption With all the recent news about so many ICOs being outright scams or just failures, it’s good to remember that there are actual projects in the cryptocurrency space that are delivering real services to real users. Two recent examples are Brave and Steemit, coincidentally two different attempts to change how online content monetisation works.The Brave browser recently passed 5 million downloads for the Android operating system and now boasts over 2.3 million monthly active users and over 14,000 verified publishers. And recently the one millionth account was created on the Steem blockchain, which now sees around 60,000 unique accounts transacting each day, and over 250,000 unique daily visitors for the site.What do you think about today’s news updates and what they mean for the future?

All of the top currencies are in the deep red right now, with some of them suffering bigger setbacks compared to others. The Bitcoin Cash price, for example, has dropped below $1,200 once again, yet it remains to be seen how long this negative trend will remain in place. The Bitcoin Cash Price Decline\nWith all major cryptocurrencies on the decline, it is only normal Bitcoin and other altcoins will suffer from this pressure. In the case of BCH, the value has declined in the past few hours, and it seems the Bitcoin Cash price will face a big struggle to remain close to the $1,200 level first and foremost. So far, the value has dipped below $1,200 already, but it seems things may improve moving forward.\nOver the past seven days, the Bitcoin Cash price has dropped for over $1,400 all the way down to $1,150. Ever since that time, the value bounced back to nearly $1,300, but holding on to that momentum has proven to be far more difficult than speculators imagined at first. With the Bitcoin Cash price now dropping below $1,200, an interesting trend is forming, which may push the value down to $1,150 once again.\nDue to this 5.61% decline in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash is one of the bigger “losers” of the day so far. There is also a 3.13% decline in the BCH/BTC ration over the past 24 hours, which is only making things worse. Recovering value in either department will be pretty difficult for Bitcoin Cash, but nothing is impossible in the world of cryptocurrency.\nEven the Bitcoin Cash trading volume is on the decline over the past 24 hours. With the volume dropping to just over $602m, things are not looking all that great for BCH. Even so, the overall cryptocurrency trading volume has continued to decline as well, pushing the number down to under $16bn.Turning that situation around will not be easy, as this week is off to another rocky start.\nLooking over the exchanges ranked by trading volume, OKEx is still clearly in a dominant position. HitBTC is not far behind, and EXX takes the third spot. Lbank and OKEx’s BTC pair complete the top five. There are no fiat currency pairs in the top five for BCH right now, which could explain why the USD value is dropping at an accelerated pace.\nFor the time being, Bitcoin Cash speculators will have to contend with this ongoing bearish pressure. It is evident things will not necessarily improve later today, although stranger things have happened in the world of cryptocurrency. Until the Bitcoin price recovers in a significant manner, altcoins will continue to suffer. When that recovery process will take place, remains to be determined at this stage.

From Monday, the country began to regulate the digital currency and the initial placement of the tokens that are now administered by the Commission on securities and exchange Commission of Thailand (SEC).\nOn Monday enacted a decree about the legal regulation of cryptocurrency IPOs tokens (ICO) in Thailand. Cryptocurrency transactions are currently subject to income tax for private companies and individual investors, said the Nation Multimedia. Sarah Thongprasom (Saroch Thongpracum), Director of legal Affairs Tax management in the country, announced at a press conference on Tuesday:\n«The IRS will waive the value added tax for entities that trade crypto-currencies on the foreign exchange markets, approved by the Commission on securities and stock exchanges».\nHowever, Sarah stressed that «traders will still have to pay 15% tax on capital gains, also known as a tax on sources of income, or profit received as a result of trading».\nExemption from VAT for certain cryptocurrency traders aimed at «reducing their tax burden,» according to the publication. In addition, the IRS «will issue a resolution on refusal from 7% VAT for individual investors.» The article also States:\n«Under the new law, the private company that runs the ICO must pay corporate income tax on the money they collected in the framework of the campaign».\nAccording to the decree, the Thai SEC is the primary regulator of digital assets. Under the regulation fall within three groups of cryptooperation: brokers, dealers and ICO platforms. By words a press-the Secretary of the Department, these companies must obtain a license from the Ministry of Finance.\nThe SEC Chairman said that the Commission plans to publish the full rules for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and the ICO by the end of June after public hearings. «Public hearings will take 2-3 weeks because of investments in digital tokens are complex and involve greater risks», — said the Chairman of the SEC, RAPI Sucharitakul (Rapee Sucharitakul) in an interview with the Bangkok Post. Up to this point the country has banned the holding of ICO.\nIn addition, the RAPI said:\n«The new regulation aims to protect ordinary investors because only investors with knowledge about the release of ICO or transactions with the company’s digital assets, should have the opportunity to participate in such trade.»\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Thailand said he would wait for more information from the SEC before taking any action, said in an interview with the assistant President of the Bank of Canteven Sucharitakul (Chantavarn Sucharitakul). Previously, the Central Bank asked financial institutions in the country to refrain from cryptocurrency transactions.\nThai authorities have already not the first month studying the cryptocurrency industry. In January of this year, the government allowed futures trading for bitcoin. Despite this, the Commission on securities and stock exchanges of Thailand continues to warn investors about the high risks in this area and urged caution.

Spending 10,000 BTC eight years ago turned into one of the strongest memes of the cryptocurrency world.\nhttps://twitter.com/bitcoin_pizza/status/998748808514334721\nThe annual celebration caught the markets in the red, as Bitcoin again slumped, unable to hold above $9,000, or tough $10,000 again.\nOver the years, Bitcoin has gone through peaks and troughs, always with a changing risk profile, but always surviving. On Pizza Day, “the honeybadger of money” is facing varying pressures.\nBTC fell by 2.13% overnight to $8,339.16, down around 4.7% this week. The share of BTC trading has been hovering around 30% in the past weeks, as altcoins take the lead. The share of Japanese Yen trading exploded to more than 53% after falling toward 14% for unknown reasons, based on statistics by Cryptocompare.\nBTC trading volumes also dwindled to around $5 billion, a level not seen in weeks. What began as a bull market in April is having regular setups, with a shakedown in prices happening almost weekly. For now, BTC has drifted, not fulfilling expectations of falling to $5,000, but not rising again to peak prices.\nBut the Pizza Day this year takes the news in stride, as exchanges and crypto-related companies use the event to their marketing advantage. Ledger has a limited edition hardware wallet out to commemorate the pizza purchase:\nhttps://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/998824558546341889\nHowever, the value of the pizzas is only often denominated in dollar terms. Yet 10,000 BTC could do much more work, even without being sold for fiat.\nThe amount could fuel between two and four ICO projects - in fact, this is one of the ways BTC whales increase their wealth, by buying into ICOs and sometimes selling again back to BTC.\nIn perspective, 10,000 BTC could sway a small exchange or cause a pump - but it is a small fraction of daily trading, which even at subdued volumes is around 600,000 BTC in 24 hours. × Stay up to date with market trends and exclusive crypto news!

It holds a tremendous amount of value being the first cryptocurrency and has global recognition and established adoption . The cryptography makes the currency secure and impenetrable. You are more likely to get struck by lightning twice than someone getting access to your wallet. The ease of transferability provides liquidity and seamless access to funds wherever you are around the globe. The value of the asset is more than likely to only increase due to there being a scarce, or fixated supply.\nBitcoin has been around since 2009 and since, 17 million of these coins have been mined through the use of heavy-duty computing to solve algorithmic hashes, which is a fancy way of saying using computers to guess as many possible outcomes to solve for the correct answer.\nThe miners, or people using these computers to solve these advanced mathematical based equations get compensated for securing the network through validating transactions and preventing breaches of security within the network. Its’ now estimated the Bitcoin network takes up 1% of the entire global population energy consumption. That’s huge!\nContinuous adoption across merchants, financial institutions, and the general public have allowed Bitcoin to hold a significant amount of value that’s uncorrelated to anything else, no other government issued currency or commodity is like Bitcoin , it’s a unique store of value and is accepted by millions of people.\nThe technology is rapidly improving. Not only are developers working on technological improvements that make the digital currency more simple and easy to use, but the entire ecosystem as a whole are building applications and a better means of making the cryptocurrency more adoptable and simple to understand.\nCoinJolt, for example, is working on an email based application where all you’ll need is a person’s email address to send or receive Bitcoin. Instead of having to copy and paste a 256 string of letters and numbers, you can simply tie in your wallet with your email address and verify transactions through a set unique password, SMS verification or through the use of Google Authenticator.\nThe fact that the digital currency is more secure than any other currency around the globe gives opportunities for investors to secure a position in an asset that’s poised to only increase in value multiple times over is something you don’t run across every day.\nClick here to invest in Bitcoin instantly with no fees.\nImages courtesy of CoinJolt\nThe content of this article was provided by the company referenced.

Well eight years ago an early Bitcoiner opted for the latter and on the anniversary of the now-legendary deal, heâs absolutely no regrets! An Expensive Slice of History?\nEight years ago, on this very day, history was made. As far as we know, for the first time ever, Bitcoin was traded for something outside of the realms of software developers. Sure, the worldâs most popular digital currency had previously been gifted to folks, or a coin or two swapped for lines of code on various cryptography forums, but the anniversary we celebrate today marks Bitcoin entering the real world â traded for something visible, something tangible, something delicious!\nWe are, of course, talking about Bitcoin Pizza Day. If youâre not familiar with the story, Iâll recap. Back in 2010, early cryptocurrency miner Laszlo Hanyecz signed onto a forum and made what has since become a legendary post:\nâI’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzasâŚ Like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.â\nThe post continued, stating that the hungry cryptographer wasnât fussy about the origins of said slices â he would happily accept takeaway or homemade â the important clauses of the deal were a) the transaction had to happen in Bitcoin b) the food had to arrive at Hanyeczâs home, and c) he didnât want to have to order or prepare the food himself.\nIt was a few days later when Jeremy Sturdivant replied to the post. He agreed to accept the deal and proceeded to place an order from his London apartment across the Atlantic Ocean to arrive at Florida-based Hanyecz’s place. That was it. Bitcoin had just successfully proven itself as the permissionless, cross-border payment method it was intended to be.\nOf course, back in 2010 the 10,000 Bitcoin were worth a fraction of what they are today. In fact, according to the irreverent Twitter account ‘Bitcoin Pizza,’ the long-devoured disks of deliciousness were bought for over $83 million. The #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day!\n— Bitcoin Pizza\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nHanyecz isn’t phased by the vast appreciation of his payment, however. For him, mining was a hobby and he did get free pizza after all. The now 36-year-old told the U.K.’s Telegraph :\n“I donât think it was a mistake. Itâs like if you could go back in time and buy Google stocks when they were $1 or something…Â At the time it wasnât worth much and I feel like if I hadnât done it, someone else would have. I wouldnât have spent $100m on pizza, right? But if I hadnât done that, maybe it wouldnât have become popular.”\nIn fact, Hanyecz enjoyed his entry into the Bitcoin history books so much that he repeated his order Â this year. This time, he used the Lightning Network to order his munchies – again two pizzas. He personally feels that the software upgrade is what’s missing from Bitcoin becoming a truly global payment network rather than a speculative investment that people are hoping will make them rich.\nEven though people love to make a big deal about the supposed value of the legendary Bitcoin pizzas being in the tens of millions today, it’s not likeÂ Sturdivant ended up retiring in his twenties thanks to the deal. He was able to trade the coins in for a significant (although certainly not life-changing) profit to take a trip to the U.S. with his girlfriend. Eight years on from the purchase,Â Sturdivant still sees the necessity of a commodity like Bitcoin though:\n“I believe the overall power of cryptocurrency is for goodâŚ empowering individuals and companies alike to handle local and international trade in a fair and traceable manner, and that’s exactly what I see it bringing to the future, as a component in an era of economic freedom.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

File Photo: Bitcoins May 22, 2018, 12:22 PM IST Source: Reuters Trending News Monalisa`s dance moves in new song will drive away your Monday blues - Watch\nHong Kong: Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world`s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world`s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company`s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin`s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin`s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong`s central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren`t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto `picks and shovels`, and that`s what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation <2330> (TSMC), the world`s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator`s apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan`s deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain .\n\"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalisation of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favoured for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n\"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE`s second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan`s smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n\"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic`s Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan`s IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan`s IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan`s industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.

If this continues to keep gains in check, bitcoin could still resume the selloff to the support areas marked. Using the Fib extension tool shows the potential downside targets in the short-term.\nBitcoin price might still resume its downtrend as the top of its descending channel is keeping gains in check.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse.\nHowever, an upward crossover appears to be materializing and if so, bitcoin price might still be able to break past the channel top. In particular, a move past the swing high around $8,600 could confirm that buyers have the upper hand.\nRSI is dipping into oversold territory to show that sellers are exhausted and may let buyers take over. Stochastic still seems to have some room to fall, so bitcoin price might follow suit.\nThe nearest support area is at the 38.2% extension or $8,039 level at the mid-channel area of interest. The 50% extension is at $7,855 and the 61.8% extension is at the swing low or $7,671. Stronger selling pressure could take it down to the 78.6% extension at $7,410 or the channel support. The full extension is located at $7,077.4. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nA rebound in risk-taking paved the way for some bitcoin price gains after a trade truce between the US and China was announced. This supported commodities, equities, and other riskier assets like cryptocurrencies versus the dollar.\nThe main event for the US dollar is the release of the FOMC minutes this week as this could clarify tightening expectations. Hawkish remarks could mean more dollar gains versus bitcoin while cautious ones could allow the cryptocurrency to advance.\nThere have been no major headlines pertaining to bitcoin, so investors could keep holding out and staying cautious while waiting for more developments.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency networks are bound to surpass the majority of the failed attempts to popularize its value-added benefits, leading to global adoption.\nA very popular video game called ‘The Simpsons: Tapped Out’ are inculcating crypto references into their game’s website. The Tapped Out game version of Simpsons have their own version of ‘Springfield’ where Homer Simpson has to bring back his town members and re-built the city. The game is available in six languages including French, Turkish, Italian, making it more globally recognizable.\nThe game has had several purchasers as for its players and thus has earned more than $100 million. There’s a point in the game where Martin refers to Bitcoin mining as a part of the story’s plotline. He casually brags about mining “some Bitcoin” through his computer, to which is next statement goes like “and then the value went through the roof,” so once the player completes the task he asks more users to join in together to mine Bitcoin.\nBoth players and crypto-space enthusiasts are excited about this first-ever portrayal of any cryptocurrency in the world of Cartoons and graphic.\nIn other news, Bitcoin has successfully made references in popular Netflix shows like Supernatural, House of Cards and even The Big Bang Theory! The episode 9 from season 11’s Big Bang Theory, that was aired last year in November follows up with Sheldon announcing that he had mined some Bitcoin almost seven years ago with using Howard’s old laptop, to which he adds that its worth has increased more than expected it to. Stuart then agrees to be supportive of him as he remembers doing the same. A scene from Big Bang Theory\nIn a flashback included in the plotline of episode 9, Sheldon asks Stuart if he ‘accepts the new virtual coinage Bitcoin’, to which he explains how one needs to solve “complex mathematical problems” to earn them. Raj later realizes that Sheldon had warned them that ‘someday they would regret it’.\nAs far as the show ‘Simpsons’ goes, it has mentioned Bitcoin more than once. Even back in 1997, the Simpson’s had a mention of a ‘Place for codes’ or a ‘Crypto Barn’. Marvel comics have had their share of crypto-mention with its ‘Hunt for Wolverine- Adamantium Agenda 1’, where they consider Bitcoin as a universal delivery body that is used for delivering power and are often used by robots.

Argument 1: No Viable Use Case\nThe core argument Davis offered on his ETF.com opinion piece to support his theory that the price of bitcoin drops to zero in the long-term is the lack of a viable use case of bitcoin. Davis resorted to the conventional “blockchain not bitcoin” argument, claiming that the most dominant cryptocurrency has no use case.\n“I’m enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible. In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero,” said Davis.\nBitcoin has many use cases. Xapo, the Swiss-based cryptocurrency wallet and vault service provider, stores more than $10 billion worth of bitcoin in its cold wallets managed offline in safe Swiss vaults. According to Bloomberg, more customers have stored bitcoin in Xapo’s vault than 5,670 banks in the US.\nThe primary use case of bitcoin, due to its fungibility, transportability, security, and decentralized nature, is an efficient store of value. It protects and stores wealth better than traditional assets and stores of value, such as gold.\nHence, the claim of Davis that bitcoin does not have a use case is evidently invalid, given that it is already being used as a store of value and has been used as a digital currency since its launch in 2009. Argument 2: No Cash Flows and no Fundamental Value\nMajor cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols like Ethereum are worth many billions of dollars. However, Davis claimed that unlike stocks and bonds, blockchain protocols do not issue interest payments or dividends for investors and as such, their value cannot be justified. He added that the underlying economic activity of countries can justify traditional assets like fiat currency. Davis said:\n“The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use.”\nThe basis of the argument of Davis uses an assumption that every economy and government around the world can remain strong and solid. But, such an assumption is simply not realistic. Venezuela is a prime example of an economy that has turned into turmoil due to government corruption.\nWhen the national currency of a country falls, there exists no other alternative except decentralized financial networks and autonomous systems. As the Venezuelan bolivar, the country’s national currency, lost all of its value because of hyperinflation, local residents and citizens turned towards bitcoin as the only form of sound money available to the country’s people.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim buckley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trillion vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "va", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:40:26.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e2d34631593fba9e9f3d0e06ef9f3ec8eb5b01a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeOZ7NgPmFyi1Ef7gRv2h8z8XPJpTjQmo9uBxNUhwZzm6RMoJw7ffgk-", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=a&start=82&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "[twitter 검색 May-22, 17시] bitcoin", "title_full": "[twitter 검색 May-22, 17시] bitcoin : 네이버 블로그", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://blogimgs.naver.net/nblog/mylog/post/og_default_image_160610.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e2d34631593fba9e9f3d0e06ef9f3ec8eb5b01a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeOZ7NgPmFyi1Ef7gRv2h8z8XPJpTjQmo9uBxNUhwZzm6RMoJw7ffgk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NORAZO", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "[twitter 검색 May-22, 17시] bitcoin", "text": "가상화폐 [twitter 검색 May-22, 17시] bitcoin 2018. 5. 22. 17:57 머신 러닝을 통한 분석 Google Blogger(개발중)\n2018-05-22 08:57:19 kennbmondo Bitcoin_Mafia That's all it takes\n2018-05-22 08:57:19 Bitcoin Could Be a Problem for U.S. Security Clearances https://t.co/i1DWQW0yns https://t.co/RWFETrSnK0\n2018-05-22 08:57:18 BlaineFaceless Bitcoin_Mafia Yup\n2018-05-22 08:57:18 Cryptomocro1 Bitcoin_Mafia Yes\n2018-05-22 08:57:18 Bitcoin a Shadowy New Realm as US Weighs Security Clearances https://t.co/kMkSJs1QqQ 📈 Exchange the World via https://t.co/rlzM1RPyMa\n2018-05-22 08:57:17 How to Install Gekko on Windows – A FREE Bitcoin Trading Bot Updated May 21, #2018 https://t.co/URy4ze87FK https://t.co/SH9pa7pzak\n2018-05-22 08:57:17 RT officialmcafee: Bitcoin_Mafia By using our heads.

However, ask any bitcoin enthusiast, and he is sure to point you towards the story of Laszlo Hanyecz. The Multi-million Dollar Pizza\nOn May 18, 2010, Hanyecz, a Florida-based computer programmer, set out to prove the world that bitcoin can be used as a real transfer-of-value, and is not mere magic internet money.\nFor the task, Hanyecz posted on the Bitcointalk forum and offered 10,000 bitcoins, worth around $40 in May 2010, in exchange for two pizzas:\n“I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas. Maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.”\nWith the current price of bitcoin near $8,000, the amount paid for two pizzas now totals to more than $80 million. A 4-day Wait to Trade Bitcoin for Pizza\nWhile the post rapidly drew attention from bitcoin enthusiasts, developers, and forum members, several of the currency’s disbelievers considered the Bitcointalk entry as a bid to get a free meal, in turn of digital pennies which was unknown beyond a minuscule set of “cyberpunks.” Others pointed out that they might not be able to pay from outside the U.S. with their credit card. A slice of Bitcoin history . Source: Bitcointalk\nAt one point on May 21, Hanyecz wrote on the forum “So nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I’m offering too low?”\nHowever, Hanyecz proved the digital currency’s newfound role as a medium of exchange on May 22, 2010, with a comment stating that he had “successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins to acquire them,” along with a picture. The 10,000 bitcoin pizzas . Source: Heliacal Advertisement advertisement\nAt the time of writing, the two pizzas are valued at approximately $80 million, which proves the massive augmentation of bitcoin’s rise in value, stepping out of obscurity in 2009, to an emergent digital asset in 2018.\nThe transaction remains historic and is the earliest known example of using bitcoins to purchase an everyday sustenance. For these reasons, May 22 of each year is remembered as the “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” Hanyecz Reveals His Bitcoin Story\nSpeaking to The New York Times in 2013, when the pizzas were worth $6 million, Hanyecz said :\n“It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.”\nAt the time, bitcoin was not easily available on exchanges and had to be mined to be possessed. To this effect, the programmer made a custom-built mining rig that used his personal computing power to solve the Bitcoin network’s complex puzzles, in turn of receiving units of the cryptocurrency upon the successful mining of a block.\nFurthermore, Hanyecz does not lament over the purported lost wealth, instead of considering the transaction as a historical use-case which proved its capabilities as an obscure technology. However, he reveals that he bought a computer for $4,000, when the value of his bitcoins reached $1.\nThe computer programmer ardently follows the Bitcoin protocol, and was instrumental in replicating the experiment after the network’s Lightning upgrade, which introduced fast transactions speeds to an oft-criticized slow network.\nAs reported by BTCManager , Hanyecz paid 0.00649 bitcoin for two pizzas to test the Lightning Network on February 27, 2018, equivalent to $53 at the time. The bitcoin pioneer has not stopped there, he has also convinced his employer GoRuck to start accepting the cryptocurrency. Bitrefill Commemorates ‘Bitcoin Pizza Day’\nIn celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22, Bitrefill announced a surprise feature. Those based in the U.S. can now pay with bitcoin to buy a gift card for Italian restaurants Bertucci’s and Buca Di Beppo. Bitcoiners in the States can also use the online delivery service Menufy to order their own ‘Bitcoin Pizza.’\nCryptocurrency hardware wallet providers also offered promotions; Ledger announced a Ledger Nano S – Pizza Day edition while Trezor offered a ten percent sale on all of its products.

It does make me cringe a little bit though,” stated Jeremy Cagan, a bitcoin user.\n“It’s a really good excuse to get together and eat some pizza, but it’s also a really important moment in bitcoins history,” stated Rosenberg.\nBitcoin Pizza Day, while some may say it’s quirky, marks a huge step forward, opening the door for hundreds of thousands of other online sources to accept the currency.\n“The next step is we are going to start seeing applications and people’s lives change because of it,” stated an event attendee and bitcoin advocate. “It’s the future.”\nIn an interview with the New York Times, the man who bought those two pizzas eight years ago said he wasn’t upset by his decision because bitcoins didn’t have any value, so at the time, the idea of trading bitcoin for pizza was pretty cool.

Further enhancing the point that even with the lower values we are seeing today, since 2010, Bitcoin has made the most inspiring and fantastic progression.\nOkay, what is the point of all this?\nThis acts as a reminder of not only Bitcoin’s history, but also of Bitcoin’s potential to grow. In times like these when the markets seem to be sluggish, we must remember that eventually, things will flip round and that eventually Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin Pizzas will see some enhanced values soon enough.\nBitcoin Pizza is a novel cultural phenomenon that serves as a hot, and frankly cheesy reminder of where we are heading as a community.

According to Corcoran, the use of bitcoin in real estate is only going to become more common.Giving her reasons why, she said: “It’s peer-to-peer, with no central anything, and that’s why it’s so powerful. The main idea is to eliminate the middle guy.” Interestingly, she is of the opinion that banks won’t exist in the next 10 years, arguing that they won’t be ‘needed if bitcoin does what I believe it’s going to do.’The use of bitcoin to purchase real estate is certainly not a new thing. While it hasn’t become a major payment choice there are more homeowners who are willing to accept the digital currency for the sale of their homes. So much so, that a San Diego brokerage is betting that the real estate industry lies with cryptocurrency, in particular bitcoin.In a report from TechBullion earlier this month, Andrew Canter, the CEO and founder of Canter Companies, a financial and advisory investment firm located in San Diego, is hoping to tap into a demographic that has been underserved in the housing sector. As the adoption of bitcoin hasn’t been as widespread within the industry, those who own the cryptocurrency haven’t been able to use their coins in housing deals like they would want.Canter said: “We realized there is so much new wealth in the crypto space. There are a lot of new buyers and a lot of people that have seen their wealth fluctuate over the last year.” Notably, most of the houses up for sale that have the option of payment in cryptocurrency are worth a considerable amount. For instance, a client of Canter’s, who is selling a luxury property, has listed it at $7.8 million. Canter’s firm, however, is primarily targeting the crypto rich who have the money to spend.He explained by adding that: “Our job is to make sure our clients are aware of emerging technologies and trends. After carefully studying this industry, it’s clear there is an entire new class of wealthy individuals which are underserved and our mission will be to help bridge that gap between them and our real estate clients. This won’t be a one-time campaign. We’ll continue to research and implement different strategies to gain access.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

This is widely hailed as the first real-world transaction with Bitcoin, and May 22nd is celebrated annually as Bitcoin Pizza Day.\nLaszlo paid for the pizza with 10000 BTC, which was roughly worth around $25 around the time of the transaction. The current worth of 10000 BTC is close to $82 million.\nIn hindsight, Bitcoin’s astronomical growth is extremely visible. Even as the market is volatile, the value of the first cryptocurrency has exhibited growth of 327999900% since the transaction.\nThe transaction also signaled the growth of merchant adoption, as it was the first documented peer-to-peer transaction with an exchange of goods for Bitcoin.\nVarious companies also celebrated Bitcoin Pizza day, as seen with Ledger. Ledger released a limited edition Ledger Nano S today to commemorate pizza day. The wallet is thematically designed to reflect Pizza Day, with a red coloring instead of its normal black-and-steel look.\nThe product box is customized and signed by one of Ledger’s employees. The product has a limited run of 1337 units, in honor of the Internet culture that birthed Bitcoin and Bitcoin Pizza Day. They reached out to Laszlo himself to ask him for his opinion on the wallet. He said:\n“Bitcoin was just a fun hobby project for me 8 years ago. When I paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas I had no idea that Bitcoin would eventually become as popular as it is today, with people using it for real world transactions every day.”\nLedger also elaborates on how far Bitcoin has come from being a niche to dominating the mainstream. They also say:\n“…our most exciting and significant work may be ahead of us.”\nAnirudh VK is a full-time journalist at AMBCrypto.

Required fields are marked * Comment FODL on Bitcoin [BTC], HODL on Ethereum [ETH] & Bitcoin Cash [BCH]; Ripple [XRP] in the trash – Mr. Neu Ner stated\nPublished Sarah Rodrigues Source: Public Domain Pictures\nIn a recent interview with CNBC’s Fast Money, Ran Neu-Ner participated in their “HODL or FODL?” game on their channel where he was asked the outlook for several top-leading cryptocurrencies in the market. CNBC’s Fast Money tweet.\nWith regards to Bitcoin [BTC], Mr Neu-Ner stated that:\n“I like bitcoin a lot, but I’m going to FODL.”\nAlthough he believes that Bitcoin’s price will go up, it’s currently low and it’s a slow and stable process. He focused on the more exciting cryptocurrencies out in the market and he will put his money in something more exciting. However, he will HODL on to Bitcoin Cash. He thinks that there is a potential and since the team consists of old Bitcoin members, he prefers them.\nHe says:\n“I think there’s a lot of potential for Bitcoin Cash, I like the team, that are driving. it’s all the old bitcoin people. I love both Bitcoin Cash [BCH] and Bitcoin [BTC] equally, but if you ask me where I put my money right now, Bitcoin Cash has more potential.”\nMr. Neu-Ner also states:\n“there are more exciting cryptocurrencies out there, and if you’re going to ask me whether I’m going to put my money in bitcoin, or something more exciting, I’m going to go with something more exciting.”\nThe ICO frenzy has taken highlight in this current cryptocurrency market world, Mr. Neu-Ner believes that the institutions will go to Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] before anything which in turn leads the market to rise.\nHe says:\n“There’s this frenzy happening which is not on the markets, where hundreds of millions of dollars are going into ICOs, where’s that money coming from? It’s not coming from fiat, it’s people cashing in their bitcoin and their Ethereum, and when they cash in the markets are going to go down.”\nOn a different cryptocurrency, Ethereum [ETH], the Onchain Capital Founder says that will HODL as the community of Ethereum is big in the industry of cryptocurrency market. He is bullish on Bitcoin Cash [BCH] and Ethereum [ETH].\nMr Neu-Ner states:\n“Thousands of people, the smartest people in the room. They’ve got used cases and they’re solving their scaling issues. So I’m holding Ethereum.”\nWhen it comes to Ripple [XRP], Ran Neu-Ner is not quite certain on the token and how it works, although he states that the Ripple [XRP] company is the best he knows.\nHe concluded:\n“So as far as I know, I can’t find a use for the token, so I’m out. It’s centralized, and that defeats the whole purpose of the blockchain.”\nHe is the founder of Onchain Capital and the host of CNBC’s Africa’s ‘Crypto Trader’ show. In this interview, he discusses his views for the several top-leading cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offering [ICOs] and the outlook of the major cryptocurrencies on the trading list.

It won this award in no small part due to its bitcoin allocation, which ranged between 6% and 10%, according to FactSet. At one point, bitcoin topped the list of the fund’s holdings.\nIn December of 2017, Catherine Wood , Ark Investment Management, CEO, said that bitcoin was a bigger idea than Apple .\nARK’s fund could not directly own bitcoin, so it purchased shares in Grayscale Investment’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) in 2015, when bitcoin traded below $250.\nThe only ETF that matched ARKK’s access to bitcoin was another of the firm’s products: the ARK Web x.0 ETF, an internet-focused fund. Bitcoin Drove Returns ARK pared its exposure to bitcoin as the cryptocurrency’s value plunged from its December highs.\nThe funds’ bitcoin holdings drove the returns last year, as both funds gained more than 87% percent in 2017, while GBTC jumped 1,550%.\nHowever, Ark began paring its bitcoin exposure across both funds earlier this year, as the cryptocurrency market entered a bearish cycle. ARKK now holds 0.5% in bitcoin while ARKW holds 0.6%. The reason behind the pullback, according to the company, was tax and regulatory concerns.\nBitcoin’s performance most likely was a big driver as well. The cryptocurrency, based on GBTC indicators, began falling in value later in 2017 after soaring in 2016 and early 2017. GBTC, meanwhile, has fallen 37% so far in 2018, losing more than 63% in five months from its mid-December high.\nBoth Ark funds are up about 15% year to date.\nArk might have profited from bitcoin earlier in the year and pared its allocation as bitcoin’s price fell. If GBTC’s performance had spurred the change in direction, a bitcoin rebound could revive its allocations in the Ark funds.\nAlso read: Ark Investment CEO: bitcoin is bigger than Apple ETF Access to Bitcoin Still Limited\nThe liquidation of Ark’s bitcoin holdings makes it even more difficult for investors to gain exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency through traditional financial instruments.\nBitcoin ETFs, as CCN has reported , are waiting on the sidelines since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet approved any of these widely-anticipated investment vehicles.\nGBTC — which trades over-the-counter (OTC) — is the closest product to a bitcoin ETF. Unlike most companies that have applied for bitcoin ETFs, this fund holds bitcoin directly instead of through derivatives contracts. The fund’s value to investors has been up for debate since its shares almost always trade at a premium over bitcoin’s net asset value.\nImages from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin dro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catherine wood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "liquidates bitcoin holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "factset", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grayscale investment’s bitcoin investment trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ark investment management", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T04:27:32.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f109b4c9bc5a205ab524af3d22da24393ed58d78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vyXpiJ.83E.VHtbFo8xSxRqpTQxpgEweG8NWja.ASfQ8gydYEfJLzhPzJj0K6vN1Ib6wv6NJgXP2HMgt6lRMKdB9iLiKap574cJR2JYb1V1c7MrqVbnHe", "site_full": "www.btc-current.nl", "site": "btc-current.nl", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Price of Bitcoin Slides Below $8,100 Amid Consensus Woes - BTCCurrent", "title_full": "Price of Bitcoin Slides Below $8,100 Amid Consensus Woes - BTCCurrent", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f109b4c9bc5a205ab524af3d22da24393ed58d78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vyXpiJ.83E.VHtbFo8xSxRqpTQxpgEweG8NWja.ASfQ8gydYEfJLzhPzJj0K6vN1Ib6wv6NJgXP2HMgt6lRMKdB9iLiKap574cJR2JYb1V1c7MrqVbnHe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Price of Bitcoin Slides Below $8,100 Amid Consensus Woes - BTCCurrent", "text": "Price of Bitcoin Slides Below $8,100 Amid Consensus Woes By Donate Bitcoin Cash to admin Scan the QR code or copy the address below into your wallet to send bitcoin: Scan the QR code or copy the address below into your wallet to send some ZCash: Copy ZCash Address\nIf you look at the network hash rate it’s dropped proportionally as well: down to 25,955,157.85 TH/s and correlating to an intrinsic energy cost of $3,806 per coin ( https://www.trinsicoin.com )\nThat’s close to the low it had before the conference pumped up mining interest and speculation.

The company pulled all non-compliant atms offline, a total of nine out of the company’s more than 60 kiosks, and offered those operators an opportunity to upgrade their software.\nRobocoin users took to reddit early this morning to complain about the change in position. One robocoin ATM operator went so far as to suggest a boycott against robocoin and encouraged other operators to replace robocoin’s ATM software with a free open-source platform called rakía from competitor lamassu. Bitcoin exchange market share\nAnonymity is at the heart of bitcoin’s ethos. To make sure bitcoin is not doubly transacted, all transactions are published to a public ledger, unlike a bank, which tracks all transactions and personally identifiable customer information. In contrast bitcoin’s self-regulating network keeps user information anonymous, so the identity and location of the transactor cannot immediately be known.\nKYC laws directly oppose the self-regulating nature of bitcoin. They require that financial services know who their customers are and alert law enforcement officials if they see suspicious activity. In this way, bringing bitcoin under regulation at all may be near impossible — bitcoin transactions don’t require a third-party. Users who want to purchase illegal goods or launder money can do it easily without touching a bitcoin ATM or other regulated service. Bitcoin exchange market share\nAnd yet, in order for the bitcoin economy to meaningfully grow, bitcoin businesses will need to face off with existing financial regulations. “bitcoin was born out of a belief that freedom and privacy no longer exist in the financial sector,” says jaron lukasiewicz, CEO of bitcoin exchange coinsetter. Many in the bitcoin community feel strongly about maintaining the core values of the system.\nHowever, the bitcoin economy has grown and there is increasing investor interest in building it further — more than $72 million has been invested in the asset, according to coindesk. Not only that, but regulators are cracking down on bitcoin businesses it suspects of facilitating money laundering and other illegal activities — like the silk road 2.0.\nBut, lukasiewicz says, under bitcoin’s decentralized protocol, the currency can’t really be regulated. Bitcoin exchange market share therefore, certain businesses, in addition to trying to remain as fincen-compliant as possible, are trying to work with regulators to create laws that are more bitcoin-specific. “we are putting efforts into convincing regulatory agencies that there are better ways to regulate new financial technologies,” he says.\nOne of bitcoin’s other intentions is to provide people around the world who lack access to banking an easy way to store money and make transactions online. Robocoin CEO jordan kelley says that in order to grow his bitcoin banking network, he has to work with regulators — even if it upsets certain members of the community.\n“we love anonymity, but we also love the idea of getting millions of people bitcoin, and we can’t do that if machines are getting seized.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T23:56:10.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9fd6e0485f04ec1454998899a052456e0f822cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4UiNZTYOPX6PJiC6Kn.jRGyxgOMElLPbPnD59_Zv8uZqGJddcxAHJi2gu_V0I0rAi00jKQoTQKflI3zreGGS6iWX9Cz6TMDxiipqckkdpoh2ZSkFUXCUxgA--", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Coinbase: A bitcoin start-up spreading its bets on the crypto economy", "title_full": "Coinbase: A bitcoin start-up spreading its bets on the crypto economy", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/03/20/105076487-GettyImages-893595362.1910x1000.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 168, "comments": 0, "shares": 168}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9fd6e0485f04ec1454998899a052456e0f822cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4UiNZTYOPX6PJiC6Kn.jRGyxgOMElLPbPnD59_Zv8uZqGJddcxAHJi2gu_V0I0rAi00jKQoTQKflI3zreGGS6iWX9Cz6TMDxiipqckkdpoh2ZSkFUXCUxgA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Rooney", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coinbase: A bitcoin start-up spreading its bets on the crypto economy", "text": "As one of the biggest digital currency platforms, Coinbase was in the right place at the right time as the price of bitcoin skyrocketed in 2017, but the company has no intention of taking its crypto gains for granted. With $150 billion in assets traded across more than 20 million customers, and 2017 revenue reported at $1 billion, it's plowing money back into a master plan to stay ahead in a much larger cryptocurrency economy.\nWhile the San Francisco-based company is best known as the leading U.S. cryptocurrency trading platform, Coinbase — which landed at the No. 10 spot on the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 list — doesn't think of itself that way.\n\"We don't see ourselves as a crypto exchange,\" said Coinbase president and COO Asiff Hirji. \"We are very focused on the establishment of the crypto economy. We see ourselves as enabler of that future economy.\"\nMeet the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 companies In the past few months, Coinbase has poached key executives from LinkedIn, Twitter , Facebook and the New York Stock Exchange. Already this year, Coinbase has doubled the size of its full-time engineering team and overhauled much of the platform's code, which resulted in a 1,000 percent increase in its capacity. It expects \"to again double this capacity in coming months,\" according to a letter it released publicly in early May in response to pressure from the New York Attorney General's office.\nIn April, Coinbase bought Earn.com for a reported $100 million, which lets users send and receive digital currency for replying to mass-market emails and completing micro tasks. As part of the acquisition, the crypto company will bring on Earn's founder and CEO, a former Andreessen Horowitz venture capitalist, as its first-ever chief technology officer. Earn was originally backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.\nThere are few spokes in the cryptocurrency wheel that its early success as a bitcoin exchange hasn't allowed Coinbase to now chase. The company is reportedly much more bullish on its own value than VC funding estimates. Coinbase valued itself at about $8 billion when it set out to buy Earn.com, according to Recode , much higher than a valuation of $1.6 billion at its last round of venture capitalist financing in summer 2017.\nCoinbase Coinbase president and chief operating officer, Asiff Hirji (left), with Coinbase CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong \"What we provide is an on-ramp from the old economy to the new, from fiat to crypto,\" Hirji said. \"We need a bridge to get there, and we are providing that bridge.\"\nCoinbase, which has more than $225 million in funding from top VCs including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, as well as from the New York Stock Exchange , declined to comment on its valuation.\nThe New York Stock Exchange is reportedly planning its own cryptocurrency exchange to meet the needs of institutional investors to trade bitcoin, a move NYSE rival Nasdaq also said it's contemplating.\nThe competition is coming for Coinbase The moves into other venture capital and other business could be a way of building a moat around the company as others move into the crypto exchange business.\nSquare , run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is one potential competitor. It began trading cryptocurrency on its Square Cash app in January and could eat into the Coinbase exchange business, according to Nomura Instinet analyst Dan Dolev.\n\"If you're only a one-trick pony, at some point you're going to lose to competitors coming in like Square,\" he said. \"Eventually there will be another guy with a bigger offering.\"\nDolev estimated Coinbase's average trading fees were roughly 1.8 percent in 2017. That alone could drive users to other, cheaper exchanges.\n\"Coinbase has a huge first-mover advantage, but you're seeing that these things don't live forever,\" he said. \"It's always a risk to spread yourself too thin, but it's also an opportunity.\"\nCoinbase is hedging its exchange business by looking to become a one-stop shop for institutional investors. The company announced a fleet of products to lure in that \"white glove\" investor class, which has been especially cautious to dive into the volatile market.\nshow chapters Crypto exchange Coinbase goes after institutional investors 2:17 PM ET Thu, 17 May 2018 | 01:00 The company launched four new products: Coinbase Custody, Coinbase Markets, The Coinbase Institutional Coverage Group and Coinbase Prime.\nCoinbase, which already custodies $9 billion in customer assets, said there are billions of dollars in institutional money that will be invested in digital currency.\n\"We think this can unlock $10 billion of institutional investor money sitting on the sideline,\" Adam White, Coinbase's vice president and general manager, told CNBC. \"We're seeing a rapid increase in attention awareness and adoption in the cryptocurrency market.\"\nHirji said investors, like hedge funds, want exposure to the sector but are not interested in \"picking name A or name B\" cryptocurrency. Hedge funds and other institutional investors have contacted Coinbase expressing their desire to increase activity in the space, and that was a primary reason Coinbase launched an index fund in March.\nThe fund gives accredited U.S. investors exposure to all the digital currencies listed on Coinbase, but unlike a major equities index — like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average, which holds 30 stocks — the Coinbase Index Fund invested in a limited list of four cryptocurrency holdings. Out of 1,500 cryptocurrencies in existence, the platform only trades bitcoin , bitcoin cash , ethereum and litecoin .\nCoinbase has not suffered a hack like some other global cryptocurrency exchanges, yet institutional investors are concerned about security. Lack of a trusted custodia to safeguard their crypto assets was the impetus to launch Coinbase Custody last November, Coinbase president and COO Hirji said.\n\"They tell us that the No. 1 thing preventing them from getting started is the existence of a digital asset custodian that they can trust to store client funds securely,\" the company wrote in a blog post.\nWall St. shifts from bashing bit to cryptocurrency backer Wall Street's interest in cryptocurrency seems to be increasing. There are now 287 crypto hedge funds, up from 175 a year earlier, according to the latest data from Autonomous Next. Only 20 hedge funds for cryptocurrency existed in 2016. Goldman Sachs is reportedly looking to open a cryptocurrency trading desk, and White said others will be quick to follow.\nThe company noted at the launch that more than 100 hedge funds have been created in the past year exclusively to trade digital currency.\nCoinbase Ventures, an incubator fund for early-stage start-ups working in cryptocurrencies and blockchain, launched one month after the index fund and has $15 million geared up for investments. It announced its first investment in a start-up called Compound, which lets you lend or borrow cryptocurrency and earn an interest rate. Coinbase joined Andreessen Horowitz, crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital and Bain Capital Ventures in the investment round.\n\"We've looked at and invested in things that could be competitive to us,\" Hirji said.\n\"We think this can unlock $10 billion of institutional investor money sitting on the sideline. We're seeing a rapid increase in attention awareness and adoption in the cryptocurrency market.\" -Adam White, Coinbase vice president and general manager Earlier this year it launched Coinbase Commerce, which lets merchants accept major cryptocurrencies for payment, an area of the crypto economy that Square is positioned to exploit. Another early-into-the-sector bitcoin start-up was BitPay, which recently raised another $40 million in venture money. BitPay processed more than $1 billion in bitcoin payments last year.\nCryptocurrency, if you buy its believers thesis, has the power to upend the entire financial system. Proponents of blockchain technology, which underpins bitcoin , say it could eliminate the need for central authorities like banks, while lowering costs and even creating financial solutions for the unbanked. Earn.com, for example, can compensate users in any country for replying to an email or completing a simple task, even if they don't have a bank account.\nRegulatory scrutiny remains intense The Coinbase decision to keep access limited to four types of crypto has drawn criticism. The company has been treading lightly as U.S. regulators deliberate on how they might police certain uses of the technology. In the meantime, it issued a set of guidelines in response to \"feedback from customers that they want more assets on Coinbase.\"\nCoinbase is known as one of the more compliant companies in the space. It recently responded to former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's ongoing inquiry into exchanges, with some new disclosures and updates. Crypto exchange Kraken in contrast publicly refused to answer the inquiry from the New York Attorney General's office; its CEO called the questioning \"hostile.\"\nNew York City has been known as one of the least crypto-friendly jurisdictions. It requires a \"bitlicense,\" which has only been given to four companies, including Coinbase. The expensive, arduous process has made exchanges like Kraken leave New York City.\nA look back at the CNBC Disruptor 50: 6 years, 167 companies A key issue for Coinbase and others is whether what they offer on their platforms are securities and therefore subject to Securities and Exchange Commission jurisdiction. The agency said in March it is looking to apply securities laws to cryptocurrency exchanges, which is a main reason Coinbase has been admittedly slow to add new coins.\nCoinbase reportedly met with SEC officials this year to discuss registering as a licensed brokerage and electronic-trading venue, The Wall Street Journal reported , citing sources familiar with the situation. Some analysts said that move would make it easier for Coinbase to support more coins and complying with securities regulation. A source familiar with the situation confirmed to CNBC that the company is in talks with the agency about registering, but Coinbase declined to comment. It was also reported last week that Coinbase met with officials at the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in early 2018 about bank licenses.\nThe rapid growth for Coinbase hasn't come pain-free.\nThe company more than doubled its user base from late 2016 to the end of last year, while bitcoin rose from less than $1,000 to it's highest point, near $20,000. Today it's trading at around $8,300. As new users took to the platform, some complained on Twitter and Reddit about uptime, site outages and customer support, as well as technology decisions that some say has left them short on funds.\nOne notable hiccup happened at the end of last year, when the company surprised markets by immediately rolling out the trading of bitcoin cash, an offshoot of bitcoin. The company had earlier said in a blog post that it was targeting a launch by January 1, 2018, but ended up launching the cryptocurrency sooner than expected.\nThe price of that new digital currency skyrocketed after the announcement, and CEO Brian Armstrong later said in a December blog post that the company is investigating possible insider trading. No updates have been released. Sources familiar with the company's operations say an internal investigation conducted by a third-party team continues.\nThat botched roll-out of bitcoin-cash trading cost investors more than $5 million, a lawsuit alleges. Lawyers in March filed a class-action suit in the Northern District of California on behalf of customers who say they were damaged by \"negligence in the handling of the launch.\"\nCoinbase declined to comment on its internal review or any ongoing litigation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael short", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "linkedin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc disruptor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco-based coinba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:12:28.062+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6730cc8986e7b216b365fc7410632561a2682b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.HQNSflwHz.dcFK7Iql4Nk-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6730cc8986e7b216b365fc7410632561a2682b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.HQNSflwHz.dcFK7Iql4Nk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nTo get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!
