Here are other life-changing uses you didn’t know about. Just the FAQs\nBitcoin prices see-sawed Thursday following a report that the Department of Justice and the nation's top commodities regulator are investigating whether traders have manipulated the price of digital currencies.\nThe value of Bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market capitalization, fell roughly 3% to a six-week low of $7,272 in early trading, according to the CoinDesk price index . After a subsequent recovery, Bitcoin was fractionally higher at $7,524 in late-morning trading.\nThe price swings came after Bloomberg News reported that the Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation of potential cryptocurrency market manipulation. Federal investigators are working with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates financial derivatives that have values linked to digital currencies, the report said.\nInvestigators are focusing on banned trading tactics that can trigger price swings. They include spoofing, a strategy in which traders submit fake transactions in an effort to fool others into buying or selling, the report said.\nThe investigation also focuses on so-called wash trades, a tactic that involves a trader simultaneously buying and selling the same financial instruments. Such transactions may give a false picture of market activity and lure others into trading.\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment. The CFTC said the regulator would \"neither confirm nor deny any investigative activity.\"\nIn general, federal investigators and regulators have been scrutinizing trading in Bitcoin and other digital currencies based on a history of erratic price swings in cryptocurrency values and fears that markets that host the trading may not have sufficient safeguards to detect and halt fraud.\nIn a February advisory to consumers and investors , the CFTC warned about trading schemes that can occur \"in thinly traded or new 'alternative' virtual currencies and digital coins or tokens.\"\n\"Customers should not purchase virtual currencies, digital coins or tokens based on social media tips or sudden price spikes,\" the regulator cautioned. \"Thoroughly research virtual currencies, digital coins, tokens, and the companies or entities behind them in order to separate hype from facts.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Speaking at an industry event in London on Wednesday, Jeffrey Tessler, the firm’s head of clients, products and core markets, said, We’re deep at work with it.”. Nevertheless, any move in the cryptographic space on the stock exchange might not be instantly forthcoming, with Bloomberg quoting Tessler as saying: Before we move forward with anything like bitcoin we would like To make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the simplest thing to do. While CME Group and Cboe Global Markets both launched bitcoin futures trading last December, Tessler further said throughout the event that Deutsche Boerse isn’t at the same stage.”.\nThe company, he said, is attempting first to comprehend the volatility of the bitcoin market and making certain customers and regulators are in line before moving forward with any offerings, he added. Whilst a move into offering bitcoin products is so far not certain, the exchange has already been active in the blockchain space. Last June, Deutsche Boerse revealed details to CoinDesk about its plans to move the majority of its post trade services to the chain. It said at that time that it was focused on creating a system, using Hyperledger’s open source Fabric protocol, to transfer securities and move commercial bank money, while still ensuring cross jurisdictional compliance with regulators.\nAnd, as lately as March, the group announced it’d develop a platform for much more efficient securities lending using R3’s Corda Blockchain technology.

under criminal investigation by the feds By Jacob Ridley The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is facing a new criminal challenge from the US Justice department, as if the value of Bitcoin dropping further from the early year highs this month wasn’t bad enough for crypto-investors. An investigation has been opened into illicit trading across the Bitcoin network by the US Justice department, alongside the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It’s main goal is to root out traders that are set on manipulating the market in their favour through nefarious actions. According to insiders, Bitcoin, and various other cryptocurrencies including Ether, which runs the Ethereum network, could be manipulated easily, and may already be subject to illegal trading tactics. Promise not to mine on your shiny new GPU? Okay, here are the best graphics cards of 2018. These nefarious actions, all with fairly hilarious nicknames but very serious outcomes, are common to financial markets. For example there's 'spoofing,' which is when traders manipulate the market to create a false outlook and use this to their benefit at the expense of others. Then there's 'pump and dump,' where an investor spreads misplaced confidence in a security, and then sells their own shares for profit while the security tanks. You've also got 'churning,' where a trader puts in many buy and sell orders for the sole reason of attracting further investors due to the flurry of activity and increasing value; and similarly, 'wash trading,' which is the act of doubling down on securities to increase prices off the back of false activity. The report comes from Bloomberg , who spoke with insiders close to the investigation who wished to stay anonymous. The insiders indicated that federal prosecutors were chasing down the lackadaisically monitored crypto-market. Supposedly, cryptocurrency exchanges may not be doing enough to track down illegal traders, and a lack of regulation has has made the market “easy to spoof”, as John Griffin, finance professor at University of Texas, says to Bloomberg. Cryptocurrencies are not heavily regulated by an independent body at this time, and it has been a question for the future of cryptocurrency investments. Unfortunately, a regulatory being goes against many of the principles behind a ‘decentralised’ cryptocurrency, and handing control to a centralised authority would push investors away from the platforms. However, there are many in cryptocurrency traders that support some self-regulation to grow the platform into a serious world market. “I think it’s really great that these regulations appear because they can provide legal companies, and the companies that develop a working product, lots of opportunities”, CEO of Playkey, Egor Gurjev told us regarding the future of the Ethereum Blockchain under regulation. “They will throw out lots of coins and companies that only develop the coin to take all the money and run away. I think this will bring lots of advantages.\" The SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) has, on various occasions, investigated dodgy ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and expects to remain actively investigating cryptocurrencies for the foreseeable future. Also, many countries have independently started to regulate cryptos to varying degrees. The rise of cryptocurrencies has been a hot topic among gamers for the past year, mostly due to the surge in demand for mining-proficient graphics cards . However, this demand has lessened in the last month, wiping huge profits from Nvidia and AMD , and letting gamers pick up graphics cards for MSRP for the first time in, at least, half a year. Will this regulation and investigation stifle crypto demand further? Bitcoin is still gaining considerable interest and oodles of positive opinion among big bankers and investors, although its value is still comparatively low, at roughly $7,500 compared to the record highs of near-enough $20,000 at the beginning of the year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jacob r", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:20:51.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60d8ddbfe723104273350801d9d1ddf6fdd0d06c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0ll_t8WSZjwNKYkvzDCzyCzCzJT_rRcUOQoomcycLUpwrEpaPx_3ijdqxfyYdmyV20BqoIHA2kU7huQvXi1Q0tBKZoRy5DgZhOHft.NhWMxWtO97oYPBlUXFLLqj.hGzX9POBA7dkNyg.zUibZoO2QJOu40phNAIP51vJ.ZpGfjLrCCxCchiH.QLHQfhAGC8-", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/-2128680634.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "International Business, World & Global Business News | Share Market News - Times of India", "title": "UK mosque first in the world to accept bitcoin donations - Times of India", "title_full": "UK mosque first in the world to accept bitcoin donations - Times of India", "published": "2018-05-24T18:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-64299120,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1119232,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60d8ddbfe723104273350801d9d1ddf6fdd0d06c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0ll_t8WSZjwNKYkvzDCzyCzCzJT_rRcUOQoomcycLUpwrEpaPx_3ijdqxfyYdmyV20BqoIHA2kU7huQvXi1Q0tBKZoRy5DgZhOHft.NhWMxWtO97oYPBlUXFLLqj.hGzX9POBA7dkNyg.zUibZoO2QJOu40phNAIP51vJ.ZpGfjLrCCxCchiH.QLHQfhAGC8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2018-05-24T18:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "UK mosque first in the world to accept bitcoin donations - Times of India", "text": "A London mosque is thought to be the first in the world to accept bitcoin donations, one month after an Islamic scholar declared the cryptocurrency permissible under Sharia Law.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Hackney announced that it is hoping to raise at least £10,000 in cryptocurrency donations over Ramadan , through both bitcoin and ethereum.

Some crypto market observers have opined bitcoin could reach new highs this year, but those are just projections. In financial markets, price matters and bitcoin’s price has rapidly eroded since the start of May. Why Bitcoin Has been Unimpressive\n“Notably, the five-month moving average (MA) has rolled over in favor of the bears and looks set to cut the 10-month MA from above – a bearish crossover that hasn’t been seen since June 2014,” reports CoinDesk . “If that occurs it could be a worrying signal for the long-term price outlook. Back then, following an identical crossover in June 2014, the cryptocurrency subsequently dropped by 70 percent (from $580 to $166) in the seven months leading up to January 2015.” Other Cryptos Are Tumbling Too\nBitcoin is not the only digital currency that has recently tumbled. On Wednesday, 19 of the 20 largest alt-coins by market value lost ground. Of those 19, at least 17 were down 10% or more at some point during Wednesday’s U.S. trading session.\n“This time around, the bearish crossover will likely occur at the turn of the month, if bitcoin extends the current decline towards the $7,000 mark, and would open the doors for a deeper sell-off towards the $5,000 mark,” according to CoinDesk.\nSome cryptocurrency market observers believe that if bitcoin can make it back to $10,000, rallies fromt there could be significant. Recently, the Bitcoin Dominance Index has been rising, confirming the dominant perch of the cryptocurrency, but that view is severely impaired in the near-term, particularly if bitcoin continues flirting with $7,000 on the downside.\n“BTC risks deeper pullback towards $7,000. In such a case, the 5-month MA will cross the 10-month MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover and opening doors for a drop to $5,000,” according to CoinDesk.\nFor more information on the cryptocurrency market, visit our Bitcoin category .

Not only did bitcoin lose 3 percent this morning, but ethereum was trading down 3.15 percent by 8:14a.m. EST:\nThe DoJ investigation comes on the heels of a campaign launched by State of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, which sent letters in April to 13 exchanges, requesting detailed information on their operations.\n“Representing a technological advance, a medium of exchange, and an investment opportunity all at once, virtual currencies are inspiring innovators, entrepreneurs, and investors—and are fueling an increasingly diverse ecosystem of companies and applications,” the AG’s office wrote in the letter. “But virtual currency is also a highly speculative sector, featuring significant volatility, instability, and risk. Moreover, published reports indicate the sector has attracted fraudsters, market manipulators, and thieves.” Related: Consumers Lost $1.6M To Crypto Fraud In Australia\nAmong the 13 exchanges were the well-known Kraken, Poloniex, Binance and one that should be gaining a fair amount of attention right now—Gemini, the brainchild of the Winklevoss brothers.\nGemini is operating without New York State’s “BitLicense”, but it has also recently thrown in with Nasdaq to monitor crypto markets for illicit trading using the same technology used by traditional markets to look for things like spoofing and washing.\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been scrambling to get in front of crypto regulation, counterintuitively proposing the creation of a national self-regulatory body to govern the digital token sector.\nSo is the latest news of the DoJ investigation propitious for Gemini? Ultimately, it very well could because Gemini will use Nasdaq technology to monitor trading patterns even in closing auctions where prices are most vulnerable to manipulation, according to Quartz . It’s a process called “ banging the close ”.\nIn the meantime, bitcoin isn’t going to catch a clear break as long as regulatory questions remain unanswered; nor is it ever likely to reach its $20,000 high of last December in this environment. Holding on to gains from 4 May when it topped $9,000 again will also be difficult.\nA recent Federal Reserve report said that bitcoin’s “hypothetical value” is $1,800.\n“Although Bitcoins do not possess any real intrinsic value, from a commodity valuation perspective, we can estimate a hypothetical value based on its production costs. Recent estimates regarding the energy involved in mining a single Bitcoin by professional energy-efficient mining rigs put it at about $1,800 when mined in China (where 80% of the currently mined Bitcoins originate),” Joost van der Burgt, fintech policy advisor at the Federal Reserve’s San Francisco branch wrote in the May 18 report .\nBy Michael Kern for Safehaven.com\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://qz.com/1261537/winklevoss-twins-gemini-bitcoin-exchange-partners-with-nasdaq-to-monitor-for-market-manipulation/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe", "https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-launches-inquiry-cryptocurrency-exchanges", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-futures-manipulation-101-how-banging-the-close-works-1513425600", "https://www.frbsf.org/banking/publications/fintech-edge/2018/may/making-sense-of-bitcoin-price-levels/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael kern", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:48:25.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eaf9c96c198aca3f8d52a6e43c91ce69198940eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCLQWDzEggTjD2h..Fw90g-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Government and Bitcoin", "title_full": "Government and Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-24T17:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.959, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eaf9c96c198aca3f8d52a6e43c91ce69198940eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCLQWDzEggTjD2h..Fw90g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DimensionsOfHell", "published": "2018-05-24T17:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Government and Bitcoin", "text": "in general, countries are afraid of digital currencies, although they understand that the prohibitions can not be saved.

It has led to a lot of pushback and even court cases amidst crypto businesses closing.\nIndia’s relationship with Bitcoin is rocky at best, but also confusing and convoluted, and well worth examining as so much has happened in just the past few months. Bitcoin and blockchain in review\nIndia had a very productive 2017 in terms of the growth, adoption, and acceptance of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\nOne of India’s leading trade associations, ASSOCHAM, held a global summit on Bitcoin and blockchain in March 2017.\nIn May 2017, the demand for Bitcoin grew exponentially and abruptly, so much that India’s largest exchanges had to put a limit on Bitcoin purchases due to lack of supply.\nIn June, Zebpay, one of India’s leading Bitcoin exchanges established back in 2012, became the seventh most popular app in the finance category on India’s Apple app store, even higher than the apps of many national banks.\nIn October, it was reported that the major Bitcoin exchanges in India were attracting more than 200,000 new users every month .\nThis was all going on with negative rumbling from the RBI already in the background, as it was issuing warnings throughout the year cautioning people about buying Bitcoin. The rumbling gets louder\nWhile there was huge growth and interest from individuals and companies in cryptocurrency and blockchain, the RBI was mostly unswayed, and in the government remained similarly unimpressed.\nIn the hopes of deterring buyers, India’s Ministry of Finance called Bitcoin a ponzi scheme and said it had no intrinsic value, but this was announced only a few days after Bitcoin topped a high of $20,000 , and mostly fell on deaf ears.\nBut those warnings started turning into actions as the banking sector took tangible steps to try to slow down Bitcoin’s growth and progress. Banks dig in their heels\nOn January 21, 2018, it was reported that a number of major banks in India had suspended or greatly curtailed functionality on exchange accounts.\nState Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank had all taken strong actions against crypto exchanges, either closing accounts or severely limiting functionality. The reason given was the risk of dubious transactions, according to local reports .\nOn February 14, Citibank India banned its customers from using credit cards to purchase cryptocurrencies. It also took the measure one step further by banning the use of debit cards for crypto purchases, Quartz India reported .\nThe move by the banks, coupled with a negative mention about Bitcoin by finance minister Arun Jaitley during his budget speech, had an impact as Bitcoin businesses started feeling the heat and were unprepared to operate in such a negative climate.\nOn February 28, crypto exchanges BTCXIndia and ETHEXIndia then informed their customers via email that they were stopping trading activities, citing the “stress” on their business caused by governmental actions discouraging crypto.\nThis all led up to the RBI’s big announcement of its ‘ban ’. They explained in their statement that the move was justified by the associated risks that the government had been warning against all this time.\nThus, it has been decided that, effective immediately, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Regulated entities that already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified timeframe. Hope remains\nWhile the news was seen as semi-positive since it was not a direct ban on cryptocurrencies, it was still a blow for India’s burgeoning cryptocurrency environment.\nHowever, a day after the ‘ban’ was announced, hope was slightly renewed as the RBI also said that it was considering creating its own cryptocurrency . RBI Deputy Governor B.P. Kanungo had some positive things to say about the technology. He told The Times Of India :\n“Technological innovations, including virtual currencies, have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system. We recognize that the Blockchain technology has potential benefits for the financial sector and we believe that they should be encouraged to be exploited for the benefit of the economy.” A big backlash\nDespite the positivity about the technology and the economic potential cryptocurrencies could offer India, the fact of the matter was that the damage was done, and already the fledgling crypto ecosystem was taking hits as exchanges closed.\nThis triggered a backlash from Indian citizens as well as some big crypto-influencers.\nTim Draper , the well-regarded tech investor, called the RBI’s decision a huge mistake and warned that it would drain India of cryptocurrency experts, which it would clearly need if it did see potential in the technology.\nFurthermore, a petition garnered over 17,000 signatures, urging the RBI to reverse its decision on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The reason for signing this petition for many was expressed as:\n“It could lead to an increase of irregular cash trading of cryptocurrencies in India. In addition, the ban could take away potential revenue to the government from crypto exchanges, and instigate a crypto market price drop ‘due to the knee jerk reaction in which prices got impacted.’”\nThis unfortunately was not strong enough to sway the RBI’s decision, which then led to sterner measures being taken. Legal intervention\nOn April 22, 2018, the High Court of Delhi reportedly issued a notice to the RBI , the Ministry of Finance, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council alleging that RBI’s decision to end dealings with crypto businesses violates the constitution.\nHowever, as this issue began to climb up the judicial ladder, it was halted when the Supreme Court of India was called upon. On May 12, the Supreme Court declined to grant an interim injunction against the RBI.\nLater on, the Supreme Court came forward again and said that no petitions could be filed in any High Court of India against the RBI crypto decision. This decision will be in place until July, when the Court will set a hearing date for the existing petition on July 20 . What’s happening on the ground floor?\nFor all the rumbling coming out of India from court battles and petitions to these bans on dealing with crypto, it is always important to see how the news is affecting the crypto-users on the ground floor.\nEvan Luthra, an Indian cryptocurrency investor and entrepreneur, spoke to Cointelegraph about what is going on, and how the government is really just looking to play it safe.\n“What most people need to understand is that the views and opinions of a few people in the government don’t make a law,” Luthra told Cointelegraph. “The Indian government is just trying to play it safe and actually bringing light to the whole industry.”\n“The process taken by the government is not the wrong intention. It is for putting a stop to people who are doing scams and running ponzi schemes. The actions taken will only slow down the process but it cannot stop the adoption. That’s the beauty of decentralization, that it cannot be stopped or controlled by any central authority. If people choose to adopt Bitcoin, crypto, or Gladage, or any other token, for example, directly without converting into fiat, it will next leap in the industry.”\n“The government has only put a stop to conversion into fiat but they are actively promoting the technology. Even the Prime Minister is going out in public and explains the benefits of adopting the technology. In the coming days things will get much better even on the regulatory side.”\nLuthra’s point, that the government has good intentions, does make sense. However, their implementation is rubbing people the wrong way in the short term. Still, down the line, when this move has cleared away scams and ponzi schemes, perhaps it will be viewed in a better light. The battle rages\nIt is a baffling situation that the Indian cryprocommunity finds themselves in as their central bank is slowing the progress of Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies in general. The government does not have a positive outlook on crypto, but they are not banning it.\nRather it is being choked out by the banking system which is now under pressure from the community, who is involving the courts. India is fighting internally about the future of cryptocurrency with even the banks admitting that there is a lot of promise in the technology.\nThe next step in India’s battle for cryptocurrency legitimacy will come on July 20, when the courts sit down and look over the new petitions, but until then, the cryptocummunity has to try to survive even with the banking squeeze.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-goes-bitcoin-zebpay-will-add-500k-users-monthly-by-2018", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hits-20000-per-coin-capping-year-of-enormous-growth", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/citibank-india-bans-both-credit-and-debit-cards-for-crypto-purchases-cites-risks", "https://qz.com/1205928/choking-bitcoin-citibank-joins-a-growing-list-of-lenders-squeezing-cryptocurrencies-in-india/", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-two-crypto-exchanges-halt-trading-blame-discouraging-government-stance", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-demand-explodes-in-india-overwhelmed-exchanges-put-limits-on-purchases", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-circular-barring-banking-service-for-crypto-currencies-challenged-in-hc/articleshow/63868562.cms", "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/top-banks-suspend-accounts-of-major-bitcoin-exchanges-in-india/articleshow/62576882.cms?from=mdr", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-banks-suspending-bitcoin-exchange-accounts", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/reserve-bank-of-india-considers-central-bank-issued-digital-currency", "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PressRelease/PDFs/PR264270719E5CB28249D7BCE07C5B3196C904.PDF", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-supreme-court-upholds-central-banks-crypto-dealings-ban-until-july-hearing", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/growth-of-bitcoin-blockchain-development-in-india-2017-in-review", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-delhi-high-court-seeks-response-from-central-bank-on-recent-crypto-ban-report-says", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/cointelegraphcomstorageuploadsviewd39ddc678cc6e43c9a4fe85fcd2db95fjpg", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/indias-central-bank-to-stop-dealing-with-all-crypto-related-accounts-not-ban-on-crypto-commenters-say", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/global-bitcoin-summit-in-india-will-explore-opportunities-help-fend-off-bad-rap", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/indias-ministry-of-finance-compares-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-to-ponzi-schemes", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/petition-to-reverse-indian-central-banks-crypto-ban-gains-17000-signatures", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/ban-complete-china-blocks-foreign-crypto-exchanges-to-counter-financial-risks", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-may-introduce-its-own-version-of-digital-currency/articleshow/63627093.cms", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-draper-calls-indias-crypto-stance-a-huge-mistake-warns-of-potential-brain-drain", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/whats-the-plan-government-bitcoin-or-no-bitcoin-for-india", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-supreme-court-denies-interim-injunction-against-reserve-bank-of-india-restrictions"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoiners", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T22:40:26.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26a2276d1e099f0e384c79d041862519f02eb2e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosK0NKOHgosoHDgnYXBctGcHg5MGHiskVfj772UGARFQuY8oDCWJh8pvWrW9Nj.cnQcd1ZQs3sbIcM-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.cz", "site": "freelancer.cz", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.cz/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer -

(Kin Cheung / Associated Press) The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter.\nThe investigation is focused on illegal practices that can influence prices — such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the review is private. Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said. Advertisement\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3% to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. It's down more than 20% since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading — forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, and CFTC officials didn't respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.' latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin's meteoric rise — it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 — has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That's prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, because of suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren't registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn't regulate what's known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have the authority to impose sanctions. Fraud target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n\"There's very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,\" Griffin said. \"It would be easy to spoof this market.\"\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry's growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a \"buyer beware\" approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co.

With $10- to $15 million you’re able to move markets quite substantially,” he added.\nThe news initially sent the price of bitcoin down more than 2 percent, but it rose 1.3 percent, to $7,599.23 by early afternoon.\nLast year, bitcoin saw its value explode to nearly $20,000 from about $1,000 the year before as investors were lured in by the futuristic promises of the industry and, above all, greed.\nBitcoin has collapsed more than 50 percent, but true believers have continued to flock to digital currencies — and last week Ethereum’s co-founder held a $3 million blow-out party for revelers.\nBitcoin, Ethereum and other similar cryptocurrencies have been plagued with reputations for aiding drug dealers and money launderers since transactions are conducted anonymously and are extremely difficult to track.\nAbout $1.2 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen by criminals, many of which are associated with drugs or money laundering — and only about 20 percent of that has been recovered, according to a study released Thursday by the Anti-Phishing Working Group, a cybersecurity non-profit.\n“This is more of a warning shot,” van der Chijs said. “Maybe they catch one or two people to show that they know how to do it.”\nIn April, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent letters to 13 cryptocurrency exchanges asking for information about their general practices, including how they police fraud, money laundering, and other illegal operations.\nEarlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a broad investigation into bitcoin-like “tokens” that are issued by companies through so-called “initial coin offerings.”\nThat market, which uses similar technology to the bitcoin, has been over-run with scams and get-rich quick schemers.\nLast month, advisory firm Satis Group released a research report that found that 80 percent of ICOs are scams.\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department and the CFTC didn’t immediately return requests for comment.\nRelated Video 1:23 Bitcoin went from the trenches of Occupy Wall Street to the top of Goldman Sachs Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Facebook Messenger WhatsApp Email Copy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://nyp.st/2GP2wmk&#038;appId=823934954307605", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe", "https://nyp.st/2KO4h5C", "https://nyp.st/2KO4eXu"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. department of justice", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:48:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8ddb0cafe1436bcb2c776c7fdb7fb9bd598df02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYzvIJIqZ478EJqs4BWdSAKZjz9rg_0eEBIDhcGKcIs30N0lm9NR_ZHBcttrPNtocRA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "UK Banking App Revolut Adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading", "title_full": "UK Banking App Revolut Adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading", "published": "2018-05-24T17:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8ddb0cafe1436bcb2c776c7fdb7fb9bd598df02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYzvIJIqZ478EJqs4BWdSAKZjz9rg_0eEBIDhcGKcIs30N0lm9NR_ZHBcttrPNtocRA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T17:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "UK Banking App Revolut Adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading", "text": "Revolut, London-based fintech startup that created the first app allowing customers to invest in Bitcoin, is adding Bitcoin Cash and Ripple to its cryptocurrency feature.\nRevolut is the UK-based payments company which uses investments to further expand its operations and allow users to purchase and sell digital currency. Founded in 2015 by former institutional trader Nikolay Storonsky, it is a digital banking alternative that includes a pre-paid debit card, currency exchange, cryptocurrency exchange and peer-to-peer payments.\nLast December, Revolut became the first banking app to let customers invest in Bitcoin. Now Revolut will offer them the chance to buy Ripple and Bitcoin Cash as well.\n🤩 The wait is over. You can now buy, hold and sell #XRP and #BCH instantly with Revolut. https://t.co/WgvhpdEoTP\n— Revolut (@RevolutApp) May 24, 2018\nRipple and Bitcoin Cash are the third and fourth most popular cryptocurrencies by market value. Among cryptocurrencies that have already been made available for clients to trade within the app are bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum.\n\"We've been asking the Revolut community which cryptocurrencies they would like to see next, and the demand for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash has been absolutely overwhelming,\" said Vlad Yatsenko, Revolut chief technology officer.\nAccording to the company, the decision to include Bitcoin Cash and XRP was made because \"other major cryptocurrency exchanges are yet to support these digital currencies\".\n\"After months of negotiation and development work, we're incredibly excited to offer exposure to these two digital currencies to the UK market,\" Vlad Yatsenko said.\nA fee for cryptocurrency transactions makes up 1.5%. In comparison with a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can't send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you'll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRevolut conducts over 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day. Recently, the startup added a new feature called Vaults. With the feature, Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time. You can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. You can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money daily, weekly or monthly. Moreover, you get to choose the currency of your vault, which is a good way to hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nMore than 50,000 of Revolut's customers signed up to the feature. However, they don't earn interests on vaults. This feature is just a way to set some money aside that doesn't appear in your main Revolut account.\nRevolut has extensive plans for growth. The company wants to bulk up its engineering and design staff in order to expand into the United States, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand this year.\n\"By expanding overseas, we will be empowering millions of people to take control over their financial lives, and in the process, we will be reducing the cost of international transfers by partnering with the best players in the financial world,\" Revolut said.\nThe post UK Banking App Revolut Adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading appeared first on CoinSpeaker .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "revolut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikolay storonsky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:44:42.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b051ac5b97c43d9b89113f9184a343245ed0df16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVtPlBWiFyDuDyQvlBSi28Vii8_17rjyOEBjTBCV2nH.94Hc3jFq5WF4wULeajMZ1uBhN1tV78P2a_NPiQvxiuWEy.xotQIUxq6_hRfcv0wMHxU9ati18xwZvF1307zdngs4en.DR4BC6IFvNqvFIOdo-", "site_full": "www.dailyfx.com", "site": "dailyfx.com", "site_section": "https://rss.dailyfx.com/feeds/all", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "games"], "section_title": "DailyFX - Feeds all", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Slump Continues on US Justice Department Probe Talk", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Slump Continues on US Justice Department Probe Talk", "published": "2018-05-24T17:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10, "comments": 0, "shares": 10}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b051ac5b97c43d9b89113f9184a343245ed0df16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVtPlBWiFyDuDyQvlBSi28Vii8_17rjyOEBjTBCV2nH.94Hc3jFq5WF4wULeajMZ1uBhN1tV78P2a_NPiQvxiuWEy.xotQIUxq6_hRfcv0wMHxU9ati18xwZvF1307zdngs4en.DR4BC6IFvNqvFIOdo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nick Cawley, Analyst", "published": "2018-05-24T17:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Slump Continues on US Justice Department Probe Talk", "text": "Fundamental analysis and financial markets.

The story, citing four people familiar with the matter, states that officials are looking at potential price manipulation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies along with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\nThis report comes hot on the heels of a statement by the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) applauding “ fellow regulators in the United States and Canada who are coordinating and participating in efforts to police fraud in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) markets”. Chairman Jay Clayton added that “ The enforcement actions being announced by NASAA should be a strong warning to would-be fraudsters in this space that many sets of eyes are watching, and that regulators are coordinating on an international level to take strong actions to deter and stop fraud ”.\nA combination of increased regulatory oversight and a weak technical backdrop has forced cryptocurrency prices sharply lower across the board in the past couple of days, taking out noted levels of support. Market heavyweight Bitcoin (BTC) currently trades around $7,400 and is nearing the bottom of its recent trading range at $6,438.

Well, US authorities have apparently heard your whining because they are now reportedly suspicious manipulation is indeed occurring.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street Spoofing and Wash Trading\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly launched a criminal investigation to determine if big money traders are manipulating the prices of Bitcoin, Ether and possibly other cryptocurrencies. The illicit trade tactics that the DOJ is looking into include spoofing and wash trading, and federal prosecutors are working in collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the investigation, this according to “four people familiar with the matter” cited by Bloomberg .\nSpoofing refers to creating false buy orders to attract other traders (usually bots) to get in, with the intention of manipulating the market price in order to make a profit by actually selling. The Dodd-Frank Act defines spoofing as “the illegal practice of bidding or offering with intent to cancel before execution.” Similarly, wash trading is when someone simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading activity, meant to make it appear as if an asset has more trade volume than it really does. Why Now?\nUS authorities are reportedly concerned that cryptocurrency markets are prone to manipulation for a number of reasons including doubts that all trading venues are on the lookout for fraudsters, massive price swings that make it possible to steer valuations and a lack of strong regulations on crypto exchanges.\nWhile many will surely applaud the DOJ for its diligence in protecting crypto investors, skeptics might wonder if US authorities are not doing this also in an effort to further cool the market down by frightening investors. They are not generally known to be welcoming toward the field, and only recently it was revealed that American regulators also took part in a crackdown on what they call “fraudulent ICOs and crypto-asset investment products.”\nAre cryptocurrency prices manipulated and is it the US DOJ’s job to investigate these global markets at all?

Further, while users can send cryptocurrency to other users using the payment option, the firm says that they may not directly transfer them in or out of the app due to \"strict regulation.\"\nThe U.K.-based app provider's move to offer cryptocurrency services came about following the completion of a $66 million Series B funding round last summer.

Police on Wednesday said the family had not even heard of the cryptocurrency.\nTimesLive quoted police spokesman Leonard Hlathi as saying “he has been found.” There was no immediate comment from police.\nPolice say there has been a rise in kidnappings but this is the apparently the first demand for a ransom in bitcoin.\nIn December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than $1 million in bitcoins for releasing their victim - an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange.

Market manipulation has been an increasingly popular topic in crypto world – particularly since prices started their historic surge.\nLast summer, the SEC established the legal precedent that all digital tokens should be treated like legitimate securities and required them to be registered with the agency. Meanwhile, the CFTC, which is also working with the DOJ, declared bitcoin a commodity back in 2015, and is responsible for regulating bitcoin futures.\nInvestigators will likely look to bring charges against traders who engaged in spoofing – flooding the market with fake orders to push a price up or down depending on one’s position. Another illicit tactic that the DOJ is looking into is called wash trading, which is also prevalent in equity and futures markets. Wash traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume in an otherwise illiquid market.\nThe probe is reportedly focusing on bitcoin and ether, according to Bloomberg’s sources.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise – it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 – has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nThe Rest… HERE 10:27 Economics , Technology Leave a Reply", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-24/doj-launches-criminal-probe-bitcoin-market-manipulation"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "doj launches criminal probe into bitcoin price manipulation doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:09:32.055+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f03ebf2d1a4849abfd0f0b6fde051ac9046db5f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTRVacInObnNbA4lctS2ONuiUlTLYtp7.8u7Q8CJb37FXyq_QX8gPIStbSCJuMCkpYKdeHiftcuJvamOKQfdMEnPNr3g2sGET805T8zb7AxKHDvHZTPuCjY1gmm0UFbeEu9UI3gX5q70Xmdx6XURWVzDTLcgJMS3yf0CG7hHlSL5g--", "site_full": "newspapers.naijamotherland.com", "site": "naijamotherland.com", "site_section": "https://newspapers.naijamotherland.com/feed.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "NaijaMotherland", "title": "Kidnappers Demand Ransom Of $120,000 In Bitcoin For Teenage Boy - The Trent", "title_full": "Kidnappers Demand Ransom Of $120,000 In Bitcoin For Teenage Boy - The Trent", "published": "2018-05-24T17:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.naijamotherland.com/storage/downloads/members/thetrentonline/news/l_3a0e98246ac147c38c824bf59d8c621c.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f03ebf2d1a4849abfd0f0b6fde051ac9046db5f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTRVacInObnNbA4lctS2ONuiUlTLYtp7.8u7Q8CJb37FXyq_QX8gPIStbSCJuMCkpYKdeHiftcuJvamOKQfdMEnPNr3g2sGET805T8zb7AxKHDvHZTPuCjY1gmm0UFbeEu9UI3gX5q70Xmdx6XURWVzDTLcgJMS3yf0CG7hHlSL5g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T17:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kidnappers Demand Ransom Of $120,000 In Bitcoin For Teenage Boy - The Trent", "text": "Kidnappers Demand Ransom Of $120,000 In Bitcoin For Teenage Boy - The Trent thetrentonline.com | Thursday, May 24, 2018 | 14 views A criminal gang in South Africa who kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday, May 20, 2018 are demanding a ransom in bitcoin crytocurrency of nearly $120,000, police said. Katlego Marite, 13, was dragged into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank, a town in the eastern province of Mpumalanga, on Sunday afternoon, police spokesman Leonard Hlathi said. South African schoolboy Katlego Marite, 13, was snatched by a gang in the eastern province of Mpumalanga on Sunday. The kidnappers are demanding a ransom be paid in bitcoin. “They demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,” he told news channel eNCA. “(The parents) don’t even know what these bitcoins are. They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak.” Although police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first. In December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than $1 million in bitcoins for releasing their victim – an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange. via Reuters The post Kidnappers Demand Ransom Of $120,000 In Bitcoin For Teenage Boy appeared first on The Trent.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leonard hlathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katlego marite", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mpumalanga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "witbank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T01:23:11.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5097b93493ca928f2f1972ce5ef39102dfcfd6fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSy03S_B2zdIl6ffAJxV4yhjWDXe29GcrKKhDwgNSMD10iDn8ZtbZwbar6o9mby_RWsLbLuYtDrkhyUKhxksNlFldC9LmXXv4d7.a_o8LtJYQ--", "site_full": "www.thedailyeconomist.com", "site": "thedailyeconomist.com", "site_section": "https://www.thedailyeconomist.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "The Daily Economist", "title": "Argentine bank dumps SWIFT for Bitcoin is helping facilitate currency swaps", "title_full": "Argentine bank dumps SWIFT for Bitcoin is helping facilitate currency swaps", "published": "2018-05-24T17:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5097b93493ca928f2f1972ce5ef39102dfcfd6fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSy03S_B2zdIl6ffAJxV4yhjWDXe29GcrKKhDwgNSMD10iDn8ZtbZwbar6o9mby_RWsLbLuYtDrkhyUKhxksNlFldC9LmXXv4d7.a_o8LtJYQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kenneth Schortgen Jr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T17:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Argentine bank dumps SWIFT for Bitcoin is helping facilitate currency swaps", "text": "Despite the fact that the U.S. dollar is the world's recognized reserve currency, swapping out one's own domestic currency for another carries with it intrinsic costs.

Investigators will examine practices such as flooding the market with mass numbers of buy and sell orders with intent to retract the offers later.\nFederal prosecutors will be working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission . Regulators remain concerned that cryptocurrencies pose a high risk to consumers with their highly volatile nature. Additionally, lack of consumer knowledge presents a great risk of fraud with little or no recourse available.\nAnother tactic being scrutinized is wash trading. There are some users that place buy and sell orders to make it appear as though there is high market activity, but are truly only moving their own assets around through an exchange site. Once there appears to be high activity periods, other consumers are lured into making trades and allowing the wash trader to take advantage of the market volatility.\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are being examined for evidence of wash trading and order spoofing. Since the CFTC is a derivatives oversight group, it does not actually regulate the direct trading of digital coins. Instead, it watches over futures that are linked to cryptocurrencies. If there are any instances of illicit activity found with respect to spot markets, sanctions can be imposed.\nDespite attempts to regulate and patrol the sea of cryptocurrencies, there is little that can actually be done to prevent order spoofing and market manipulation techniques. Digital currencies can be traded globally at any time without need for a central authority. It is possible to directly regulate derivatives markets, but as long as the underlying cryptocurrencies used in spot markets are being used, there is little that can be done to enforce trade rules.

Police on Wednesday said the family had not even heard of the cryptocurrency. TimesLive quoted police spokesman Leonard Hlathi as saying “he has been found.” There was no immediate comment from police.\nPolice say there has been a rise in kidnappings but this is the apparently the first demand for a ransom in bitcoin.\nIn December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than $1 million in bitcoins for releasing their victim - an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange.

But could some of them be right?\nThe U.S. Justice Department has launched a criminal probe into whether the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being manipulated by traders, Bloomberg reported Thursday.\nThis manipulation can include practices such as spoofing (placing large numbers of buy or sell orders with no intent to fill them) and wash trading (simultaneously buying and selling the same asset to create fake volume on the market). You will rarely see these illegal methods used in established stock markets, but some may be using them to profit in the largely unregulated world of cryptocurrencies, teeming with millions of inexperienced traders.\nAccording to the report, the Justice Department is working with CFTC officials on the investigation, which is said to be in its early stages. The investigation is reportedly focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\nA recent analysis by investor Sylvain Ribes, for example, has shown that a large amount of volume seen on some popular cryptocurrency exchanges is likely fake and exists only due to practices such as wash trading. And a recent paper , published in the Journal of Monetary Economics, concluded that suspicious trading activity may have been responsible for Bitcoin’s rapid jump in price from $150 to $1,000 in late 2013.\nThe price of Bitcoin has been on the decline since May 5, when it briefly hit $9,950, and is currently at $7,543. The market cap of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency stands at $128.6 billion. Ethereum is following a similar trajectory. It’s currently trading at $586 with a market cap of $58.4 billion.\nDisclosure: The author of this text owns, or has recently owned, a number of cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://weis2017.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/05/WEIS_2017_paper_21.pdf", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe", "https://mashable.com/author/stan-schroeder/", "https://medium.com/@sylvainartplayribes/chasing-fake-volume-a-crypto-plague-ea1a3c1e0b5e"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stan schroeder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:59:09.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebfa6c6b56ba8d0d560115d78007e00f5e666b01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwaez9tRfpoUmxJvWMzQZJeRijD3b7q2OAndNV_0t0Pp3PuXSTV3DNkYjwHFzl.BDWyEA9eQrmkoN92l0boYYnOQxcwTqIJnfZSlTc3VhAdDCVp_BDqYuDP.1KY_5EC.ClTboQVpvZ.xA--", "site_full": "feedjunkie.com", "site": "feedjunkie.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/feedjunkie", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Feedjunkie.com", "title": "Justice Department launches probe into Bitcoin price manipulation, report claims", "title_full": "Justice Department launches probe into Bitcoin price manipulation, report claims", "published": "2018-05-24T17:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ebfa6c6b56ba8d0d560115d78007e00f5e666b01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwaez9tRfpoUmxJvWMzQZJeRijD3b7q2OAndNV_0t0Pp3PuXSTV3DNkYjwHFzl.BDWyEA9eQrmkoN92l0boYYnOQxcwTqIJnfZSlTc3VhAdDCVp_BDqYuDP.1KY_5EC.ClTboQVpvZ.xA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mashable!", "published": "2018-05-24T17:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Justice Department launches probe into Bitcoin price manipulation, report claims", "text": "Mashable!

The United States Department of Justice is taking a closer look at that by opening a criminal probe into price manipulation of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies), according to a report from Bloomberg .\nAccording to the report, investigators are specifically looking into practices like spoofing (filling the marketplace with fake orders that are later canceled to manipulate others to buy or sell a particular coin) and wash trading (trading with oneself in order to falsely imply more market demand than there actually is). There are forms of cheating that have long existed and been battled in more traditional financial markets, but cryptocurrency’s lack of serious regulation or monitoring may have given these old scams a new place to thrive.\nAccording to the report, the DOJ is working with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees and regulates cryptocurrency derivatives in its investigation. Part of the problem, however, is that the CFTC can only regulate futures based on coins, not the actual trading of coins themselves. That could change if the investigation finds that fraud is found to have actually occurred.\nThe new DOJ investigation isn’t the first attempt by the government to try and rein in shady Bitcoin practices, either. The SEC has been struggling for several months to try and better regulate sketchy ICOs (initial coin offerings), even going as far as creating a fake ICO of its own to help warn against the problem. The SEC has also warned celebrities against endorsing ICOs without proper disclosure , and it recently charged a fraudulent ICO endorsed by Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled over false claims.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "us department of justice", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:17:05.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2218b23691c67b3bb1e71d8197b3ead11aab0b24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiT4VnKd3Fg5Gzs77Li_PLVEhfy9CQyOA.EVXtOOepT3xyHnQcIbXawzoIHF6Rg89Ew--", "site_full": "www.freerepublic.com", "site": "freerepublic.com", "site_section": "http://www.freerepublic.com/tag/*/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest Articles", "title": "Bitcoin Plummets On Price Manipulation Investigation", "title_full": "Bitcoin Plummets On Price Manipulation Investigation", "published": "2018-05-24T17:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9817, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2218b23691c67b3bb1e71d8197b3ead11aab0b24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiT4VnKd3Fg5Gzs77Li_PLVEhfy9CQyOA.EVXtOOepT3xyHnQcIbXawzoIHF6Rg89Ew--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Safehaven.com", "published": "2018-05-24T17:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Plummets On Price Manipulation Investigation", "text": "Safehaven.com ^ | 24-05-2018 | Kern\nPosted on 05/24/2018 7:13:03 AM PDT by bananaman22\nReports that the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has launched a criminal probe into potential illegal manipulation of cryptocurrency prices has seen bitcoin lose 3 percent this morning, down to just over $7,300 in the early morning hours.\nThe DoJ, as reported by Bloomberg, is investigating illegal tactics of traders, including the issuing of fake orders for cryptocurrencies, causing their prices to go up and down artificially.\nIn cooperation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the DoJ is specifically probing what is commonly known in the trading world as spoofing and washing.
