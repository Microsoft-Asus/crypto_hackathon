NEW HAVEN, Conn. ( Project Syndicate ) — The cryptocurrency revolution, which started with bitcoin in 2009, claims to be inventing new kinds of money. There are now nearly 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and millions of people worldwide are excited by them. What accounts for this enthusiasm, which so far remains undampened by warnings that the revolution is a sham?\nOne must bear in mind that attempts to reinvent money have a long history.\nAs the sociologist Viviana Zelizer points out in her book “The Social Meaning of Money”: “Despite the commonsense idea that ‘a dollar is a dollar is a dollar,’ everywhere we look people are constantly creating different kinds of money.” Many of these innovations generate real excitement, at least for a while.\nAs the medium of exchange throughout the world, money, in its various embodiments, is rich in mystique. We tend to measure people’s value by it. It sums things up like nothing else.\nAnd yet it may consist of nothing more than pieces of paper that just go round and round in circles of spending. So its value depends on belief and trust in those pieces of paper. One might call it faith.\nEstablishing a new kind of money may be seen as a community’s avowal of faith in an idea, and an effort to inspire its realization. In his book “Euro Tragedy: A Drama in Nine Acts,” the economist Ashoka Mody argues that the true public justification for creating the European currency in 1992 was a kind of “groupthink,” a faith “embedded in people’s psyches” that “the mere existence of a single currency…would create the impetus for countries to come together in closer political embrace.”\nNew ideas for money seem to go with the territory of revolution, accompanied by a compelling, easily understood narrative. In 1827, Josiah Warner opened the “Cincinnati Time Store” that sold merchandise in units of hours of work, relying on “labor notes,” which resembled paper money. The new money was seen as a testament to the importance of working people, until he closed the store in 1830.\nTwo years later, Robert Owen, sometimes described as the father of socialism, attempted to establish in London the National Equitable Labour Exchange, relying on labor notes, or “time money,” as currency. Here, too, using time instead of gold or silver as a standard of value enforced the notion of the primacy of labor. But, like Warner’s time store, Owen’s experiment failed.\nLikewise, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels proposed that the central Communist premise — “Abolition of private property” — would be accompanied by a “Communistic abolition of buying and selling.”\nEliminating money, however, was impossible to do, and no Communist state ever did so. Instead, as the British Museum’s recent exhibit, “The Currency of Communism,” showed, they issued paper money with vivid symbols of the working class on it. They had to do something different with money.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, a radical movement, called Technocracy, associated with Columbia University, proposed to replace the gold-backed dollar with a measure of energy, the erg. In their book “The A B C of Technocracy,” published under the pseudonym Frank Arkright, they advanced the idea that putting the economy “on an energy basis” would overcome the unemployment problem. The Technocracy fad proved to be short-lived, though, after top scientists debunked the idea’s technical pretensions.\nBut the effort to dress up a half-baked idea in advanced science didn’t stop there.\nParallel with Technocracy, in 1932 the economist John Pease Norton, addressing the Econometric Society, proposed a dollar backed not by gold but by electricity.\nBut while Norton’s electric dollar received substantial attention, he had no good reason for choosing electricity over other commodities to back the dollar. At a time when most households in advanced countries had only recently been electrified, and electric devices from radios to refrigerators had entered homes, electricity evoked images of the most glamorous high science.\nBut, like Technocracy, the attempt to co-opt science backfired. Syndicated columnist Harry I. Phillips in 1933 saw in the electric dollar only fodder for comedy. “But it would be good fun getting an income tax blank and sending the government 300 volts,” he noted.\nNow we have something new again: bitcoin BTCUSD, -2.17% and other cryptocurrencies, which have spawned the initial coin offering (ICO). Issuers claim that ICOs are exempt from securities regulation, because they do not involve conventional money or confer ownership of profits. Investing in an ICO is thought of as an entirely new inspiration.\nEach of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.\nAnd, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work.\nThat mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.\nThis article has been published with permission of Project Syndicate — The Old Allure of New Money.\nCryptocurrencies taking us back to the Stone Age Blockchain is one of the most overhyped technologies ever", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cryptocurrencies-scientific-narrative-by-robert-j--shiller-2018-05", "https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eurotragedy-9780199351381?cc=us&lang=en&", "https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11007.html", "https://www.project-syndicate.org/", "https://data.flw.li/piwik/", "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/aug/14/british-museum-exhibition-communist-currencies-russian-revolution", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://books.google.com/books?id=v1zqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&dq=robert+owen+AND+%22time+money%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz0_PQ2ofbAhVktlkKHYstDzwQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=robert%20owen%20AND%20%22time%20money%22&f=false", "https://www.investing.com/crypto/currencies", "https://books.google.com/books?id=9hIsAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=equitable+commerce+and+warren&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX9JaG2YfbAhXtt1kKHb9fAM4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=equitable%20commerce%20and%20warren&f=false", "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61?msg=welcome_stranger"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "viviana zelizer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "conn.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T22:17:21.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cccb0cca9e500e5d9d0025acc4c56a987190cd03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pKI6c8kzbx_8h6vnCNIagqv8Dq3s6seQNfkotFBvQ6MEctoYYZgDnkOZX3pKo47nGV4IP6s9jRF4uCyJT8nmtljZ9j2srOCI_3mR3V7dKhoIKStkmyNme7DPl5TYRWNiWF2BaB7IFLLxaCHRrMQsE8bwEcymB_enqA--", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "How the Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency Community Lost Its Way, and How We Can Find It Again.", "title_full": "How the Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency Community Lost Its Way, and How We Can Find It Again.", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 16, "comments": 0, "shares": 16}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cccb0cca9e500e5d9d0025acc4c56a987190cd03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pKI6c8kzbx_8h6vnCNIagqv8Dq3s6seQNfkotFBvQ6MEctoYYZgDnkOZX3pKo47nGV4IP6s9jRF4uCyJT8nmtljZ9j2srOCI_3mR3V7dKhoIKStkmyNme7DPl5TYRWNiWF2BaB7IFLLxaCHRrMQsE8bwEcymB_enqA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How the Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency Community Lost Its Way, and How We Can Find It Again.", "text": "May 21 How the Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency Community Lost Its Way, and How We Can Find It Again. I begin with an allegory: In the Old Testament, Moses was the spiritual leader of the Israelites. According to scripture, he ascended Mount Sinai to speak with God, who gave him the 10 commandments. But when Moses did not soon return from the mountain, the people became anxious and impatient. Disoriented, they constructed their own idols (including a golden calf), invented their own rituals, and turned away from God and his teachings, with dire repercussions. The story of those starting with good intentions but inevitably losing their way repeats endlessly throughout history. And we’re no exception. The cryptocurrency community has already wandered far from the original ideals and vision held by the early (2009–2012) Bitcoin community. The Original Bitcoin Whitepaper Satoshi Nakamoto’s original paper, entitled Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System isn’t “scripture”, but it is a very powerful seminal document. Those that understand and espouse the Bitcoin whitepaper are commonly attacked with out-of-context arguments such as: You must be engaging in an appeal-to-authority fallacy. Technology evolves. You are dogmatically clinging to the past, unwilling to assimilate the latest information. Those attackers are usually missing the point on multiple levels. One of the Greatest Inventions of All Time Bitcoin is a monumental breakthrough of the highest order. The challenge of creating an electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party is one that has befuddled the world’s greatest computer scientists, cryptographers, and economists for decades. Like fire, or the wheel, you cannot really improve on the essence of a basic discovery. Some of the “improvements” to Bitcoin are as foolish and misguided as trying to improve the wheel by adding more angles, or improving fire by adding hot water. Granted, there is obviously a difference between the basic idea of the blockchain and the implementation details. But what’s really important here? What’s the essence? It boils down to one simple thing: Anyone can send money to anyone else in the world, quickly, cheaply, reliably, and without permission. This one function is a nuclear explosion of value to the world. Even positive advancements in blockchain technology are relatively insignificant upgrades when compared to the quantum leap achieved by Bitcoin itself. The Benefits of Bitcoin Bitcoin, (and I’m talking about the peer to peer electronic cash system described in the Satoshi whitepaper) is light-years beyond government issued fiat money. Governments can’t inflate it. Banks can’t confiscate it. Counterfeiters can’t copy it. Middlemen can’t exploit it, and thieves can’t burglarize it (if properly secured). It’s cheap, fast and easy to move, store, hide, and transfer… plus its scarce, durable, divisible, and requires no one’s permission to use. Bitcoin (BTC) vs. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) The Great Scaling Debate of 2013–2017 is a tiresome affair that concluded with Bitcoin (BTC) soft-forking to enable a complicated and controversial modification known as Segregated Witness (“SegWit”). The conclusion also birthed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) via a hard fork block size increase, a simple approach that was recommended by Satoshi and expected by the early bitcoin community. The BCH fork follows the Satoshi whitepaper much more closely but the BTC fork has the majority of hashpower and most accumulated Proof-of-Work. Bitcoin (BTC) has an artificially restricted capacity that only allows about 3–6 transactions per second, and has historically suffered from congested full blocks with out-of-control fees. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) now supports about 100 transactions per second — well above peak demand and comparable with PayPal. Thus, transactions on BCH are fast, cheap, and reliable. Lightning Network With a restricted capacity of 3–6 tx/sec, BTC cannot achieve widespread adoption, but its supporters hope to solve this problem with “second layer solutions” such the Lightning Network (LN). LN is currently difficult to use and is still in development. It is unclear when exactly it would be able to fulfill its scaling promises. But the timeline is just one concern. The real trouble with the Lightning Network is that it destroys the peer-to-peer, permissionless quality of Bitcoin. Why the BTC crew would take such a hardline stance against any blocksize increase is a mystery. Perhaps incompetence, perhaps malice, perhaps both. Just to put things in perspective, Bitcoin Cash currently allows 32MB blocks. The Gigablock testnet is attempting to run gigabyte blocks. The terab project claims that terabyte blocks are feasible both technically and economically, which is ONE MILLION times bigger than a megabyte. Bitcoin Core refused to increase to even 2MB and has put all their faith in the Lightning Network roadmap — an unproven, nascent ‘solution’ which appears to incontrovertibly compromise the best properties Bitcoin has to offer. The Larger Cryptoverse Most people are unaware of what’s really going on between BTC and BCH. But the problem is bigger than that. The early Bitcoin adopters were principled libertarians. Some have forgotten the original idea of Bitcoin, the great benefits, and just how awesome and world-changing it could be. Those who joined the community later invariably have little scope of understanding or care for such things. They are opportunists who came to ride bull trends and generate profits. There’s nothing wrong with chasing opportunities, but is it any surprise there’s so many lost noobs and low-value ICOs? Most projects have no legitimate need to create their own token. Moreover, there is little value in having 1000 different public blockchains. The value of Bitcoin and similar projects stems from having a network effect of a huge number of users. Inevitably, as in any market, there will be a few big winners. Fortunes will be won and lost. The successful speculators will be those that invest in solid projects. The hype driven bubble of 2017 is over. A Tale of Two Conferences Last week, Coingeek.com held a conference in Hong Kong called “bComm” (blockchain commerce). Bitcoin Cash was at the heart of it for nearly every speaker. No one can say with certainty that BCH will be a success. There is fierce competition from other blockchains. But our hat is in the ring. We recognize what Bitcoin has to offer… what it really means to have a peer to peer electronic cash system. We’re focused, passionate, and positive. We’re aggressively building the ecosystem and growing adoption. Contrast this to another conference that happened simultaneously in New York City: “Consensus 2018”. Reviewing the agenda , we find topics such as “how governments use the technology”, “the token economy”, “layer 2”, “blockchain governance”, “enterprise investments”, “financial infrastructure”, and “the wall street digital gold rush”. My impression? An uninspired blend of regulatory sycophants, institutional investors, and corporate opportunists… lost minions worshiping the golden calf. Bitcoin’s Ultimate Incentive Alignment One of the most incredible aspects of Bitcoin is that it aligns the intentions of opportunists with those who truly want to see a better world. If everyone uses Bitcoin, then both groups win. The world gets peer to peer sound money, and the price will go to the moon. So what happened? Well, the price did go to the moon in 2017. But it was mostly a speculative bubble. Actual usage plateaued, thanks to the blocksize limit. Meanwhile, other projects grew. Many aware of the situation profited by making alternative investments. They were all too happy to see Bitcoin stagnate and become less competitive. BTC has painted itself into a corner by refusing to scale the blockchain. If Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a true contender to become a globally used payment system, the same incentive structure arises again. Blockchain’s Killer App Is Still Money So what happens now? We as a community still haven’t capitalized on the original promise of Bitcoin. The “lie” is that we already have blockchain-based money and we now need to develop the next killer apps. Sure, anyone is free to use a blockchain like BCH, but the real benefits will only come when the user base is large. That would have happened with BTC had it been allowed to grow, but so far, this hasn’t happened yet with any coin. Like a modern day Tower of Babel, the cryptocurrency community has been splintered and scattered into 1000 blockchains. We can find our way to the promised land by re-uniting through a truly permissionless form of peer to peer electronic cash, perhaps BCH. Like what you read? Give Jonald Fyookball a round of applause.

Instead, the price of bitcoin dropped after the conference concluded and remained mostly unchanged versus last week’s closing price.\nNonetheless, the takeaways from Consensus were more positive than negative for the future of cryptocurrencies.\nUS regulators present at the Consensus 2018 conference made it clear that they want to sanitize the cryptocurrency space by formulating policies that would protect investors and boost growth in the nascent digital currency ecosystem.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Enforcement Division Cyber Unit chief Robert Cohen said at a panel discussion:\n“The SEC has been open about meeting with people from the industry, to come in and meet with the staff, to talk about the ideas you have, the new developments, and have a dialogue about the new technology. The commission encourages ways to raise capital; we don’t regulate the technology – we regulate the financial industry and the markets.”\nPositive news regarding cryptocurrency regulations also came out of Thailand, where ICOs have been legalized. Even in the European Union, where regulation is focusing on KYC/AML measures as opposed to curbing cryptocurrency-related activities, the French Finance Minister said that he wants to “make France the first place for blockchain & cryptocurrency innovation in Europe.”\nGiven that global cryptocurrency regulations have been cited as a major risk factor for asset valuations in 2018, investors will be happy to see more clarity coming for regulators around the world. Renewed EU KYC Enforcement May Reinforce Bitcoin Legitimacy\nThe EU has been at the forefront of creating a robust regulatory framework for the burgeoning crypto market with a lot of emphasis on Know your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. On May 14, 2018, the EU agreed to a renewed drive at enforcing KYC and AML compliance in the crypto market.\nAccording to the working group, robust KYC and AML regulations makes it difficult for criminal elements to use cryptos as a vehicle for perpetrating crimes or hiding the proceeds from the illicit activities. As a result, different segments of the market including exchange platforms and wallet providers must carry out the same identity verification processes as banks.\nVetting the identity of customers is also essential in the fight against terrorist organizations who might take advantage of anonymous cryptocurrency transactions to fund their nefarious activities. In fact, together with money laundering, terrorist funding is the primary worry of many governments in the crypto sphere. Swiss Authorities Consider Launching State-backed Cryptocurrency\nAccording to Reuters , the Swiss Federal Council has solicited a report that states the perils and scope of developing a native cryptocurrency. They have reportedly decided to term it as “e-franc,” an amalgamation of electronic francs – Switzerland’s currency.\nIn the government’s words, the only difference between the e-franc and bitcoin would be that of being backed by the state as a legal tender opposed to being “privately-backed.” Regardless, the underlying technology shall remain that of a publically-viewable blockchain .\nIt now remains for the Swiss parliament’s lower house to take a call on whether to support the Federal Council’s request for a report on the topic.\nThe development comes after a warning issued by Switzerland’s Bank of International Settlement ( BIS ) in March 2018 which appealed central banks to strongly consider prospective risks involved with introducing their own cryptocurrency. French Finance Minister is Seized by Sudden Passion For Cryptocurrency\nBruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister since May 2017, has publicly stated that he has obtained a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency sector and blockchain technology.\nIn an interview with Alex Stachtchenko , the co-founder of Blockchain Partner and La Chaintech, two blockchain associations based in France, Le Maire said: “I was a rookie a year ago, but now, I’ve been seized by a sudden passion. It took me a year. Let’s teach this knowledge to our fellow citizen to make France the first place for blockchain & cryptocurrency innovation in Europe.” Advertisement advertisement\nAs BTCManager reported in April 2018, the French government officially declared cryptocurrency as movable property , decreasing the tax rate on cryptocurrency sales from 45 percent to 19 percent. That means, before April 26, when France’s Council of State officially modified the tax rate, the government charged 45 percent on the sale of bitcoin . Legally, the government had the right to chase after investors who have purchased bitcoin and request 45 a percent tax outright.\nPerhaps due to the influence of Le Maire, the French government also announced that it had begun the development phase of various regulatory frameworks that will ease pressure placed upon cryptocurrency startups. Bitcoin Uses 0.5 Percent of World’s Energy Supply, Says Peer-Reviewed Report\nBitcoin ’s energy usage has long been a subject of criticism since the issues first came to light. But, most of the revelations are limited to anecdotal evidence or weakly researched primary reports, with future predictions based on such data. To combat the epistemic crisis, a recent peer-reviewed research paper breaks the unresearched monotony, and the evaluated results are nothing short of shocking.\nOn May 16, 2018, financial analyst and blockchain evangelist Alex de Vries published “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem” on Joule, a research publication, to apprise the world of Bitcoin’s troubling energy usage.\nUtilizing complex monetary models, de Vries combined his calculations with average power costs and publically available bitcoin mining data. His primary aim was to release a foundational study for the world’s organizations and individuals on which to base their Bitcoin studies.\nAs per de Vries, the lowest prerequisite wattage to run a mining rig in 2018 is 2.55 gigawatts, which equals the overall power demand of the world’s 118th largest nation, Ireland. Likewise, the researcher states that this sum is equivalent to half a percent of the world’s aggregate power use.\nIf Bitcoin mining goes on at the same rate, the report predicts its energy usage could measure up to that of the whole of Austria by the end of 2018, utilizing 7.7 gigawatts. Moreover, every Bitcoin transaction uses enough energy to power a home in the Netherlands for a month. Thailand Successfully Regulates Cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings\nBack in February 2018, BTCManager reported that Thai authorities were on the verge of legalizing initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) in the Asian nation, in a manner that would encourage innovation, while protecting investors optimally.\n“The SEC Thailand encourages access to funding for businesses, including high potential tech startups, and realizes the potential of ICO in answering startups’ funding needs. In cases where an ICO constitutes an offering of securities, the issuer will need to comply with applicable regulatory requirements under the SEC Thailand’s purview,” the SEC declared.\nAccording to the Bangkok Post , the royal decree for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, a 100-section law, was published in the nation’s Royal Gazette on May 13, 2018.\nAs per the Bangkok Post , the latest regulation defines cryptocurrency as digital assets and digital tokens, as such, they must come under the purview of Thailand’s Security Exchange Commission ( SEC ). With this latest development, all crypto-related businesses are required to register with the SEC within 90 days or face legislative consequences. Ripple’s Announces Launch of XRP Fund: Creates an Actual Use Case for Token\nOn May 14, 2018, Ripple announced Xpring, an initiative that would invest, incubate, acquire, campaign, and provide grants to blockchain and cryptocurrency firms. Under Xpring, selected entrepreneurs would utilize XRP, Ripple ’s native token, and XRP ledger, an open-sourced and decentralized ledger, to build innovative products for solving customers’ problems.\nEnumerating on their reason to launch Xpring, Ripple claims to have been approached by many entrepreneurs who sought technical support, due to the former’s understanding of the XRP ledger. Furthermore, Ripple added they are “among the few blockchain companies with traction to a non-speculative function,” hence well-equipped for the role of an incubator. CME Announces Launch of Two Ethereum-focused Indices\nAccording to an official press release , the world’s largest futures operator said that it would provide “a daily benchmark price in U.S. dollars,” in addition to collating data (calculated by UK-based Crypto Facilities ) from crypto-exchanges Kraken and Bitstamp to determine real-time prices. This data would be based on transactions and order book activity of the world’s second-largest digital currency by market cap.\nThe two launched indices are the CME CF-Dollar Reference Rate, which would close daily prices at 3 PM (UTC), and the CME CF Ether-Dollar Real-Time Index. UK-based exchange Crypto Facilities calculates the price of both indices. While the real-time value of ETH is already online on CME’s website, the necessary market data shall be processed starting June 4, 2018.\nSpeaking about the development, Tim McCourt, CME Group managing director and global head of equity products and alternative investments, said in a statement:\n“The Ether Reference Rate and Real Time Index are designed to meet the evolving needs of this marketplace.

Picture taken\nBy Alun John and Jennifer Hughes\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China.

These type of funds are legal under Law 22/2014, and investments can be made through three types of legal entities.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space\nFunds Directly Investing in Cryptocurrencies\nSpain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV – Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores) recently clarified its position on registered funds investing in cryptocurrencies directly. The CNMV is the Spanish government agency responsible for regulating the securities markets.\nIn a Questions and Answers document addressed to fintech companies on activities and services that can have a relationship with the Commission, one of the questions was “Can a fund registered by the CNMV directly invest in cryptocurrencies?” The Commission replied:\nThis type of funds would have a legal place in Law 22/2014, which regulates, in addition to venture capital entities, other collective investment entities of closed type and their management entities.\nLaw 22/2014 establishes, among others, closed-end collective investment entities (EICC), closed-end investment funds (FICC), and closed-end investment companies (SICC), Iclg describes.\nEICC, FICC, or SICC\nThe CNMV explained that the investments could be made through EICC, FICC, or SICC.\nCNMV building.\nFor EICC, Article 2.1 of the above law mandates that “the divestment policy of its participants or partners” must meet two requirements. Firstly, the fund’s “disinvestments [must] occur simultaneously for all investors or participants,” the Commission detailed. Secondly, “what is received by each investor or participant is based on the rights that correspond to each one of them, according to the established terms in its bylaws or regulations for each class of shares or participations.”\nBoth FICC and SICC have their own “numerous requirements and conditions,” the CNMV noted. For example, an FICC registered with the Commission must be “managed by a management company of closed-end type collective investment entities (SGEIC) or by a collective investment institution management company (SGIIC) that is authorized to manage this type of funds.” The Commission also noted that “the FICC and the SICC are not subject to the supervision of the CNMV (except [for] self-managed SICC)” based on the provisions of article 85 of Law 22/2014.\nWhile registered funds can theoretically invest in cryptocurrencies directly, the Commission emphasized that there are many factors to consider, reiterating:\nThe investment of FICC and SICC in cryptocurrencies raises a series of practical problems on how to comply with the regulations regarding the valuation of assets, the management of liquidity and the custody guarantee.\nEuropean Regulation\nEuropa Press reported earlier this month that the CNMV “will apply [its] securities regulations to cryptocurrencies until there is European regulation.” The news outlet quoted CNMV’s general director of Strategic Policy and International Affairs, Víctor Rodríguez, saying:\nThe approach adopted by the CNMV is to try to apply the existing securities regulations as long as we do not have an international or European reference standard.\nWhat do you think of the CNMV’s approach to cryptocurrencies?

Shiller: ‘No One Can Explain How Cryptocurrencies Work’\nWriting in a new blog posted today, the Yale professor and Nobel-winning economist wrote that enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency market remains strong despite warnings that it could be a scam. ‘One must bear in mind that attempts to reinvent money have a long history,’ he said. Yet, while new monetary innovations create excitement to begin with, they fail to last, he added.\nAs an example he cited Josiah Warner, who in 1827 opened the ‘Cincinnati Time Store’ that sold merchandise in units of hours of work. These relied on labour notes, which resembled paper money; however, while they were considered a sign of importance of working people, the store closed in 1830.\nUndeterred by Warner’s failure, two years later Robert Owen attempted to create the National Equitable Labour Exchange in London. This relied on ‘time money’ as a currency. Yet, similar to Warner’s attempts Owen’s experiment failed as well, Shiller pointed out.\nA hundred years later, during the Great Depression, economist John Pease Norton proposed a dollar backed not by gold, but by electricity. Notably, though, this too failed to catch on.\n“Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story,” wrote Shiller. “But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.”\nIn his opinion, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are no different, adding:\n“The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\nHe goes on to state that similar to past failed currencies, ‘the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery.’\n“Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work,” he said.” That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.”\nThis is certainly not the first time that Shiller has spoken out against the cryptocurrency market. Last October, he called bitcoin a ‘ fad ,’ as he commented on the ‘strange enthusiasm’ for the currency. Earlier this year, he was reported as being conflicted on bitcoin and wasn’t sure whether it would fail or succeed. He’s also said bitcoin is a bubble and that it only attracts investors because it is a good story. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Picture taken\nBy Alun John and Jennifer Hughes\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price.

The San Francisco-based crypto platform is reported to have held talks with banking industry regulators about a possible entrance into the mainstream financial services industry, a move that would allow Coinbase to diversify its product offerings and steer clear of the murky state of regulation in the crypto industry. THE BENEFITS AND THE COSTS\nQuoting a source familiar with the matter, the WSJ reported on May 18 that Coinbase had met with officials from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) earlier this year. The OCC is an independent department of the US Department of the Treasury which regulates national banks. It is charged with safeguarding the soundness of the national banking system.\nThe discussion centered around the possibility of Coinbase acquiring a banking license and its implications for the company, but other issues were discussed too. While crypto exchanges have faced much scrutiny from the SEC, the CFTC and other regulators, Coinbase would be under even more scrutiny if it acquired a banking charter. That’s because the charter would put Coinbase squarely in the crosshairs of a single regulator.\nThe charter would also enable the company to diversify its products and bypass all its bank partnerships, serving customers directly instead. The benefits would also include the ability to welcome institutional investors such as hedge funds, which could invest huge amounts of money and push the platform miles ahead of its competitors. This would align with its recent announcement regarding the launch of a suite of products that target institutional investors. These products, which include Coinbase Custody and Coinbase Markets, are offered in partnership with an “SEC-regulated broker-dealer.”\nNot everything would be rosy for Coinbase, however, as a banking charter would subject the company to tougher regulations and a whole new set of rules. The company might have to do a complete overhaul of its business model, bring in new people, and apply more stringent measures going forward. COINBASE IS NOT ALONE\nCoinbase hasn’t been the only crypto-related business to have held meetings regarding acquiring a banking license. Ivy Koins LLC, a payments platform that deals in both fiat and digital currencies, has also held talks with regulators, according to the WSJ. Ivy Koins has been working with banks and other financial institutions yet, according to its president, has no immediate intention of applying for a banking license.\nIvy Koins describes its meetings with regulators as pleasant and informative, and encourages other crypto-based startups to do the same. The meeting covered the startup’s business model, the risks and challenges ahead, and how best to steer clear of trouble.\nCoinbase has not confirmed the meeting or divulged any further information. A spokesperson for the company said the firm is committed to cooperating with state and federal regulators to ensure the site is properly licensed to perform the services it offers. The OCC declined to comment on the same.\nCoinbase has taken aggressive measures in the recent past to compete with other elite platforms. With many people regarding it as ‘the beginner’s exchange’, it has sought to upgrade its image by launching products that target institutional investors such as block trading. It has also announced an expansion plan that will see it open an operation in Chicago to take advantage of growing crypto interest in the city which hosts both CME Group and Cboe Global Markets.

But one cryptocurrency that has been persistent during this market crisis is Bitcoin Cash. Many investors and tech geeks are expecting a technological advancement in the system of Bitcoin Cash as another hard fork approaches in the network.\nThe Bitcoin Cash investors are a bit worried about their investment but it can be safely said that the engineers are investing their hard work and resources to make it happen. According to the latest news, Bitcoin Cash has announced an increase in the block size up to 32 MB, and such advancements are expected in the coming time. This increased block size allows the transaction to be achieved at an inexpensive and consistent transaction fee.\nThere has also been an increase in demand for Bitcoin Cash in the market and is also proven beneficial from a business perspective. The last three months of data show significant growth in the price in Bitcoin along with the price in USD and the market capital of Bitcoin Cash. The current market capital of Bitcoin Cash is over $18 billion USD which puts it in the fourth place in the top ten cryptocurrencies in the world. Here are few reasons that will justify why Bitcoin Cash is going to be successful.\nLatest upgrade\nThe latest upgrade that has got people talking is the increase in the size of the block which has gone from 8MB to 32MB. This has investors relieved because of the inexpensive and faster transaction that Bitcoin Cash will bestow. It has also attracted new investors and is believed to move up in the charts of top ten cryptocurrencies. The development of new upgrades is done in a decentralized environment where multiple teams of developers work together to provide efficient software solutions.\nArchitecture and support\nBitcoin Cash as a cryptocurrency is compatible with many tools and technologies that are required by the users. It has gained the support of major online cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitstamp, Coinbase, Evonax, Kraken, etc. This means that you can perform an O nline Bitcoin Exchange with the help of such platforms. Bitcoin Cash is also supported by a long line of common crypto coin wallets such as Ledger, Edge, Jaxx, Bread, Stash, Trezor, etc.\nA loyal community\nIt is really important for a cryptocurrency to have a loyal and passionate community to sustain in this cut-throat competition. Bitcoin Cash a huge audience base that is loyal because of its ease of transaction. There are even many Bitcoin supporters who are interested in the capabilities of Bitcoin Cash and are investing in it collaterally along with Bitcoin. This has opened a new opportunity for Bitcoin Cash to provide them efficient software solutions that Bitcoin was unable to provide.\nInexpensive transaction fees\nThe transaction fee for Bitcoin Cash is less than other major blockchain networks and, after the 32MB block upgrade, the transaction has become much faster. This has given Bitcoin Cash users and investors a new medium to transfer cash at a large distance. The Bitcoin average transaction fee is $1.76 as of May 2018 whereas the transaction fee of Bitcoin cash is $0.0934 which is comparative low.\nThe real blockchain vision\nThe founder of blockchain and Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, had a vision for cryptocurrency and the standards that it should uphold. Bitcoin Cash is designed and developed according to this vision which is shored up by the developers. Satoshi’s vision will make sure that the services of cryptocurrency and blockchain are accessible to everyone. Even the small-scale investors and miners can easily gain access to Bitcoin Cash.\nThese factors together justify the position of Bitcoin Cash in the top cryptocurrency list. It uses a strong SHA-256 Proof-of-Work algorithm which remains robust. It is now widely recognized as the cryptocurrency that is destined to succeed. Satoshi once stated that after twenty years there will be a large volume of crypto-coin transactions or there will be nothing at all. Even halfway down the road, the market of cryptocurrency does not seem to be slowing down.

Published 3:31 PM ET Mon, 21 May 2018 Updated 21 Hours Ago Ramin Talale | Bloomberg | Getty Images Robert Shiller\nCryptocurrencies mirror some of the most famous failed currency experiments throughout history, according to Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller.\nEnthusiasm around the thousands of existing cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin , remains strong despite warnings from investors such as Warren Buffett that they're worthless. That mania and attempts to launch new units of money have existed in different forms since the 1800s, Shiller said.\nShiller, best known for warning about the housing and dot-com bubbles, pointed to the early 19th century, when merchants tried to replace the gold standard with \"time money.\" The \"Cincinnati Time Store\" for example sold merchandise in units of work and closed just three years after it launched. One hundred years later during the Great Depression, economist John Pease Norton proposed a dollar by electricity, which also failed to catch on. show chapters 10:10 AM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 01:56\n\"Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story,\" Shiller wrote in a blog post Monday. \"But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.\"\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are no different, he said. They were introduced by a community of entrepreneurs who, as Shiller put it, \"hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.\"\nThe mania around bitcoin today is also due in part to its mystery, the Yale University professor said.\n\"Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal,\" Shiller said. \"None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.\"\nThe height of the public's fascination was also undoubtedly tied to bitcoin's meteoric rise in price. The world's first cryptocurrency rose to near $20,000 last year before losing roughly half of its value in the first quarter of 2018.\nHere is the full post by Shiller.

I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.”\nThe head of the Vanguard Investment Strategy Group argues that bitcoin does not meet the criteria of a currency — which its creator(s) and proponents believe it to be — saying it’s a dubious medium of exchange and its excessive volatility does not make it a suitable store of value.\nRead: Bitcoin bull argues for rally to $20,000\nDavis, who works for the largest mutual-fund provider and second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds, said bitcoin doesn’t stack up as a traditional investment. “Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices,” wrote Davis.\nHe added that by adding bitcoin to a portfolio, you would have to reduce a “tried and true asset class.”\nWhile supporters of bitcoin and other digital assets see the technology as an alternative to central banks, Davis said bitcoin is not a true threat to them, arguing that there’s a good chance central banks will eventually adopt their own digital currencies, and will have the upper hand because they impose the regulations on exchanges.\nLike many cryptocurrency naysayers, Davis was more positive on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but said the two do not go hand-in-hand like some argue.\n“Although cryptocurrencies are built using a blockchain, they are not necessarily tied to the value of blockchain applications that may improve the cost, speed and security of executing transactions or contracts,” wrote Davis.\n“Bitcoin is an investment in blockchain in the same way that Pets.com was an investment in the internet.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.etf.com/sections/etf-industry-perspective/vanguard-bitcoin-presents-quandary?EXCMPGN=EX:PC:FAS:Sustaining", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard group", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vanguard investment strategy group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T03:22:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d3e89d73fbebe971770dda9cc90790a4387213e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTknsVNTRYd5eutapDiPxfMgeV_EFcCKBfVmEo_RVl6r4PQukR2mubPZpalwqnsdvSPwjZdgcskJIamB92rweG14x9Lh4fOzpoXHszgPiotHaMh3Ez2yh0ByXoJGBiv3g4-", "site_full": "ethereumworldnews.com", "site": "ethereumworldnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Over 1000 Bitcoins Seized in Israeli Fraud and Money Laundering Case | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Over 1000 Bitcoins Seized in Israeli Fraud and Money Laundering Case | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.795, "main_image": "https://ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoinmining.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d3e89d73fbebe971770dda9cc90790a4387213e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTknsVNTRYd5eutapDiPxfMgeV_EFcCKBfVmEo_RVl6r4PQukR2mubPZpalwqnsdvSPwjZdgcskJIamB92rweG14x9Lh4fOzpoXHszgPiotHaMh3Ez2yh0ByXoJGBiv3g4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Over 1000 Bitcoins Seized in Israeli Fraud and Money Laundering Case | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "6 days ago | 552 shares About\nBitcoin Insight aggregates the latest stories, tweets and videos about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain.

But one cryptocurrency that has been persistent during this market crisis is Bitcoin Cash. Many investors and tech geeks are expecting a technological advancement in the system of Bitcoin Cash as another hard fork approaches in the network.\nThe Bitcoin Cash investors are a bit worried about their investment but it can be safely said that the engineers are investing their hard work and resources to make it happen. According to the latest news, Bitcoin Cash has announced an increase in the block size up to 32 MB, and such advancements are expected in the coming time. This increased block size allows the transaction to be achieved at an inexpensive and consistent transaction fee.\nThere has also been an increase in demand for Bitcoin Cash in the market and is also proven beneficial from a business perspective. The last three months of data show significant growth in the price in Bitcoin along with the price in USD and the market capital of Bitcoin Cash. The current market capital of Bitcoin Cash is over $18 billion USD which puts it in the fourth place in the top ten cryptocurrencies in the world. Here are few reasons that will justify why Bitcoin Cash is going to be successful.\nLatest upgrade\nThe latest upgrade that has got people talking is the increase in the size of the block which has gone from 8MB to 32MB. This has investors relieved because of the inexpensive and faster transaction that Bitcoin Cash will bestow. It has also attracted new investors and is believed to move up in the charts of top ten cryptocurrencies. The development of new upgrades is done in a decentralized environment where multiple teams of developers work together to provide efficient software solutions.\nArchitecture and support\nBitcoin Cash as a cryptocurrency is compatible with many tools and technologies that are required by the users. It has gained the support of major online cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitstamp, Coinbase, Evonax, Kraken, etc. This means that you can perform an O nline Bitcoin Exchange with the help of such platforms. Bitcoin Cash is also supported by a long line of common crypto coin wallets such as Ledger, Edge, Jaxx, Bread, Stash, Trezor, etc.\nA loyal community\nIt is really important for a cryptocurrency to have a loyal and passionate community to sustain in this cut-throat competition. Bitcoin Cash a huge audience base that is loyal because of its ease of transaction. There are even many Bitcoin supporters who are interested in the capabilities of Bitcoin Cash and are investing in it collaterally along with Bitcoin. This has opened a new opportunity for Bitcoin Cash to provide them efficient software solutions that Bitcoin was unable to provide.\nInexpensive transaction fees\nThe transaction fee for Bitcoin Cash is less than other major blockchain networks and, after the 32MB block upgrade, the transaction has become much faster. This has given Bitcoin Cash users and investors a new medium to transfer cash at a large distance. The Bitcoin average transaction fee is $1.76 as of May 2018 whereas the transaction fee of Bitcoin cash is $0.0934 which is comparative low.\nThe real blockchain vision\nThe founder of blockchain and Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, had a vision for cryptocurrency and the standards that it should uphold. Bitcoin Cash is designed and developed according to this vision which is shored up by the developers. Satoshi’s vision will make sure that the services of cryptocurrency and blockchain are accessible to everyone. Even the small-scale investors and miners can easily gain access to Bitcoin Cash.\nThese factors together justify the position of Bitcoin Cash in the top cryptocurrency list.

As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future.\nSauter and McGill are also participating lawyers in the Digital Currency & Ledger Defense Coalition (DCLDC), a coalition of lawyers and academics whose collaborated effort focuses on understanding the regulatory and legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to protect individual constitutional rights and civil liberties in connection with regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny.\nFor a large financial institution such as ICE or Goldman Sachs, figuring out how to develop a cryptocurrency trading platform is a potentially complicated analysis that begins with the question of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. If a cryptocurrency is deemed a security by the Howey test, “there are a lot more regulatory requirements,” according to McGill.\nWhile many people agree, including Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at the Coin Center, that the Howey test can act as the ultimate clarifier of which cryptocurrency is a security and which is not; the distinction is also important for another reason. Ultimately, the Howey test gives guidance in which regulatory agency polices which cryptocurrency. At this point, securities fall under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. Non-security cryptocurrencies — or commodities until proven otherwise — are in the realm of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While this is obvious to anyone who can remember each agency’s full name, the distinction is also important because each agency has taken a different approach to policing cryptocurrency.\nThe SEC has gone after what McGill called “low-hanging fruit.” These are the “pump-and-dump” ICOs that are scams or otherwise illegitimate in their offerings to investors. And, at least with ICOs, both agencies appeared to be on the same page in January 2018. More recently, the SEC has created a fake ICO. The token, aptly named HoweyCoin, is being used as a way to demonstrate potential signs of fraud in ICOs to cryptocurrency investors.\nOutside of the SEC’s scam scrubbing, Sauter and McGill have also seen regulator behavior that is not exactly encouraging for private sector participants:\n“The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) say they want to have an active dialogue with industry participants to understand the latest trends and developments. Unfortunately, we see a lot of regulators initiating those conversations with industry players by way of subpoena. Whenever you receive a subpoena from a regulator, you have to be concerned that it could be a lead-in to an enforcement action. This dynamic doesn’t exactly promote a free and healthy exchange of ideas,” said McGill. CFTC: The Prevailing Bitcoin Regulator?\nIn late April, SEC Chairman Clayton said bitcoin is not a security. According to both McGill and Sauter, because bitcoin will not likely be classified as a security, larger financial institutions like CME, CBOE, Goldman Sachs and now ICE are able to move forward with giving their clients exposure.\nNot being a security also means that the CFTC is the federal agency that most often acts as a watchdog over bitcoin transactions. But it is also not the only one. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has become involved in some bitcoin futures trading in pursuit of acts of perjury and obstruction of justice.\nEven if it is the prevailing regulator, how the CFTC will handle bad actors and fraud in bitcoin transactions is still up for debate. In the last year, there have been more aggressive actions such as CFTC v. McDonnell (CabbageTech) and, outside of cryptocurrencies, the CFTC’s prerogative to cut down on fraud and market manipulation (Monex). This could be evidence that there will likely be a crackdown on certain types of short-term trading behavior.\n“An underlying concern of the CFTC is that there are a number of people who can fairly easily impact prices with their trading. It makes it very difficult to regulate markets,” said Sauter, “but innovation is happening in futures and derivatives markets.”\nSpeaking toward how Bitcoin law will develop in the U.S., Sauter stated that industry cases which reach the court of appeals will be the ones that will ultimately shape U.S. regulation by either correcting case decision errors or clarifying and interpreting the law itself. Contract Swaps Aren’t New or Unregulated\nIf reports that ICE is considering using a model of trading bitcoin with swap contracts, this type of trading would remain under the regulatory realm of the CFTC. Furthermore, it would also decrease transaction speed.\nSwaps are a type of derivative contract where two parties trade based on a notional principal amount. Generally, one of these amounts is fixed while the other is variable, commonly based on an interest rate, floating currency exchange rate or index price. Swaps do not normally trade on exchanges but instead are over-the-counter contracts between different organizations. Sauter and McGill suggested that ICE would likely use an interest rate swap, though they are most likely still figuring out what they will pin bitcoin prices to.\n“Using the swap mechanism allows ICE to position themselves squarely under CFTC regulations, but getting that regulatory certainty looks like it will come at the cost of speed,” said McGill. “One of the ideas behind bitcoin and other digital currencies that made them so attractive as a concept was the idea that market participants could securely transact with one another almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. But, if you have to create a swap product with a one-day settlement period to get regulatory clarity, then you lose a lot of what made digital currencies attractive in the first place.”\n“Bitcoin swaps aren’t entirely novel, either,” pointed out Sauter.\nTeraExchange began offering Bitcoin-based swaps in 2014. And, since launching its derivatives swap option in October 2017 after CFTC approval, LedgerX is reported to have increased their trading volume sevenfold.\nSauter stated that one reason why regulators have not moved more quickly to establish clear law around Bitcoin is that there still remains debate and uncertainty about regulators, the CFTC in particular, to police the markets.\n“One way regulators and institutional players are dealing with this is to move trading to regulated derivatives markets, be it swaps, futures or options,” said Sauter. “When that happens, the CFTC has a much more direct line of access to the markets and market participants. That’s part of the reason why we’re seeing such innovation happening in the derivatives markets.”\nAnother reason Sauter proposes for the interest in Bitcoin derivatives is that they are a much easier route by which big financial institution players can get involved. “Institutional investors often have strict requirements concerning the types of markets and products they can trade, and they tend to like the idea of trading in markets that they know are being policed and that offer remedies in the event problems arise.” How Decentralized Proprietary Trading Could Be Affected\nThe implications of the rise in bitcoin-based swap contracts also means that the instantaneous transaction, so highly placed in the early value of bitcoin, might be a thing of the past for more mainstream investors to gain less-risky exposure. However, as McGill pointed out, “A lot of that early speed and eliminating transaction fees comes at the cost of added risk.”\nIt can be assumed that any cryptocurrency trader that is familiar with Mt. Gox is well aware of the risks associated with trading on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. Still, for some, the risks are worth it.\n“Some of this will just be decided by the market,” said Sauter. “Plenty of investors are weighing the risk of maybe not getting their money back when they need to unwind a trade. Traders who don’t want to deal with this will opt-into these trading platforms run by accredited institutional investors.”\n“There’s clearly more risk in operating on less regulated and decentralized exchanges,” said McGill. “There may well be more lucrative opportunities as well, but there are all sorts of risks — including insider fraud — that a lot of traders want to avoid.”\nBy this estimation, bitcoin futures have brought the attention of regulators and that will inevitably alter the current space, whether making it more regulated or diversified remains to be seen.\n“CME bitcoin futures acted as the canary in the coal mine. From a regulatory perspective, it will be interesting to see if some of the fast-and-loose trading techniques that were being deployed on the nascent cryptocurrency exchanges carry over to the more mature and tightly regulated markets operated by CME and ICE,” said McGill. “Certainly, you’re going to get more players in the mix, and that alone will probably translate into more enforcement activity by CME and government regulators.”\nWeighing the risks of unregulated and decentralized exchanges draws back to the fundamental conflict that has been revolving around the cryptocurrency space since the Bitcoin white paper was first issued.\nWill bitcoin remain truly decentralized or will the desire to hedge against risk lead the majority of traders to accredited and regulated institutions? For many who are invested in bitcoin, not just for profit, but also ideological reasons, the answer appears obvious. Yet whether these Bitcoiners are early adopters of a movement or no more than fringe factions will be decided by the market. It would appear that less regulated and decentralized exchanges still need to develop strategies to match the greater security legacy financial institutions are championing to bring to cryptocurrency.\n“From a regulatory point of view, the idea of decentralized exchanges pose some interesting jurisdictional questions,” said McGill. “Ultimately, U.S. regulators tend to be less concerned about physical location and more focused on whether the activity interacts with and impacts U.S. commerce. I don’t think the notion of decentralizing an exchange will translate to immunity from regulators, but it has the potential to create a lot of headaches for regulators.”\nAnother factor in ICE and other legacy institutions hopping into bitcoin trading is an increase in the space’s technological innovation brought by increased competition.\n“Now you’re going to have the most sophisticated trading companies in the world trading in these products at an algorithmic level, which will substantially increase the volume of trading activity,” said McGill.\n“You’re going to get more players in the mix and probably many of those will have less regulatory experience and perhaps as a result more enforcement cases,” said Sauter. On New Competition and Shorting\nThough the involvement for big U.S.-based financial players will certainly affect the market, established cryptocurrency exchanges are optimistic about the future.\nTendai Musakwa, director of marketing at the Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange, BTCC, believes that exchanges like BTCC “will remain the go-to cryptocurrency market for retail clients for the foreseeable future.”\n“We specifically designed our USD exchange to be accessible, drawing on our seven years’ experience operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange to create an effortless crypto trading experience. “\nMusakwa also pointed out that many legacy financial exchanges will have “high barriers of entry and inaccessible or confusing user interfaces.” Citing “real-person 24/7 customer support and deposit options such as credit cards,” he believes that cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to create value that institutional exchanges are unable to offer. “In addition, legacy fiat exchanges are geographically bound, while exchanges like BTCC offer customers worldwide easy access to BTC/USD trading.”\nAdded to this, Sauter attested that there are still many more regulatory hurdles for institutional exchanges — many of which have not yet been created. For instance, “even if an exchange is authorized, investment companies and broker dealers and issuers of ICOs must become accredited before they can move forward.”\nThe ICE has also indicated that plans for such a platform could dissolve at anytime based on the unregulated changes in cryptocurrency market. Another institutional player, CEO of Nasdaq Adena Friedman told CNBC that Nasdaq would be open for bitcoin trading when “people are ready for a more regulated market.”\n“It’s going to be a more balanced marketplace going forward,” stated McGill. “It would be a shame that, in the process, a lot of what has drawn people into cryptocurrency could be lost in the shuffle due to new regulation.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine.

Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are non-productive assets similar to gold. So anyone buying it is betting that someone else will pay more for it later. Berkshire Vice-Chairman Charlie Munger said buying bitcoin with the hope that someone else will outbid you later is a bad business. Talking about Amazon and Google at Berkshire’s annual general meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett said, \"I made the wrong decision on Google and Amazon.”“We've certainly looked that them... the truth is, I've watched Amazon from the start and what Jeff Bezos has done is something close to a miracle. If I think something is a miracle, I tend not to bet on it. Bill Gates told me early on (to look at) Google,” he said. \"I'll miss a lot of things that I don’t feel I understand well enough, and there is no penalty in investing if you don’t swing at a ball that’s in the strike zone, as long as you swing at something at some point...

Shiller: ‘No One Can Explain How Cryptocurrencies Work’\nWriting in a new blog posted today, the Yale professor and Nobel-winning economist wrote that enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency market remains strong despite warnings that it could be a scam. ‘One must bear in mind that attempts to reinvent money have a long history,’ he said. Yet, while new monetary innovations create excitement to begin with, they fail to last, he added.\nAs an example he cited Josiah Warner, who in 1827 opened the ‘Cincinnati Time Store’ that sold merchandise in units of hours of work. These relied on labour notes, which resembled paper money; however, while they were considered a sign of importance of working people, the store closed in 1830.\nUndeterred by Warner’s failure, two years later Robert Owen attempted to create the National Equitable Labour Exchange in London. This relied on ‘time money’ as a currency. Yet, similar to Warner’s attempts Owen’s experiment failed as well, Shiller pointed out.\nA hundred years later, during the Great Depression, economist John Pease Norton proposed a dollar backed not by gold, but by electricity. Notably, though, this too failed to catch on.\n“Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story,” wrote Shiller. “But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.”\nIn his opinion, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are no different, adding:\n“The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\nHe goes on to state that similar to past failed currencies, ‘the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery.’\n“Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work,” he said.” That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.”\nThis is certainly not the first time that Shiller has spoken out against the cryptocurrency market. Last October, he called bitcoin a ‘ fad ,’ as he commented on the ‘strange enthusiasm’ for the currency. Earlier this year, he was reported as being conflicted on bitcoin and wasn’t sure whether it would fail or succeed. He’s also said bitcoin is a bubble and that it only attracts investors because it is a good story. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Picture taken\nBy Alun John and Jennifer Hughes\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.\n\"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalization of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favored for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n\"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n\"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.\n(Reporting by Alun John and Jennifer Hughes; additional reporting by Sijia Jiang and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by Gerry Doyle) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alun john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T08:12:44.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b521d2344ecf7b262983bc5346445485b5b11b4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVqXgEvCFThWTFlmdljZEXmkLxC7290lA5yZAtT2rKB1_UM8jHrhTvsZ2iRHDeR.X2RwvKCK8lNayO95QNfgZQOQ6qSP6KQ51r", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Poland Backpedals on “Irrational” Crypto Tax After Strong Backlash - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Poland Backpedals on “Irrational” Crypto Tax After Strong Backlash - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.963, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_704626399_1600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b521d2344ecf7b262983bc5346445485b5b11b4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVqXgEvCFThWTFlmdljZEXmkLxC7290lA5yZAtT2rKB1_UM8jHrhTvsZ2iRHDeR.X2RwvKCK8lNayO95QNfgZQOQ6qSP6KQ51r", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lubomir Tassev", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Poland Backpedals on “Irrational” Crypto Tax After Strong Backlash - Bitcoin News", "text": "823 Poland Backpedals on “Irrational” Crypto Tax After Strong Backlash\nAuthorities in Poland have realized how inapplicable their decision to tax all crypto transactions really is. A high-ranking official from the Finance Ministry said in an interview that his department “accepts the irrational effect” of the tax it wanted to levy on every purchase and sale of cryptocurrency, regardless of their profitability. Other reports suggest that Warsaw has no intentions to strictly follow the letter of the current tax law before it develops a comprehensive approach towards the crypto sector.\nAlso read: The Government Dilemma: How To Tax Something One Pretends Does Not Exist Temporary Abandonment of Irrational Ideas\nThe Polish Finance Ministry intends to issue a new regulation to “temporarily abandon” the tax on transactions with virtual currency. It also plans to carry out “in-depth analysis” and prepare “system solutions” to regulate this particular economic space. The move comes after an interpretation of the tax code in April prompted angry reactions from the country’s crypto community, an online petition, and even protests in Warsaw.\n“The Ministry of Finance has accepted the irrational effect of the PCC tax on cryptocurrencies,” Deputy Finance Minister Paweł Gruza recently told Business Insider Polska . He was commenting on his department’s decision to impose the Polish “Civil Law Transactions Tax” (PCC in Polish) on all crypto transactions. “So far, the Ministry hasn’t done anything about the PCC, except for recognizing cryptocurrencies as property rights, which automatically means obligation to pay the civil law transactions tax,” he noted.\nGruza was referring to a controversial decision to tax crypto incomes and profits, which was announced less than a month before the end of the tax campaign in Poland on April 30. In an official position published last month, Ministerstwo Finansów said that Polish residents should report on their tax returns all revenues from trade and exchange for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum.\nThe notice reads that crypto incomes and gains are subject to personal income tax in accordance with the current tax legislation. Moreover, the ministry insisted that all purchases and sales of cryptocurrency, considered transfers of property rights, should be taxed regardless of the profit or loss made. The tax rate for these so called “civil law transactions” is only 1%. However, as it does not depend on their profitability, traders could potentially lose all their funds to taxes. A recent update, quoted by the Polish Press Agency , indicates that the ministry has had a second thought on the subject:\nTaking into account the specificity of trading in virtual currencies, which boils down to trading these property rights through their purchase, sale and exchange, and therefore entering into multiple sale and exchange contracts, the entity that trades the virtual currency may be required to pay tax in an amount that often exceeds the funds invested.\nAs a consequence of this realization, plans to tax crypto transactions have been abandoned. The new regulation on the matter is expected by June 15. Protesters Gather in Front of the Finance Ministry\nThe initial interpretation of the Polish tax law, which has not been updated to encompass cryptocurrencies, quite expectedly drew negative reactions from the Polish crypto community. Its members immediately organized an online petition blaming the government for effectively restricting access to the growing cryptocurrency market. The tax regime was imposed without any consultations with the affected parties.\nThere are indications that the strong backlash was the main factor that forced the Finance Ministry to rethink its position. After meeting protesters in front of the ministry last month, Deputy Finance Minister Paweł Gruza announced: “There will be no PCC tax on trading of cryptocurrencies before any final solutions are worked out, which will happen in no less than two years. However, we maintain the obligation to settle the personal income tax, while working on temporary solutions.”\nMr. Gruza also said that “unfortunately” those who had already paid the civil law transactions tax, would not get a refund. “We are working on legislative solutions to solve this problem,” he assured. The official added that a working group has been set up to develop “simple and transparent taxation rules” regarding cryptocurrencies. According to the Polish outlet Kryptowaluti , there is hope that the upcoming legislation will exclude the PCC tax.\nA new law is expected to “rationalize” the income tax regime in Poland, as well, which currently has a progressive scale with two brackets – 18% for annual incomes of up to PLN 85,528 zloty (€20,400), and 32% for those above the limit. The changes should be introduced next year. Some reports suggest that Polish crypto investors may be granted additional tax exemptions in that respect, although there has been no official confirmation of that.\nOn the contrary, the track record of the Polish government so far proves a rather hostile attitude towards cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Earlier this year the executive branch of power in Warsaw approved a draft law aimed at bringing cryptos under the traditional anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing provisions of the Polish legislation.\nFinancial authorities in Poland have been accused of spending taxpayers’ money on smear campaigns against decentralized digital currencies in at least two occasions. Recently, the country’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) issued a new tender order to plan and conduct a campaign aimed at “building awareness” for the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, listed alongside pyramid schemes and unsupervised forex activities. Earlier this year, it was revealed that the Central Bank of Poland and the KNF had paid a popular Polish Youtube network to produce anti-crypto videos.\nDo you agree that the strong reaction of the Polish crypto community is the main reason for the decision to abandon the tax on crypto transactions?

And while some critics take issue with these figures, few disagree that the digital currency's energy use is a problem that's only getting bigger.\nEconomist Alex de Vries studies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which were invented in 2008 by an anonymous computer programmer . Bitcoin allows people to buy and sell things directly from each other without the use of intermediaries, like banks or currencies controlled and manipulated by governments.\nAnalysis How blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, could change your life Is bitcoin an environmental hazard? Bitcoins are exchanged along a public digital ledger, known as a blockchain, where every move is tracked and verified by computers doing complex mathematical calculations, called hashes. Those willing to lend a hand in verifying the transactions and building the blockchain are rewarded with bitcoins.\nIf it sounds complicated, that's because it is. It's also hard work.\nDe Vries estimates that globally, computers on the bitcoin network are currently crunching 26 quintillion hashes — that's millions of trillions, or 26 followed by 18 zeros — every second of every day.\nBitmain, by far the biggest player in the bitcoin world, has locations where tens of thousands of computers are mining at the same time. (Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) It takes quite a bit of computational power to pull that off, and de Vries is among those taking a stab at figuring out just how much energy is used in conducting all that work, publishing his latest survey — the first peer-reviewed research on the topic — in the scientific energy journal Joule .\nBy his math, computers hashing for bitcoins — known as \"miners\" — are currently using at least 2.5 gigawatts of power, and are on track to collectively suck up more than three times that by the end of this year. That's more than Ireland, Austria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and most Canadian provinces currently each use.\n'It is growing fast' De Vries also estimates the industry's voracious appetite for juice has doubled in the past six months, possibly due to new interest in bitcoin — their price spiked to just under $20,000 each at the end of last year — but also because energy-consumption growth is baked in: the supply of undiscovered bitcoins is dwindling so it takes more work to find those left.\nIn the early days, it was comparatively easy to find a bitcoin, as there were fewer miners competing for the work. Mining could be done by hobbyists using personal computers. But as the digital currency's popularity — and value — has skyrocketed, the increased complexity of the blockchain requires more energy and computing power to solve equations, and now there are specialized computing farms mining for bitcoin.\nChinese bitcoin miners eye sites in Quebec, Manitoba By de Vries' math, a single bitcoin transaction uses as much electricity as a typical Canadian home would consume in a month — and there are 200,000 transactions being processed each day.\n\"Bitcoin has a big problem,\" de Vries wrote. \"And it is growing fast.\"\nBut de Vries' numbers and methodology are not without their critics. The economist comes up with his estimates by assuming most large-scale miners are using the most energy-efficient devices possible, then factors in how many machines are known to be in use and the cost of electricity where these machines are known to be clustered.\nHe admits he's taking educated guesses, partly because many bitcoin miners operate in relative secrecy.\nResearcher and economist Alex de Vries has been charting his best guess at bitcoin's electricity usage on Twitter at @DigiEconomist for more than a year now. (Alex de Vries) Stanford University lecturer Jonathan Koomey says de Vries' work makes far too many leaps of logic, which results in assumptions that are likely wildly out of step with reality.\n\"We know there's a lot of electricity used and we know there's rapid growth,\" Koomey said in an interview. \"But nobody has been in these facilities and we don't have information on the servers themselves.\"\nThe 800-pound gorilla of the bitcoin world is a Chinese company called Bitmain , which has huge operations in Mongolia and remote parts of China. Bitmain is a fascinating player as the company both mines for bitcoin itself, but also sells mining equipment to others.\nCanadian couple invests $100K to build backyard bitcoin mine\nTheir most efficient model, known as an Antminer S9, has the computational power of about a half-million PlayStation 3 gaming consoles, but uses as much wattage as a dishwasher in the process, according to de Vries.\nIt's not hard to imagine how 20,000 of those devices — as one of Bitmain's locations in Mongolia is believed to have — would net an eye-watering electricity bill.\nIndividual bitcoin-mining machines, such as these, have large demands for energy, partly because of the heat that they emit. (Glen Kugelstadt/CBC) It's also not hard to understand why many of the largest mining facilities are set up in cold-weather places with a steady supply of cheap power, such as Manitoba, Quebec and Iceland . \"Rational agents would undertake mining while the marginal costs are lower,\" de Vries said.\nWe still don't know exactly how much power they're using or how much they pay for it.\nDe Vries admits his work is only meant to be a starting off point for future research. \"I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That's actually quite debatable,\" he said.\n\"We don't really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started.\"\nBitcoin price seesaws up to $11,000 US and down to under $9,000 then back up again But Koomey argues it's classic scaremongering to worry about the electricity use of new technologies. Twenty years ago, he recalls that the media was full of stories about how internet usage was growing too rapidly , and reportedly destined to consume as much as half of all electricity in the world.\n\"I've seen this happen over and over,\" said Koomey. \"That was bunk, [so] people shouldn't jump to conclusions.\"\n\"To be clear, [bitcoin mining] is a big user of electricity and growing rapidly,\" he said. \"But we need to be careful to not to overhype the problem.\"\nKoomey said he puts more stead in the work of Marc Bevand, another researcher who suggests de Vries is overestimating bitcoin's power consumption, possibly by twice as much. ( Bevand has published a detailed criticism of de Vries' work online. )\n'Digital versions of Beanie Babies' Regardless of the electrical toll, some argue any amount of time and effort that is going into the mining of bitcoin is a fruitless folly.\nAndreas Park, a finance professor at the University of Toronto, likens the digital currency to a major fad of the 1990s.\n\"Bitcoin, such as it is, has little-to-no use. So we are effectively using our planet's resources to secure people's digital versions of Beanie Babies,\" he told CBC News in an email.\n\"I am a fan of decentralization and blockchains, but I sincerely hope that we find mathematically and economically sound alternative approaches soon that replace this waste of resources.\"\nWhat's fuelling the potential bitcoin mining boom in Canada\nAbout the Author Pete Evans\nSenior Writer, CBCNews.ca\nPete Evans is the senior business writer for CBCNews.ca.

If anything, Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Lee is digging in his heels even further, reportedly reiterating his forecast for a $25,000 BTC price by year-end. What Happened\nLee placed a great deal of stock in last week’s Consensus conference, having said that a combination of a “sanity check” among market participants that innovation on the blockchain isn’t slowing down coupled with “new interest” should have been a catalyst for market gains. Instead, the broader cryptocurrency market shed about 10%. He told CNBC : “Clearly, we were too optimistic.” Source: Bloomberg\nLee’s predictions till now have been unfolding like clockwork, including the tax-selling pressure that he rightly called was weighing on the bitcoin price through much of the first quarter of 2018. But perhaps it was too high an expectation to put on any conference, despite the strong turnout.\nLast week’s blockchain extravaganza was a single event that most assuredly stirred curiosity about the market among newcomers, if only for the Lamborghinis that were parked outside in Midtown Manhattan. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that investors will or should make any sudden decisions to invest. If anything, perhaps attendees are researching cryptocurrencies further now that the market is on their radar and they understand it better.\nWhat Fundstrat’s Lee apparently didn’t factor in, however, was the reticence on the part of institutional investors to enter a market whose regulatory clarity is murky. It’s not that he anticipated a fully regulatory framework by Consensus, but he admitted on CNBC the regulatory tilt was slightly negative.\n“Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions. But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions,” according to Lee . Custody, Regulation and Price Targets\nHindsight, of course, is always 20/20, and Fundstrat’s Lee looking forward. But he says that “it’s going to take time” for key developments to unfold, which in addition to more regulatory clarity includes greater custodial support before the institutional capital will come off the sidelines. Consensus, despite its ability to rally the markets, “was a success,” he said, and it did reveal some custodial partnerships, such as Japanese bank Nomura taking on the role as custodian . Tom Lee is sticking to his prediction of forecasting bitcoin price to hit $25,000 by the year’s end. Pic: Bloomberg\nFundsrat’s famous Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI), which reflects the way that people are emotionally feeling about the leading cryptocurrency, currently hovers at about 30 on a scale of 1-100, which Lee says “is good news” because only last month it was at 18. Fundstrat actually tracks 16 cryptocurrencies in that index, and bitcoin’s score is the lowest among them while EOS is at the highest emotional level.\nLee is “absolutely” sticking to his outlook for $25,000 bitcoin by year-end, saying: “We have to keep in mind … bitcoin at $8,000 and bitcoin at $25,000 …. it doesn’t require bitcoin to go up every day till the end of the year,” he told CNBC.\nIndeed, as Lee has pointed out previously, bitcoin historically achieves all of its gains across the 10 top trading days of the year.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee sticks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T16:49:31.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fdcf921c0d4f7d353ae0f7f13f48c8de2ec1fbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pDgPmb0JPLpae_r5jj_b4nloUGFlP4oLafkfDlJvxA6zsGs5ZyA6VMc8EETd1ExRzjz4KhNin60nRQeECjFoQ1o-", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "📌 The Simpsons mine bitcoins – TECHNOTEC – Medium", "title_full": "📌 The Simpsons mine bitcoins – TECHNOTEC – Medium", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.025, "main_image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*yRaXYbxkRGXSuOn6Chvnhw@2x.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fdcf921c0d4f7d353ae0f7f13f48c8de2ec1fbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pDgPmb0JPLpae_r5jj_b4nloUGFlP4oLafkfDlJvxA6zsGs5ZyA6VMc8EETd1ExRzjz4KhNin60nRQeECjFoQ1o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "📌 The Simpsons mine bitcoins – TECHNOTEC – Medium", "text": "Oil & gas extraction maintenance services.

Admitting that he had never heard of blockchain “until last week”, he says: “I mined some bitcoin with my computer, and then the value went through the roof” and adds: “Now I act like I’m an expert on it!” Once players completed this task, they are also be asked to encourage three youngsters to mine bitcoin on their computers.

NEWS Omkar Godbole May 21, 2018 at 09:00 UTC | Updated May 22, 2018 at 04:04 UTC\nBitcoin (BTC) has bounced back above $8,500, but the rally is not backed by decent trading volumes, the technical charts indicate.\nThe cryptocurrency closed below key technical levels on Thursday, signaling a bearish breakdown, but the sell-off unexpectedly ran out of steam at $7,925 a day later. Subsequently, bitcoin gained more than $500 over the weekend, rising back above resistance at the 50-day moving average.\nAt time of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $8,530, having clocked a six-day high of $8,644 earlier today.\nWhile last week's bearish trend seems to have run out of steam (as seen in the charts below), the weekend's low-volume rally risks trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market. 4-hour chart\nThe inverse head-and-shoulders breakout indicates short-term bullish trend reversal - i.e. the pullback from the high of $9,990 has ended and the breakout has opened the doors to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method. Daily chart\nThe daily chart shows yesterday's candle closed (as per UTC) above Saturday's doji candle high of $8,468, signaling a bullish reversal. Further, the 5-day and 10-day moving averages have shed bearish bias (are no longer sloping downwards).\nAs a result, the probability that bitcoin will rally to $9,000 this week is high. However, the bullish case significantly weakens if we take into account the figures for trading volume.\nVolume is an important indicator, as it shows the level of interest in bitcoin. A rally backed by high volumes means greater reliance can be placed on the bullish move. Conversely, a low volume rally trends to end up being a bull trap.\nIn BTC's case, currently, trading volume on Bitfinex continues to decline and more importantly remained low alongside positive price action, as seen in the chart above. Further, trading volume across all exchanges fell below $5 billion over the weekend - the lowest level since April 11, according to CoinMarketCap .\nThus, the sustainability of the rally seen over the weekend is under question. View BTC rally lacks substance (low volumes), hence the outlook is likely neutral, despite the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout (4-hour chart) and the bullish doji reversal (daily chart). A failure to hold above $8,475 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) would revive the bearish view and allow a drop to Friday's low of $7,925. On the higher side, only a high volume move above the 100-day moving average, currently seen at $8,857, would open the doors to $10,000.\nRunning up steps image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T13:13:54.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55aefe7b60c463a26446da1e4457996cdc527629", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzntZu3Zk..D6_I3J_5KBCY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "title_full": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55aefe7b60c463a26446da1e4457996cdc527629", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzntZu3Zk..D6_I3J_5KBCY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\n Become a part of a huge mining pool!

That’s about $150 less than where the currency stood yesterday. Bitcoin has been marred by ups and downs for the last 1.5 weeks, and it appears they aren’t ceasing anytime soon.\nSince May 5, bitcoin has been on shaky ground. The currency was originally slated to hit $10,000 after it reached a $9,800 high, but sadly, this never occurred. In fact, bitcoin has undergone steady drops ever since and is now trading for $1,500 less.\nFundstrat’s Tom Lee attributes this to what he calls a lagging “trifecta of progress.” The cryptocurrency analyst states that for cryptocurrency to succeed, it requires: Institutional custody and tools; Buy-in by banks and investment managers; Regulatory clarity.\nAt press time, it appears only the first two requirements have been satisfied. In terms of classifications, many cryptocurrencies are still trapped in the dark and unsure of where they stand or what regulations they should adhere to.\nStill, however, a lack of regulatory clarity isn’t getting in the way of some analysts’ predictions regarding bitcoin’s future. Rodrigo Marques, for example, is chief executive of Atlas Quantum , one of Brazil’s largest crypto-trading platforms. In a recent interview, Marques made the bold prediction that bitcoin would strike $20,000 territory within the next six months , and that $8,000 was an interim low for the father of cryptocurrencies. That means we can all expect bitcoin to more than double in value by the time Thanksgiving rolls along.\nIn addition, the regulatory uncertainty that Tom Lee says is plaguing the cryptocurrency market could be about to diminish, as the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is set to provide “tighter guidance on the digital currency market” in the future.\nWhile speaking at the North American Securities Administrators Association Conference in Washington, CFTC chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the financial body is on the verge of publishing what he calls a “staff directory” that will ultimately provide further guidance to both clearinghouses and cryptocurrency exchanges that list derivative contracts based on digital assets.\n“This advisory will reflect CFTC staff’s current thinking based on our growing experience with virtual currency derivatives,” Giancarlo explained. “As new products are brought forth, staff will re-evaluate and revisit the advisory, as necessary, to address any new and emerging issues.”\nIt is difficult to accept that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are still birthing technologies. While entitles like bitcoin have been around for some time, the systems behind them are still adapting to news, trends, forks, software changes and other elements. Thus, it’s difficult for governing financial bodies to garner the experience they need to regulate and control them.\nOn one hand, this kind of regulation and control goes against what bitcoin and its crypto-cousins originally stood for. Then again, with threats like hackings and thefts consistently showing their ugly faces in the virtual currency space, regulation may be the one thing that could set concerns to rest, and put the values and prices of these cryptocurrencies where they deserve to be.\nIt will be interesting, to say the least, to see if bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices do wind up benefiting from newfound regulation attempts in the coming months.

On 1 August 2017, the blockchain of bitcoin – an online ledger that documents every transaction – was split in two, spawning a brand new rival to the original cryptocurrency called bitcoin cash. There has since been more hard forks splitting the cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin gold and bitcoin private, however none were as truly divisive as that of bitcoin cash.The new cryptocurrency is currently only worth around 15 per cent of the original bitcoin – or bitcoin core – yet its improved functionality means some of the original cypher punks believe it is “the one true bitcoin”. The bitcoin core side also claims that any issues with slow transactions and high fees can be solved by building new technology on top of it, such as the Lightning Network – a 'second layer' payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain to enable instant transactions. Ultimately, by sticking to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision, bitcoin cash supporters believe the new cryptocurrency will overtake bitcoin as the world’s most valuable digital currency, an event referred to as “the flippening”.Enthusiasts have even set up a bitcoin cash ‘faucet’ offering free units of the cryptocurrency to encourage new users. But bitcoin cash is just one of more than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies that have emerged since bitcoin’s inception in 2009, according to Coinmarketcap. Cryptocurrencies like ethereum and dash offer similar functionality, but without widespread adoption none will be able to fully realise bitcoin’s promise of being the dominant electronic cash system.

HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group's investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd.\nHandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through \"contactless\" means once users' mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality).\nHandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: \"Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender's mobile device close to the recipient's device. That's why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.\"\nHandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using \"handle\" names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip.\nHandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy \"contactless\" payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nHandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: \"In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.\"\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: \"For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\"\nnChain's deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes:\nIncreasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality. The BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low. The upgrade validates HandCash's vision in creating its wallet product for Bitcoin Cash.\nWebsite: nChain.com\nTwitter: @nChainGlobal\nABOUT NCHAIN GROUP: The nChain Group is the global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies.

Bitcoin Cash, and pretty much any other coin offends their wallet.\nBut traders and people who just want to get richer by doing nothing (HODLing) was never the intended beneficiary of Bitcoin—it’s the people who try to feed their families but lose their shirts to large financial corporations in the process.\nTo demand that an entire network like Bitcoin Cash yield to one’s goal of getting more money without doing anything, and drop its fundamental principles and pledges to the very people it promised to serve is an ultimate demonstration of unjustifiable and undeserved entitlement.\nWhile all rabid fanatics see in their bubble is bull runs and “shooting to the Moon,” in other parts of the world (yes, there are other parts of the world), the main thing people worry about is losing huge chunks of their hard-earned cash to transaction fees, and getting whatever’s left of that money to their families as quick as possible. Believe it or not, contrary to what the comfortable would have themselves conveniently believe, for some,$1 can mean the difference between having food on the table and running on an empty stomach.\nTo fulfill this pledge of global financial inclusion, Bitcoin Cash hard forked from the legacy chain last year to escape the changes that would effectively insert financial institutions and intermediaries back in—which would mean the imposition of the same fees and corporate control Bitcoin intended to eradicate in the first place.\nLast week, members of the community came together at the CoinGeek Conference, held May 18 at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong, to discuss ongoing developments as well as areas of further improvement. Here are a few points from the speakers and how they can help everyone—including those who live on less than $2 a day.\nNakasendo and high-level native scripting language\nJimmy Nguyen , CEO of nChain, explained the developments the development group is working on, saying that their flagship development kit, Nakasendo, is now open to the public. The software development kit is free to use for those building projects on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain . He adds that they are building a high-level, native scripting language for BCH which would eliminate the need for other scripting languages while enabling more complex capabilities and application integration.\nMiner community should contribute to funding development\nJihan Wu , CEO of Bitmain , dropped a huge tidbit at the conference: he says miners should contribute to funding development and give back to the community, hinting at the possibility that Bitmain will be opening up a fund for this very purpose.\nAtomic swaps—enabling users to convert cryptocurrencies, cross blockchains for free\nDr. Craig S. Wright , chief scientist at nChain, discussed the atomic swap which would enable users to convert cryptocurrencies for free through the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Dr. Wright , of course, outlined a lot more and this will be covered in more detail in a later post.\nVisa/Mastercard scale: BCH will reach around 2,000 transactions per second\nAmaury Sechet, lead developer at Bitcoin ABC—which has been a primary driving force for the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from the very beginning, outlined plans for global scale adoption. He says that the Giga block testnet works today, but will require more work until it’s production-ready.\nBcash is now a real thing\nSteven Bower , senior developer at Purse.io, is taking the name back. Purse.io has added BCH into their platform, where people can shop with BCH from people who accept it, and are incentivized with a 15-20% discount on Amazon items.\nMore projects to bookmark\nAngela Holowaychuk , COO at Canadian wallet and exchange nCrypt, enables access to BCH. Holowaychuk says that the low transaction costs can directly benefit consumers when stores revert their savings into discounts or marked down prices for their products.\nAlex Agut , CEO of HandCash, is building UX-conscious projects—user experience (UX) design is one of the biggest hindrances and is definitely a propeller for mass use. He adds that they will push Bitcoin Cash forward into PoS centers.\nVin Armani , CTO of Cointext is pushing for more community collaboration, saying it’s time for the BCH community to start looking at the future of governance, and addressing the “unit of account” aspect of the cryptocurrency.\nThese are only some of the points but there are more to cover. We’ll be posting more detailed articles on the other speakers shortly. Other speakers include, Centbee CEO Lorien Gamaroff , Global Poker GM Jonas Odman , SBI Bits chief of digital asset solutions Jerry Chan , Quoine CFO Katsuya Konno , Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver , and Yours.org CEO Ryan X Charles .\nFor those of you who missed out, there are more opportunities.

Ong was apprehended as part of a sting operation by Federal agents. Apart from jail time, Ong must also forfeit about $1.1 million worth of bitcoin and cash. The Sting Operation\nOng first appeared on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) radar in 2016 after he posted an online ad about his bitcoin trading business. Federal agents soon contacted him and in no time had set up a $12,000 bitcoin sale. Ong met with the undercover agents at a Tukwila McDonald’s, and the deal went through. The agents again contacted Ong for another deal, this time worth $50,000.\nOne of the red flags for the undercover agents was the high fees charged by Ong. In a statement by the postal inspector to the court:\nBased upon my training and experience, I know that this is a substantially higher service fee than that charged by legitimate, (Treasury Department)-licensed bitcoin exchangers.\nAccording to the details of the operation made available to the media, Ong had a policy of not wanting to know where his clients got their money. After one of the agents let slip about drug deals, Ong is quoted as saying:\nSo, there is one thing I tell people is I don’t really care what they use the bitcoin for. It’s better that I don’t actually know because then I can have plausible deniability. I am not interested in what you buy or sell (bitcoin) for, so please do not mention it or have your friends mention it either. The Arrest\nAfter a couple of deals, federal agents confronted Ong as part of an anti-money laundering task force, whereupon he agreed to stop his unlicensed bitcoin trading activities. He broke the terms of the deal, however, and proceeded to conduct three more illegal bitcoin trades with undercover agents. Ong was arrested on July 21, 2017, and charged with five counts of money laundering and one count of running an unregistered money-transmission business. According to the indictment, Ong laundered approximately $290,000. U.S. Unlicensed Bitcoin Trading Crackdown\nSince 2016, tracking domestic bitcoin traders has been a mandate of the DHS task force. It all came about in the aftermath of the arrest of David Burchard for the illegal sale of marijuana using Tor. Since then, several federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and DHS have made several arrests of unlicensed bitcoin traders. In 2017, Missouri native Jason Klein was arrested for selling roughly $75,000 worth of bitcoin to undercover FBI agents.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Treasury department classified bitcoin trading as a “money services business.” Thus, bitcoin trading in the country is subject to regulations which make unlicensed crypto trading a criminal offense.\nDo you think the sentence was harsh? Should unlicensed P2P cryptocurrency trading be illegal?

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the content below.\nCryptocurrency mining, once a highly profitable venture, has become more challenging as costs have increased, especially in the past year.\nAdvanced Miners , a mining company that already operates a mine in northern China, has developed more economical mining equipment, an online mining cloud platform, and will open more mining farms.\nAdvanced Miners’ goal is to make bitcoin more decentralized with more mining pools and more versatile mining hardware. The company’s versatile equipment will make mining more accessible to many. Meeting The Challenge\nNot only is investment in mining is long-term, but the investments require an understanding of mining equipment, which is difficult to acquire for many.\nAdvanced Miners has responded to this need by introducing its own ASIC mining equipment based on 12 nanometer (nm) chip, which has been successfully tested. The chip will be launched for public sale by mid-year, and an ASIC based on 7 nm will be available by year’s end.\nThe income from both the AMS-12 nm and ASM-7 nm has the potential to surpasses that of other mining equipment.\nFollowing distribution of the new mining equipment, Advanced Miners will open its online cloud platform for people to buy and sell hash. Only the ACM token will be accepted for payment, which bodes well for the token’s future value.\nThe company in 2016 launched its first bitcoin focused farm in northern China using Antminer ASIC from Bitmain. The best energy price at the time was $0.04 per KW. By April 2017, Litecoin and Ethereum farms were established, followed by Monero and Dash farms. ICO Begins\nThe announcement of the 12 nm chips coincided with the recent launch of the ICO, which released 12 million tokens and will last through June 15. The price is $0.9 per token, a 35% discount from final token price.\nThe second stage of the ICO will bring the main sale, with a token price of $1.2 for 5,000 to 10,000 units of ASIC AM-12. The ASIC AM-7 based on the 7 nm chip will be tested.\nHash rates will increase in steps following the ICO. The estimated hash rate after the ICO is 542.00 PH/s for SHA-245, then 1,650.00 PH/S after the buy/sell hash platform begins, then 3,800.00 PH/S after the launch of the cloud mining platform. New Mining Farm Coming\nAdvanced Miners’ next step will be to establish a mining farm in Canada with an AMS-1 based on a 12 nm chip with an estimated electricity rate of $0.03 per KW. A large mining pool will launch by April of 2019.\nInvestors will be able to exchange or turn ACM tokens into hash power since mining profit and payments will be executed automatically. Users can purchase contracts for bitcoin mining with ASIC AM-12 and AM-7 with ACM tokens during the 2018-2019 period.\nThe company will not sell mining boards equipped with the 12 nm chips to the public, but only to its investors in its ICO.\nICO investors will have some advantages compared to other mining companies since they can choose whether to buy ASIC with delivery to their data centers or buy hash on the online platform with guaranteed cheap electricity.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advanced miners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T23:19:46.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e65a92a6ae1523f909c6661cca11a4708e4cc672", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf.BO1AwKs_VdV0AttfQmjdAci.C_VFwaLAqQOzFjrLxAl_w5hp9hcNIoKBLUi6SEaNhV7mqFkm.blrxMDQd.rQm_l7csCAOg2uc8oDXMwCK0", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Startup Teams Samourai Wallet on App to Trade Bitcoin Without the Internet", "title_full": "Startup Teams Samourai Wallet on App to Trade Bitcoin Without the Internet", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-wallet.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e65a92a6ae1523f909c6661cca11a4708e4cc672", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf.BO1AwKs_VdV0AttfQmjdAci.C_VFwaLAqQOzFjrLxAl_w5hp9hcNIoKBLUi6SEaNhV7mqFkm.blrxMDQd.rQm_l7csCAOg2uc8oDXMwCK0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Startup Teams Samourai Wallet on App to Trade Bitcoin Without the Internet", "text": "Startup Teams Samourai Wallet on App to Trade Bitcoin Without the Internet Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nGoTenna, a decentralized startup, has teamed with Samourai Wallet , a bitcoin wallet focused on privacy and security, on an app that allows users to trade bitcoin when not connected to the web.\nThe TxTenna app marks an effort to further decentralize the bitcoin network, according to Richard Myers, a goTenna decentralized applications engineer and co-founder of Bybit AB, writing in inthemesh.com . The goTenna device allows users to join a mesh network and send information without the need for Internet access. How It Works\nWith the goTenna app, the user creates a bitcoin transaction on the app while offline. The app sends the transaction to the Txtenna app, delivering it to mesh nodes. The transaction then gets relayed to other goTenna devices, eventually reaching an Internet-connected node that also runs TxTenna, which passes it on to the bitcoin network.\nAccording to goTenna, simulations indicate less than 2 random nodes in a three-square-mile area can sufficiently provide a goTenna network.\nThe project offers an alternative communication layer that goTenna believes will provide a more resilient bitcoin network. Building On Blockstream Project\ngoTenna has integrated its device with the Samourai Wallet’s MuleTools project, an open source project that was influenced by Blockstream’s satellite initiative to use satellites to support bitcoin network transactions, an effort to support alternative transaction systems. Myers noted that Blockstream’s decentralization measure benefits transaction verification, but leaves the need to move transactions to the bitcoin network.\nThe bitcoin network currently relies on ISPs that are largely run by big companies that often place commercial interest over net neutrality, Myers claimed. In 2007/2008, for instance, Comcast undermined traffic for BitTorrent , a network for downloading and file sharing. In Search Of A More Resilient Blockchain\nShould a government prohibit bitcoin, that government could enlist ISPs to block local network nodes, Myers noted.\nInstances have already been recorded of private law firms, claiming alleged copyright infringements, identifying BitTorrent users based on ISP provided information.\nAccording to JW Weatherman in his “Bitcoin Threat Model,” a bitcoin node can be duped into thinking a transaction was not confirmed, Myers noted.\nThe fact that such ISPs are centralized also makes them prone to disasters, he noted. The communication layer itself needs to be more resilient.\nElaine Ou and Nick Szabo suggested using shortwave radio for transactions, a project that remains in prototype.\nLess common channels such as private microwave connections amateur radio repeaters, pager networks and satellites could also provide such resilience, Myers observed.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samourai wallet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gotenna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard myers", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "internet startup teams samourai wallet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "startup teams samourai wallet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bybit ab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:47:20.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16954094db00e20c49294a6e32ad6b26f6fb725e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJ0.3yf89hQgUgBlqXktnWAhGKDA3U7e8J0VxkVNjAnHnrLUAghincuCu5lWKJ8Rq088OzXU630rVCQo8E_5E8fvesFwRp2PQ6hB5r1EPqt0wCtINgPI7NEsOfVI.YipluRNm5i3ykwT2aZOGNYE5kN", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories?format=xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com - Top Stories", "title": "Bitcoin headed for $20,000 in six months, says CEO of cryptocurrency platform", "title_full": "Bitcoin headed for $20,000 in six months, says CEO of cryptocurrency platform - MarketWatch", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GA591_btc_go_ZG_20171220152243.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16954094db00e20c49294a6e32ad6b26f6fb725e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJ0.3yf89hQgUgBlqXktnWAhGKDA3U7e8J0VxkVNjAnHnrLUAghincuCu5lWKJ8Rq088OzXU630rVCQo8E_5E8fvesFwRp2PQ6hB5r1EPqt0wCtINgPI7NEsOfVI.YipluRNm5i3ykwT2aZOGNYE5kN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Hankin", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin headed for $20,000 in six months, says CEO of cryptocurrency platform", "text": "Bitcoin, the world’s biggest digital currency, drifted back under $8,500 on Monday as weekend gains slowly faded.

In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.”\nDavis argued that bitcoin should not be classified as money, because although it could qualify as a unit of account and medium of exchange it is not an effective store of value. Moreover, he said that its current valuation is based purely on speculation rather than economic fundamentals.\nHe wrote:\n“The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use.”\nHe further warned investors against allocating even a small percentage of their assets to bitcoin, as this will reduce their exposure to “tried and true asset classes” in favor of an asset class whose investment case is “hardly compelling.”\n“As innovation quickens and competition increases, the majority of networks (and their associated cryptocurrencies) may be rendered obsolete, leaving many cryptocurrencies like tulip bulbs in 17th-century Holland—soaring to incredible heights before the speculative bubble pops,” he said, parroting a common-but-dubious analogy. “And, unlike tulips, they don’t look very nice in a vase.”\nDavis isn’t the first Vanguard executive to disparage bitcoin as an investment and cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Last year, Vanguard Group founder John Bogle advised investors to “avoid bitcoin like the plague” since it has no underlying rate of return. “When it gets back to $100, we’ll talk,” he said.\nOther asset managers, however, are beginning to warm to the nascent cryptocurrency industry. Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch a bitcoin trading operation , and even JPMorgan — whose CEO, Jamie Dimon, has long been one of bitcoin’s most outspoken opponents — may soon help its clients invest in cryptocurrency.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard economist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T01:56:39.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd3812dbc1fae7d97bf7b4c1da031195213716b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVbkeB.Xil4fSf06XFRfjhhpbjwbcagXswBoA0nFCUkhFkBVgNh0DGL6nR_8auvRgRJJhrcNij4OyxuCvccx2ypjbryGvq7bmLaF3zT1hgWoLOj9rxJJqHgQ--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Privacy Coin Matrix: A Comprehensive Spreadsheet of Anonymous Digital Assets - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "The Privacy Coin Matrix: A Comprehensive Spreadsheet of Anonymous Digital Assets - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HIDEMatrix.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd3812dbc1fae7d97bf7b4c1da031195213716b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVbkeB.Xil4fSf06XFRfjhhpbjwbcagXswBoA0nFCUkhFkBVgNh0DGL6nR_8auvRgRJJhrcNij4OyxuCvccx2ypjbryGvq7bmLaF3zT1hgWoLOj9rxJJqHgQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Redman", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Privacy Coin Matrix: A Comprehensive Spreadsheet of Anonymous Digital Assets - Bitcoin News", "text": "This story was shared from this site\nAfter delving into the world of cryptocurrencies one can see that good majority of digital asset proponents are big fans of privacy and anonymity. Just recently a spreadsheet document was published that lists the top privacy-centric coins and the various differences between them. The paper called “Privacy Coin Matrix,” allows enthusiasts to see a comprehensive list of cryptocurrency networks that focus on promoting financial privacy.\nAlso read: Marvel, The Simpsons Go Crypto\nIntroducing the Privacy Coin Matrix\nA Google Docs’ spreadsheet has been recently published on the wide variety of cryptocurrencies that aim to bolster financial anonymity. The paper is very comprehensive and includes various details about each coins’ attributes strewn across a very long spreadsheet. Coins that are present in the ‘Matrix’ spreadsheet include Bitcoin Core (BTC), Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Dash, Verge (XVG), PIVX, Bitcoin Private (BTCP), and more. There are a total of twenty cryptocurrencies listed, alongside some relatively unknown coins like Zoin (ZOI), and Colossus Coin (COLX). There are a bunch of privacy-centric coins missing from the list as well such as anon tokens like Boolberry (BBR), and Bitcoin Dark (BTCD).\nThere are fourteen separate sections that distinguish each coin such as the asset’s summary, features, resources, trading, supply and distribution, wallets, and privacy benefits. With each section summarizing the protocols’ features it can give a reader an in-depth look at how much privacy these networks actually give to users. For instance, in the ‘privacy’ section, readers will likely get the most information concerning anonymity methods. Both Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) mentioned in the list fail miserably when it comes to nearly everything privacy related.\nSome Coins Offer Very Little Privacy, Scaling is Dependent on Unfinished Second Layer Solutions, and Others Have No Wallet Support\nThe lists details that other coins such as Monero, Zash, Particl, Bitcoin Private, Zencash, Zclassic, and Sumocoin obfuscate a recipient, and a senders’ transactions with certain features. Anonymity protocols these coins use are methods like ring signatures, stealth addresses, and zsnarks (zerocoin). According to the Matrix spreadsheet many of the other coins mentioned like Dash, and Colossus show no cryptographic privacy, and they depend on techniques like Coinjoin. Further, the list also details whether or not the coins have an auditable supply and a trusted setup.\nThe coins’ ability to scale is also a section worth reading as it shows which cryptocurrencies have begun to scale through forks, and others waiting on technologies like Lightning to come to fruition. Other technologies mentioned in the scaling section include masternode protocols, bulletproofs, and other second layer options. Lastly, some of the coins mentioned have wallet implementations across most clients created within the industry, while other coins have very little wallet support making utility very difficult for coins like Phore, Zoin, Colossus, Spectrecoin, and Sumokoin.\nMatrix List Cuts Through the Anon-Coin Hype\nBesides this list, there are more anonymity focused cryptocurrencies in existence that claim to provide significant privacy for users utilizing these networks. However, the Matrix spreadsheet cuts through all the anon-coin hype, headlines, and shilling taking place across the web by separating features, attributes, and facts, into a list of things cryptocurrency proponents care about.\nWhat do you think about the Privacy Coin Matrix spreadsheet? Are there privacy coins that you didn’t see mention in the Matrix list? Let us know your thoughts on this subject in the comments below.\nImages via the Matrix, The Wachowski Brothers, and the Matrix spreadsheet.\nDo you agree with us that Bitcoin is the best invention since sliced bread?

When trolls wish to hector bitcoin cash supporters they often employ the name. Well, the two CEOs remarked gleefully, now the association has a real use case. It’s a fork of bcoin, a full node implementation, and both agreed they’d be employing the innovation. The Purse.io adventure parallels the ecosystem’s, as viewers come to find out. Mr. Charles prompts Mr. Ver into expanding on just why Mr. Ver was such a heavy proponent and user of the tech.\nMr. Ver explained how he used Purse.io for a great many business transactions, for nearly everything. When bitcoin core (BTC) fees became untenable for transactions, he left the service altogether, cashing out his remaining BTC for bitcoin cash (BCH). With Purse.io continuing to innovate and adapt, accepting BCH and offering a handy 15% discount on Amazon purchases, Mr. Ver happily encouraged viewers to return to the service. And indeed there does seem to be a resurgence in so-called micropayment tech, as more and more businesses transition to BCH. Fast and Furious\nMr. Charles then raves about Openbazaar’s move into decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, a very big deal in the community. Traditional exchanges ask quite a lot of potential users, with frictions in onboarding and withdrawal, not to mention invasive personal questions. They’ve long gone against a basic aspect of crypto philosophy. Mr. Ver explained the store at Bitcoin.com will also sell its goods and services on Openbazzar .\nContinuing on the micropayment innovations, both praised Mr. Charles’ latest project, the Money Button. The days-old tech is a spin on Yours.org’s BCH micropayment social media concept. Mr. Charles’ content providers asked for an API usable on their own proprietary websites; a money button, if you will, for the internet. The Yours.org CEO describes the Money Button as similar to pressing Like on Facebook. The prototype looks to be pretty amazing and transformative if the tech holds up: imagine every site surfed, readers and viewers had the ability to tip in fractions of BCH as a show of appreciation. Mr. Charles is careful to stress it is still not ready for large scale deployment, but he does want folks to give it a try over the next two months in the hopes of gaining feedback and working out bugs.\nThese are just some of the forward-looking subjects the two shared. Celebrating the ‘Pizza Anniversary,’ Marco Coino app, shout out to those protesting on behalf of a bitcoiner being charged for ridiculous crimes, more Lightning Network folly, decentralized crowdfunding through Lighthouse, Twitter censorship games, Memo.cash, Blockpress.com, and, of course, the 32MB Bitcoin Cash upgrade and OP codes. For those wishing to keep up with the ongoings of bitcoin cash, whose innovations are coming fast and furious, or are just curious about the digital currency, Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles are arguably the best ambassadors around. No word if the two plan further collabs in the video sense, but Mr. Ver did stress future shows will include a displayed key which Bitcoin.com Wallet holders will be able to scan for free BCH!\nAre you excited about BCH adoption and innovation?

This story, astrology-based financial investment, and many more feature in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Marvel, The Simpsons Go Crypto Parity Shuts Down ICO Passport Service\nThe team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check. The reason for the closure is a new EU dictate called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is meant to bring a new set of “digital rights” for EU citizens and guard their personal data. The regulation that will come into force this Friday has already killed other services in the crypto space such as the P2P exchange Cointouch and has forced others to change the way they do business such as Localbitcoins .\nThe Parity team explained that: “GDPR creates new and untested challenges when storing personal information on the blockchain. These challenges make running a service like PICOPS more difficult. We are looking at ways of resolving the uncertainty and making PICOPS compliant with GDPR while keeping it useful. However, as things stand, the solutions we have identified restrict the service to a very limited set of features. Because of this, the significant resources required to make PICOPS GDPR-compliant, and the fact that PICOPS is not part of our core technology stack, we have decided to discontinue the service, despite overwhelming market needs and demand.” Indian Ban Case Shifts to Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court of India has taken over the cases of Coin Recoil and others challenging the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) ban on local banks from dealing with bitcoin companies. The n ext hearing of this now combined case is planned for July 20, 2018.\nRashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co., commented: “The Supreme Court has recently transferred the entire batch of petitions pending at High Court level with respect to the contentious issue of RBI effectively banning transactions in cryptocurrencies. This decision highlights the importance of this issue at a national level from not just a legal, but also an economic standpoint. We strongly believe that the RBI’s circular to effectively discourage the business of cryptocurrency exchanges is an arbitrary decision against the freedom of the right to trade guaranteed by the Constitution. We are hopeful that justice will be meted out at the Supreme Court level.” Written in the Stars\nAstrology-based financial investment is apparently a thing, and many practitioners are using it to navigate the tumultuous seas of the cryptocurrency markets. This is according to a Marketwatch report that cited a number of astro-investors and even a professional astro-analyst talking about the practice as well as their predictions.\nThis matter came into the forefront recently after ex-NFL star Ricky Williams shared his use of the of study of celestial objects with CNBC . “When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight. The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus,” he explained. Roboforex to Compete with Wallets\nRoboforex, an IFSC (International Financial Services Commission of Belize) licensed financial firm offering crypto CFDs , has introduced a new service for its clients to buy BTC with fiat directly from the broker. The company believes that its regulated status will convince users to use their accounts over existing wallets.\nDenis Golomedov, Chief Marketing Officer at Roboforex, said: “Providing the ability for clients to deposit into their accounts in Bitcoin is not only an additional service, which expands clients’ opportunities, but also a standalone product, which significantly dominates over its market counterparts. Security has become very significant issue recently, as more and more information appears about hacking cryptocurrency exchanges and stealing users’ assets. Using the cryptocurrency is much more convenient and safer for clients within the framework of their trading and investment activities, using products and services provided by a regulated broker”.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

The pair is likely to accelerate gains above $8,650 if it continues to follow the ascending channel.\nBitcoin price is trading with a positive bias above $8,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD could extend the current move above the $8.650 and $8,800 resistance levels. Bitcoin Price Analysis (BTC/USD)\nAfter a spike below the $8,000 level, bitcoin price found a strong buying interest against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded as low as $7,915 before starting an upside move. It gained traction and moved above the $8,000, $8,200 and $8,400 resistance levels. The upside move was positive since there was a close above the $8,400 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nBTC buyers got in control and pushed the price above the last swing high of $8,506. It opened the doors for more gains and it seems like the price may well test the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low. At the moment, the price is consolidating gains above the $8,400 level. There is also a significant ascending channel formed with support at $8,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Should the price gain bullish momentum, it could easily break the $8,600 resistance to test the 1.618 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low at $8,870.\nLooking at the chart , the price remains well supported above the $8,400 level. A downside break below $8,400 may well call for a short-term reversal of the current trend.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slightly in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving lower towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,400 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin price analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T12:00:50.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2141172a1a21e5a296f6b6e7d5defa86e9b6ba9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRq_UwN.lZZR2uKM5ok94BYZAiLj.gVGcAzQnOyWuIz4GCnR6fevUdE0Ag1Tcl9x3GTx8avGdRcRHj_pt4SUV1Qgu1LBchjFhxl89KgINd233ZlFqexHb0", "site_full": "www.icryptodesk.com", "site": "icryptodesk.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "How Will Bitcoin Solve Its Energy Consumption Problem? – iCrypto", "title_full": "How Will Bitcoin Solve Its Energy Consumption Problem? – iCrypto", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.036, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.icryptodesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Energy.jpg?fit=1000%2C667&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2141172a1a21e5a296f6b6e7d5defa86e9b6ba9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRq_UwN.lZZR2uKM5ok94BYZAiLj.gVGcAzQnOyWuIz4GCnR6fevUdE0Ag1Tcl9x3GTx8avGdRcRHj_pt4SUV1Qgu1LBchjFhxl89KgINd233ZlFqexHb0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Post Author", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Will Bitcoin Solve Its Energy Consumption Problem? – iCrypto", "text": "21 MAY How Will Bitcoin Solve Its Energy Consumption Problem?\nIf Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th largest consumer of electricity in the world. A new research paper has highlighted the growing problem as major cryptocurrencies seek to solve it. Bitcoin’s Energy Crisis Explored\nAccording to the figures, the amount of energy used for each transaction could run a dishwasher for a year.\nAlex de Vries wrote: “With the Bitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, this means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018.” This doesn’t mean that Bitcoin transactions couldn’t be processed without high amounts of energy, it’s just that there are a lot of miners. Currently , miners earn about $100 per transaction.\nDigiconomist estimates the consumption of electricity by Bitcoin Miners in its Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BEXI). According to its data, Bitcoin uses 67.91 TWh annually which is just greater than Chile, ranked 40th in the world at 66 TWh. They estimate that the amount of electricity used per transaction is higher at 929 kWh which would be the equivalent of running three dishwashers for a year. The main issue is that the figures are rising at a much steeper rate and have been since September 2017.\nBEXI has to work backwards to calculate the energy used. It starts with how much money the miners are making and works out how much they probably spend on electricity. Then they consider the price of electricity and estimate how much is used. It does rely on several assumptions but it would be much harder to contact all Bitcoin miners and ask how much electricity they use. Will the Lightning Network Help?\nThe Lightning Network will take Bitcoin transactions off-chain by setting up channels between users. Transactions between them will occur and only be recorded on the blockchain when the channel is closed. This will reduce the number of transactions that nodes will have to confirm and in doing so, will reduce the energy required for maintaining the network.\nHowever, the majority of electricity used is for Bitcoin mining where computers generate hashes that fulfil a set of criteria. Reducing the number of transactions on the blockchain is unlikely to affect how many miners there are. Bitcoin transactions have halved since December but the mining difficulty has doubled , indicating there is twice as much mining equipment being used. This means that the Lightning Network will only be able to solve some of the problem.\nIn reality, the best bet for Bitcoin, using Proof-of-Work, is using renewable energy, as highlighted in a response to the paper. The International Energy Agency said that renewable energy is set to grow 40% by 2022 and highlighted that renewables are dominant in new energy sources being created. Iceland has already shown how it can work as it runs on 100% renewable energy. In essence, renewable electricity allows the Bitcoin Network to run without changing its underlying structure.\nOther ways of solving the problem include moving to Proof-of-Stake as Ethereum is doing. Digiconomist estimate that Ethereum uses about a third of the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin. NewsBTC reported on the recent publication of the code for Casper. The move is likely to reduce electricity usage significantly, but the question is whether or not the network will remain secure. Featured image from Shutterstock.

According to a financial statement included as part of the IPO filing, Canaan raised 1.3 billion yuan ($204 million) in revenue in 2017 alone, marking 3,000 percent year-on-year growth compared with 2016.\nSimilarly, the firm also brought in a net profit of $56 million in 2017 - a six-fold increase over the previous year.\nThis isn't the first time that the bitcoin miner maker has closed on becoming a publicly traded entity. As previously reported by CoinDesk, an attempted acquisition deal in 2016 would have seen Canaan go public on China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange, but the stock exchange eventually blocked the move over \"uncertainties.\"\nIn May 2017, the company raised 300 million yuan ($43 million at the time) in a Series A round that saw the participation of Jin Jiang International Group, Baopu Asset Management and Tunlan Investment.\nAvalon mining chips image via Canaan The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .
