Don't Play Alas, not even a trio of (rented) Lamborghinis, a 1,000-person yacht party and a performance by 46-year-old rapper Snoop Dogg could prevent the value of virtual currencies tracked by Coinmarketcap.com from sinking by $US45 billion ($56.6 billion) since May 11.\nEven a cool event featuring rapper Snoop Dogg couldn't revive bitcoin's fortunes.\nPhoto: supplied Bitcoin, the most popular of the bunch, dropped 3.7 per cent this week to $US8,117.43 even as Arthur Hayes -- the crypto exchange executive whose firm rented the Lamborghinis -- predicted a surge to $US50,000 by year-end.\nAdvertisement \"While there was not a consensus bump, our conviction on cryptocurrencies strengthened during the conference,\" Lee wrote in a note on Friday. He cited over exuberance about the prospects for rising institutional demand and lingering concerns about the regulatory framework for depressing prices.\nLoading 'Rat poison squared' This week's slump is far from extreme by crypto standards, but the market's resistance to Blockchain Week's ballyhoo highlights one of the arguments often used by virtual currency pessimists -- that most people who are willing to buy the coins have already piled in.\nWhile bulls point to a vast pool of pent-up demand from professional money managers, it's far from clear that regulations in the US and elsewhere will evolve in ways that attract institutional investors. Many Wall Street pros have dismissed the market as a speculative bubble, while Warren Buffett has likened bitcoin to \"rat poison squared.\"\nThis week's losses may have been the result of unmet expectations surrounding Consensus 2018, said Sunny Lu, the chief executive officer of blockchain-based logistics company VeChain Tech and one of the conference speakers.\n\"The quality of projects and speakers were not really as good as expected,\" Lu said. \"I guess people just got disappointed.\"\nBloomberg\nCryptocurrencies Bitcoin Comments disabled Most Viewed in Business Loading Morning & Afternoon Newsletter Delivered Mon–Fri.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrea tan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blake schmidt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "snoop dogg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "snoop dogg crypto", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T04:43:32.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e604da7a84c792343a0c8327ba087a24d638674", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmazmGpjhOPQgM2k.Bsgc9aE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Why anyone who invests 5,000$ now in bitcoin will be millionaire by 2025", "title_full": "Why anyone who invests 5,000$ now in bitcoin will be millionaire by 2025", "published": "2018-05-19T04:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.029, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e604da7a84c792343a0c8327ba087a24d638674", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmazmGpjhOPQgM2k.Bsgc9aE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "darkangel11", "published": "2018-05-19T04:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why anyone who invests 5,000$ now in bitcoin will be millionaire by 2025", "text": "I have invested much more than 5k USD and I doubt that I will ever be a millionaire, at least comparable to the current millionaires.

Cryptokitties , from San Francisco design team AxiomZen , is like a mixture of Pokemon and Ethereum. The game uses Ethereum’s blockchain to create and track tokens that take the form of digital kittens. The kittens can breed and they can also be bought and sold in online auctions. The game started with 100 “Founder Kitties,” and the blockchain will churn out a new “Gen 0” kitty every fifteen minutes until November 2018. Those kitties are listed for sale at a price based on the average of the last five kitties sold plus 50 percent. That price declines over the next 24 hours until it reaches a level that someone is willing to pay. Players can “sire” two kitties that they own or they can pay, using ETH, to sire with someone else’s kitty. Pregnancies, which the game calls “cooldown periods,” range from an hour to as much as a week. Kitties with shorter cooldown times sell for higher prices but each siring increases the time needed. Each kitty comes with a genome made up of 256 bits that determine its background color, appearance, cooldown time, and so on. Occasionally, a siring will produce a “Fancy Cat.” The idea is simple, especially if you’re already familiar with the blockchain and cryptocurrency. But it’s already taking off. Players have spent around $4.5 million on the game. The most valuable Kitty sold for 246.9 ETH, around $117,712. It’s possible that CryptoKitties will be the next Pokemon or Beanie Babies. It’s also possible that it won’t spread beyond the realm of cryptocurrency early adopters–and they don’t include too many teenage kitty fans. Kitties can currently only be purchased on a computer or laptop running Chrome or Firefox, and payments have to be made through MetaMask, a digital wallet. That’s likely to reduce adoption. Unlike Bitcoin, kitties can’t be mined. But they can be sired, a process that, like mining, generates a fee. Each transaction is registered on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring its integrity. Players also get to own their pets. Unlike games run by large companies, there’s no chance of the database and ownership registry disappearing if AxiomZen decides to move on. The real benefit of CryptoKitties then, is that it’s a great introduction to the world of cryptocurrency for people still doubtful about its value. (It’s a topic I discuss on my Bad Crypto Podcast. ) It’s not easy to explain to someone why they should buy bitcoin or where the price of a bitcoin comes from. It’s much easier to explain that this kitty is more expensive than that kitty because it’s prettier, closer to Gen 0 and has a short cooldown period. Explain that the name of the kitten and the buyer’s ownership of it is entered into a digital registry and they’ll get it. In the process, they’ll get bitcoin. Whether or not CryptoKitties turns out to be the next Pokemon, curiosity about these digital cats might well help to drive new interest in digital currencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.axiomzen.co/", "http://inc.com/joel-comm/what-to-do-when-bitcoin-falls.html", "https://www.cryptokitties.co/", "http://inc.com/joel-comm/4-things-you-really-need-to-know-before-you-buy-bi.html", "http://badcryptopodcast.com/2017/12/05/cryptokitties-craziness-59/", "https://twitter.com/share", "https://kittysales.herokuapp.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T18:59:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56095aa10eed1bebcd1b6bd61116f480d9dfefa9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSB3aLIJsxIiKOy8jIW1nwU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "title_full": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "published": "2018-05-19T04:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.109, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56095aa10eed1bebcd1b6bd61116f480d9dfefa9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSB3aLIJsxIiKOy8jIW1nwU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Godef", "published": "2018-05-19T04:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Or Investment", "text": "i think its good both bitcoin and investment . bitcoin you can earn here using any other techiques minig or trading . then if you get more bitcoin you can trade it to money then go for investment .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T23:46:37.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dba4d6685c560d1333367e046db58c32e493a840", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcI7F7WNmICYc0yrRIPFLX2NuQCC7aGaVQSWxe2DuYzR.OUjhCSjZo2ppVj3mQj97ow--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Coming To Purse!", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Coming To Purse!

Expect central bank chatter this week. FOMC minutes will scare markets more than give actual direction to monetary policy. ECB accounts will likely be more in depth without holding any more information. Bitcoin Bitcoin seems to have found buying support in the low $8k. There is still selling pressure at these levels, which is likely short term trading and not a trend lower. Bitcoin wales are still a threat, but a minor short term threat. So hold with caution, and short only if desperate, but expect a move higher in the longer term. Crypto The high of cryptos came in the middle of media hype. That kind of hype was driving prices on speculation. Similar speculation has driven shares of Tesla and Apple, which is the idea that they are doing something groundbreaking and novel. That probably adds another 20% to the price when the general public buys in without knowing exactly what they have bought. Cryptos are still profound to many people as they don`t use them in everyday life. However, their use is gaining wider acceptance. Money is anything that can be used as a medium of exchange. On a bank`s ledger, a simple key stroke can turn $10,000 to $100,000. Cryptos, as a decentralized ledger, are forced to rely on market belief to improve value, not money printing like fiat currency. That same belief in the underlying fiat, (or lack of belief) and excessive money printing is why Venezuela and Zimbabwe currencies collapsed. Meanwhile, the USA and Australia are both trying to eradicate $100 notes which will likely follow the currency crisis of India when they abolished larger notes. This will not stem the use of cash in the black market, but instead will lead people to use gold coins or crypto for lager value exchanges that are hidden from governments. Human behavior will continue to find things to supplant money, if need be. Fear of the new and novel technologies won`t stop wider application because cryptos are a solution to many problems within the financial industries. The older generation sees cryptos as some random digital bits but doesn`t gather that this is the new medium of exchange. Their fears of lost cryptos are the same fears people have about stolen credit cards and identity theft, except that holding crypto is more secure because they don`t have to rely on insecure banks or credit agencies. Just as the internet has woven itself into daily life, cryptos are finding wider adoption. As industry uses crypto as an exchange and solution, it gains market value regardless of naysayers. Wider adoption is happening, regardless of the general population`s understanding of how blockchain functions. So long term, cryptos are still a good investment. In the short term, media hype will continue to drive price action. This is just as you`d expect from share prices and commodities. Those minor perturbations won`t stall the price action.

Nevertheless, it's not new to everyone of us, it's not the first time it ever happened. We have to stay hopeful in spite of this issue and learn to respond to it constructively.

So, whereas the market seems to be greeting the launch of not one but two bitcoin futures exchanges in the next two weeks (with two more doubtlessly important ones on the near horizon) with ebullience, we really ought to be regarding this growth as the end of the start. The abbreviation ICO stands for Preliminary Coin Offering, that is, the preliminary placement of coins (tokens). Using the most recent Ethereum expertise, FunFair delivers low cost, high quality, transparent casino experiences which can open up the global gaming market. It's claimed in few circumstances that a few of them have tried to extort money from the mission creators, and when their demands aren't met, the projects were targeted with unfavourable feedback and reports on BitcoinTalk, other forums, and social media platforms. Later, these cash can be used on the undertaking platform as an inner forex or trade them on exchanges. We've got one of the largest blockchain groups on this planet and we meet the wants of the market as a cryptocurrency platform from an established entity - one that's already trusted and delivering commissions for governments around the globe. The dark days of stumbling into insincere token distributors and dishonest ICOs are virtually behind us with on the onset of ICO listing directories that do a very good job. Throughout the implementation of ICO, a company or a new enterprise can simply raise fund for the continuation of a challenge or the launching of a new one by promoting tokens of a cryptocurrency. He has worked with many blockchain tasks and thus far suggested 10 ICOs in 2017. has also reached an settlement to listing its tokens post-ICO on the Alternate -- a world cryptocurrency marketplace where varied monetary instruments could be traded and exchanged against each other, no matter their asset class or transaction size. Within the third quarter of 2017 alone, ICOs raised more than $1.three billion for crypto ventures — approximately 5 occasions greater than funding raised by means of enterprise capital in the blockchain area. This consists of the aim of the project, the period of the fundraising, the quantity to be raised, and the number of the token to be sold in trade for the legal tender. Tokenisation: It is unclear to me how prospects will be able to change Nau tokens into actual money. The case is the primary introduced by a new SEC unit created in September to focus on misconduct involving distributed ledger expertise and initial coin offerings. Firms involved in ICO campaigns distribute cash according to their projected supply. The growth of a bitcoin futures market positions it much more as a commodity than a currency (in the US, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates futures markets). That was why the US Securities and Trade Commission (SEC) warned the traders to be careful of scammers utilizing ICOs doing Pump and Dump\" plan. The Securities and Change Fee issued its first public warning in July, indicating that digital cash could also be topic to securities laws, and the agency adopted up in September by charging two corporations with ICO fraud.

In the last 24 hours for example, it is down nine percent adding on to their weekly 13 percent loss. It might have been because of the mixed reaction following the upgrade from 8MB to 32MB happening at a time when the average daily transaction is around 20K at 80kb per block. When Bitcoin Cash shall utilize full capacity and fill 32MB per block we don't know. Considering competition especially from Bitcoin and Ethereum-the latter plans on sharding, it might take a while before that happens.\nFrom the News Is Bitcoin Cash a wonderful product? Absolutely! Will it replace Bitcoin and dominate the crypto world? Well, maybe, who knows! For investors, speculators and traders, waiting on the sidelines and timing good entry positions can be prudent than trading with every slight swing. Yes, they had an upgrade this week but is it convincing enough for merchants and retail users to say switch from say Litecoin and use Bitcoin Cash to transact? Time is everything and right now, sellers are pressing the gas pedal with eyes set at $600.\nWhat we do know for sure is that Bitcoin Cash has new capacity now that we have a 32MB block in place. There will be space for new user cases and yes, just to clarify, majority of the Bitcoin Cash network would be run by small data centers with better connections and which have the ability to carry out network back hauls. In my view, I don't really think there would be problems of centralization as many people have been made to believe.\nNot everyone can become a full node and forget about your smart phone ever becoming one. The issue of centralization might crop up not because of storage issue or bandwidth limitation but from centralization of hardware via economies of scale. It's a design weakness and that's why we have these huge mining pools who are set to get richer with every block size increment. So, will Bitcoin Cash becomes another centralized business in the future? I leave that to you.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nIn the weekly chart, Bitcoin Cash prices are basically topping and after week ending May 13 double bar bear reversal pattern, it is likely that prices might dip lower. Notice that last week ended lower despite abnormal volumes suggesting that there were some form of liquidation and rejection of higher highs at resistance. So, unless otherwise, this week will likely end as a bear and in that case we shall continue holding our bear stance as we aim for week ending April 8 lows at around $700.\nDaily Chart Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nLike the weekly chart, BCH sellers are in charge and for sure, this might continue. As it looks, bears have already broken through the first level of distribution at $1200. From the look of things and basing this on the general trend, swing traders can initiate shorts at current prices and aim for $800, $700 and $600 round numbers.\nThe post Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Analysis (May 19, 2018) appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:43:31.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3661e9281cbd4e1a95f380c0dcbcf948b4201c88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5kn7NitFT61zjdSoRd1Y34ksBHUicT4TSuvdXtpngDkY", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Freakin' Bitcoin :P", "title_full": "Freakin' Bitcoin :P", "published": "2018-05-19T03:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3661e9281cbd4e1a95f380c0dcbcf948b4201c88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5kn7NitFT61zjdSoRd1Y34ksBHUicT4TSuvdXtpngDkY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-19T03:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Freakin' Bitcoin :P", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:51:59.114+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a4f4a9769de44ffa9ef80b46cf699e47d2198db8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8M6oP54MIiFyyV5z0gUtBdwVF3wItt0mvj.OAWEZmziGTvfR5czZD4f_dcsaZl7mVo2EMuOjjG5A2IIge16SRnskfZU8gxIW8W7mXVnCW50VKnvglNB07qnua28n1Q.XY-", "site_full": "www.standard.net", "site": "standard.net", "site_section": "http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/index.php/nav/rss/68c99963de9a9573", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest Software News RSS feed – Big News Network", "title": "Crypto wealth sinks $45 billion while bitcoin bros party", "title_full": "Crypto wealth sinks $45 billion while bitcoin bros party", "published": "2018-05-19T03:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82424, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a4f4a9769de44ffa9ef80b46cf699e47d2198db8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8M6oP54MIiFyyV5z0gUtBdwVF3wItt0mvj.OAWEZmziGTvfR5czZD4f_dcsaZl7mVo2EMuOjjG5A2IIge16SRnskfZU8gxIW8W7mXVnCW50VKnvglNB07qnua28n1Q.XY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-19T03:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto wealth sinks $45 billion while bitcoin bros party", "text": "Crypto wealth sinks $45 billion while bitcoin bros party Friday , May 18, 2018 - 9:05 AM Andrea Tan and Blake Schmidt\n(c) 2018, Bloomberg.\nSo much for the Blockchain Week bounce.\nWith thousands of cryptocurrency diehards swarming into Manhattan for this week’s Consensus 2018 conference and other industry related events, the prediction from bitcoin bulls like Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors was that the hype-filled gathering would trigger a market rally.\nAlas, not even a trio of (rented) Lamborghinis, a 1,000-person yacht party and a performance by 46-year-old rapper Snoop Dogg could prevent the value of virtual currencies tracked by Coinmarketcap.com from sinking by $45 billion since May 11. Bitcoin, the most popular of the bunch, dropped 3.7 percent this week to $8,117.43 even as Arthur Hayes -- the crypto exchange executive whose firm rented the Lamborghinis -- predicted a surge to $50,000 by year-end.\n“While there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on cryptocurrencies strengthened during the conference,” Lee wrote in a note Friday. He cited over exuberance about the prospects for rising institutional demand and lingering concerns about the regulatory framework for depressing prices.\nThis week’s slump is far from extreme by crypto standards, but the market’s resistance to Blockchain Week’s ballyhoo highlights one of the arguments often used by virtual currency pessimists -- that most people who are willing to buy the coins have already piled in.\nWhile bulls point to a vast pool of pent-up demand from professional money managers, it’s far from clear that regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere will evolve in ways that attract institutional investors. Many Wall Street pros have dismissed the market as a speculative bubble, while Warren Buffett has likened bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”\nThis week’s losses may have been the result of unmet expectations surrounding Consensus 2018, said Sunny Lu, the chief executive officer of blockchain-based logistics company VeChain Tech and one of the conference speakers.\n“The quality of projects and speakers were not really as good as expected,” Lu said. “I guess people just got disappointed.”\ncurrency\nSign up for e-mail news updates.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

He said if you support any altcoin (or bitcoin fork), you're essentially supporting the continuation of the legacy fiat currency system, as you're supporting the printing of money out of thin air.\nI think this is sort of apt. Especially if you believe POW is the best form of securing a blockchain.\nBecause there is a limited amount of energy and resources to pour into proof of work it can be surmised that the security of blockchain networks is the sum total of the hashpower behind ALL of POW cryptocurrencies. And to the extent we assign VALUE to the tokens on a competing blockchain, and hashpower to go along with it we are just minting more \"bitcoin\" in the broadest sence.\nOne reason we maximalists (yes, I am yet another Monero shill who calls himself a BTC maximalist* ) cringe so hard when the topic of BCASH comes up is it is, among other things, one of the most directly Bitcoin diluting projects in every way. At 1/6th the price of BTC it has effectively minted another 3.5MM Bitcoins. And steals hashpower and value from the actual Bitcoin chain (while trying to coopt the name, and history of Bitcoin at the same time, bastards).\nSo yes. The vast, vast, vast majority of altcoin projects are a direct or indirect attack on Bitcoin.\nHowever there is value in those chains. For example ETH teaches us LOTS of important lessons. It has shown us what a ginormous attack surface can do. It is also showing us what happens when you have an actual KING driving the \"consensus\". I remember that time that Buterin, with all the grace of a 6 year old threatened to \"leave the project\" if certain things didn't change. Can you imagine what a clusterfuck Bitcoin would be if Satoshi had stuck around? Even if he (or Vitalik for that matter) had the purest of motives, corruption would creep up in some form or another and poison the well.\nETH may survive just because of first mover in the whole programmable aspect. But Bitcoin adding things like RSK on *LAYER TWO* where it's much safer and does not touch the base protocol might just give ETH the reverse flippening with full ironic glory.\nIn fact the virtuous black hole of BITCOIN (BTC) will suck up all its bastard children in the end. Perhaps leaving a handful of favorites to fulfill parallel functions in harmony with big daddy BTC. What I don't know is how far along the path of sucking up all the meaningless paper-government-scrip-garbage BTC will have traveled before it turns on it's prodigal sons.\n*this is not the place to discuss my reasons for making a fairly glaring exception for Monero to my above maximalist screed. And, if fact, I hold a bit of cognitive dissonance against the fact I do make that exception. But I have my reasons... if you care what they are feel free to ask me outside of here.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T23:42:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "342d9393be7584a028742303963bbdcfc50e1dd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcJ9_g4qrMLaztfc9DDQKAm_kpsc7jH6fwQ9CNeB_boWmK07I483UlhSZYWnlcSc.DnHLb.gH9wDwq8_v98BWN2s-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "From One to Two: Bitcoin Cash – Purse: Save 20%+ on Amazon [2018]", "title_full": "From One to Two: Bitcoin Cash – Purse: Save 20%+ on Amazon [2018] : btc", "published": "2018-05-19T03:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.43, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "342d9393be7584a028742303963bbdcfc50e1dd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcJ9_g4qrMLaztfc9DDQKAm_kpsc7jH6fwQ9CNeB_boWmK07I483UlhSZYWnlcSc.DnHLb.gH9wDwq8_v98BWN2s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HostFat", "published": "2018-05-19T03:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "From One to Two: Bitcoin Cash – Purse: Save 20%+ on Amazon [2018]", "text": "submitted by /u/HostFat\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blog.purse.io/from-one-to-two-bitcoin-cash-bad5ec8539f4"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T23:28:03.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "814919daed7a74578d92e2eb394044e7dd455d41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqx69noRD73Z7WYxCLdBnggStS0IeIyXddBwW_5RItNNlyZgjbCdkrGBftqNvJKzbDBviIgefI9DlVzoCWkZY61ZJlnxC8JHaJKDK4ADATtf2N8hTgnsfKrwg4R_1zSzUQEmMKx10TptA--", "site_full": "buzzfixtoday.online", "site": "buzzfixtoday.online", "site_section": "http://buzzfixtoday.online/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BuzzFix Today (News All Day, Updated, Without Spin)", "title": "Bitcoin price: Massive boost for ETHEREUM and bitcoin as China backs blockchain", "title_full": "Bitcoin price: Massive boost for ETHEREUM and bitcoin as China backs blockchain", "published": "2018-05-19T03:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "814919daed7a74578d92e2eb394044e7dd455d41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqx69noRD73Z7WYxCLdBnggStS0IeIyXddBwW_5RItNNlyZgjbCdkrGBftqNvJKzbDBviIgefI9DlVzoCWkZY61ZJlnxC8JHaJKDK4ADATtf2N8hTgnsfKrwg4R_1zSzUQEmMKx10TptA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-19T03:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price: Massive boost for ETHEREUM and bitcoin as China backs blockchain", "text": "Business | By admin Bitcoin price: Massive boost for ETHEREUM and bitcoin as China backs blockchain\nChina’s notoriously harsh approach to the cryptocurrency space looks to be softening following news that government’s official Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing, has started ranking the strength and future potential of the underlying blockchain technology of Bitcoin , Ethereum, Steem and Lisk.\nAlthough prices are yet to respond with Bitcoin continuing south today having fallen from $8,763 to $7962 over the last seven days, the move to rank the underlying technology is a clear sign that, according to experts, China’s crypto frost is beginning to thaw.\nDaniele Bianchi, Assistant Professor of Finance at Warwick business school described the move as, “basically a government-led assessment of blockchain experts which will be based on feedbacks and reviews from academics, industry operators and governmental agencies.\nHe said: “The reason why it is important are twofold; first, it makes clear that a massive market like China is openly considering blockchain technologies to boost productivity. Second, it relaxes the view that the Chinese government is openly against cryptocurrencies and their use.”\nKevin Murcko, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinMetro that China’s position on crypto is changing over the realisation that as a global economic super-power it must also be a “front runner in the digital economy era.”\nMr Murcko says that China’s message on Bitcoin looks mixed as although it “sees cryptocurrency as a threat to its financial stability”, he said: “China wants to be the front runner in the digital economy era, and as the nation readies for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it sees cryptocurrency and blockchain – a technology with enormous potential to remove pain points and inefficiencies – as an economic game-changer.”\nMr Murcko simplifies China’s Global Public Chain Assessment Index as “essentially an attempt by the Chinese government to identify useful blockchain projects.” The list will work as a “guide” for government, enterprise and research institutes, and represent an important milestone for the technology which, to-date, has lacked completely independent assessment.\nHowever, analyst Joseph Young from CCN.com reports that the cryptocurrency community was “taken aback” by the ranking of bitcoin at 13, arguing that bitcoin has the “longest track record as the most secure and dominant cryptocurrency in the global market”.\nHe wrote on twitter: “China ranks Ethereum as the #1 blockchain. Bitcoin is ranked at #13, same as Verge. But when an organisation says bitcoin is in the same ranking as Verge, you know its (sic) highly incompetent.”\nChina’s move towards crypto looks set to continue, the country was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organisation database.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.express.co.uk/latest/bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniele bianchi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warwick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T04:11:55.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3267a3aacfb610d592e496e983278f536e14f367", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdYBLJn9B6.my9F6CaTC7XI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Analytics of Bitcoin prices by the end of 2019", "title_full": "Analytics of Bitcoin prices by the end of 2019", "published": "2018-05-19T03:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3267a3aacfb610d592e496e983278f536e14f367", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdYBLJn9B6.my9F6CaTC7XI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "trrewqs", "published": "2018-05-19T03:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Analytics of Bitcoin prices by the end of 2019", "text": "I would like to tell you about the analyst of the Bitcoin price by the end of 2019 on the basis of the dynamics of a hashtraite\nDue to mining Bitcoin price will rise to $ 36,000 by 2019\nA new study by Fundstrat Global Advisors shows that by the end of 2019 the price of bitcoin will reach $ 36,000,reported co-founder Tom Lee.\nAnalysis of the relationship between the cost of mining and the price made it possible to conclude that the price of the cryptocurrency will vary between $ 20,000 and $ 64,000 by the end of 2019.\nThese calculations take into account the price of BTC in relation to the profitability of mining, which shows \"a reliable long-term level of support.\"\n\"We expect the mining economy to grow over the next few years and the bitcoin price will reach around $ 36,000\"\nWhat do you think about it?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T10:27:52.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c90efd9fa5f1a81ee39bf9b1663541ca6077369", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZs.PX6lLKk4QPnbaRPo1So-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Ethereum vs Bitcoin as goal of investments", "title_full": "Ethereum vs Bitcoin as goal of investments", "published": "2018-05-19T03:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c90efd9fa5f1a81ee39bf9b1663541ca6077369", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZs.PX6lLKk4QPnbaRPo1So-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sergienkoe", "published": "2018-05-19T03:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ethereum vs Bitcoin as goal of investments", "text": "Quote: from: inillo on January 10, 2018, 10:27:19 PM Many people out there don´t believe that Ethereum can be a long term hodling, they simply use it participate in ICOs, sell and buy bitcoin again with the profit.

Unlike stocks that is based on the company performance. I think Warren Buffett pretty much nailed it on exactly why Bitcoin is so great and it was unfortunate he didn't realize this.\nA currency or any asset that's linked to a government or bank or an enterprise becomes dependent on these entities. Through out history we have seen too many cases where a country and its government can collapse, a banking industry or an enterprise can fail and so does the linked currency or assets. Even the superpower United States could not escape economic recessions and devalue of USD over time. So how is that a good thing that a currency or an asset is backed by anything or is dependent on anything? It is not because no one can guaranty a government won't fail, won't print more money which cause inflation and devalue the currency. No one can guaranty an enterprise doi ng very well today will continue to do well in the future. So why is Bitcoin so great?\nBitcoin is so great because it is precisely what Warren Buffett said. Bitcoin is not backed by anything, it's not linked to any government, banks, or enterprise. It is an independent distributed network owned by people everywhere. For this reason, Bitcoin is immune to collapsing government, failing bank or enterprises, or even war. Bitcoin is separated from all of that and that's why it is a great hedge against everything else and a great store of value.\nPeople will slowly catch on to this. In the stock market you place trust in a company stock, you can be wiped out completely because that company failed miserably and gone bankrupt. You have no control over that. Your wealth went to zero because of that company's failure. In a fiat currency it can devalue so fast due to the actions of a government, and yet again, you have no control over that. But in Bitcoin you have 100% c ontrol because it's value is what you and everyone else place in it. We the people of the world have the sole power to destroy Bitcoin when we no longer place trust in it. That's the only way Bitcoin will go to zero. The world government can ban it, make it illegal, but it will never destroy Bitcoin as long as people place value in it. This is why Bitcoin is so great because it is the people of this world that gives Bitcoin value and nothing else.\nThe rise of Bitcoin value over the last 9 years is proof that more and more people place trust in Bitcoin. That's the true value of Bitcoin is because people want to hold on to it. The volatility we are seeing is because of new people not understanding Bitcoin and they were not buying because they place trust in Bitcoin, but they were chasing quick bucks. But Bitcoin doesn't fall to zero because more and more people are becoming educated and aware of how powerful Bitcion really is. The ability to become independent of everyt hing else. The ability to take control into your own hands. Another quote by Warren Buffett, and many other popular figures saying Bitcoin is what the next guy willing to pay for it. Ding ding ding, Bingo! They just hit the nail on the head, that's the intrinsic value of Bitcoin not affected by anything but what we trust it to be.\nIf the United States government collapse tomorrow USD will probably be worthless, but Bitcoin will not go to zero. If the biggest banks of Wall Street went bankrupt, a lot of people will probably lose a ton of money, but Bitcoin will not go to zero. Even in an apocalypse world war, Bitcoin lives on because it doesn't care about all that.

Unlike stocks that is based on the company performance. I think Warren Buffett pretty much nailed it on exactly why Bitcoin is so great and it was unfortunate he didn't realize this.\nA currency or any asset that's linked to a government or bank or an enterprise becomes dependent on these entities. Through out history we have seen too many cases where a country and its government can collapse, a banking industry or an enterprise can fail and so does the linked currency or assets. Even the superpower United States could not escape economic recessions and devalue of USD over time. So how is that a good thing that a currency or an asset is backed by anything or is dependent on anything? It is not because no one can guaranty a government won't fail, won't print more money which cause inflation and devalue the currency. No one can guaranty an enterprise doi ng very well today will continue to do well in the future. So why is Bitcoin so great?\nBitcoin is so great because it is precisely what Warren Buffett said. Bitcoin is not backed by anything, it's not linked to any government, banks, or enterprise. It is an independent distributed network owned by people everywhere. For this reason, Bitcoin is immune to collapsing government, failing bank or enterprises, or even war. Bitcoin is separated from all of that and that's why it is a great hedge against everything else and a great store of value.\nPeople will slowly catch on to this. In the stock market you place trust in a company stock, you can be wiped out completely because that company failed miserably and gone bankrupt. You have no control over that. Your wealth went to zero because of that company's failure. In a fiat currency it can devalue so fast due to the actions of a government, and yet again, you have no control over that. But in Bitcoin you have 100% c ontrol because it's value is what you and everyone else place in it. We the people of the world have the sole power to destroy Bitcoin when we no longer place trust in it. That's the only way Bitcoin will go to zero. The world government can ban it, make it illegal, but it will never destroy Bitcoin as long as people place value in it. This is why Bitcoin is so great because it is the people of this world that gives Bitcoin value and nothing else.\nThe rise of Bitcoin value over the last 9 years is proof that more and more people place trust in Bitcoin. That's the true value of Bitcoin is because people want to hold on to it. The volatility we are seeing is because of new people not understanding Bitcoin and they were not buying because they place trust in Bitcoin, but they were chasing quick bucks. But Bitcoin doesn't fall to zero because more and more people are becoming educated and aware of how powerful Bitcion really is. The ability to become independent of everyt hing else. The ability to take control into your own hands. Another quote by Warren Buffett, and many other popular figures saying Bitcoin is what the next guy willing to pay for it. Ding ding ding, Bingo! They just hit the nail on the head, that's the intrinsic value of Bitcoin not affected by anything but what we trust it to be.\nIf the United States government collapse tomorrow USD will probably be worthless, but Bitcoin will not go to zero. If the biggest banks of Wall Street went bankrupt, a lot of people will probably lose a ton of money, but Bitcoin will not go to zero. Even in an apocalypse world war, Bitcoin lives on because it doesn't care about all that. We have our Bitcoin stashed and it remains valuable because we trust in it.\nsubmitted by /u/Tekterra\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:08:30.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c2faa98027bd5be676128794a7bad8d049e9e06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8FbTiLyRRk4aehijSRibBIUK31jcEwEXbUBAeovBphDzPEDpS5Om2teDPdG0495h1NUrjVEjnq4l.FXR__lO.0K6BOiO.n3i4-", "site_full": "www.xbt.money", "site": "xbt.money", "site_section": "http://www.xbt.money/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "XBT.MONEY", "title": "Inside the Competitive World of OTC Bitcoin Trading", "title_full": "Inside the Competitive World of OTC Bitcoin Trading", "published": "2018-05-19T03:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-otc-brokers-1068x1068-660x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1c2faa98027bd5be676128794a7bad8d049e9e06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8FbTiLyRRk4aehijSRibBIUK31jcEwEXbUBAeovBphDzPEDpS5Om2teDPdG0495h1NUrjVEjnq4l.FXR__lO.0K6BOiO.n3i4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xbt.money", "published": "2018-05-19T03:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Inside the Competitive World of OTC Bitcoin Trading", "text": "Inside the Competitive World of OTC Bitcoin Trading May 19, 2018 16 Views\nMarkets and Prices\nIf you work in cryptocurrency and are a member of Linkedin, you’re probably familiar with OTC bitcoin brokers. They’ll message you, out of the blue, asking if you know any private sellers, and will offer to set up a deal for your mutual benefit. The majority of these men (for they are always men) are genuine in their intentions. This does not disguise the fact, though, that BTC brokers are little more than sharks circling the same prey.\nAlso read: Research Paper Finds Transaction Patterns Can Degrade Zcash Privacy Brokers Outnumber Buyers and Sellers 100:1\nAnyone can become a bitcoin broker: change your Linkedin title to “OTC Bitcoin Broker” and you’ve done it. Brokerage is a job that, like most cryptocurrency roles, outside of development, requires no formal qualifications. Just as anyone can call themselves an ICO advisor, anyone can assume the mantle of bitcoin broker, consigning them to start spamming Linkedin users for buyers and highly coveted sellers.\nTo understand the viral spread of brokers, it’s necessary to understand the conditions that led to large OTC sellers coming about. Back in the day, it was possible to acquire a lot of bitcoin for very little money. A lot of people mined it; some made it from trading shitcoins; and a few simply bought a bunch of BTC and then had the presence of mind to hodl, through thick and thin, for years.\nMost brokers will take on anything from 500 BTC upwards as an OTC deal, often operating on behalf of family funds seeking to acquire bitcoin in bulk. But what brokers are really chasing is the big one – deals of 10,000 BTC or more, in which a brokerage commission of 3% is worth millions of dollars. The number of bitcoin addresses containing between 10k and 100k BTC sits at little more than 100, however, and while some sellers have their coins distributed across multiple wallets, bona fide whales looking to sell are rare. Because the rewards for finding one are so great, a swarm of brokers, each chasing “the big one”, has proliferated. How an OTC Deal Works\nSellers want to sell OTC to avoid the sort of slippage that occurs when unloading large amounts of BTC on an exchange. Whales also value their privacy, and while they are still required to undergo KYC to complete an OTC deal, their identity is only going to be shared with the broker, their attorney, and the escrow service. Normally, even the buyer won’t know the identity of the person they are buying the coins from. The seller provides “proof of satoshi” by moving a fraction of a bitcoin from the wallet they control, the buyer provides proof of funds in the form of a bank certification of deposit or credit and a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and a letter of intent (LOI) are signed. The process usually works as follows: Attorney for the buyer prepares LOI detailing terms including BTC purchase amount, commission, net discount and other details Proof of funds is provided within a specific timeframe of signing the LOI. A screenshot is not accepted: cryptographically provided proof of coin, sent via the blockchain, is required Master Fee Protection Agreement as well as Draft Purchase Agreement and Escrow Agreement may then be circulated and signed by all parties Money is placed in escrow, escrow verifies receipt of funds and BTC is sent to buyer’s wallet Transfer may be done in full or in tranches depending on the agreement\nGiven the desire of buyer and seller to preserve their privacy, and the need for each party to be connected in the first place, brokers play a vital role. But due to the lucrative prize at stake, it’s a job that attracts a lot of chancers – and a lot of Linkedin requests, much to the chagrin of other cryptocurrency users.

The studies on this topic paint very different pictures, although they share a few similarities. The most recent study claims that Bitcoin mining will consume 0.5% of the world’s electricity by year’s end. That’s a somewhat worrisome statistic, albeit one that isn’t based on all the facts. Bitcoin Mining is a Power-hungry Industry\nNo one can deny that there is vast electricity usage associated with mining Bitcoin. This is not just the case with Bitcoin, though, as it applies to virtually all cryptocurrencies these days. Anything that requires hefty computational work will need a lot of electricity. Supercomputers are no different in this regard.\nEven so, Bitcoin mining attracts a lot of negative attention because of its electricity requirements. A new study by a Dutch specialist claims that the Bitcoin mining industry will consume as much as 0.5% of the world’s electricity by late 2018. While that may sound rather problematic, it is not necessarily a major concern when looking at the bigger picture.\nThis study bases its findings on the contention that the current Bitcoin mining ecosystem uses as much electricity as the country of Ireland. That particular claim has been subject to a lot of controversy and scrutiny, as it is very loosely based on facts and involves some calculations which seemingly don’t add up. Using that study as a basis for subsequent claims regarding Bitcoin mining’s electricity usage will only lead to more confusion and misinformation.\nThere is no adequate way of predicting how much electricity will be used by the Bitcoin mining industry by late 2018. Most of the calculations made in this regard are based on partial information, speculation, and some desire to make Bitcoin mining look extremely bad. A scientific discussion regarding this topic seemingly makes a lot of sense, but since the research is often derived from incomplete findings by someone else, the issues are only compounded even further.\nAdditionally, studies like these tend to overlook one critical aspect of Bitcoin mining. The use of renewable energy should not be overlooked by any means. Successfully mining Bitcoin for profit requires the use of the cheapest electricity source available. Right now, renewable energy fits the bill perfectly. This is part of the reason why so many mining operations are set up in regions with an abundance of renewable energy.\nHow all of this will evolve moving forward is anybody’s guess at this stage. Global interest in mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is not slowing down, even though individual users face a tough time turning a profit. Additionally, currencies such as Ethereum will switch to proof-of-stake at some point, completely removing the mining aspect. Those factors are, once again, being overlooked by a study pertaining to Bitcoin mining’s electricity usage.

Since January 2017, Dash’s coin is up 8,000%, roughly six times the rise of bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Evan Duffield created Dash, previously called “Darkcoin,” in January 2014.\nDash believes it’s created a superior cryptocurrency to bitcoin. From a consumer standpoint, the two work similarly: people who own dash can transfer the coins to prepaid debit cards like SpectroCoin and spend the money wherever debit cards are accepted. Some merchants in the U.S. accept dash directly for goods and services, but not many—a search on Dash’s website reveals just three places in Manhattan that deal in it, two of which are ATM machines. As of July 2017, Dash’s average transaction size was more than $10,000, indicating it’s being traded primarily as an investment, like bitcoin.\nDash’s self-funding structure makes it unique. When new dash are minted, 10% are set aside to improve the currency’s ecosystem. For example, Dash has planned to invest up to $1.2 million in Alt Thirty Six, which makes point-of-sale payment software targeting the legal marijuana industry in the U.S. Alt Thirty Six’s platform, of course, accepts dash. Dash power users vote to decide which projects get funded. Bitcoin relies on volunteers and donations to fund software development.\nDash’s two-tiered structure is another distinguishing trait. Unlike Bitcoin, where miners do all of the work on the blockchain, Dash has a tier of super-users called “masternodes” who perform key functions like deciding which projects get funded and enabling private transactions on Dash. To become a masternode, you must buy at least 1,000 dash coins—as of December 2017, that buy-in price is nearly $1 million. When new coins are created, 45% of them go to miners, 45% go to masternodes, and 10% go to the network.\nDue to Dash’s masternode structure, where power is more concentrated in the hands of some users, some critics say it’s not truly a decentralized network. Others, like authors Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar, take issue with the initial distribution of coins, saying it unfairly awarded its creators and early adopters with nearly two million dash on the first day of mining.\nRegardless, the coin is on a big rally the last year and some see it as a worthy alternative to bitcoin, especially given its lower price, which makes it easier to buy in. “I think there is a lot of value in some of the smaller tokens such as Dash, Ripple, and NEO. They are very cheap, but their business ecosystem is really strong,” former trader Naeem Aslam told Forbes contributor Ken Rapoza. Dash’s biggest competitors are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, and Litecoin.

Values are sinking and have done so since this time last week. We have seen some brief periods of calm which did begin to suggest that the markets would start a recovery, these however have been in vain and as it stands, the markets are still retreating at an alarming rate. We must look past the doom and gloom of today though and see how this may set us up for another market surge in the coming weeks. We have already discussed how Bitcoin and Ethereum could line up for another bull run soon, of course, Bitcoin Cash will play a huge part in this.\nMuch like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash has a historical tendency to take huge jumps up in the light of market droughts.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash is valued at $1,207.66, down 6.66% and overall, down from a recent spike of around $1,818.63.\nI want to focus on two historic Bitcoin Cash droughts now. First of all, on the 6 th of February, much like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash hit a low of $784.68. Almost two weeks later, on the 18 th of February, we saw Bitcoin Cash spike at $1,616.66. This is a rise of almost $800.00 in just under two weeks.\nNext, a similar event happened, when Bitcoin Cash bottomed out at $663.57 on the 12 th of April, before shooting up to $1,539.38 on the 24 th of April, once again, just under two weeks later. You might see a trend here, once more, this was a gain of around $800.00. So, with all of this in mind and the evidence before us, once the markets make a recovery, we could see Bitcoin Cash shoot up by around $800.00 in as little as ten days (ten days from the point the markets decide to calm down at least). At the current rate, this would see Bitcoin Cash hit just short of $2,000.00.\nThis aims to demonstrate that yes, at the moment things do look pretty bleak, overall though we still have hope that soon enough, things could very well swing upwards. This is based on speculation and thus is not investment advice. Please remember to trade safe.

Whether it is performing well, or not, you can almost guarantee that someone will be talking about it for good or bad. At the moment though, the news seems to be good, and experts are even predicting that it is destined for even greater heights in the future!\nOne reason that Bitcoin has been predicted to go far is due to the simplicity of the Bitcoin blockchain. It was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain . Because it was the first of its kind, in the years that Bitcoin has been created, there have been many other iterations of the technology, but not all have been successful.\nCertain updates, such as SegWit and the Lightning Network have meant that the efficiency of the blockchain can be improved even more. One thing that is for sure though, even with these improvements, the Bitcoin blockchain remains to be simple and basic, which adds to it’s a appeal, especially to those who are less technologically minded.\nWe can also note the fintech revolution as part of the reason for their success. Bitcoin has started to dominate fintech, especially since recent reports have shown that the Square Cash app is overtaking Paypal’s Venmo in terms of growth. In the first quarter of this year alone, Square has sold $34 million worth of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth in areas such as Africa, with a lot of payment platforms beginning to offer Bitcoin products. This has made payments a lot easier.\nDespite cryptocurrencies in their nature being incredibly volatile when it comes to the price, Bitcoin has, overtime shown itself to be relatively resilient to market events that sends other prices up and down. Bitcoin, on the whole only suffers single digit declines, and it has been predicted that as the market matures, Bitcoin will show even less of a reaction. This is great news for the oldest cryptocurrency.\nFinally, as time goes on, Bitcoin will continue to be adopted into the mainstream finance world. A recent example of this is when Nasdaq recently partnered with Gemini to ensure the fidelity of the exchange platform’s Bitcoin trading infrastructure.\nDespite seeing some price falls at the beginning of the year, 2018 has been great for Bitcoin inclusion. Both Coinbase and Goldman Sachs have recently unveiled products that have been targeted at institutional investors, along with OTC Bitcoin trading decks that will soon allow significant Bitcoin buy and sell orders without it negatively impacting the market.

One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.\nWell, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it's not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking .\n...secondly, Bitcoin and cryptos will not function well as the EROI of energy continues to fall, destroying the ability to scale up or maintain high technology . I recently watched a documentary about the Dark Ages on the history channel. After the fall of the ancient western Roman Empire (5th century), people who lived around the once great city in the 6th and 7th century knew that life was better in the past because they saw all these massive buildings and structures, but were now living mostly a peasant's life.\nIn just 3-4 generations, people no longer remembered what it was like to live in Rome during its heyday. The great culture, technology, food, and trade of the ancient Roman Empire were gone for good. Most Americans today have no idea what life is like after a collapse of society.\nNot only will Bitcoin and the cryptos not survive the coming Falling EROI energy collapse, either will most of the advanced technology. Sure, some technology will be around, but it will claim the same fate as the ancient Roman Empire. For this reason, gold will always remain the KING MONETARY METAL and asset.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand the Falling EROI of energy as they mislead their followers into investing in just another fly-by-night bubble.\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-18/why-gold-king-monetary-asset-not-bitcoin\nWhy Gold Is The King Monetary Asset, Not Bitcoin by SRSrocco Fri, 05/18/2018 - 09:23 By the SRSrocco Report , There seems to be a lot of misinformation being peddled on the internet about gold and bitcoin.

The studies on this topic paint very different pictures, although they share a few similarities. The most recent study claims that Bitcoin mining will consume 0.5% of the world’s electricity by year’s end. That’s a somewhat worrisome statistic, albeit one that isn’t based on all the facts. Bitcoin Mining is a Power-hungry Industry\nNo one can deny that there is vast electricity usage associated with mining Bitcoin. This is not just the case with Bitcoin, though, as it applies to virtually all cryptocurrencies these days. Anything that requires hefty computational work will need a lot of electricity. Supercomputers are no different in this regard.\nEven so, Bitcoin mining attracts a lot of negative attention because of its electricity requirements. A new study by a Dutch specialist claims that the Bitcoin mining industry will consume as much as 0.5% of the world’s electricity by late 2018. While that may sound rather problematic, it is not necessarily a major concern when looking at the bigger picture.\nThis study bases its findings on the contention that the current Bitcoin mining ecosystem uses as much electricity as the country of Ireland. That particular claim has been subject to a lot of controversy and scrutiny, as it is very loosely based on facts and involves some calculations which seemingly don’t add up. Using that study as a basis for subsequent claims regarding Bitcoin mining’s electricity usage will only lead to more confusion and misinformation.\nThere is no adequate way of predicting how much electricity will be used by the Bitcoin mining industry by late 2018. Most of the calculations made in this regard are based on partial information, speculation, and some desire to make Bitcoin mining look extremely bad. A scientific discussion regarding this topic seemingly makes a lot of sense, but since the research is often derived from incomplete findings by someone else, the issues are only compounded even further.\nAdditionally, studies like these tend to overlook one critical aspect of Bitcoin mining. The use of renewable energy should not be overlooked by any means. Successfully mining Bitcoin for profit requires the use of the cheapest electricity source available. Right now, renewable energy fits the bill perfectly. This is part of the reason why so many mining operations are set up in regions with an abundance of renewable energy.\nHow all of this will evolve moving forward is anybody’s guess at this stage. Global interest in mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is not slowing down, even though individual users face a tough time turning a profit. Additionally, currencies such as Ethereum will switch to proof-of-stake at some point, completely removing the mining aspect. Those factors are, once again, being overlooked by a study pertaining to Bitcoin mining’s electricity usage.

This is roughly $200 higher than where it stood yesterday, and the currency has spiked by approximately five percent over the last 24 hours.\nThe prices of cryptocurrencies are exploding as the week comes to an end. Entities like Ethereum are also up, while the cryptocurrency market cap has added roughly $40 billion to its overall worth.\nInterestingly, the Coindesk Consensus Conference – which took place Monday through Wednesday – ultimately failed to give bitcoin the big boost many enthusiasts were expecting. While the price of the currency is rising now, hype surrounding the event did not produce the results several were hoping for, showing that cryptocurrency remains a highly speculative market; that price boosts can occur through unexpected means, and that things remain highly unpredictable when it comes to how certain forms of crypto will behave.\nOne source predicted that bitcoin would sustain support at the $8,200 levels, and that further declines would stop at both $8,100 and $8,000. Thus far, this appears to be coming true. The next target in sight is $8,400 as bitcoin continues to face diminishing selling pressure. Presently, $8,300 is offering newfound resistance for bitcoin’s price, and it is hard to determine when, exactly, $8,400 could come around.\nThe interesting thing about bitcoin is that despite the volatile nature of the coin, it continues to remain popular amongst users, and advocates’ loyalty towards the currency has yet to falter. A new report says that bitcoin mining now uses about as much energy as the entire country of Ireland – and energy demands don’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.\nIreland is a country with a healthy population – considerably larger than that of Iceland, which was the first country that outdid itself with bitcoin mining. It was reported only months ago that bitcoin mining was now using more energy in Iceland than what was necessary to power every residence within the nation’s borders. That’s a lot, to say the least…\nAustria appears next in line to be outdone by bitcoin mining energy. One source explains that bitcoin mining will soon require as much electricity as the entire German-speaking nation by the end of 2018.\nBetween cooling fans, manufacturing hardware and growing energy costs to operate bitcoin mining rigs, the process of extracting new coins will require as many as 7.67 gigawatts of power by the time 2019 is ready to roll along. That’s roughly one two-hundredth of all the electricity used on planet Earth.\nPresently, bitcoin mining requires only about 3.1 gigawatts of power. That means that by the end of 2018, this figure will have more than doubled. Cryptocurrency mining remains a popular past-time, and that popularity is likely to grow exponentially in the coming months as the final count of unmined bitcoins continues to shrink even further.\nThis leaves a lot of open-ended questions on the horizon, perhaps the biggest one being, “What kind of damage can bitcoin mining do to our environment?” This is an argument we’ve heard before, and will no doubt hear again as the energy required for bitcoin mining operations grows over time.

Square’s Market Cap Rises $8 Billion\nOn May 4, BTCManager reported that investors were initially not satisfied with Square’s $200,000 revenue from its bitcoin venture, considering that the integration of bitcoin by Square generated significant hype in both the fintech sector and cryptocurrency market.\nDespite the relatively low revenue margin of Square , the company’s market valuation and user base have continued to surge throughout 2018. Following its bitcoin integration, the stock price of Square increased from $35 to $55, by more than 57 percent. The market valuation of Square rose by a staggering $8 billion since November 2017, within a six-month period.\nSince 2016, the payment app of Square known as Square Cash recorded a 128 percent year-over-year growth, easily outpacing Venmo’s 74 percent revealed Nomura, a major Japanese bank, in its research. Dan Dolev, a financial analyst, also emphasized that Square has nearly caught up to the user base of Venmo and is currently one million users below Venmo.\n“Historically, Venmo saw more downloads versus Square, but the gap appears to have peaked in July 2017. With Square Cash App now open for bitcoin trading in most states, comparing its growth versus the popular Coinbase app is noteworthy. Here, while Coinbase saw growth peak around the holiday time — as bitcoin prices spiked — Coinbase’s growth has slowed from record levels, whereas Square Cash App experienced more balanced growth,” Dolev told CNBC . Advertisement advertisement\nAlthough Square saw a revenue of $200,000 in the first quarter of 2018 from its bitcoin sales, CNBC reported that it is because Square spent $33.9 million to purchase the cryptocurrency. That means, during that period, the price of bitcoin increased and Square was able to sell the cryptocurrency at a higher rate.\nSquare is a brokerage platform, and unlike cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase’s GDAX, the company does not generate revenue from fees. Binance , the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, was able to obtain $200 million in profit in the first quarter of 2018, surpassing the profit margin of Germany’s largest bank Deutsche Bank.\nIf the company hopes to generate more profit from its bitcoin venture, operating a proper bitcoin exchange that exists within the Square Cash app to enable users to buy, sell, and store the dominant cryptocurrency is an option. Investors Confident in Long-term Bitcoin-focused Vision\nThe market valuation of Square and the confidence of investors towards the U.S.-based FinTech app have not declined after the company released its small $200,000 revenue from its bitcoin venture, demonstrating that investors are satisfied with the long-term vision and strategy of Square to target the cryptocurrency sector.\nIn previous interviews and presentations, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey stated that he envisions bitcoin evolving into the native currency of the internet.\n“The internet is going to have a native currency so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin, but I hope it will be. If we were able to use it a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in,” said Dorsey at the Consensus 2018 cryptocurrency conference.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan dolev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venmo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fintech app square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nomura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "btcmanager  square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T15:43:12.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "038b726df67fef3ab06c7bfb0ead0e625d0e7d20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjx5AzR939tX7jfNH4piimzxIASBBlR9VNOV4AqT9Wc4_I2wv5VFNwm6CU8SvZvLFawl44wRokfzQbo2Xp8fcb0qA--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "When Thousands Filled a Hilton Ballroom to Ponder the Future of Bitcoin - The New York Times", "title_full": "When Thousands Filled a Hilton Ballroom to Ponder the Future of Bitcoin - The New York Times", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/19/business/19CRYPTOPHOTO-11/19CRYPTOPHOTO-11-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 190, "comments": 0, "shares": 190}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "038b726df67fef3ab06c7bfb0ead0e625d0e7d20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjx5AzR939tX7jfNH4piimzxIASBBlR9VNOV4AqT9Wc4_I2wv5VFNwm6CU8SvZvLFawl44wRokfzQbo2Xp8fcb0qA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "When Thousands Filled a Hilton Ballroom to Ponder the Future of Bitcoin - The New York Times", "text": "Image When Thousands Filled a Hilton Ballroom to Ponder the Future of Bitcoin A gathering in New York this week for Consensus 2018, a blockchain-themed event, had all of the trappings of a modern business conference — a sign that the once-fringe world is increasingly going mainstream.
