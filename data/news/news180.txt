It was the first digital currency to be introduced and has experienced phenomenal growth especially in the past one year. However, the price has since then been dropping but Joe Davis, a senior economist at Vanguard Group believes that it will lose all its value at some point. Davis is one of the analysts that seem to be against Bitcoin while others believe that Bitcoin will still deliver massive growth in the future. The Vanguard analyst recently stated that Bitcoin is a poor investment choice and that it is not a currency. He also added that Bitcoin’s biggest threats are the institutions that it was created to bypass. Davis believes that Bitcoin will continue to lose value and eventually its price will be Zero.\nDavis argues that Bitcoin does not match the characteristics of a currency yet it is considered as one. He also feels that its extreme volatility means it is not ideal as a store of value. The analyst claims that Bitcoin also lacks the characteristics necessary for it to be matched alongside traditional investments such as stocks and bonds.\nThose supporting cryptocurrencies view blockchain technology and digital currencies as alternatives to central bank systems. Davis believes that central banks will eventually come up with their own cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems which they will use to improve their financial services. Additionally, Bitcoin is being adopted in different industries for the efficiency that it provides. Decentralized technology is believed to be the real breakthrough in this narrative.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has been widely adopted over the years and has since enjoyed massive gains. Only in the past few months has its price started dropping by huge margins leading to concerns about the future of Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market in general. It is not clear whether the price will keep falling or whether it will recover.\nThe current situation with Bitcoin has led to a sort of dilemma, especially for cryptocurrency traders. Bitcoin has proved to be extremely volatile, thus making it less suitable as an investment. There is also the uncertainty about the future of the cryptocurrency which is also amplified by the fact that cryptocurrency is intangible and it is not backed by any physical asset.\nSuggested Articles\nEthereum: Commodity or Security: What’s the Difference? How Bitcoin Can Destroy the World. Completely! Bitcoin’s Lightning Network: How Can it Solve Bitcoin’s Biggest Problem Another reason for bitcoin’s vagueness is that many analysts feel that Bitcoin is treated as an asset and a store of value despite it being considered as a digital currency. There is also the issue about the use of cryptocurrencies to facilitate illegal activities such as money laundering and drug trafficking which has been one of the reasons why regulatory authorities have been against cryptocurrencies.\nAlthough Bitcoin and altcoins are considered threats to fiat currencies and the banking system, they will most likely not replace the monetary system but rather encourage upgrades and the adoption of blockchain technology.\nBuy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: How to Buy EOS Coin: A Complete Guide USD/JPY Progressive Zig-Zag Potentially Targeting 111.60 Coordinated Action against Bad ICO Players Underway Technical Checks For EUR/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD & NZD/USD: 22.05.2018 E-mini S&P 500 Index (ES) Futures Technical Analysis – May 22, 2018 Forecast Cheetah Mobile Inc.

That eye-watering amount was worth a mere $25 at the time, or a fraction of a penny apiece.\nYet at the time, it wasn't so much the number of bitcoins spent or the product involved â the event was a milestone simply because the transaction had taken place. Though limited to 16 slices of pizza, the era of bitcoin-powered commerce had begun â not to mention the silent wincing over spending millions of dollars for two pizzas.\n\"It wasn't like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\" Hanyecz said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times , adding:\n\"No one knew it was going to get so big.\"\nStill, the tradition lives on, with the purchase being used to track other notable bitcoin milestones.\nIndeed, it was Hanyecz himself who would later participate in what might one day be known as \"Lightning Pizza Day\" after he used the next-generation technology, now in development, to purchase a pieÂ in February .\nPizza image via Shutterstock\nRelated Stories Bitcoin Fights Back, But Too Early to Call Bull Reversal German Authorities Sold $14 Million in Seized Cryptos Over Price Fears", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/failed-bull-breakout-leaves-bitcoin-eyeing-drop-8k/", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-pizza-bought-10000-btc/", "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/", "https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin-pizza-day-widget/&quot;", "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/&quot;", "https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin-pizza-day-widget/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5gevPnu18l84_Bt2wPbkFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTQ0O2g9Mjg4/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/be6f3b8a9b6457641c627298bc452ae5);", "https://www.coindesk.com/initial-coin-offerings-setting-capital-free-thats-huge/", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-2-lightning-payment-just-made-history/&quot;", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hits-one-month-low-10k-sell-off-resumes/", "https://www.coindesk.com/initial-coin-offerings-setting-capital-free-thats-huge/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5gevPnu18l84_Bt2wPbkFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTQ0O2g9Mjg4/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/be6f3b8a9b6457641c627298bc452ae5", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-2-lightning-payment-just-made-history/", "https://www.coindesk.com/bank-argentina-just-added-bitcoin-cross-border-payments/", "https://www.coindesk.com/failed-bull-breakout-leaves-bitcoin-eyeing-drop-8k/&quot;", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-pizza-bought-10000-btc/&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T20:31:53.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf45def7258a75a206ac038f99ab13e2f0978c54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggkLf0wIs1VKpDU92WVuEJQyWe.XoSvkVAypuztuYuw45WkCRNsvxY2tpRmBYZy04mqgb25r0hYvlA--", "site_full": "sg.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/topic/economy", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business finance, stock market, quotes, news", "title": "He Paid How Much?!

That's Huge\nA deal was struck: 10,000 BTC for two Papa John's pizzas. That eye-watering amount was worth a mere $25 at the time, or a fraction of a penny apiece.\nYet at the time, it wasn't so much the number of bitcoins spent or the product involved - the event was a milestone simply because the transaction had taken place. Though limited to 16 slices of pizza, the era of bitcoin-powered commerce had begun - not to mention the silent wincing over spending millions of dollars for two pizzas.\n\"It wasn't like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\" Hanyecz said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times , adding:\n\"No one knew it was going to get so big.\"\nStill, the tradition lives on, with the purchase being used to track other notable bitcoin milestones.\nIndeed, it was Hanyecz himself who would later participate in what might one day be known as \"Lightning Pizza Day\" after he used the next-generation technology, now in development, to purchase a pieÂ in February .\nPizza A Bank In Argentina Is Now Using Bitcoin for Cross-Border Payments Bitcoin Hits One-Month Low As $10K Sell-Off Resumes", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/failed-bull-breakout-leaves-bitcoin-eyeing-drop-8k/", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-pizza-bought-10000-btc/", "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/", "https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin-pizza-day-widget/&quot;", "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/disruptions-betting-on-bitcoin/&quot;", "https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin-pizza-day-widget/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5gevPnu18l84_Bt2wPbkFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTQ0O2g9Mjg4/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/be6f3b8a9b6457641c627298bc452ae5);", "https://www.coindesk.com/initial-coin-offerings-setting-capital-free-thats-huge/", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-2-lightning-payment-just-made-history/&quot;", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hits-one-month-low-10k-sell-off-resumes/", "https://www.coindesk.com/initial-coin-offerings-setting-capital-free-thats-huge/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5gevPnu18l84_Bt2wPbkFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTQ0O2g9Mjg4/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/be6f3b8a9b6457641c627298bc452ae5", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-2-lightning-payment-just-made-history/", "https://www.coindesk.com/bank-argentina-just-added-bitcoin-cross-border-payments/", "https://www.coindesk.com/failed-bull-breakout-leaves-bitcoin-eyeing-drop-8k/&quot;", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-pizza-bought-10000-btc/&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:43:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b968b7dacd28158eb21424b90132ce0a33fe77a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTg9TswnY2oJtDwxHZe2NU.x3JpdG5BdsqzhJKsxCs5zFdNEjQepljRQ4K.B4H2GRMql5yhXOvYcvRrXD8WdlFTj4Ql444DfKYo0BI_JO.MmA--", "site_full": "e-mailscamalerts.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://e-mailscamalerts.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free E-Mail Scam Alert", "title": "The Bitcoin Code Don t miss a moment", "title_full": "The Bitcoin Code Don t miss a moment", "published": "2018-05-22T19:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b968b7dacd28158eb21424b90132ce0a33fe77a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTg9TswnY2oJtDwxHZe2NU.x3JpdG5BdsqzhJKsxCs5zFdNEjQepljRQ4K.B4H2GRMql5yhXOvYcvRrXD8WdlFTj4Ql444DfKYo0BI_JO.MmA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "emailscam alert (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T19:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Bitcoin Code Don t miss a moment", "text": "From: \"The Bitcoin Code\" <ubzemkn@fungroups.eu>\nReply: \"The Bitcoin Code\" <ubzemkn@fungroups.eu>\nDate: Tue, 22 May 2018 19:50:05 +0300\nSubject: Don't miss a moment\nAttachments oxuyaekyhuzhip.jpeg By Email Scam Alerts", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "don", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T11:11:17.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a29d69249bd0ca7d136264b039980972b4fbe522", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsV3ndThX8s9c.01LSSdW5o0Ig5rWW1jyT8rYf5qjUrNXk_pkH_6KUerCfrp.MS17TbpA84GmIoIfQ2yaKxE3tKfSFmHw0A7FES.JKCBxpNZZOL3ePXWHeUyA-", "site_full": "www.sfgate.com", "site": "sfgate.com", "site_section": "http://www.sfgate.com/business/", "site_categories": ["media", "social"], "section_title": "Business News -

Local media said the ransom note was left at the scene. \"We demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child's safe release — non negotiable,\" read the reported note. This case appears to be the first ransom demand in South Africa made in virtual currency. In March, US hackers demanding a ransom payable in bitcoin attacked computers of the Atlanta city government in the southern state of Georgia.

Despite certain positive fundamentals for the Crypto market, Bitcoin are not making big bullish gains for the time being. The dynamic support area is being squeezed right now to keep the bullish bias going, so impulsive bullish breakout above $8,500 is needed in the coming days. As for the current scenario, the price is currently quite bearish in nature inside the range, whereas a breakout above $8,500 is the ultimate need. A breakout above $8,500 and later above $9,000 will strengthen the bullish momentum with a target towards $10,000 in the short term. As the price remains above $8,000 area with a daily close, the bullish bias is expected to continue further.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

If you’ve read the news lately you might already know all this.\nWhat you might not know is Laszlo’s one of GORUCK’s oldest employees. He built our very first website and has managed our IT systems ever since.\nTo celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day and honor our very own Laszlo, GORUCK is now accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, and while supplies last all Bitcoin purchases will receive a free Bitcoin Pizza Day patch. Patches will ship separately within 90 days.\n“Back in 2010 I bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. It wasn’t worth much at the time and I was pretty happy to get ‘free’ food for my internet money. My main job has been GORUCK all along and Bitcoin was just a hobby for me. I certainly did not expect it to get so popular so quickly! Here we are in 2018 and now Bitcoin is suddenly a very valuable asset used by millions of people all over the world. Bitcoin allows people to transact money among each other without needing to trust, without asking for permission, and without a middle man. It is a great personal achievement for me to be able to accept Bitcoin at GORUCK.com . Even if you’re not a Bitcoin user or haven’t heard of it before, I hope you can at least check it out and see why we’re so excited about it.”\n– Laszlo Hanyecz Bitcoin Pizza Guy & GORUCK Developer\nWant to learn more about Bitcoin?

No other date, save for January 3, 2009 when Satoshi mined the genesis block, is more symbolic. It was on May 22, 2010 that Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Eight years on, the occasion has become part of bitcoin’s mythology.\nAlso read: Ross Ulbricht Continues to Fight for Freedom With Supreme Court Petition Remembering the $83 Million Pizza\nOn May 18 2009, Laszlo posted a thread on the Bitcointalk forum entitled “Pizza for bitcoins?” In it, he explained: “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!”\nLaszlo then went on to list his favorite toppings, before specifying “just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that”. Within days he had a buyer and the deal went through on May 22. The event is symbolic, not so much for the value of those 10,000 BTC today, but because it marked one of the first public instances of bitcoin being used as a means of payment. The pizza thread, like the value of BTC, has since grown and grown, and today runs to 73 pages, having been viewed around 750,000 times. Pizza Wallets and Pizza Moon Missions\nEvery year on May 22 the bitcoin community now competes to despatch the best pizza tweets and branded products, all tied to that then-minor but now massive day in 2010 when bitcoin proved its worth. It hasn’t stopped proving it ever since. To mark the occasion today, Bitstamp has calculated how far $83m of pizzas would stretch, using the following formula:\n10,000 BTC * 8,400 USD (1 BTC) = 84 million USD 84 million USD / 15 USD (1 pizza price) = 5.6 million pizzas 5.6 million pizzas * 14 inches (diameter of a large pizza) = 1237 miles 1237 miles / 248 miles (average altitude of the ISS) = 4.9 PIZZA TO THE MOON: In 2010, a Florida man bought two large pizzas for 10.000 #Bitcoin .

US Cryptocurrency Investors Made $92 Billion of Taxable Gains during 2017 Alone, Resulting in about $25 Billion of Cryptocurrency related Tax Liabilities, and the ABA Is Asking the IRS to Offer an Offshore Voluntary Compliance Initiative Focused on Virtual Currency and Equivalent Assets. “It is unclear whether a taxpayer holding cryptocurrencies on a foreign cryptocurrency exchange ( e.g. , Xapo.com or Binance.com) or in a wallet maintained by a foreign wallet service provider ( e.g. , Blockchain.com) is required to report the account(s) on an FBAR as it is unclear whether cryptocurrencies may qualify as a reportable account for FBAR purposes.\nThere is tension between the Service’s classification of cryptocurrency as “property,” the Securities Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) classification of cryptocurrency, in certain circumstances, as a “security,” and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (“CFTC”) classification of cryptocurrency as a “commodity.”\nThis tension is perhaps most pronounced in the context of the FBAR reporting requirements, which blend concepts of tax, securities, commodities, and money and finance laws. On the one hand, if cryptocurrency is property, then it is arguably not subject to FBAR reporting requirements because it is not, under the current regulatory definitions, a “bank, securities, or other financial account.” On the other hand, if cryptocurrency is a “security,” then FBAR reporting requirements may apply under the general rule: “each United States person having a financial interest in, or signature authority over, a bank, securities, or other financial account in a foreign country shall report such relationship to the Commissioner…” Moreover, by treating cryptocurrency as “property,” the answer to whether cryptocurrency held in foreign wallets must be reported likely depends on what functions the wallet provider actually provides, which may be difficult for taxpayers to determine in many cases. Furthermore, it is unclear how these requirements may apply to taxpayers who hold cryptocurrencies directly on a distributed blockchain. Additional guidance is needed with respect to whether, and the extent to which, the FBAR reporting requirements apply to cryptocurrency. Assuming an FBAR may be required in particular cases, it would also be helpful if guidance addresses the differences in filing requirements for cryptocurrency held on an exchange, cryptocurrency held through a wallet service company (custodial or noncustodial), or cryptocurrency held directly through a wallet address maintained by the taxpayer. The ABA believes that cryptocurrency that is held directly by a taxpayer or held through a noncustodial wallet should not be reportable on the FBAR as there is no “financial account” maintained by a third party as there is with other reportable accounts. We previously discussed, that an abundance of caution , a taxpayer may want to report their investments in cryptocurrencies on their FBAR and Form the 8938 , since Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions can be audited for those transactions and, when appropriate, can be liable for penalties and interest. In more extreme situations, taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution for failing to properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions. Criminal charges could include tax evasion and filing a false tax return. Anyone convicted of tax evasion is subject to a prison term of up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000. Anyone convicted of filing a false return is subject to a prison term of up to three years and a fine of up to $250,000. Have an IRS Tax Problem?

Today, Bitcoin can be used as a real-world currency — and it’s all thanks to Laszlo Hanyecz and his 10,000 BTC pizza appetite. On May 17, 2010, Laszlo — who was a contributing coder for Bitcoin at the time — was on a mission to prove Bitcoin can be used to buy two pizzas. On the 22nd, Laszlo paid a fellow 10,000 BTC to sell two Papa John’s pizzas to him — without any regrets. Laszlo became the first person to ever make a documented purchase using Bitcoin. Since then, thousands of companies have offered up goods and services for the world’s most popular digital currency (including us) — which we’d love to celebrate with you today. Now it’s your turn to munch down a digitally purchased pizza on one of the most celebrated days in Bitcoin history. New at Bitrefill — you can wolf down a delicious Italian pizza pie from Bertucci’s and Buca Di Beppo .

No other date, save for January 3, 2009 when Satoshi mined the genesis block, is more symbolic. It was on May 22, 2010 that Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Eight years on, the occasion has become part of bitcoin’s mythology.\nAlso read: Ross Ulbricht Continues to Fight for Freedom With Supreme Court Petition\nRemembering the $83 Million Pizza On May 18 2009, Laszlo posted a thread on the Bitcointalk forum entitled “Pizza for bitcoins?” In it, he explained: “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!”\nLaszlo then went on to list his favorite toppings, before specifying “just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that”. Within days he had a buyer and the deal went through on May 22. The event is symbolic, not so much for the value of those 10,000 BTC today, but because it marked one of the first public instances of bitcoin being used as a means of payment. The pizza thread, like the value of BTC, has since grown and grown, and today runs to 73 pages, having been viewed around 750,000 times.\nPizza Wallets and Pizza Moon Missions Every year on May 22 the bitcoin community now competes to despatch the best pizza tweets and branded products, all tied to that then-minor but now massive day in 2010 when bitcoin proved its worth. It hasn’t stopped proving it ever since. To mark the occasion today, Bitstamp has calculated how far $83m of pizzas would stretch, using the following formula:\n10,000 BTC * 8,400 USD (1 BTC) = 84 million USD\n84 million USD / 15 USD (1 pizza price) = 5.6 million pizzas\n5.6 million pizzas * 14 inches (diameter of a large pizza) = 1237 miles\n1237 miles / 248 miles (average altitude of the ISS) = 4.9\nPIZZA TO THE MOON: In 2010, a Florida man bought two large pizzas for 10.000 #Bitcoin . Today, this could buy you enough pizzas to get to the International Space Station five times. #whenmoon Happy #BitcoinPizzaDay ! #BTC #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/OuPeXC93CM\n— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) May 22, 2018\nHardware wallet manufacturer Ledger has gone one better, creating a limited edition Pizza Day Nano S. Just 1,337 of the units will be issued, each coming in a special Laszlo’s Pizza box complete with a sachet of red chilli pepper oil, for those who like to spice up their cold storage.\nAs for the man who made this infamous anniversary come about, history records that Laszlo sold most of his bitcoins at around $1 apiece but, having contributed to its early source code, and done his bit to ensure real world adoption, he regrets nothing. In the crypto community, Laszlo Hanyecz’s actions will always be the ultimate “Florida man” story, destined to be commemorated faithfully every May 22 forevermore.\nWould you buy a limited edition Pizza Day wallet?

Outpacing the Rest\nIf it proves to be successful, Argentina would significantly outstep progress with cryptocurrencies by its neighbors, while the country’s domestic banking sector has been preparing for closer integration for some time.\nIn April, an event dubbed ‘ Bitcoin Day ’ in the capital, Buenos Aires, saw participants approve the supportive environment around Bitcoin, contrasting it with the prohibitive stance taken by authorities in countries such as Chile .\nChanges in legislation have also resulted in operators pledging to install thousands of Bitcoin ATMs throughout Argentina this year.\nEarlier this month meanwhile, Brazil’s largest asset management company moved to launch an over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading platform, highlighting a wish to target institutional investor money.\nBlockchain-based payments are also gaining traction with banks, with Santander becoming the first to launch the facility for customers in several jurisdictions, including Brazil, in April via a partnership with Ripple.\n“Transfers to Europe can be made on the same day and we are aiming to deliver instant transfers across several markets by the summer,” the bank said in a statement .\nWhat do you think about Banco Masventas’ Bitcoin payments?

Ether and Bitcoin against each helps remove general cryptocurrency market risk.\n- Ether continues to out-perform Bitcoin.\nIf you are new to trading cryptocurrencies, or are just looking to refresh your trading knowledge, please see the DailyFX 'Guide to Day Trading Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies'.\nTrading the ETH/BTC Spread\nCryptocurrency trading is notoriously volatile with price swings of 20%+ seen in times of heavy turbulence. And in most of these cases, all cryptocurrencies move in the same direc tion, either sharply up or down, leaving traders exposed to market risk. And while cryptocurrencies are different with specific news and announcements also major drivers for market moves, general market sentiment continues to be the main theme of the cryptocurrency space.\nOne way to reduce market sentiment risk is by trading two cryptocurrencies against each other - a spread trade. A look at the latest Ether (ETH)/Bitcoin (BTC) spread shows that ETH has been outperforming BTC over the last 6 weeks, moving up from around 0.0580 to a current level of 0.0832, a rise of just over 43%. The basis behind this move is that traders believe that ETH has more value than BTC as a company or network, while market positioning and sentiment will also have played a part in the move.\nA comprehensive guide to Bitcoin (BTC)\nA comprehensive guide to Ether (ETH)\nA look at the latest IG Client Sentiment Report shows that customers are 73.6% net-long of Bitcoin and 91.0% net-long of Ether. While this is a contrarian indicator - bearish for both - daily and weekly changes in net-longs and net-shorts impact on overall retail sentiment.\nThe strong uptrend remains in place, while on this four-hour chart the price remains above the 200-day moving average, a bullish sign. At the bottom of the chart the RSI indicator is around 46, just above the four-recent oversold reversal signals at 39.\nETH vs BTC Price Spread Four Hour Chart (April 6 - May 22, 2018)\n--- Written by Nick Cawley , Analyst .\nYou can contact the author at Nicholas.cawley@ig.com or via Twitter @nickcawley1.\noriginal source\nDailyFX provides forex news and technical analysis on the trends that influence the global currency markets.\nLearn forex trading with a free practice account and trading charts from IG .\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.dailyfx.com/ether-eth?ref-author=Cawley", "https://www.dailyfx.com/bitcoin?ref-author=Cawley", "https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/technical/article/special_report/2018/03/05/-A-Guide-to-Day-Trading-Bitcoin--Other-Cryptocurrencies.html?ref-author=Cawley", "https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/post_of_the_day/2018/05/22/ETH-vs-BTC-Ether-and-Bitcoin-spread-De-risking-Crypto-Trading.html", "https://www.ig.com/uk/dfx-demo?CHID=7&QPID=14620&QPPID=1", "https://www.dailyfx.com/?"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T21:07:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c0f073d1b6834a6f6dca2da1ff1a7be768bf0b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhZzq0jo.zMuJ2fDmftVfh4_vY6qWolu24wILeLZm.z9PdbU1nyhYU9uoHM6A88W0VAZb2irbls4NuxkaLQ0s38fQXSmOTykvUWd0cUSJ7qsWLENIKwJrUjM-", "site_full": "southafrica.trendolizer.com", "site": "trendolizer.com", "site_section": "http://southafrica.trendolizer.com/atom.xml", "site_categories": ["travel", "africa"], "section_title": "South Africa", "title": "Kidnappers demand bitcoin ransom for South African teen", "title_full": "Kidnappers demand bitcoin ransom for South African teen", "published": "2018-05-22T19:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://southafrica.trendolizer.com/images/caption_8802918.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 63018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c0f073d1b6834a6f6dca2da1ff1a7be768bf0b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhZzq0jo.zMuJ2fDmftVfh4_vY6qWolu24wILeLZm.z9PdbU1nyhYU9uoHM6A88W0VAZb2irbls4NuxkaLQ0s38fQXSmOTykvUWd0cUSJ7qsWLENIKwJrUjM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maarten Schenk", "published": "2018-05-22T19:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kidnappers demand bitcoin ransom for South African teen", "text": "Kidnappers demand bitcoin ransom for South African teen Trending story found on www.dailymail.co.uk A gang who kidnapped a South African teenager from a playground at the weekend have demanded a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency worth about $123,000, police have said.

Here's four reasons why it probably won't http://bit.ly/2s0GPuV Source: Shutterstock\nAs with any revolutionary technology, it’s easy to make a long list of both the pros and cons of bitcoin. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have already produced an untold number of millionaires. And with the price of Bitcoin and most altcoins down sharply since December, a lot of people are getting excited for the inevitable next rally.\nAt this time, however, the balance of bitcoin’s pros and cons favors the downside. Bitcoin still lacks a killer application, government regulation is increasing, technical charts look weak, and dubious Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are wreaking havoc on the market. For those reasons, bitcoin is unlikely to provide the same sort of big returns this year that it did in 2017.\nLet’s dive into each of these problems further. No Killer Applications\nA discussion about the pros and cons of bitcoin has to take into account its potential uses. Since humans came up with primitive accounting, we’ve sought ways to store wealth. Be it shells, salt, precious metals, or more recently, fiat money, we’ve always tried to hold onto value from our labors.\nBitcoin is the latest challenger to these pre-existing monies. And bitcoin has some great advantages — including privacy and the ease of avoiding capital controls. In countries like Venezuela with a busted currency and dysfunctional government, bitcoin is a great store of value compared to other alternatives.\nBut a currency can’t achieve mainstream adoption from a few edge cases. In developed markets with functioning capitalist economies, it’s unclear what benefit bitcoin provides versus existing systems. So far, bitcoin transactions remain slow, and subject to high transaction fees. If I owned Visa Inc (NYSE: V ) stock, I wouldn’t be too worried about bitcoin. Many tech-oriented sites such as Steam that used to accept bitcoin have given up on it. That’s due to the hassle of dealing with high transaction fees and an unpredictable and volatile exchange rate.\nSo far, the main uses of bitcoin seem to be for gray area or illegal activities such as buying narcotics, avoiding taxes and laundering money. There is great potential for blockchain in the real world. As of yet, however, there are few legal, efficient and game-changing applications using either bitcoin or blockchain.\nThat’s problematic for the crypto market, which is currently worth $400 billion. That’s the same as, say Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM ) or JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM ). Increasing Regulation\nOne of the big pros to bitcoin originally was freedom from government interference. Crypto was the wild west. Investors and traders made a killing before the IRS, SEC, or other regulatory bodies got involved. That’s all changing in a big way, however.\nThe past 12 months have brought a major crackdown on crypto trading. Exchanges such as Bitfinex are now demanding customer information so that it can be shared with the IRS. Reports suggest that merely trading between one crypto, such as bitcoin, and another, such as Ethereum, is a taxable event. This will turn crypto, previously a market frontier, into an accounting headache. It also hammers at a main benefit of crypto: If the IRS can track all your transactions, how private or secure are your funds?\nAdditionally, the SEC is cracking down on new coin and token offerings. This isn’t necessarily a negative for the price of bitcoin itself — see below — but it will impede the growth of the crypto landscape. People were making new coins as a loophole to avoid government oversight necessary for IPOs and other traditional funding mechanisms.\nThe government is now enforcing the law on new ICOs, perhaps limiting the appeal of Overstock.com Inc (NASDAQ: OSTK ) and other companies that intend to profit from having crpyto-driven market exchanges that would bypass the stock market. Bitcoin Price Chart Is Weak\nThe price of bitcoin peaked last December, coming near the $20,000 per coin mark around the holidays. Bitcoin dropped back to $13,000 heading into the new year. On January 6, bitcoin made its 2018 high of the year at $17,000. From there, it’s been almost all downhill.\nBitcoin dropped to below $10,000 at the start of February, falling to as low as $7,000. It made two weak rebounds back to just above the $10,000-mark, but quickly lost that key technical level. Since March 6, bitcoin hasn’t closed above $10,000. The price of bitcoin has continued to deteriorate further since then. In April, it fell to the low 6,000s. Since then, the price failed just below the $10,000 level once more, and is now slumping again. Compare Brokers\nTechnically, this is a classic set of lower lows and lower highs that marks a bear market. Each time bitcoin drops, it hits a lower trough than previously. And when it tries to bounce, it fails at a worse point. The $10,000-mark, which was previously a support level, is now overhead resistance. Until bitcoin can make a higher high (currently the $10,000 level must be breached), its chart remains ominous for bullish traders. ICO Madness\nIn the dot-com boom, we got IPO madness. A bunch of tiny internet firms went public with little more than a business plan. They raised billions of dollars, most of which was lost within a couple of years. We’re now having ICO madness, where new coins are launched seemingly daily.\nThese new coins may seem harmless, since they are much smaller than bitcoin. But they dilute the marketplace, and leave speculators stinging with massive losses. Consider Dentacoin , for example, which shot from a $100 million market cap to almost $3 billion in the space of a week in January. The company intends to be the first “blockchain solution for the global dental industry.” Was there some need to put a record of our cavities on the blockchain? And would dentists find Dentacoin acceptance more useful than cash or a Visa card? In a speculative bubble, no one worries about these sorts of questions. Regardless, Dentacoin has already lost 90% of its value since January.\nMultiply that sort of silliness across hundreds of new coins, and you get a polluted and watered down market. From outright scams to implausible business models, the crypto world is suffering from a swarm of hucksters and opportunists. This has attracted attention from the SEC, which recently made its own new coin offering as a parody of current market conditions.\nNeedless to say, the combination of scams and resulting government oversight are unlikely to bode well for bitcoin and crpyto’s long-term prospects.\nAt the time of this writing, the author held no cryptocurrencies.

The Next Bitcoin - Decred USD (Cryptocurrency:DCR-USD)", "text": "As a retail investor, I believe most of the secondary markets are efficient. Huge returns can only be made in developing markets, such as the cryptocurrency market. From what I learn and see, cryptocurrency will not replace fiat currencies but will play an important role in the financial industry as a new asset class. Imagine what will happen if every institution allocates 5% of their assets to crypto assets. Currently, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is $378 billion , which is less than 1% of total global asset under management. That said, this article's focus is on Decred ( DCR-USD ).\nDCR is not a well-known project, but precisely because of that, it is deeply undervalued and is a sound investment for investors who are looking for value in the cryptocurrency space. \"Decred is Bitcoin as it should have been,\" argued crypto investor Jon Creasy.\nDecred is a project created by Btcsuite developers after leaving the Bitcoin community in 2016. Btcsuite developers have long been respected as one of the best blockchain developers . As a fork of Bitcoin, Decred shares the characteristic of having a limited supply of 21 million coins. The project's goal is to develop a cryptocurrency that overcomes some of the inherent limitations in Bitcoin. DCR is currently trading at $110 with a market value of $800 million, which is 0.5% of Bitcoin and 1% of Ethereum. Decred's current market cap rank is 30.\nFundamental Analysis Comparing to Bitcoin, Decred has the following improved features.\nAbsolute Decentralization\nBitcoin is based on the Proof of Work (PoW) mining algorithm. Essentially, 1 CPU equals 1 power. In the past two years, Bitcoin network's hash rate has concentrated in the hands of several major mining companies. It is fair to say that Bitcoin is not decentralized anymore.\nIn light of this, Decred invented the PoW + PoS mixed mechanism. As PoW entitles the entire newly generated block reward to miners, Proof of Stake (PoS) entitles block reward to Decred holders. 60% of newly created DCR block rewards are given to miners based on PoW, 30% to DCR holders based on PoS, and 10% to software developers to incentivize project development. This mechanism effectively keeps Decred decentralized. No single stakeholder has overwhelming power over the project.\nDecentralization also allows the cryptocurrency immune to certain external risks, such as being too dependent on the founder. Last year, when news was reported (incorrectly) that Ethereum's founder Vitalik Buterin was involved in a fatal car accident, Ethereum lost $4 billion of its market value.\nDividend-like Mechanism\nAs mentioned earlier, Decred created PoS to reward DCR holders with new coins in order to evenly distribute power among miners, holders and developers. This is how it works.\nA Decred investor has to lock 95 DCRs in the official wallet (Decrediton) to buy a ticket that can vote on project proposals. The locked DCRs cannot be used until the ticket is selected randomly by the system. On average, tickets are selected in around 28 days. After the ticket is selected, the 95 locked DCRs will be unlocked and return to the investor's wallet. In addition, the investor will receive approximately 1.2 DCR as a reward for staking. The amount of DCR required to buy a ticket is floating and is based on an algorithm. When more DCR holders decide to buy tickets, the ticket price will increase to keep the number of purchased tickets at the same level. The amount of DCR giving out as a staking reward will also slowly decrease over time.\nProjections on the diminishing PoS subsidy can be found here . At present, the PoS reward is annualized to around 17%.\nInnovative Governance Mechanism\nBitcoin does not have a proper governance mechanism. As the conflict between Bitcoin miners and the core development team intensifies, the split of the Bitcoin community becomes inevitable. Having two powerful group of stakeholders with opposite opinions does not benefit Bitcoin in the long term. The Decred team previously participated in Bitcoin projects, and they recognize the importance of a proper governance system.\nIn the coming months, Decred will launch the Politeia governance platform to allow Decred stakeholders vote on all project decisions. Under a completely democratic and decentralized governance mechanism, the community will stay united in the long term. Placeholder VC made an excellent point : \"Decred's killer feature is good governance, and with good governance, you can have any feature you want\"\nOther catalysts in 2018\nThere are a number of catalysts expected in the coming months that can serve as price catalysts. Below are the important ones. The whole list can be found in the official 2018 road map .\nLightning Network Innovation: Solve the concern of long transaction times in other cryptocurrency projects, such as Bitcoin.\nAtomic Swap Innovation: Potentially replace exchanges by allowing DCR holders to \"swap\" DCR to other cryptocurrencies without commission. One caveat is that transaction time is much longer than trading on exchanges. Decred was the first cryptocurrency to execute a blockchain atomic swap with Litecoin in September 2017 .\nPrivacy Feature: Potentially implementing a similar privacy feature as Monero, which has a market cap that is 4x that of DCR.\nListing On More Exchanges: Two weeks ago, DCR surged 20% when Korean exchange Upbit released the DCR/KRW trading pair.\nTechnical Analysis Low Circulating Supply\nBecause of the rewarding feature of PoS, 47% of the current total DCR supply is currently locked . The limited supply implies that DCR can rise faster than other cryptocurrencies.\nStrength in the Recent Market Downturn\nThe recent cryptocurrency market took a hit, with Bitcoin BTC-USD dropping 15%. However, DCR's price DCR-USD shows extreme strength. Excluding USDT, which is pegged with the U.S. dollar, DCR is currently at the top of the list of top 70 cryptocurrencies that are closest to an all-time high .\nDCR's strong price performance and increasing volume imply enormous buying demand. When the cryptocurrency market recovers, DCR's buying demand will power DCR to outperform other cryptocurrencies and lead the market.\nIn the chart below, provided by Yahoo Finance , the blue line represents Bitcoin and the candlesticks represent DCR:\nValuation This is the most challenging part. DCR is undervalued because the Decred team focuses most of its resources on building the best-in-class cryptocurrency in the space. The team spends much less effort on marketing when comparing to other projects. I consider PoS's 15% dividend as a safety margin when investing in Decred.\nComparing to Dash and Monero that have similar technical features, Decred is trading at a 75% discount. Dash also has a comparable governance mechanism and Monero's privacy feature is one of the features Decred team is actively implementing this year.\nThe Decred team believes that Decred should be in top 10 in terms of the quality of the project. Assuming the Decred team is right and the cryptocurrency market overall does not have any capital inflow, DCR is trading at a 80% discount of its intrinsic value.\nPotential Risks Decred is one of the most decentralized cryptocurrencies, which reduces risks imposed by external factors, but there are some potential risks investors need to be aware of. The investment thesis of Decred is built on the belief that cryptocurrency will continue to be an asset class in the financial market. The recent market news - such as Goldman starting a crypto trading desk and JPMorgan launching a crypto strategy - shows that cryptocurrency projects are taken seriously by financial institutions. But investors need to recognize that the tide may change at any time if the government decides to further restrict cryptocurrencies.\nDecred is created by former Bitcoin developers, but there is a chance that the team misses a bug in the system that allows hackers to destroy the cryptocurrency. The BeautyChain project hack incident was a good example. In addition, competitor risk arises if another team of developers builds a different cryptocurrency that rivals Decred by offering even better governance mechanism.\nFinally, keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is not very liquid and price movements can be huge - especially for smaller cryptocurrencies, such as Decred.\nConclusion If you believe cryptocurrencies have value and are prepared to endure high volatility, then you should definitely learn more about Decred. The cryptocurrency is deeply undervalued because of lack of marketing. The current 15% PoS return acts as a cushion, and now is the perfect time to invest as Decred is planning to release many innovative and revolutionary features in the coming months that will potentially shock the market. According to many who believe in the project, DCR is currently trading at a 80% discount.\nThere aren't many cryptocurrency projects that receive well respects from the current top 10 projects, and Decred is one of them. Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) and director of engineering at Coinbase, has publicly praised Decred as one of the four best cryptocurrencies .

The day has become part of folklore, not because of the transaction, but more the price: the man in question paid 10,000 Bitcoins, which today is worth over $80 million, for the two pizzas. (See also: New Bitcoin Price Record: Over $2,000 Per Coin )\nOn May 22, 2010, now known as Bitcoin Pizza Day, Laszlo Hanyecz agreed to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for two delivered Papa John's pizzas. Organized on bitcointalk forum, the Florida man reached out for help. \"I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day,\" Hanyecz wrote.\n\"I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!\"\nA British man took up Hanyecz's offer and bought the two pizzas for him in exchange for the 10,000 Bitcoins. Even then the recipient of the Bitcoins got himself a bargain, paying $25 for the pizzas, while 10,000 Bitcoins were worth around $41 at the time. (See also: Basics For Buying And Investing In Bitcoin )\n— Bitcoin Pizza (@bitcoin_pizza) May 22, 2017\nSince the inception of Bitcoin, Hanyeczs' pizzas have got more and more expensive. Nine months after the purchase, Bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar, making the two pizzas worth $10,000 and in 2015 -- the fifth anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day -- the two pizzas were valued at $2.4 million. Today, Bitcoin is at just over $8200, making the pizzas worth...you get it.

( MNXBF ), which recently spent $34 million to acquire Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, has plans to bring the service to the U.S. That's according to an article on cryptocurrency website BTCManager.com , which reported that Coincheck wants to expand into the U.S., although a timeline as to when that will happen hasn't been provided. More favorable tax rates, increasing interest in cryptocurrencies and the lure of reaching millions of new customers are some of the drivers behind Monex's expansion of Coincheck into the U.S., according to BTCManager.com.\nA move into the U.S. is a bit surprising given regulators in the country haven't been as open to cryptocurrency trading as those in Japan, which has been an early adopter of cryptocurrency. Monex does own active trading online brokerage TradeStation, which offers bitcoin futures from CME and CBOE World Markets and has already stated its desire to offer crypto trading directly to its customers.\n[Read Investopedia's TD Ameritrade review to learn about this low-cost broker with powerful charting tools.]\nSince its acquisition of Coincheck, Monex put a new management team in place and has been rebuilding the digital token exchange, which in January disclosed a hack of its exchange in which $530 million in digital tokens were stolen. That prompted Japan's Financial Services Agency to require Coincheck to enhance its operations to better protect customers assets. The government agency also wants the cryptocurrency exchange to put into place anti-money laundering safeguards.\nWhile it's not clear how cryptocurrency trading will work in the U.S., Monex Chief Executive Oki Matsumoto thinks the initiative will be successful, telling Bloomberg in a recent interview that going after institutional investors is one avenue to success. \"Japan may seem like it's one step ahead in crypto, but in terms of deciding what's a security or a token and attracting institutional investors, the U.S. and Europe are moving ahead,\" he was quoted as saying. Monex can also tap its employees in the U.S. that are part of TradeStation to get the service up and running, noted the report.\nTradeStation has been positioning itself as a leader in bitcoin trading, announcing in January that, if NYSE Arca, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange, gets approval to list the ProShares Bitcoin ETF and the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF, TradeStation will offer these investments to its customers. The ETFs would track one of the two recently launched bitcoin futures contracts from CME and Cboe. In March, TradeStation teamed up with cryptocurrency exchange GDAX to provide real-time market data on the leading digital tokens. In a statement, the discount brokerage said that it will provide customers with real-time market data for bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin, the four leading cryptocurrencies.

Service Highlights ‘No Intermediaries’\nThe initiative, which Banco Masventas (BMV) launched May 22nd, is the result of a partnership with local blockchain financial services startup Bitex.\nOnce payments begin being sent, BMV will likely become the world’s first banking institution to actively leverage Bitcoin as an international payments standard.\nThe move is a conspicuous move away from extant options such as the SWIFT clearing network, which has seen multiple failures and security problems in recent years.\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” a dedicated information page on the bank’s website states.\nThe service will initially roll out to 50 countries, with payment timeframes reduced to 24 hours. Outpacing the Rest\nIf it proves to be successful, Argentina would significantly outstep progress with cryptocurrencies by its neighbors, while the country’s domestic banking sector has been preparing for closer integration for some time.\nIn April, an event dubbed ‘ Bitcoin Day ’ in the capital, Buenos Aires, saw participants approve the supportive environment around Bitcoin, contrasting it with the prohibitive stance taken by authorities in countries such as Chile .\nChanges in legislation have also resulted in operators pledging to install thousands of Bitcoin ATMs throughout Argentina this year.\nEarlier this month meanwhile, Brazil’s largest asset management company moved to launch an over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading platform, highlighting a wish to target institutional investor money.\nBlockchain-based payments are also gaining traction with banks, with Santander becoming the first to launch the facility for customers in several jurisdictions, including Brazil, in April via a partnership with Ripple.\n“Transfers to Europe can be made on the same day and we are aiming to deliver instant transfers across several markets by the summer,” the bank said in a statement .\nWhat do you think about Banco Masventas’ Bitcoin payments?

The power and positives of technology also come with many dangers. The kidnapping of a 13-year-old from Witbank has shown that again clearly.\nMpumalanga police have confirmed that Katlego Marite was snatched on Sunday afternoon as the criminals left behind a ransom note that no one would have expected.\nThe child was playing with his two friends outside in eMalahleni, previously known as Witbank. A car pulled up, grabbed Marite and left a piece of paper demanding a payment of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\neNCA spoke to Police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi.\n“While playing, a gold Toyota Corolla with three occupants stopped next to them. One of the men, who was dressed in black, with a green jacket, grabbed the victim to the vehicle (sic) before driving off with him. Katlego’s friends ran to his mom and told her about the ordeal. She, in turn, reported the incident to the police.”\nA case of kidnapping has been opened and the police have also confirmed that Marite’s parents were not even aware of Bitcoin.\n“This is a kidnapping! We have your child. Your child will not be harmed if the following demands are met:\nDo not involve the police, we are monitoring all your communications and movments.\nWe demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid to the below Bitcoin wallet to secure your child’s safe release.”\nThe note goes on to demand that “at least” one of the Bitcoins be paid before midnight 21 May. The note concludes by claiming that the child will be “hanged and decapitated” if no payments are made.

Today I will proffer two more: censorship and propaganda were allowed to run rampant; miners didn't understand their power and responsibility. Last Friday, Coingeek.com held a fantastic conference in Hong Kong on the topic of blockchain commerce. The conference concluded with a panel discussion featuring 3 of the most well-known thought leaders in the Bitcoin Cash community: Roger Ver, Dr. Craig Wright, and Jihan Wu. Each of them said something important that pertains to these topics.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 3\nBitcoin Cash Avoiding Censorship Censorship is an obvious barrier to an educated community and is motivated by a desire to control the narrative. Thus, it goes hand-in-hand with propaganda and the active promotion of mis information.\nIn Hong Kong, Roger shared that his biggest mistake was underestimating how effective censorship can be. He explained why: while established community members can easily dismiss misinformation, newcomers cannot. And since the community is a fast-growing one, the misinformed newcomers become a majority.\nYou can read more about the history of censorship in Bitcoin here.\nMindful Miners In a recent \"AMA\" , former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn pointed out that historically, BTC miners haven't been rational economic actors. He said they've been incapable of disobeying the authority of the devs.\nBut we may be turning the corner on this. At the Coingeek conference, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu expressed that the miners have learned from previous mistakes, and are starting to take more responsibility for understanding the protocol and making intelligent decisions.\nIn the past, miners have followed Bitcoin Core almost unconditionally — perhaps overly fearful of \"breaking\" the network should their guidance not be followed to the letter. While its sensible to consult experts for their opinions, Bitcoin is not on the same order of complexity as nuclear engineering.\n(Incidentally, nuclear engineering has been the very metaphor used to incorrectly suggest that the community should abandon independent thinking and blindly follow developers).\nBitcoin is an Economic System One of the thematic ideas presented by Dr. Wright in Hong Kong (and in previous talks) is that Bitcoin is NOT a cryptographic system. It's an economic system that happens to use cryptography.\nThis is the kind of revelation that's obvious after you hear it expressed so succinctly. In my own words, it means that Bitcoin's economic incentives are the foundation of what makes Bitcoin work. The cryptography is secondary to that. The economics are the \"what\" and the cryptography is the \"how\".\nIf you investigate one of Bitcoin's predecessors, Wei Dai's b-money , you may be surprised at how similar it is to Bitcoin. The one major element that's missing is the set of economic incentives.\nMiners, Users, and the Public Discourse Miners and users have a symbiotic relationship. Users don't have a network without miners, and miners don't have economic incentive without users.\nIn theory, miners are rewarded by providing the network that users want.\nBut what if the miners don't know what users want because the public discussion is being censored and brigaded with propaganda? What if they're listening to the devs instead of the users, or they simply don't understand enough about Bitcoin to make good choices?\nUnfortunately, miners can participate in the system and earn rewards for securing the network without understanding anything about Bitcoin. But its quite dangerous for miners to be ignorant because they're the ones directly responsible for making the bottom line decisions about consensus rules.\nIt's therefore really encouraging to hear that miners are much more educated and involved than they were several years ago.\nThe Role of Developers In the (flawed) Bitcoin Core paradigm, Bitcoin developers were the wizards and rulers. They handed down the proclamations from their ivory towers for the users and miners to follow. If you didn't like it, you were told you could \"fork off\", even as those developers denied they wielded influence over the protocol.\nIn the actual economic model of Bitcoin, miners set the consensus rules with the ultimate consent of the users who give economic value to the system.\nDevelopers, although important, serve a tertiary role and are not directly part of the incentive model.\nDevelopment Funding If developer groups need to compete (as we discussed in a previous article), then the obvious question is \"what incentivizes that competition?\"\nIn the past, this has been a conundrum. How can we make sure there's enough development resources and talent in a free, open-source software project?\nYet, if we look honestly at the incentive model of Bitcoin, the answer is clear: it's ultimately the miners' responsibility to pay for the software they are going to run.\nMaybe that means mining pools directly sponsor development teams (which seems to be something that's been irrationally shamed or presented as a conflict of interest)\n…Or maybe it means miners should formulate some kind of system to donate a portion of the block rewards to protocol advancement, as was proposed in a recent strategy meeting .\nConclusion\nBitcoin Cash is on the right track and will stay on the right track by following these 5 principles:\nKnowledge and education must be valued and promoted. Understanding Bitcoin is not the exclusive realm of wizards. Bitcoin (BCH) is peer to peer electronic cash. Anyone can send money to anyone else in the world, quickly, cheaply, reliably, and without permission. We can disagree on many things as long as we agree on this. We must never allow censorship, because we know propaganda and misinformation are sure to quickly follow. There needs to be multiple independent teams of developers and multiple protocol implementations. No one group should have control of the protocol. The mining community must be engaged, informed, and willing to make logical decisions that align with their own economic interests. What are your thoughts on educating the BCH community?

According to The Age , Hunter Energy will recommission the Redbank power station in the Hunter Valley, two hours drive north of Sydney.\nOnce the power plant is reopened (expected to be completed within 12 months), it will offer wholesale or \"pre-grid\" power prices to blockchain companies, allowing them to do things like mining cryptocurrencies, without having to pay retail power prices. […]\nBut while blockchain guarantees trust in a digital world, mining blocks (the process of adding and securing data) is an incredibly compute-intensive task, and one which consumes a huge amount of power. World mining of bitcoin (probably the most well-known blockchain application) currently uses about as much power as the country of Singapore . [ more ]\nThis coal power plant is being reopened for blockchain mining\nBy Cole Latimer\n10 April 2018\n(The Age) – An Australian first energy and blockchain deal could help make the NSW Hunter Valley the next Silicon Valley.\nIOT Group has signed an agreement with Hunter Energy to build a blockchain centre inside the Redbank coal-fired power station to provide cheap electricity for blockchain applications.\nThe deal, the first of its kind in Australia, would put the centre ‘behind the grid’, giving it direct access to wholesale electricity prices to avoid additional costs from the retailer, transmission, and being connected to poles and wires.\nIt is understood the proposed two-hectare development could cut energy prices by up to 20 per cent.\n\"The average consumer pays around 28 cents per kilowatt-hour, with what IOT are doing its pre-grid [price] is 8 cents and will be 5 cents at night time,\" IOT said in a company statement.\nWhile Australia has been on the radar for many blockchain companies due to its stable investment environment and low sovereign risk, high electricity prices have dissuaded entry into the market.\nBlockchain technology creates a transparent and auditable record of transactions and data movement.\nCompanies that use blockchain applications are typically cryptocurrency – or bitcoin – miners such as Bitfury and Bitmain Technologies or peer-to-peer token trading, like Power Ledger, which last year carried out an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to raise equity and engage potential users in its trading network.\nBlockchain technology is also used by oil and resources companies to streamline their commodity trading processes.\n\"This deal has opened the door to these kinds of businesses,\" Mr Neylon said.\n\"Blockchain processes used a lot of computing power and energy,\" IOT Group executive director Sean Neylon told Fairfax Media.\nThe energy demand of the bitcoin network alone is believed to be equivalent to the entire electricity demand of Denmark, around 32 terawatt-hours annually, or about 16 per cent of Australia's total electricity consumption last financial year.\n\"The reasons why blockchain specialists are not in Australia is because power costs are too high, it’s not efficient. Power at wholesale cost would make blockchain related operations attractive in Australia,\" Mr Neylon said.\nMr Neylon said this could support the development of a new industry in the Hunter Valley and help create a tech-focussed hub just two hours north of Sydney.\n\"With these current prices, by having a blockchain application centre behind the grid offers cheaper power. It offers the potential to create a new Silicon Valley in Australia,\" he said.\n\"We’re offering services so clients can build data centres where they can get cheaper power.\" [ more ]\nBlockchain to

The Austin home was sold when Bitcoin prices were $3,429 in September 2017. &l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;In addition to these transactions, other residential real estate properties are being listed for Bitcoin. A recent&l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianmitchell/2018/05/01/this-serial-tech-entrepreneur-put-his-8-million-home-up-for-sale-in-bitcoin/#7f9219103992&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;Forbes article&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g; describes how Canter Companies, a full-service investment firm specializing in real estate and asset management projects, recently listed two multi-million dollar homes for sale in Bitcoin. The homes are collectively priced at under $20 million in Bitcoin. And recently, a &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://propy.com/property/5aea694419b0090ec40518cc/featured&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;27 acre piece of land in Silicon Valley&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g; has been &a;nbsp;listed for sale in Bitcoin, Ether and XRP with a starting price of $16 million. &l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;However, while there are a handful of homes currently listed for sale in Bitcoin, some believe that using Bitcoin for real estate transactions will not result in widespread adoption — At least not until the real estate industry starts to utilize blockchain technology, which in turn will drive the adoption of cryptocurrency transactions. &l;/span&g;\n&l;/p&g;&l;blockquote&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;While Bitcoin is stepping into society&a;rsquo;s massive adoption as a decentralized cryptocurrency, the next-generation blockchain technology &a;nbsp;brings a lot more to the real estate world than just a payment alternative. For example, Propy is based on the Ethereum blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around, while also representing the ownership of property. Ultimately, this enables title deed transfers to take place entirely online. Imagine a world where you can buy or sell your property while sitting on your couch – now this is a reality with blockchain technology, Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://tokensale.propy.com/&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;Propy&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;, told me.&l;/span&g;&l;/blockquote&g;\nAccording to Karayaneva, the only way to encourage homebuyers and sellers to take advantage of cryptocurrency for real estate transactions is to take a &a;ldquo;cryptoeconomics&a;rdquo; approach, which goes much further than simply putting homes up for sale in Bitcoin.\nCryptoeconomics lays out the framework for the way in which cryptocurrency ecosystems thrive and function across a decentralized network, known as the blockchain. These ecosystems are able to allow a number of entities who do not know one another to reliably reach consensus across an anonymous, trustworthy network through the use of cryptocurrencies. This is achieved by using a combination of economic incentives and basic cryptographic tools.\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;&a;ldquo;Cryptoeconomics is like mechanism design. It starts with the desired end goal and works backwards to find the right set of mechanisms to align with the incentives of all participants in the system, to bring forth a common goal,&a;rdquo; said Karl Floerch, a core researcher for &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://www.ethereum.org/foundation&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;the Ethereum Foundation&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;For example, the international real estate marketplace, Propy, applies cryptoeconomics by &l;/span&g;&l;i&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;incentivizing&l;/span&g;&l;/i&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g; individual users to join the Propy platform to list properties, share properties on social media, upload title history into the system and more.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;&a;ldquo;Users on the Propy platform are rewarded with blockchain tokens that serve as &a;ldquo;coupons&a;rdquo; for the use of the platform&a;rsquo;s services, while they are easily tradable online to other perspective users that want to obtain access to the services. Users have in their hands a secure, easy-to-use, comprehensive way for completing their real estate transactions,&a;rdquo; Karayaneva said. &l;/span&g;\n&l;!–nextpage–&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;Users who list properties, share these listings on social media and upload title history on the network, are fueled by Propy&a;rsquo;s &a;ldquo;PRO&a;rdquo; tokens (ERC-20 tokens), which are designed to be used for unlocking smart contracts for title transfers in the Propy Registry. In other words, ownership transfer is happening entirely online and is secured by blockchain technology. &l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;Moreover, the token economics approach in the real estate industry is also intended to incentivize title &a;ldquo;miners&a;rdquo; and government agencies adoption, encouraging widespread&a;nbsp;use of digital tokens for every participant involved in the process.&a;nbsp;&l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;&l;/span&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;. &l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;For example, the state of Vermont just &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-vermont-city-tests-blockchain-technology-for-property-deals-1517351207&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;announced&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g; the launch of a pilot project with Propy to utilize blockchain technology to record real estate conveyance documents. The pilot demonstrates how blockchain technology can secure real estate transactions by storing land management data across a blockchain-based network.&l;/span&g;\n&l;blockquote&g;The announcement of a pilot project to utilize blockchain technology in real estate transactions is emblematic of Vermont&a;rsquo;s long history of innovating business, insurance, and financial technology. We are fortunate to have a cutting-edge statutory framework that enables the use of blockchain technology, and we will continue to work with the legislature to ensure Vermont remains at the forefront of these innovations, said Michael Schirling, the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary.&l;/blockquote&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;Moreover, blockchain&a;rsquo;s growing presence in the real estate industry can provide a solution for creating more efficient cross-border transactions. Between 2009 and 2016, &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/198667-0&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g;demand for cross-border real estate transactions increased from $65 billion to $217 billion.&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400&q;&g; Chinese citizens are currently among the largest groups of foreign investors in the U.S. real estate market, owning over $28 billion in U.S. residential properties. However, the total value of the U.S. residential real estate market is over $29 trillion. Foreign investment in the U.S. residential sector could potentially be equal to hundreds of billions of dollars if foreign investors were able to conduct real estate transactions online.&l;/span&g;\nWhile the use of Bitcoin for real estate transactions is certainly gaining traction, an incentive based approach for using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology within the real estate industry will drive adoption moving forward. Cryptoeconomics demonstrates the real-world value that blockchain technology can bring to the real estate industry, which in turn will lead to the mainstream use of cryptocurrencies being applied to conduct real estate transactions. In the meantime, adoption will continue to progress slowly.\n&a;nbsp;", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

ANON coin was developed to address the demand for a cryptocurrency that provides truly anonymous transactions. A list of participating exchanges is expected by August 15, 2018, and the remainder of the BTCA testnet will take place up to the snapshot on September 9, 2018. ANON will officially be available on September 10, 2018 at a 1:1 ratio to holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and ZClassic (ZCL). As it is a co-fork of BTC and ZCL, one must hold BTC or ZCL prior to the fork to acquire ANON. The maximum amount of ANON will be 31.5 million, with 24 million ANON available when the fork occurs. BTCA intends to set ANON apart from other forks by succeeding where previous forks did not. The team cites lack of anonymous transactions, high transactions fees, and lengthy transaction times as some of the failures their coin will circumvent. The ability to anonymously transact draws many to cryptocurrency. BTC, the most prominent cryptocurrency, does not facilitate anonymous transactions. ANON draws from the privacy protocol of ZCL to provide anonymous transactions by using the same MIT-developed zkSNARKs privacy protocol. The zkSNARKs protocol allows for verifiable transactions without requiring interaction between the prover and verifier. As such, transactions are both secure and completely anonymous. While previous forks, like ZCL, have succeeded in providing anonymous transactions, they have fallen short in other ways that deterred widespread market adoption of the currency. The BTCA team includes several crypto and Fintech veterans who have observed other forks and what the crypto community wants to see. Increased block size and incorporation of masternodes are two features the BTCA team integrated into ANON in response to crypto market demand. Developers increased block size to support faster transaction times. Masternodes provide an opportunity for return on investment for holders of a minimum required amount of a particular coin. Through masternodes, holders of ANON can stake the currency. Staking incentivizes holding the coin for extended periods of time. The BTCA team intends that ANON is accessible and appealing to both those who have never used crypto and existing crypto users. As such, a community presence and transparent development are core principles for BTCA. BTCA has a social media presence, through which they communicate with their public. Videos of the forking process, frequent updates, and Q&A events allow anyone to follow the forking process. The team wants to tell their forking story in such a way that those unfamiliar with crypto are interested and informed, thus overcoming what was a challenge for previous forks in terms of effectively connecting with those new to crypto.

subject of hyperbole since it jumped into the public consciousness a few years ago. At that time, I started to write regularly on the subject in these pages and quickly came to realize that most articles on the subject fell into one of two camps: Either they were what seemed then to be hopelessly optimistic, calling for the digital currency’s price to be in the thousands of dollars in a few years, or they were reporting comments of respected figures in the world of finance who said that a complete collapse was coming soon.\nWhat we now know, of course, is that the bulls were right. There is, however still no shortage of people predicting a collapse to zero for bitcoin.\nThe latest to make that assessment is Vanguard’s Chief Economist, Joe Davis. In an op-ed piece for etf.com Davis says that while he is optimistic about the future for blockchain technology, he sees “a decent probability that its price goes to zero.”\nFor those of us who were bullish on the currency years ago, his reasons for that belief and his analysis elicit nothing more than a strong sense of déjà vu.\nDavis points to volatility in the price of bitcoin in dollar terms over the last year or so as evidence, but that is a statement of the obvious. What it ignores is that said volatility was sparked by a massive run up at the end of 2017. There is nothing new in any traded instrument overshooting the mark on a strong bull move before correcting.\nWhile the numbers involved in bitcoin’s surge and correction may be bigger than that of say, oil in 2013 and 2014 or gold during the same period, the chart pattern, and the dynamic that forms it, is essentially the same.\nThe argument is that the degree of volatility matters, and something that volatile cannot be a “currency,” but that argument fails on multiple fronts. First, bitcoin is currently a hybrid of a currency and a commodity. Its release and supply were, after all, modeled on gold which is seen as a commodity but is also one of the oldest currencies known to man.\nEven if you ignore that, it is still true currencies are volatile by nature. That is hard to deny, even if you disregard the obvious examples such as the Argentine Peso or Zimbabwean dollar and look at a longer-term chart for a relatively stable pair such as USD/JPY.\nHolding Yen from 2008 to 2012 resulted in a forty percent loss in value. Oh, and Davis's other argument that interest payments are vital falls down here too, when you would have received less that 0.2% on average over those four years.\nOf course, I understand that there is a difference in both magnitude and time-span between USD/JPY’s volatility and that of bitcoin, but the argument really fails when Davis states that bitcoin’s volatility disqualifies it from being a currency, as it is not a “store of value.”\nIn fact, bitcoin was created precisely because currencies are not stores of value.\nThe current model for economies and their currencies is inflationary, which is to say that economic growth is enabled by creating more money. That is why a house that cost a few thousand dollars a few decades ago will now cost hundreds of thousands, an analogy that can be applied to almost any product.\nIf you simply acquired some dollars and stashed them away fifty years ago you would have lost a lot of purchasing power. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is designed to be disinflationary. The fixed supply means that as the supply of goods increases with growth, the value of each unit increases.\nThere are, therefore, several logical flaws in Mr. Davis’ argument that bitcoin is going to zero, but what creates the sense of déjà vu is that he refers in his piece to both “pets.com” and tulips. These bubble comparisons were being made five years ago when I started to write on bitcoin and have been trotted out by hundreds, if not thousands, of people since.\nTime has shown that they were wrong then, and they are still wrong now. It is quite possible that bitcoin drops to significantly lower than the roughly $8,000 current price, but a rehash of clichéd arguments that have so far been as far from accurate as can be adds nothing to the debate. Until somebody comes up with something else, I will continue to believe recent history.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.etf.com/sections/etf-industry-perspective/vanguard-bitcoin-presents-quandary"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:08:33.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8291c02f0b30acbbb137b2fe0e91fabf2d063467", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0aFxV0e6XWoe_m8UFc.V4tT3pC8copO31HDAwFsr171N_m5srolluD80pCxqQbADtuBw.fmcRm1gpYN_Awvo.k1RspFaIRetCWYP8xaYTCE9j.PeNH3dD3uQ--", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Daily Stock Market Overview, Data Updates, Reports &amp; News - Nasdaq", "title": "A Defense Of Bitcoin Against The Latest Version Of An Old Attack", "title_full": "A Defense Of Bitcoin Against The Latest Version Of An Old Attack - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2018-05-22T18:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8291c02f0b30acbbb137b2fe0e91fabf2d063467", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0aFxV0e6XWoe_m8UFc.V4tT3pC8copO31HDAwFsr171N_m5srolluD80pCxqQbADtuBw.fmcRm1gpYN_Awvo.k1RspFaIRetCWYP8xaYTCE9j.PeNH3dD3uQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Martin Tillier", "published": "2018-05-22T18:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Defense Of Bitcoin Against The Latest Version Of An Old Attack", "text": "Shutterstock photo Bitcoin, it seems, has been the subject of hyperbole since it jumped into the public consciousness a few years ago.

The report identifies cryptocurrency related fraud to comprise less than 1% of the scam activity recorded in Australia last year.\nAlso Read: Ross Ulbricht Continues to Fight for Freedom With Supreme Court Petition Cryptocurrency Scams Responsible for 0.6% of Australian Losses to Fraud in 2017\nThe ACCC has published its annual report on the Australian scam economy. The report provides insight into “emerging trends and techniques employed by scammers.”\nDuring 2017, the ACCC, and other pertinent Australian government institutions received “over 200,000 scam reports” corresponding to “losses exceeding $340 million [AUD]” (approximately $258 million USD) – an increase of 13.3% compared with 2016’s total losses.\nDuring 2017, the ACCC attributes $2.1 million AUD ($1.59 million USD approximately) in losses to cryptocurrency scams – a megre 0.617 percent of Australia’s combined losses to scams. Cryptocurrency Scams Peak During December 2017\nThe report states that the prevalence of reported cryptocurrency scams was closely correlated to the speculative frenzy surrounding virtual currencies last year.\nThe states that “In the fourth quarter of 2017, the value and popularity of cryptocurrencies increased worldwide [….] Between January and September 2017, about $100,000 was reported lost per month to scams which had a cryptocurrency angle. However, in the month of December 2017, reported losses to Scamwatch exceeded $700,000 and the average reported loss had jumped from $1885 in January to $13,205.”\nThe report also states that “With the increased popularity of cryptocurrency speculation in the last quarter of 2017, fake initial coin offerings and other cryptocurrency-related scams were reported […] to the ACCC.” Many Victims Recommended Scams by Friends\nThe ACCC describes a variety of different scams involving cryptocurrency that were reported during 2017. In addition to “fake initial coin offerings,” the report states that other scammers “capitalized on the general confusion about how cryptocurrency works and instead of people discovering how to directly buy cryptocurrencies, many found themselves caught up in what were essentially pyramid schemes.” The report adds that “A number of reports showed that victims entered into cryptocurrency-based scams through friends and family who convinced them they were onto a good thing, a classic element of pyramid schemes.”\nThe report also states that “Not all cryptocurrency-related scams involve victims attempting to invest in stocks or initial coin offerings. Many scammers also ask for payment through cryptocurrencies for a variety of scams because it is easier to remain anonymous while receiving payment. Ransomware scammers for example, commonly ask for payment through Bitcoin.” Crypto Fraud Dwarfed by Losses Incurred by Other Scams\nThe ACCC report states that losses to investment scams exceeded $64 million AUD (approximately $48.6 million USD) in 2017 – a 33% increase from 2016. The report also estimates that dating and romance scams accounted for over $42 million AUD (roughly $31.9 USD).\nThe ACCC also states that “Australian businesses were targeted by business email compromise scams” – resulting in over $22.1 million ($16.8 million USD approximately) being transferred to scammers.\nDo you think that the mainstream narrative surrounding cryptocurrency and scams is balanced or embellished?

In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. \\n\nHowever, an upward crossover appears to be materializing and if so, bitcoin price might still be able to break past the channel top. In particular, a move past the swing high around $8,600 could confirm that buyers have the upper hand. \\n\nRSI is dipping into oversold territory to show that sellers are exhausted and may let buyers take over. Stochastic still seems to have some room to fall, so bitcoin price might follow suit. \\n\nThe nearest support area is at the 38.2% extension or $8,039 level at the mid-channel area of interest. The 50% extension is at $7,855 and the 61.8% extension is at the swing low or $7,671. Stronger selling pressure could take it down to the 78.6% extension at $7,410 or the channel support. The full extension is located at $7,077.4. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nA rebound in risk-taking paved the way for some bitcoin price gains after a trade truce between the US and China was announced. This supported commodities, equities, and other riskier assets like cryptocurrencies versus the dollar. \\n\nThe main event for the US dollar is the release of the FOMC minutes this week as this could clarify tightening expectations. Hawkish remarks could mean more dollar gains versus bitcoin while cautious ones could allow the cryptocurrency to advance. \\n\nThere have been no major headlines pertaining to bitcoin, so investors could keep holding out and staying cautious while waiting for more developments. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Might Not Be Done Yet appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T10:36:07.055+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b802ff6621a02fafb5acf5447df765b7a1d3557f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNE2cQEsPOsWbikwKedkpDGKgaFnbcWdk6HcHhriV8Ti1e_v5E0Tr_AKAFc77uuKDdQERykTIGBeGqoZjJ5Iy5FA-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to hold", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to hold", "published": "2018-05-22T18:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.045, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b802ff6621a02fafb5acf5447df765b7a1d3557f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNE2cQEsPOsWbikwKedkpDGKgaFnbcWdk6HcHhriV8Ti1e_v5E0Tr_AKAFc77uuKDdQERykTIGBeGqoZjJ5Iy5FA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-22T18:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to hold", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to hold gains above $1,220 and declined below $1,200 against the US Dollar. \\n There is a declining channel forming with resistance at $1,220 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair is likely to extend the current decline and it could test the $1,150 support level. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price is back in a bearish zone below $1,220 against the US Dollar. BCH\\/USD is losing momentum and it could continue to move down towards $1,150. \\n Bitcoin Cash Price Decline \\n\nThere was a rejection noted from the $1,300 resistance zone in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price formed a short-term top near $1,315 before starting a downside move. It declined and moved below the $1,250 and $1,220 support levels. The downside move was strong as the price also closed below the $1,220 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. \\n\nDuring the decline, the price broke the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,165 low to $1,315 high. The current price action suggests that a close below $1,220 and the 100 hourly SMA was crucial. At the moment, there is a declining channel forming with resistance at $1,220 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. The pair could accelerate declines below the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,165 low to $1,315 high. The next support may well be the last swing low of $1,165, followed by the all-important $1,150. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the current downside move seems to be a bearish wave with a close below $1,210. Should the price correct higher from the current levels, the $1,220 and $1,250 levels are likely to prevent upsides. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators: \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is back gaining pace in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is now well below the 40 level. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $1,150 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,220 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH\\/USD Losing Momentum appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T10:35:40.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36756e41dd654b600a00bc4b5fcdf05afdf4d045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfiF_XycCS.x3OvoWGLNPuEqcLTv7N5SDIHyvxF4fjDF2N1O9zrcFs0xmjwUztWpc8j2VHjaLtqythWFRav8FhzFT3gHbxDR59gRkCj3YxESE3ztpgyHnDpotAWmwjToHjDQzamqyl0t57qzTiTQwfzZQz95ZG7iUZ01enaGwqMdmdxVfcAujCFkziNxQHRug-", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent - Tech", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: How a pizza worth $40m shows the cryptocurrency’s stunning price rise", "title_full": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: How a pizza worth $40m shows the cryptocurrency’s stunning price rise | The Independent", "published": "2018-05-22T18:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/16/14/bitcoin-pizza-transaction-worth-cryptocurrency.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36756e41dd654b600a00bc4b5fcdf05afdf4d045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfiF_XycCS.x3OvoWGLNPuEqcLTv7N5SDIHyvxF4fjDF2N1O9zrcFs0xmjwUztWpc8j2VHjaLtqythWFRav8FhzFT3gHbxDR59gRkCj3YxESE3ztpgyHnDpotAWmwjToHjDQzamqyl0t57qzTiTQwfzZQz95ZG7iUZ01enaGwqMdmdxVfcAujCFkziNxQHRug-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anthony Cuthbertson", "published": "2018-05-22T18:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: How a pizza worth $40m shows the cryptocurrency’s stunning price rise", "text": "On 17 May, 2010, a computer programmer from Florida set out to prove that bitcoin could be used as a real-world currency. At the time, one unit of the cryptocurrency was only worth $0.008, so Laszlo Hanyecz proposed buying two pizzas for what would today be an extraordinary sum of bitcoins.\n“I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas,” Mr Hanyecz said on a bitcoin forum. “Maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.”\nHe signed off the post: “If you’re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.”\nYou do not have access to view this Atom. Most members of the forum were interested in the experiment but some saw it as a bid to get a free meal from a technology that was unknown beyond a small subset of free market libertarians and so-called cypher-punks.\n“Good luck on getting your free pizza,” one user commented, to which Mr Hanyecz replied: “I just think it would be interesting if I could say that I paid for a pizza in bitcoins.”\nFive days later Mr Hanyecz posted a picture of two pizzas to the same forum, alongside a comment saying he had successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins to acquire them.\nWithin a couple of months the price of bitcoin had risen 10-fold, forcing the computer programmer to rescind an open offer to exchange bitcoins for pizza.\nEight years later, that same amount of bitcoin would be worth more than $80 million – a figure that serves to demonstrate the cryptocurrency’s continued price rise since its inception in January 2009 . The historic transaction is believed to be the first time a good or service was exchanged for bitcoin and is remembered on 22 May each year as ‘Bitcoin Pizza Day.’\nThe #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day!\n— Bitcoin Pizza 🍕 (@bitcoin_pizza) May 22, 2018 \"It wasn't like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\" Mr Hanyecz told The New York Times in 2013, when the sum of bitcoins had sky-rocketed to $6 million. \"No one knew it was goin to get so big.\"\nMr Hanyecz had acquired the bitcoin through mining – a process that uses computing power to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to generate new units of the cryptocurrency. He therefore didn't see it as losing a future fortune but rather proving the capabilities of a nascent technology.\nHe eventually sold the rest of his bitcoins when their value reached $1, earning around $4,000, which he used to buy himself a new computer.\nThe computer programmer continues to be interested in bitcoin and recently replicated the experiment using the Lightning Network, a platform that operates over bitcoin's blockchain in order to facilitate more efficient transactions on bitcoin's network.\nIn February this year, Mr Hanyecz paid 0.00649 bitcoins for two pizzas in order to test the Lightning Network.\nOn May 22, 2010, those same bitcoin would have been worth 0.00005 cents.\nThe Independent's bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Connect via:\n- Trading Ether and Bitcoin against each helps remove general cryptocurrency market risk.\n- Ether continues to out-perform Bitcoin.\nIf you are new to trading cryptocurrencies, or are just looking to refresh your trading knowledge, please see the DailyFX ‘Guide to Day Trading Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies’.\nTrading the ETH/BTC Spread\nCryptocurrency trading is notoriously volatile with price swings of 20%+ seen in times of heavy turbulence. And in most of these cases, all cryptocurrencies move in the same direc tion, either sharply up or down, leaving traders exposed to market risk. And while cryptocurrencies are different with specific news and announcements also major drivers for market moves, general market sentiment continues to be the main theme of the cryptocurrency space.\nOne way to reduce market sentiment risk is by trading two cryptocurrencies against each other – a spread trade. A look at the latest Ether (ETH)/Bitcoin (BTC) spread shows that ETH has been outperforming BTC over the last 6 weeks, moving up from around 0.0580 to a current level of 0.0832, a rise of just over 43%. The basis behind this move is that traders believe that ETH has more value than BTC as a company or network, while market positioning and sentiment will also have played a part in the move.\nA comprehensive guide to Ether (ETH)\nA look at the latest IG Client Sentiment Report shows that customers are 73.6% net-long of Bitcoin and 91.0% net-long of Ether. While this is a contrarian indicator – bearish for both – daily and weekly changes in net-longs and net-shorts impact on overall retail sentiment.\nThe strong uptrend remains in place, while on this four-hour chart the price remains above the 200-day moving average, a bullish sign. At the bottom of the chart the RSI indicator is around 46, just above the four-recent oversold reversal signals at 39.\nETH vs BTC Price Spread Four Hour Chart (April 6 – May 22, 2018)\n--- Written by Nick Cawley , Analyst .\nYou can contact the author at or via Twitter @nickcawley1.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:08:39.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "183d103965396b26f0abd03b1d793280693a5c9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmW_hmu.uYvIKScGwZGXOdvI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "If bitcoin is gone will the other coin survive?", "title_full": "If bitcoin is gone will the other coin survive?", "published": "2018-05-22T18:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "183d103965396b26f0abd03b1d793280693a5c9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmW_hmu.uYvIKScGwZGXOdvI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ballerin and giroud", "published": "2018-05-22T18:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "If bitcoin is gone will the other coin survive?", "text": "I don't think altcoin will always rely on bitcoin's popularity.
