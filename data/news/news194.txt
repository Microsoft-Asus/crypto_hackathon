Going forward, do you think a slow steady rise, rather than a speedy erratic rise is good for bitcoin to get \"accepted\" all over the world? The sudden rise seems to scare people and governments.\nFor me, I am satisfied with how bitcoin value movement because we all know the bitcoin is such volatility. Imagine if the progress of the value of bitcoin is too slow in increasing and decreasing the cost it will be boring and accessible to us. Remember panic buying or even selling have an excellent effect on others holder that waiting for the value increase.

Although the cryptocurrency scene has seen a lot of action recently, this survey paper did not age and it is still a very good introduction to learning about the technical aspects and challenges of cryptocurrencies. The paper starts with a technical overview of the cryptocurrency concept. Then it delves more into incentives and stability issues. It observes that it is unclear \"how stability will be affected either in the end state of no mining rewards or in intermediate states as transaction fees become a non-negligible source of revenue\". It talks about possible attacks, including Goldfinger attack and feather-forking, and also about stability of mining pools and the peer-to-peer layer. Finally it also covers some security and privacy issues.\n\"The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments\" whitepaper is from 2016. Bitcoin has a very high latency, poor scalability, and high transaction fees, and the lightning network provides an overlay solution to ease off these pains. To this end, the paper describes a secure off-chain solution for instant payments and microtransactions with low transaction fee. This video by Jackson Palmer describes the lightning network ideas very nicely. (I strongly prefer reading to watching/listening, but recently I am finding a lot of useful content on YouTube.)\nThe protocol builds on the basic concept of a pairwise payment channel . Two parties put aside an initial amount of Bitcoin into a multi signature transaction. Subsequently many updates to the allocation of the current balance can be made off-the-chain just with the cooperation of both parties using a new timelocked transaction, without broadcasting this to the chain. This is analogous to buying a Starbucks card and transacting with Starbucks pairwise with that card. A broadcast to the chain can be done to redeem funds on the chain and to close the channel. If either party tries to cheat by broadcasting an old transaction state from the pairwise payment channel, the counterparty may take all the funds in the channel as penalty after it provides the latest multisig agreed state to the chain (within the on-chain dispute mediation window).\nThe lightning overlay network is then formed by multihop routing over these pairwise payment channels. Even when A and Z does not have a direct pairwise payment channel, it may be possible to construct a multihop route from A to Z to use intermediaries, traversing through several pairwise payment channels. While pairwise channels could be without a fee, the multihop intermediaries need a small transaction fee to have the incentive to participate.\nThe pairwise payment channels need to be extend with hashlocks to achieve multihop transactions. Here is how this is done as explained in the Bitcoin wiki:\nAlice opens a payment channel to Bob, and Bob opens a payment channel to Charlie. Alice wants to buy something from Charlie for 1000 satoshis. Charlie generates a random number and generates its SHA256 hash. Charlie gives that hash to Alice. Alice uses her payment channel to Bob to pay him 1,000 satoshis, but she adds the hash Charlie gave her to the payment along with an extra condition: in order for Bob to claim the payment, he has to provide the data which was used to produce that hash. Bob uses his payment channel to Charlie to pay Charlie 1,000 satoshis, and Bob adds a copy of the same condition that Alice put on the payment she gave Bob. Charlie has the original data that was used to produce the hash (called a pre-image), so Charlie can use it to finalize his payment and fully receive the payment from Bob. By doing so, Charlie necessarily makes the pre-image available to Bob. Bob uses the pre-image to finalize his payment from Alice\nIn order for the multihop routes to work there should be enough cooperative participants online, each of which with enough balance to pass the bucket from hand to hand. The rest is a path-finding exercise. With viable paths present, similar to a source-side routing decision, you can start the lightning transaction. There has been a lot of work on MANETs under the names of intermittently connected networks and delay tolerant routing. I wonder if some of them can find applications here (even though they were mostly geometrical and this is a non-geometrical network.) In practice though, the multihop network often converges to a hub and spokes model, with a well-connected fat wallet intermediary.\nThe lightning network is also useful for transacting securely across different blockchains, as long as all edges in the route support the same hash function to use for the hash lock and can create timed locks.\nMAD questions 1. How can we improve the way we run the seminar?\nThe students liked how we run the seminars. They said they were more actively engaged and learned a greater deal due to this format. But I think we can improve. It would be nice to get experts video-conference and answer some questions. I think many experts would be generous to spare 20 minutes to spare to answer some questions from smart well-prepared students.\nThe students also mentioned that it would have been nice to have some hands-on projects to accompany the seminars. We started a blockchain channel so the interested students can figure out some small projects they can work on and collaborate.\n2. What did I learn?\nI didn't think much of blockchains but I am fascinated to learn that there are many challenging questions here and many good ideas/techniques. This is an area very suitable for doing distributed algorithms/protocols work, which I love. There is a need for developing more principled approaches and well-reasoned and verified algorithms/protocols.\nI still think the best ideas from these work will get borrowed and used in more centralized (could be hierarchical or federated) systems for the sake of efficiency/economy and scalability. That may be how these systems will go mainstream to millions and even billions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T18:28:44.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "431fde2bc1199ff635fd29e07ad6c6a79eee4d19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQ4vsegKrR5qNZt38KJYlFg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Will the bitcoin be outdated by another currency?", "title_full": "Will the bitcoin be outdated by another currency?", "published": "2018-05-21T18:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "431fde2bc1199ff635fd29e07ad6c6a79eee4d19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQ4vsegKrR5qNZt38KJYlFg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "A L I E N", "published": "2018-05-21T18:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will the bitcoin be outdated by another currency?", "text": "Quote: from: reyanshbasu on May 18, 2018, 12:32:34 PM No, bitcoin still the number one coin in crypto world and no one will above on it.

and devices, has filed for an initial public offering with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Submitted on May 15, the firm’s request is still in draft form and pending approval from HKEX, therefore it remains unknown at this point how much the China based company is valued at and what amount it intends to raise. But how much the China based company is valued and what company aims to raise $1 billion, which, if true and eventually effective, would make it the biggest IPO in the cryptocurrency industry.\nIn the mean time, the document also provides a glimpse into the firm’s fiscal health. Based on a financial statement included as part of the IPO filing, Canaan raised 1.3 billion yuan in revenue in 2017 only, marking 3, 000 percent year-on year expansion compared with 2016. In the same way, the company also earned in revenue in 2017 only, marking 3, 000. This isn’t the very net profit of $56 million in 2017 – a six fold increase over the previous year. As previously reported by CoinDesk, an attempted acquisition deal in 2016 would have seen Canaan go public on China’s Shenzhen Stock Exchange, but the Stock Exchange finally blocked the move over doubts.\nIn May 2017, the Business raised 300 million yuan As previously reported by CoinDesk, an attempted acquisition deal in 2016 would have seen Canaan go public on China’s Shenzhen Stock Exchange, but the Stock Exchange finally blocked the move over.

With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through \"contactless\" means once users' mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality).\nHandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains:Â \"Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash.Â We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash.Â That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender's mobile device close to the recipient's device.Â That's why we named our project HandCash.Â We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.\"\nHandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require.Â Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using \"handle\" names.Â In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip.\nHandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy \"contactless\" payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nHandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: \"In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise.Â We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.\"\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: \"For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use.Â We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach.Â nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\"\nnChain's deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network.Â This recent upgrade implements two key changes:\nIncreasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality. The BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s small 1 MB block.Â This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes.Â Â This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low.Â Â The upgrade validates HandCash's vision in creating its wallet product for Bitcoin Cash.Â\nWebsite:Â nChain.com\nTwitter:Â @nChainGlobal\nABOUT NCHAIN GROUP: The nChain Group is the global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies.Â Its mission is to enable massive growth and worldwide adoption of the Bitcoin network - focusing on Bitcoin Cash as the true Bitcoin.Â The nChain Group includes these business units:Â 1) nChain Limited â€�“ a blockchain research and development service provider in London, United Kingdom ; 2) nChain Holdings Limited â€�“ a intellectual property holding and commercialization company; 3) nChain Reaction â€�“ an investment entity which supports ventures that have Bitcoin Cash products or applications; 4) nCrypt â€�“ a Bitcoin wallet and exchange in Canada ; and 5) BMG Operations â€�“ a Bitcoin Cash mining operation.\nLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/694400/nChain_HandCash_Logo.jpg Â\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "handcash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alejandro pascual agut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex agut", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nchain reaction ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nchain group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "handcash wallet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T05:32:14.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f63aab2fd05f341e7ff618e5b0001e341febdcf2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3fq59MhvWkPZzqjO1DdPOsrMf9U7_je20pRZCZOkPkJRRfKRMnDTuxb8.kajl7ZmDJhKntVOjFwEvQuVlrh8acW7c4VDoDUM-", "site_full": "themeshreport.com", "site": "themeshreport.com", "site_section": "http://themeshreport.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Mesh Report", "title": "Why Bitcoin Prices Won’t Stay Down for Long", "title_full": "Why Bitcoin Prices Won’t Stay Down for Long", "published": "2018-05-21T18:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f63aab2fd05f341e7ff618e5b0001e341febdcf2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3fq59MhvWkPZzqjO1DdPOsrMf9U7_je20pRZCZOkPkJRRfKRMnDTuxb8.kajl7ZmDJhKntVOjFwEvQuVlrh8acW7c4VDoDUM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Growth Stock Network", "published": "2018-05-21T18:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Bitcoin Prices Won’t Stay Down for Long", "text": "\nBitcoin prices fell 3.4% to $8,275.21 on Wednesday as markets continued a broader sell-off in the cryptocurrency sector.\nThat’s creating a buying opportunity for savvy investors.

The price is currently showing some bearish rejection in the process which is expected to push higher towards $8,500 and later towards $9000 in the coming days. Though there have not been any negative fundamental on the cryptomarket and Bitcoin, such bearish momentum is viewed as a result of investors' insecurity or just a hoax created for sweeping amateur traders away from the market. As for the current scenario, the price is expected to push higher towards $9,000 with a slower pace. Later if the price breaks above $9,000 with a daily close, further impulsive momentum is expected with a target towards $10,000 in the future.

A few weeks go I set it up, downloaded the blockchain and am currently running a full node! However I still am new to running a node and after messing with the core client for a bit, I have some specific questions I haven't been able to find from reading or youtube videos.\nWould it be more secure to hold my bitcoins on the node wallet or on a hardware wallet? Currently I have my coins on a hardware wallet, but its my understanding that you still have to trust the hardware device company to tap into the bitcoin network and tell you how much you have. When if you have a node, you don't have to trust a third party to tell you your funds are there because the proof is in the blockchain on your node. Am I correct in this? Would that mean it would be better to store my coins on my node computer?\nIts also my understanding that if you lose your hardware device, as long as you have the passphrase when you setup the wallet, you can order a new device, reinsert your phrase and get access to your funds. Does a node work the same way? What would happen if someone stole my node computer, but they could not get access to my funds because of my encrypted passphase? How would I recover my funds? If I got a new mode computer after mine had theoretically been stolen, can I get access to my funds similar in process to a hardware wallet? How would this work?\nI'm just looking for some clarification as to if a node is safer to store my funds that a hardware wallet and what would the process be to recover funds if my node computer was stolen. Any info on this process would be helpful, thanks!\nsubmitted by /u/italianjankzster\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T17:56:33.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae8ef56af1205f876114a91941645a2cd66a4197", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRu6_0JIyDBczXBd3xSpzO.SYffQLufHFOnDDkyuDOV2xYSQe5j_N.tvc8zWVnJ5D2Y9NOgyRtgWV_XAY3.P5EFH6bnLsIoi1Q6AAymE0qcQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinpartner.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinpartner.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BitCoinPartner - Cryptocurrency Innovative Payment Network News", "title": "Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Files for Hong Kong IPO", "title_full": "Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Files for Hong Kong IPO", "published": "2018-05-21T17:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae8ef56af1205f876114a91941645a2cd66a4197", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRu6_0JIyDBczXBd3xSpzO.SYffQLufHFOnDDkyuDOV2xYSQe5j_N.tvc8zWVnJ5D2Y9NOgyRtgWV_XAY3.P5EFH6bnLsIoi1Q6AAymE0qcQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yogya Biz (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T17:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Files for Hong Kong IPO", "text": "China-based Canaan Creative, one of the largest bitcoin mining hardware makers, has filed for an IPO in Hong Kong.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T19:06:39.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b5c93cc1e0f39ca00f98620982ee0f9cf11e3c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQylblw1_bu74JTjNA_kG2Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "What is the relationship between Altcoins and bitcoin ?", "title_full": "What is the relationship between Altcoins and bitcoin ?", "published": "2018-05-21T17:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b5c93cc1e0f39ca00f98620982ee0f9cf11e3c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQylblw1_bu74JTjNA_kG2Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Angela28", "published": "2018-05-21T17:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is the relationship between Altcoins and bitcoin ?", "text": "Between bitcoin and altcoin are interrelated.

According to financial media, the police in Shenzhen arrested six people who allegedly robbed 3,000 Chinese investors of $ 47 million, selling a cryptocurrency, which they claimed to be backed by commodities.\nSix suspects formed a company based in Shenzhen called PEB, which from January 2017 issued a token powered by Blockchain, named Pu'er Coin. The website of the project says that the buyer of the token is entitled to have a contract owned by a certain amount of Tibetan Pu'er tea, which the company has in stores, and which it considers worth billions of dollars. While the token can then be exchanged in the aftermarket called Jubi.com, another website claims that the contract may yield an annual return of 12 percent if investors choose to block their funds for 12 months. The police investigation showed that despite the fact that the company had only a \"very limited amount of tea in stock\", it promised high short-term profits to investors in promotional campaigns on social media and traveling advertising campaigns in luxury hotels. The police also say that the project has managed to attract a significant number of investors by manipulating the secondary market using its own means to raise the price of tokens twenty times during 2017. At the end of last month, the company received a warning and a fine from the Chinese state administration for market regulation, whose task is to ensure fair and fair market competition. The authorities imposed a fine of $ 20 million on the company for spreading false information in the ad that touted allegedly large Tibetan tea stocks that supported the token.\nThe arrest is another notable sanction regarding alleged cryptocurrency fraud in China, as the authorities in this country have increased their efforts to combat illegal fundraising.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market has managed to break out above the golden trend line and made a local high at the level of $8,505, just above the weekly pivot at the level of $8,446. The corrective cycle in wave 2/B might have been completed as well, but as long as the price will not break through the high of the wave X at the level of $8,900, the recent upward development might be still treated as the alt:b wave. The situation is still not 100% clear who is in control of the market, so it is better to wait for the important levels to be tested first.

Lagos is the choice location for the hub and it will be officially opened later this year.\nThe peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace also revealed that Lagos, the commercial nerve of Nigeria will provide a co-working space and some services including mentorship, corporate and individual blockchain training, and networking for ICO advisors.\nThe CEO of Paxful, Ray Youssef while speaking on the latest development said, “Paxful is committed to fostering economic growth in Africa and helping the unbanked and underbanked gain access to the opportunities they have been denied for so long.\n“The incubator is simply a starting point to help driven entrepreneurs in an industry that has shattered boundaries all over the world,” he added.\nIn a related development, Paxful also appointed Chuta Chimezie as Regional Director of Africa, to be based out of Nigeria.\nAccording to iAfrikan, Chimezie’s role will revolve around conducting business operations, facilitating local and international brand awareness, creating educational content on behalf of Paxful, recruiting and overseeing the incubator’s day-to-day operations.\nChimezie also while commenting said, “It is a privilege to work with an organization that believes in investing in countries with great potential such as Nigeria.\n“Paxful’s initiatives have not only helped those in great need here, but are also helping African entrepreneurs achieve their full potential. Paxful is using Bitcoin to do good in the world, and I am proud to become an integral part of that.”\nThis is however not Paxful’s first engagement with Africa. It is worth noting that late last year, Paxful launched a charitable program called #BuiltwithBitcoin whose aim was to encourage those in the cryptocurrency industry to contribute funds for humanitarian projects with the first project being in Rwanda.\nPaxful will sponsor several blockchain and crypto-focused events in Nigeria, and it also mentioned that it plans to sponsor and speak at others in Ghana, Cameroon and Kenya.\n“We are where we are now because people gave back and it helped us tremendously.

This slightly tilted the course of the coin on Monday, May 7, but today it is still in the green zone.\n\"I would oppose bitcoin if there was an easy way to do this,\" said Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corporation in CNBC's Squawk Box, on Monday, May 7.\n \"As an asset class, you do not produce anything, and so you should not expect it to rise, it's a kind of pure investment\" stupid theory, \"Gates said in the CNBC program\" Squawk Box. \"\n \"Bitcoin and ICO, I believe, I believe, these are some of the crazy, speculative things,\" Gates said. He added that someone once gave him bitcoins for his birthday, but he sold it in a few years.\nAccording to Gates, there is no need to count on the growth of bitcoin's value: \"from the point of view of the asset class, you do not produce anything.\" The largest shareholder of Microsoft considers investing in this cryptonet \"the theory of a bigger fool in its pure form.\"\nShe claims that money can be made by acquiring securities without regard for their quality and selling them at a profit, because there will always be a \"bigger fool.\" Proceeding from the theory, speculative bubbles grow in this way, which burst with time and bring down the value of shares in a mass sale.\nNote that earlier Gates accused the BTC of the death of people, pointing out that the coin is often used to buy drugs. In November 2014, the businessman called bitcoin \"a revolutionary technology and the most innovative solution in the modern Internet payment market.\"\nLike many critics of crypto currency, Gates acknowledged that the basic technology of blockchain has its advantages. Blocking eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, such as a bank, to quickly create a secure, permanent report on the transaction between the two parties. Bitcoin is the first application of blocking technology, and companies are exploring ways to use technology to manage supply chains, trade and other areas.\nIf he says that then maybe some banks offered him a huge amount of money to say that.

It seems only fitting to have the 2018 National Settlement Services Summit (NS3) close with a lively discussion of this topic.\nDuring the session titled “Blockchain, Bitcoin and You,” three industry insiders will discuss how the growth of Blockchain and cryptocurrency stands to benefit title agents, lenders, Realtors and borrowers.\n“I don’t want to sound too simplistic but it’s just going to change the way we do everything,” Crypto Realty Group CEO Piper Moretti said. “Rather than going to several different sources for all the information that we need as Realtors, we’ll be able to close on a house in a matter of a few days rather than a month to 45 or 60 days. Transactions will be infinitely faster. That’s the end goal, I believe.”\nMoretti will be joined by John Heck, director industry general manager at DXC Technology Co. and former of IBM, and Matt Einheber, principal at Transfer: Real Estate Intelligence.\nIn addition to speed, the speakers will detail how Blockchain could improve fraud mitigation, reduce errors, cut down on paperwork and much more.\nMoretti said she is working with some startups in the process of developing essentially a one-stop shop for all parts of the real estate transaction, from beginning to end. The efficiency of Blockchain enables them to dream big in terms of ushering in a new modern era of real estate transactions.\n“We’ll look at traditional recordkeeping, which is completely archaic, and what is hopefully coming down the pike,” she said. “It really just comes down to adoption. How fast can we do it and how fast can we learn it.”\nSome states already are taking steps to better accommodate Blockchain, she noted, such as Arizona and California. Both states have introduced legislation to make Blockchain a legal form of recordkeeping, which could alleviate issues with the use of cryptocurrency that continue to crop up.\nThe speakers also will touch on how companies can effectively protect borrowers’ sensitive information and keep them abreast of information that is pivotal to a smooth home-buying process.\nFor more information on the 2018 NS3, including the agenda and a list of speakers, click here .

A few weeks go I set it up, downloaded the blockchain and am currently running a full node! However I still am new to running a node and after messing with the core client for a bit, I have some specific questions I haven't been able to find from reading or youtube videos.\nWould it be more secure to hold my bitcoins on the node wallet or on a hardware wallet? Currently I have my coins on a hardware wallet, but its my understanding that you still have to trust the hardware device company to tap into the bitcoin network and tell you how much you have. When if you have a node, you don't have to trust a third party to tell you your funds are there because the proof is in the blockchain on your node. Am I correct in this? Would that mean it would be better to store my coins on my node computer?\nIts also my understanding that if you lose your hardware device, as long as you have the passphrase when you setup the wallet, you can order a new device, reinsert your phrase and get access to your funds. Does a node work the same way? What would happen if someone stole my node computer, but they could not get access to my funds because of my encrypted passphase? How would I recover my funds? If I got a new mode computer after mine had theoretically been stolen, can I get access to my funds similar in process to a hardware wallet? How would this work?\nI'm just looking for some clarification as to if a node is safer to store my funds that a hardware wallet and what would the process be to recover funds if my node computer was stolen.

By adopting DPoS consensus mechanism with 2M blocksize, Lightning Bitcoin improves transaction speed, promotes decentralization and also supports smart contracts. Lightning Bitcoin combines the advantages of Bitcoin and Ethereum and creates a more valuable and functional blockchain system.\nThe ticker of Lightning Bitcoin is LBTC.\nHow to claim LBTC\nThe original bitcoin holders can claim LBTC at a 1:1 ratio if you held BTC in the wallet or the supporting exchanges at Bitcoin block 499,999 (Dec. 18th, 2017).\nPlease only use links provided by this post, website, twitter or official telegram.\nWhy does LBTC use DPoS instead of PoW\nLBTC employs the DPoS Consensus Mechanism, which implements technological democracies to offset the negative effects of centralization problems posed by the PoW algorithm. As a result, true decentralization can be achieved with the voting right in the hands of the token holders, which ensures to maximize shareholder profitability and the network effect, minimize the costs of maintaining cybersecurity and the cost of operating the network. Significantly reduced the number of participating verification nodes, LBTC can reach the consensus in seconds, and the transaction speed is really FAST as lightning.\nFeatures\nAdvantages\nIoV Protocol\nRoadmap\nHow to forge LBTC\nFirst, one need to download the wallet and register as delegate. One address can register as one delegate. Then you can vote for yourself or ask others to vote for you. The number of votes is the number of LBTC held by the voting address. The top 101 addresses that get the highest number of votes can be regarded as bookkeeping nodes. The ranking and votes can be seen in the block explorer.\nThe previous steps can be completed through the light wallet our the full node wallet, but if you're elected as a bookkeeping node, you need to run the forging process in the full node wallet. The detailed tutorial can be found in LBTC website.\nSupporting Exchanges\nDigiFinex.com\nBtcTrade.im\nCoinEgg.com\nAEX.com\nFirefoxotc.com\nZB.com\nSWFT.pro\nLBTC future\nEXXVIP.com\nYoBit.net\nKKEX.com\nBCEX.ca\nFAQ\n1. LBTC ticker.\nLightning Bitcoin ticker is LBTC. You are right if you noticed that some coins have similar ticker or differ only by one letter. Litebitcoin (LBTC, LBTCX) and Bitcoin Lightning (BLT) are coins that are not related to Lightning Bitcoin. Please be careful and check the spelling before any manipulation with cryptocurrencies.\n2. How to claim LBTC? How does this airdrop of LBTC work?\nThe original bitcoin holders can claim LBTC at a 1:1 ratio if you held BTC in the wallet or the supporting exchanges at Bitcoin block 499,999. You can find the official wallet and the tutorial on our website.\n3. Why price is so different in different exchanges?\nSome of the exchanges haven't install LBTC wallet yet. At present, only one exchange is open to charge: DigiFinex.com\n4. Are there any bounty systems, how can I contribute?\nYes! Anyone can contribute by writing articles, setting up promoting groups, or coding. The detailed rules will be posted on Medium in weeks.\n5. 3sec + 2MB means the blockchain increases by 40MB/min and 57GB/day?\nThe actual blocksize depends on the transactions during this 3 seconds, and normally it's less than 1KB at the beginning, so 57GB per day is a hypothetical growth with maximum loading.\n6. Does LBTC has premine? How do you get the money to work things out?\nThere is no premine, but Lightning Team will build a security node to make sure the network works at earlier stage.\nThe addresses that have no transactions or only inflows less than 1BTC accumulated since Jan 31th 2013 are defined as inactive addresses. We took LBTC from inactive addresses for ecological construction, such as algorithmic research, smart contracts and DApps development, community rewards and global promotion.The wallet will be managed by LBTC foundation. We reserve the rights of these inactive addresses to claim their LBTC back.\n7. Are LBTC and Lightning Network related? What's the difference?\nLightning Bitcoin is a hard fork of Bitcoin; Lighting Network is an off-chain protocol built on Bitcoin. It is important to underline that these projects are not related to each other. The only thing that Lightning Bitcoin and Lightning Network have in common is the desire to propose solutions to the Bitcoin scalability problem and the word lightning .\n8. Open source?\nThe Light Wallet is open source: https://github.com/lbtcio , and other code is opened when the main network is stable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://exxvip.com/", "https://t.me/LightningBTC_news", "http://lightningbitcoin.io/", "https://github.com/lbtcio", "http://lbtc.io/", "https://t.me/LightningBTC", "https://twitter.com/LightningBTC", "https://medium.com/lightning-bitcoin-blog", "http://explorer.lbtc.io/", "https://www.digifinex.com/", "http://lbtcfans.com/", "https://t.me/Lightning_Bitcoin_LBTC", "https://t.me/LightningBTC_CN"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:39:42.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "034cbe65712efd6d31263de57d970a1ecd78b866", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdpty8CbcGN62HiJP0Vv4Sc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=9.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Off-topic", "title": "what device are you using to access bitcoin forum ?", "title_full": "what device are you using to access bitcoin forum ?", "published": "2018-05-21T17:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.108, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "034cbe65712efd6d31263de57d970a1ecd78b866", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdpty8CbcGN62HiJP0Vv4Sc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Philmate", "published": "2018-05-21T17:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "what device are you using to access bitcoin forum ?", "text": "I usually use my iPhone", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T13:32:06.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df46ce3c495af84b1d977c1e36d5bc3e457ffc6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQarwPVuj7oIpNzwtaXmuEs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marketplace", "title": "Accepting bitcoin for service", "title_full": "Accepting bitcoin for service", "published": "2018-05-21T17:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.228, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df46ce3c495af84b1d977c1e36d5bc3e457ffc6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQarwPVuj7oIpNzwtaXmuEs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Uno17", "published": "2018-05-21T17:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Accepting bitcoin for service", "text": "For me yes i will accept bitcoin as payment for my services if ever, why would i dont accept btc as payment when bitcoin is also a money being kept.

This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has moved past the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point as an early signal of bullish momentum. \\n\nRSI is on the move up to show that there’s some buying momentum left, but the oscillator is nearing overbought conditions to reflect exhaustion. Similarly, stochastic is heading north so bitcoin price could follow suit, but the oscillator is also approaching overbought levels. Turning back down could draw sellers in once more. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nIf bulls are able to stay in control, they could push bitcoin price up to the next potential resistance at the 38.2% extension or $9279. The 50% extension is near the $9700 major psychological level while the 61.8% extension lines up with the swing high around $10,000. Stronger bullish pressure could take it up to fresh highs at the 76.4% extension or $10,705 level or the full extension at $11,461. \\n\nFor now, though, market watchers are paying extra close attention to the energy costs related to mining bitcoin. This casts doubts on the sustainability of this particular cryptocurrency, but the improved sentiment in the industry to start the week appears to be providing enough support. \\n\nLooking ahead, the FOMC minutes could turn the spotlight back to dollar movements as stronger tightening hints could boost the US currency higher against bitcoin price once more. To top it off, a return in geopolitical risk could weigh on the riskier asset. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Support Holding, Bullish Pattern Forming appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T09:20:40.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f665127ff77fa869262a496aae74b2e61c5e1f6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUPDfEWXu2cJVygA9jCuEoRgR0VlQHO1YYBNDf6a2poZ6VnxjfppN6RZaaro1scQoHXozQ_oz2CQzA--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price recovered and", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price recovered and", "published": "2018-05-21T17:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.323, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f665127ff77fa869262a496aae74b2e61c5e1f6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUPDfEWXu2cJVygA9jCuEoRgR0VlQHO1YYBNDf6a2poZ6VnxjfppN6RZaaro1scQoHXozQ_oz2CQzA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-21T17:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price recovered and", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price recovered and managed to move above the $1,250 resistance against the US Dollar. \\n There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $1,255 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair may continue to rise, but it could correct lower to test the $1,240-50 support area. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price is showing a few positive signs above $1,250 against the US Dollar. BCH\\/USD is currently correcting lower and it remains supported above $1,240. \\n Bitcoin Cash Price Support \\n\nAfter forming a base around the $1,150 level, bitcoin cash price started an upside recovery against the US Dollar. The price traded higher and it managed to move above the $1,200 and $1,240 resistance levels. The upside move was very positive since the price closed above the $1,250 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It even spiked above the $1,300 level before starting a downside correction. \\n\nA high was formed at $1,315 and the price corrected below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,165 low to $1,315 high. However, there are a few key supports on the downside near $1,250. At the moment, a key bullish trend line with support at $1,255 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair is protected losses. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,165 low to $1,315 high is placed near the $1,240 level to prevent declines . \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is likely to break the trend line support at $1,255. However, there are high chances that the price could find a strong support near $1,240. On the upside, a close above $1,300 will most likely accelerate gains. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators: \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is currently moving in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is currently holding well above the 50 level. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $1,240 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013

461.26 *The assumptions underlying this energy consumption estimate can be found here . Criticism and potential validation of the estimate is discussed here . Did you know? Ever since its inception Bitcoin’s trust-minimizing consensus has been enabled by its proof-of-work algorithm. The machines performing the “work” are consuming huge amounts of energy while doing so. The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index was created to provide insight into this amount, and raise awareness on the unsustainability of the proof-of-work algorithm. Note that the Index contains the aggregate of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (other forks of the Bitcoin network are not included). A separate index was created for Ethereum, which can be found here . What kind of work are miners performing? New sets of transactions (blocks) are added to Bitcoin’s blockchain roughly every 10 minutes by so-called miners. While working on the blockchain these miners aren’t required to trust each other. The only thing miners have to trust is the code that runs Bitcoin. The code includes several rules to validate new transactions. For example, a transaction can only be valid if the sender actually owns the sent amount. Every miner individually confirms whether transactions adhere to these rules, eliminating the need to trust other miners. The trick is to get all miners to agree on the same history of transactions. Every miner in the network is constantly tasked with preparing the next batch of transactions for the blockchain. Only one of these blocks will be randomly selected to become the latest block on the chain. Random selection in a distributed network isn’t easy , so this is where proof-of-work comes in. In proof-of-work, the next block comes from the first miner that produces a valid one. This is easier said than done, as the Bitcoin protocol makes it very difficult for miners to do so. In fact, the difficulty is regularly adjusted by the protocol to ensure that all miners in the network will only produce one valid bock every 10 minutes on average. Once one of the miners finally manages to produce a valid block, it will inform the rest of the network. Other miners will accept this block once they confirm it adheres to all rules, and then discard whatever block they had been working on themselves. The lucky miner gets rewarded with a fixed amount of coins, along with the transaction fees belonging to the processed transactions in the new block. The cycle then starts again. The process of producing a valid block is largely based on trial and error, where miners are making numerous attempts every second trying to find the right value for a block component called the “ nonce “, and hoping the resulting completed block will match the requirements (as there is no way to predict the outcome). For this reason, mining is sometimes compared to a lottery where you can pick your own numbers. The number of attempts (hashes) per second is given by your mining equipment’s hashrate. This will typically be expressed in Gigahash per second (1 billion hashes per second). Sustainability The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a solid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years this has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of the currency reached new highs. The entire Bitcoin network now consumes more energy than a number of countries, based on a report published by the International Energy Agency. If Bitcoin was a country, it would rank as shown below. Apart from the previous comparison, it also possible to compare Bitcoin’s energy consumption to some of the world’s biggest energy consuming nations. The result is shown hereafter. Carbon footprint Bitcoin’s biggest problem is not even its massive energy consumption, but that the network is mostly fueled by coal-fired power plants in China. Coal-based electricity is available at very low rates in this country. Even with a conservative emission factor , this results in an extreme carbon footprint for each unique Bitcoin transaction. Comparing Bitcoin’s energy consumption to other payment systems To put the energy consumed by the Bitcoin network into perspective we can compare it to another payment system like VISA for example. According to VISA, the company consumed a total amount of 674,922 Gigajoules of energy (from various sources) globally for all its operations. This means that VISA has an energy need equal to that of around 17,000 U.S. households. We also know VISA processed 111.2 billion transactions in 2017 . With the help of these numbers, it is possible to compare both networks and show that Bitcoin is extremely more energy intensive per transaction than VISA (note that the chart below compares a single Bitcoin transaction to 100,000 VISA transactions). Of course, these numbers are far from perfect (e.g. energy consumption of VISA offices isn’t included), but the differences are so extreme that they will remain shocking regardless. A comparison with the average non-cash transaction in the regular financial system still reveals that an average Bitcoin transaction requires several thousands of times more energy . One could argue that this is simply the price of a transaction that doesn’t require a trusted third party, but this price doesn’t have to be so high as will be discussed hereafter. Alternatives Proof-of-work was the first consensus algorithm that managed to prove itself, but it isn’t the only consensus algorithm. More energy efficient algorithms, like proof-of-stake, have been in development over recent years. In proof-of-stake coin owners create blocks rather than miners, thus not requiring power hungry machines that produce as many hashes per second as possible. Because of this, the energy consumption of proof-of-stake is negligible compared to proof-of-work. Bitcoin could potentially switch to such an consensus algorithm, which would significantly improve sustainability. The only downside is that there are many different versions of proof-of-stake, and none of these have fully proven themselves yet. Nevertheless the work on these algorithms offers good hope for the future. Energy consumption model and key assumptions Even though the total network hashrate can easily be calculated, it is impossible to tell what this means in terms of energy consumption as there is no central register with all active machines (and their exact power consumption). In the past, energy consumption estimates typically included an assumption on what machines were still active and how they were distributed, in order to arrive at a certain number of Watts consumed per Gigahash/sec (GH/s). A detailed examination of a real-world Bitcoin mine shows why such an approach will certainly lead to underestimating the network’s energy consumption, because it disregards relevant factors like machine-reliability, climate and cooling costs. This arbitrary approach has therefore led to a wide set of energy consumption estimates that strongly deviate from one another, sometimes with a disregard to the economic consequences of the chosen parameters. The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index therefore proposes to turn the problem around, and approach energy consumption from an economic perspective. The index is built on the premise that miner income and costs are related. Since electricity costs are a major component of the ongoing costs, it follows that the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network must be related to miner income as well. To put it simply, the higher mining revenues, the more energy-hungry machines can be supported. How the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index uses miner income to arrive at an energy consumption estimate is explained in detail here (also in peer-reviewed academic literature here ), and summarized in the following infographic: Note that one may reach different conclusions on applying different assumptions (a calculator that allows for testing different assumptions has been made available here ). The chosen assumptions have been chosen in such a way that they can be considered to be both intuitive and conservative, based on information of actual mining operations. In the end, the goal of the Index is not to produce a perfect estimate, but to produce an economically credible day-to-day estimate that is more accurate and robust than an estimate based on the efficiency of a selection of mining machines. Criticism and Validation Update : the methodology underlying the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index has been anchored in peer-reviewed academic literature since May 2018. The full paper can be found here . Over time, the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index has been subject to a fair amount of criticism. Entrepreneur Marc Bevand, who argues that there are serious faults in the way the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index is calculated, is often quoted in this regard. In his own market-based and technical analysis of Bitcoin’s electricity consumption Bevand argues that Bitcoin’s real energy consumption is much lower (~18 terawatt hours/year per January 11, 2018) than the number provided by the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. But this alternative approach, based on analysis of Bitcoin’s hashrate (computational power), is not without controversy either. Morgan Stanley accurately captured the main problems in this approach in their report “ Bitcoin ASIC production substantiates electricity use ” (January 3, 2018), explaining that “the hash-rate methodology uses a fairly optimistic set of efficiency assumptions and may not allow enough for electricity consumption by cooling and networking gear”. The impact of this can be significant, as becomes apparent from BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov’s earlier comment that “many data centers around the world have 30 to 40 percent of electricity costs going to cooling” (40 to 65 percent relative to non-cooling electricity costs). It’s thus not surprising that a hash-rate based approach produces a lower energy consumption estimate. In the same report Morgan Stanley does argue that Bitcoin’s energy consumption must be at least 23 terawatt-hour per year (per January 3, 2018). Morgan Stanley finds this number based on “Quartz’s report of its tour of the Bitmain mining data center , equipped with the most recent 1387-based mining rigs, this past fall”. At the time, this data center was drawing 40 megawatts per hour and represented 4% of the global Bitcoin network capacity (6M TH/s). Morgan Stanley continues by stating that “the Bitcoin network’s recent active hash rate has been ~15.2M TH/s, which implies total hourly Bitcoin electricity consumption is well more than 2700 megawatts/hour (23 terawatt hours/year)”. The company also notes that a realistic number is likely to be higher because “the most efficient mining rigs used by Bitmain in its facilities are not yet widely available” (the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index was showing ~37 terawatt hours/year on the same day). For this reason, Morgan Stanley concludes that “current use estimates are probably in the right general range”. Of course, the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index is also very much a prediction model for future Bitcoin energy consumption (unlike hashrate-based estimates that have no predictive properties). The model predicts that miners will ultimately spend 60% of their revenues on electricity. At the moment (January 2018), miners are spending a lot less on electricity. On January 25, 2018, the Bitcoin Energy Index was estimating just 22% of miner revenues ($2.2B versus $10.4B) were actually spent on electricity costs. Based on this, the Energy Consumption Index would thus predict a possible energy consumption of around 130 terawatt hours/year (assuming stable revenues). This increase appears to be in line with expected miner production. With regard to future energy consumption, Morgan Stanley estimates that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company “has Bitcoin ASIC orders for 15-20K wafer-starts per month for 1Q18”. With each wafer capable of supplying chips for “~27-30 Bitcoin mining rigs”, the total Bitcoin mining pool “could see up to 5-7.5M new rigs added in the next 12 months” if “1Q18 production rates are maintained through 2018”. By the end of 2018, this means that “the Bitcoin network could potentially draw more than 13,500 megawatts/hour (120 terawatt-hours/year)”, or even 16,000 megawatts/hour (140 terawatt-hours/year) based on “90% utilization and 60% direct electricity usage”. Altogether, it can be concluded that the relatively simple Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index model is supported by both emprical evidence from real-world mining facilities, as well as Bitcoin ASIC miner production forecasts.

The market cap now stands at US$144.86 billion, with US$1.64 billion traded in the past 24 hours. On the network side, hash rate and difficulty continue to push record highs, with ongoing shipments of ASICs from multiple mining companies, including Bitmain and Halong. Although the original Bitcoin Whitepaper described Proof of Work (PoW) as \\u201cone-CPU-one-vote,\\u201d the lead SIA coin developer David Vorick argues that \\u201cfor any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware.\\u201d Drastic increases in ASIC usage can have a detrimental long term effect as they increase the likelihood of smaller independent miners being squeezed out of the market. The highest percentage of mining will continue to concentrate in large mining farms, where economies of scale and cheap electricity are available. Furthermore, ASIC chips are typically manufactured by a small number of technology companies, meaning the bulk of the network is running on the same hardware. If that hardware is found to be faulty or exploitable, the entire network remains at risk. Concerns over PoW have not been limited to ASIC proliferation. A recent presentation by Alex de Vries of Price Waterhouse Cooper in the Netherlands, \\u201c Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem ,\\u201d concludes that Bitcoin currently consumes at least 2.55 GW of electricity, and is on pace to consume 7.67 GW in the near future. This leaves the networks energy consumption comparable to countries such as Ireland now (3.1 GW) and Austria in the future (8.2 GW). Others see this as an energy revolution opportunity. Peter Van Valkenburg of CoinCenter, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency in Washington D.C., has argued that instead of destroying the planet, Bitcoin will push the energy market towards more sustainable alternatives , driving an energy revolution. Mining in Canada and Iceland uses hydro and geothermal power, while wind and solar are among the cheapest energy sources available. Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos shares this view and has questioned the hidden resource needs required by other payment platforms. However, the number of network nodes has fallen slightly over the past few months after reaching more than 12,500 in November. These statistics include mining and non-mining nodes. Although archival nodes are not incentivized directly with a block reward, they ensure network consensus. Based on global distribution, the United States and Germany have the highest percentage of nodes. \\n Source: https:\\/\\/bitnodes.earn.com \\n Transactions per day remain down sharply from the record high in December, above 400k, and are currently below 200k per day. Transactions have not only declined due to a lack of usage but also transaction batching , where one transaction is sent to many addresses at once instead of each transaction being sent individually. Using an adjusted network value to transactions ( NVT ) ratio, BTC remains in the upper-third of historical NVT value. While NVT has not been this high since January 2015 it has begun to turn downward recently, which suggests increasing on-chain network utility based on the dollar amount being transacted. Although NVT is difficult to compare between coins, which use different transactions types, the ratio can be used to assess the network\\u2019s relative utility over time. DOGE is the only coin that has had an NVT consistently lower than BTC (not shown). Additionally, inflection points in NVT ratio can be correlated to extreme highs or lows in price. Transaction fees, which increased dramatically throughout 2017, have also declined significantly. This fee reduction is also multifactorial. Although a decrease in transactions per day means fewer transactions needing to be cleared, SegWit, which currently accounts for 39% of transactions, has also been a significant contributing factor to the average fee decline. The SegWit soft fork also enabled second layer network upgrades like the Lightning Network. Since going live on March 15, the Lightning Network (LN) has continued to gain traction as new channels come online and apps are created. The software solution enables trusted, bidirectional, off-chain, hub and spoke payment channels and also promises the possibility of instant payments, microtransactions, and increased scalability. The channels work much like a tab at a restaurant, which remains open until the client settles the bill. This format allows for numerous transactions to occur without a network fee until the channel is closed. \\n Source: https:\\/\\/p2sh.info \\n At Consensus NYC, Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey and Lightning Labs co-founder and CEO Elizabeth Stark discussed their vision for the future of payments. Dorsey, who had an early interest in hacker and cypherpunk movements, was also an investor in a Lightning Labs seed round. Dorsey focused on the need to keep Bitcoin an open source project and the need for a native currency of the internet. He also hinted at a Square and Lightning partnership down the road saying, \\\"We want to go back to that original idea of being able to purchase a coffee with it. And that's why we're working with Lightning Labs. Whatever it takes to get there, we're going to make sure it happens.\\\" During his keynote speech at Consensus, eToro CEO Yoni Assia announced a new American crypto platform which will be trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Ethereum Classic, NEO, and EOS. Cryptocurrency trading on eToro increased by 4,500% in 2017, according to MarketWatch . Bitcoin exchange traded volume this week has been led by the Tether (USDT) and USD markets for the fourth consecutive week, mostly on Binance, OKEX, and Bitfinex. In Asia, the JPY volume strongly leads the pack, thanks to friendly regulations and oversight, including declaring Bitcoin legal tender. The KRW premium is currently at 1.78%. CNY volume continues to fade. Globally reported over the counter (OTC) volume from LocalBitcoins.com remains sharply down from December and January but has begun to increase again. Venezuela continues to post record highs in Bolivar volume, fueled by hyperinflation . Thus far, the hyperinflation rate has followed an almost identical trajectory as the Weimar Republic. The Venezuelan president, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro Moros, won the national election earlier today. Technical Analysis Bitcoin continues to drift sideways on low volume, with an inability to establish a clean trend on high timeframes. The status of any emerging or nascent trend can be determined using Moving Averages, Chart Patterns, Ichimoku Cloud, and Pitchforks. Further background information on the technical analysis discussed below can be found here . On the daily chart, open long\\/short interest on Bitfinex leans long, with shorts flat and longs rising (top panel, chart below). Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) have gone flat, suggesting price consolidation. Price has fallen below the 200EMA with a bearish 50\\/200EMA cross. Price structure shows a multi-month symmetrical triangle, or coil. In Technical Analysis of Stock Trends (1948), Edwards and Magee suggest that roughly 75% of these triangles lead to a continuation of the trend, while the rest mark reversals. In any case, this pattern will be a \\u2018trade the breakout\\u2019 situation because it will likely lead to weeks of trend follow through. Breakouts post consolidation typically occur after at least 66% of the triangle has completed (yellow highlight). Turning to the Ichimoku Cloud on the weekly chart, there are four metrics; the current price in relation to the Cloud, the color of the Cloud (red for bearish, green for bullish), the Tenkan (T) and Kijun (K) cross, and the Lagging Span. The best entry always occurs when most of the signals flip from bearish to bullish, or vice versa. The Cloud metrics on the weekly time frame are; price above Cloud, bullish Cloud, bullish TK cross, and Lagging Span above price and Cloud. Together, these signals suggest the trend is bullish, and will remain bullish until a bearish TK cross or price dips below the Cloud. Price itself is below the Kijun and, seemingly, in no-man\\u2019s land. Price and volume structures suggest the possibility of an unconventional inverted head and shoulders, a bullish reversal pattern. A long entry would not be warranted until price is above the Kijun, essentially also above the neckline of the head and shoulders chart pattern. The Cloud metrics on the daily time frame are; price inside Cloud, bearish Cloud, bullish TK cross, and Lagging Span above price but below Cloud. A long entry based on traditional Cloud rules does not occur until the Cloud is breached by price, currently at ~US$11,586. However, a long reversal trade opportunity known as the Edge to Edge (E2E) trade can be taken advantage of with the current Cloud structure. A long entry based on the E2E trade occurred several days ago, with a stop loss below the Kijun. Price dropped out of Cloud and below the Kijun, suggesting any active longs should be closed at that time. Although price has breached Cloud resistance for the second time, traders may avoid entering a second E2E trade this quickly as the previous E2E trade failed. An E2E failing to reach its target is often an indication of additional consolidation being needed before price momentum returns. Price typically follows through with the direction of the E2E trade, but not until the Kumo twist, which in this case will occur after June 19th. The Cloud metrics on the four hour time frame are; price below Cloud, bearish Cloud, bearish TK cross, and Lagging Span above price and below Cloud. A traditional long entry will not occur until price is above Cloud at ~US$8,942. An E2E long entry would trigger after a breach of Cloud at US$8,300. The previous four hour Kumo breakout led to a 27% price increase and both of the previous four hour E2E moves occurred in very few candles. Penultimately, price has returned to the original upward trending Pitchfork beginning in 2015, with anchor points in January, May, and August of that year. Price broke North of this trend in October 2017 and again currently sits in the upper limits. A downside target of US~$5,700 is possible should price return to the mean (red line) of the prior trend. Lastly, another Pitchfork on the daily chart starting in 2017, with anchor points in January, May, and July, shows price reaching a similar distance below the mean (red line) as was reached above the mean in December. Price has closed this pitchfork for several days suggesting bearish invalidation. If price returns to inside the Pitchfork, a return to the mean is possible. Conclusion ASICs continue to drive conversations about the network, both in terms of centralization and increasing power consumption. Network usage and fees remain relatively low with SegWit and Lightning metrics steadily increasing. Exchanges and go-to-market apps continue to be developed. Technicals suggest ongoing consolidation with several failed bullish reversal attempts, based on Ichimoku Clouds and a longstanding Pitchfork. The structure of price consolidation suggests bullish continuation, which may occur as early as May 31st. If the consolidation results in further downside a bearish target of ~US$5,700 is likely, based on a multi-year Pitchfork.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Analysis - Consolidation continues ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin whitepaper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david vorick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "halong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T09:15:42.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46722d8d03c1414c02179af6e6d349941ea8dcc7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhHw12cCj7G1zn2i7AWEoZYs-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-21T17:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46722d8d03c1414c02179af6e6d349941ea8dcc7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhHw12cCj7G1zn2i7AWEoZYs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T17:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 21, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin headed for $20000 in six months, says CEO of cryptocurrency platform MarketWatch Bitcoin , the world's biggest digital currency on Monday, traded higher, punching above $8,500 in early action.

What are the factors indicating its constant movement aside from the fact that compared from the last years its value was unfathomable in a financial sense but sudden drops oppressing lots of investors. What sort of deem of hope to investors not to become disoriented and eventually selling there btc shares as its value decrease. What do you think guys?\nFor me based on my analysis, try to look the chart last December 22, 2017 that was the highest price ever then followed by December 25, 2017 which was Christmas Day am I right? That was the time that Bitcoin Price was started to falling down you know what? base on my observation many people are selling their bitcoin because of their financial needs because it's Christmas day that time, so people are selling their stock then followed by others and it was like domino also followed by the other people was panic during that time because it will continuously go down until now. that's the big reason why the price coming from the 10 feet below the ground in shortly speaking. but for now it will gradually growing up and hopefully it will continue back to the usual price or much better if more then that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T15:28:24.047+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f81ad95c6d5354cb6422f08afb3306ce528c335", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeusSBoMCyfIVzl_Xf54ebQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Best wallet for bitcoin?", "title_full": "Best wallet for bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-21T17:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.273, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f81ad95c6d5354cb6422f08afb3306ce528c335", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeusSBoMCyfIVzl_Xf54ebQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "simongoat", "published": "2018-05-21T17:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best wallet for bitcoin?", "text": "I thought the nano ledger was the best wallet because it was the safest but after reading this https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/03/20/ledger-nano-s-hack-cryptocurrency/ it seems I might have to rethink.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/03/20/ledger-nano-s-hack-cryptocurrency/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T15:31:06.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b700c7f3069840a6d985b445e385e0bda7bd92c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNm7_dGA9qfPPF0InRox9JT6.G5Atuh.SBOCRdYhyO2vCQE1tYIDyIVA--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 118: SIGHASH_NOINPUT (eltoo precursor soft-fork)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 118: SIGHASH_NOINPUT (eltoo precursor soft-fork)", "published": "2018-05-21T17:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b700c7f3069840a6d985b445e385e0bda7bd92c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNm7_dGA9qfPPF0InRox9JT6.G5Atuh.SBOCRdYhyO2vCQE1tYIDyIVA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T17:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 118: SIGHASH_NOINPUT (eltoo precursor soft-fork)", "text": "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 118: SIGHASH_NOINPUT (eltoo precursor soft-fork)\n/u/StopAndDecrypt\nBIP 118 is what I would consider as uncontroversial as it gets in regards to softforks.\nIt breaks nothing and adds a feature for Lightning.\neltoo is an improvement to the Lightning protocol that requires the change provided in BIP 118.\nMore information on eltoo can be found here and here.\nPrevious Reddit conversations can be found here and here.\nA short summary of eltoo, as \"layman\" as I can be:\nLet 's say a \"final\" state (state 4) of a channel is sent to the network by your nodes peer, but you have a newer \"final state\" (state 6) and want to contest.

This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has moved past the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point as an early signal of bullish momentum. \\n\nRSI is on the move up to show that there’s some buying momentum left, but the oscillator is nearing overbought conditions to reflect exhaustion. Similarly, stochastic is heading north so bitcoin price could follow suit, but the oscillator is also approaching overbought levels. Turning back down could draw sellers in once more. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nIf bulls are able to stay in control, they could push bitcoin price up to the next potential resistance at the 38.2% extension or $9279. The 50% extension is near the $9700 major psychological level while the 61.8% extension lines up with the swing high around $10,000. Stronger bullish pressure could take it up to fresh highs at the 76.4% extension or $10,705 level or the full extension at $11,461. \\n\nFor now, though, market watchers are paying extra close attention to the energy costs related to mining bitcoin. This casts doubts on the sustainability of this particular cryptocurrency, but the improved sentiment in the industry to start the week appears to be providing enough support. \\n\nLooking ahead, the FOMC minutes could turn the spotlight back to dollar movements as stronger tightening hints could boost the US currency higher against bitcoin price once more.

The TRON network has improved its TPS system that is better equipped than that of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nIts highly decentralized distribution mechanism comes to terms with the uplift in its global ranking. The TRON mainnet launch is said to bring about changes with more than $1 million TRX holders contributing in this ever-growing market.\nThe team has also been proving to connect the programmers by bringing in people like Marius Gill, a German open-source wallet, DApp developer, and Sean Liu, a former Data Engineer at Gridsum to help plan the network’s technical efficiency development to mark a new era with PROJECT GENESIS. Gill is currently working on building an iOS technology with the team’s support.\n“The chance of award is less significant to me than getting involved and sharing experiences with peers in the TRON community so that I get more time for test and optimization. To get it better.\nThat’s why I made it open-source early.” In the aftermath of the network’s introduction to smart contracts, TRON is ahead of its time to plan on providing next-generation infrastructures.

Introduction to batching Bitcoin uses a UTXO model , which stands for Unspent Transaction Output . In comparison, Ripple and Ethereum use an account/balance model. In bitcoin, a user has no balances, only UTXOs that they control. If they want to transfer money to someone else, their wallet selects one or more UTXOs as inputs that in sum need to add up to the amount they want to transfer. The desired amount then goes to the recipient, which is called the output, and the difference goes back to the sender, which is called change output . Each output can carry a virtually unlimited amount of value in the form of satoshis . A satoshi is a unit representing a one-hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. This is very similar to a physical wallet full of different denominations of bills. If you’re buying a snack for $2.50 and only have a $5, you don’t hand the cashier half of your 5 dollar bill — you give him the 5 and receive some change instead. Unknown to some, there is no hardcoded limit to the number of transactions that can fit in a block. Instead, each transaction has a certain size in megabytes and constitutes an economic incentive for miners to include it in their block. Because miners have limited space of 2 MB to sell to transactors, larger transactions (in size, not bitcoin!) will need to pay higher fees to be included. Additionally, each transaction can have a virtually unlimited number of inputs or outputs — the record stands at transactions with 20,000 inputs and 13,107 outputs. So each transaction has at least one input and at one output, but often more, as well as some additional boilerplate stuff. Most of that space is taken up by the input (often 60% or more, because of the signature that proves they really belong to the sender), while the output(s) account for 15–30%. In order to keep transactions as small as possible and save fees, Bitcoin users have two major choices: Use as few inputs as possible. In order to minimize inputs, you can periodically send your smaller UTXOs to yourself in times when fees are very low, getting one large UTXO back. That is called UTXO consolidation or consolidating your inputs . Users who frequently make transfers (especially within the same block) can include an almost unlimited amount of outputs (to different people!) in the same transaction. That is called transaction batching . A typical single output transaction takes up 230 bytes, while a two output transaction only takes up 260 bytes, instead of 460 if you were to send them individually. This is something that many casual commentators overlook when comparing Bitcoin with other payment systems — a Bitcoin transaction can aggregate thousands of individual economic transfers! It’s important to recognize this, as it is the source of a great deal of misunderstanding and mistaken analysis. We’ve never encountered a common definition of a batched transaction — so for the purposes of this study we define it in the loosest possible sense: a transaction with three or more outputs . Commonly, batching is understood as an activity undertaken primarily by mining pools or exchanges who can trade off immediacy for efficiency. It is rare that a normal bitcoin user would have cause to batch, and indeed most wallets make it difficult to impossible to construct batched transactions. For everyday purposes, normal bitcoiners will likely not go to the additional effort of batching transactions. We set the threshold at three for simplicity’s sake — a normal unbatched transaction will have one transactional output and one change output — but the typical major batched transaction from an exchange will have dozens if not hundreds of outputs. For this reason we are careful to provide data on various different batch sizes, so we could determine the prevalence of three-output transactions and colossal, 100-output ones. We find it helpful to think of a Bitcoin transaction as a mail truck full of boxes. Each truck (transaction) contains boxes (outputs), each of which is full of some number of letters (satoshis). So when you’re looking at transaction count as a measure of the performance and economic throughput of the Bitcoin network, it’s a bit like counting mail trucks to discern how many letters are being sent on a given day, even though the number of letters can vary wildly. The truck analogy also makes it clear why many see Bitcoin as a settlement layer – just as mail trucks aren’t dispatched until they’re full, some envision that the same will ultimately be the case for Bitcoin. Batching 2. A timeline So what actually happened in the last six months? Let’s look at some data. Daily transactions on the Bitcoin network rose steadily until about May 2017, when average fees hit about $4. This precipitated the first collapse in usage. Then began a series of feedback loops over the next six months in which transaction load grew, fees grew to match, and transactions dropped off. This cycle repeated itself five times over the latter half of 2017. ( Link to the above chart ) The solid red line in the above chart is fees in BTC terms (not USD) and the shaded red area is daily transaction count. You can see the cycle of transaction load precipitating higher fees which in turn cause a reduction in usage. It repeats itself five or six times before the detente in spring 2018. The most notable period was the December-January fee crisis, but fees were actually fairly typical in BTC terms — the rising BTC price in USD however meant that USD fees hit extreme figures. In mid-November when fees hit double digits in USD terms, users began a concerted campaign to convince exchanges to be better stewards of block space. Both Segwit and batching were held up as meaningful approaches to maximize the compression of Bitcoin transactions into the finite block space available. Data on when exchanges began batching is sparse, but we collected information where it was available into a chart summarizing when exchanges began batching. Batching adoption at selected exchanges We’re ignoring Segwit adoption by exchanges in this analysis; as far as batching is concerned, the campaign to get exchanges to batch appears to have persuaded Bitfinex, Binance, and Shapeshift to batch. Coinbase/GDAX have stated their intention to begin batching, although they haven’t managed to integrate it yet. As far as we can tell, Gemini hasn’t mentioned batching, although we have some mixed evidence that they may have begun recently. If you know about the status of batching on Gemini or other major exchanges please get in touch. So some exchanges have been batching all along, and some have never bothered at all. Did the subset of exchanges who flipped the switch materially affect the prevalence of batched transactions? Let’s find out. 3. Analysis 3.1 How common is batching? We measured the prevalence of batching in three different ways, by transaction count, by output value and by output count. the tl;dr Batching accounts for roughly 12% of all transactions, 40% of all outputs, and 30–60% of all raw BTC output value. Not bad. 3.2 Have batched transactions become more common over time? From the chart in 3.1, we can already see a small, but steady uptrend in all three metrics, but we wanted to dig a little deeper. So we first looked at the relationship of payments (all outputs that actually pay someone, so total outputs minus change outputs) and transactions. Data from transactionfee.info/charts The first thing that becomes obvious is that the popular narrative — that the drop in transactions was caused by an increase in batching — is not the case; payments dropped by roughly the same proportion as well. Dividing payment count by transaction count gives us some insight into the relationship between the two. In our analysis we want to zoom into the time frame between November 2017 and today, and we can see that payments per transactions have actually been rallying, from 1.5 payments per transaction in early 2017 to almost two today. 3.3 What are popular batch sizes? In this next part, we will look at batch sizes to see which are most popular. To determine which transactions were batched, we downloaded a dataset of all transactions on the Bitcoin network between November 2017 and May 2018 from Blockchair . We picked that period because the fee crisis really got started in mid-November, and with it, the demands for exchanges to batch. So we wanted to capture the effect of exchanges starting to batch. Naturally a bigger sample would have been more instructive, but we were constrained in our resources, so we began with the six month sample. We grouped transactions into “batched” and “unbatched” groups with batched transactions being those with three or more outputs . We then divided batched transactions into roughly equal groups on the basis of how much total output in BTC they had accounted for in the six-month period. We didn’t select the batch sizes manually — we picked batch sizes that would split the sample into equal parts on the basis of transaction value. Here’s what we ended up with: All of the batch buckets have just about the same fraction of total BTC output over the period, but they account for radically different transaction and output counts over the period. Notice that there were only 183,108 “extra large” batches (with 41 or more outputs) in the six-month period, but between them there were 23m outputs and 30m BTC worth of value transmitted. Note that output value in this context refers to the raw or unadjusted figure — it would have been prohibitively difficult for us to adjust output for change or mixers, so we’re using the “naive” estimate. Let’s look at how many transactions various batch sizes accounted for in the sample period: Batched transactions steadily increased relative to unbatched ones, although the biggest fraction is the small batch with between 3 and 5 outputs. The story for output counts is a bit more illuminating. Even though batched transactions are a relatively small fraction of overall transaction count, they contain a meaningful number of overall outputs. Let’s see how it breaks down: Lastly, let’s look at output value. Here we see that batched transactions represent a significant fraction of value transmitted on Bitcoin. As we can see, even though batched transactions make up an average of only 12% of all transactions, they move between 30%-60% of all Bitcoins, at peak times even 70%. We think this is quite remarkable. Keep in mind, however that the ‘total output’ figure has not been altered to account for change outputs, mixers, or self-churn; that is, it is the raw and unadjusted figure. The total output value is therefore not an ideal approximation of economic volume on the Bitcoin network. 3.4 Has transaction count become an unreliable measure of Bitcoin’s usage because of batching? Yes. We strongly encourage any analysts, investors, journalists, and developers to look past mere transaction count from now on. The default measure of Bitcoin’s performance should be “payments per day” rather than transaction count. This also makes Bitcoin more comparable with other UTXO chains. They generally have significantly variable payments-per-transaction ratios, so just using payments standardizes that. (Stay tuned: Coinmetrics will be rolling out tools to facilitate this very soon.) More generally, we think that the economic value transmitted on the network is its most fundamental characteristic. Both the naive and the adjusted figures deserve to be considered. Adjusting raw output value is still more art than science, and best practices are still being developed. Again, Coinmetrics is actively developing open-source tools to make these adjustments available. 4. Conclusion We started by revisiting the past year in Bitcoin and showed that while the mempool was congested, the community started looking for ways to use the blockspace more efficiently. Attention quickly fell on batching, the practice of combining multiple outputs into a single transaction, for heavy users. We showed how batching works on a technical level and when different exchanges started implementing the technique. Today, around 12% of all transactions on the Bitcoin network are batched, and these account for about 40% of all outputs and between 30–60% of all transactional value. The fact such that a small set of transactions carries so much economic weight makes us hopeful that Bitcoin still has a lot of room to scale on the base layer, especially if usage trends continue. Lastly, it’s worth noting that the increase in batching on the Bitcoin network may not be entirely due to deliberate action by exchanges, but rather a function of its recessionary behavior in the last few months. Since batching is generally done by large industrial players like exchanges, mixers, payment processors, and mining pools, and unbatched transactions are generally made by normal individuals, the batched/unbatched ratio is also a strong proxy for how much average users are using Bitcoin. Since the collapse in price, it is quite possible that individual usage of Bitcoin decreased while “industrial” usage remained strong. This is speculation, but one explanation for what happened. Alternatively, the industrial players appear to be taking their role as stewards of the scarce block space more seriously. This is a significant boon to the network, and a nontrivial development in its history. If a culture of parsimony can be encouraged, Bitcoin will be able to compress more data into its block space and everyday users will continue to be able to run nodes for the foreseeable future. We view this as a very positive development. Members of the Bitcoin community that lobbied exchanges to add support for Segwit and batching should be proud of themselves. 5. Bonus content: UTXO consolidation Remember that we said that a second way to systematically save transaction fees in the Bitcoin network was to consolidate your UTXOs when fees were low? Looking at the relationship between input count and output count allows us to spot such consolidation phases quite well. Typically, inputs and outputs move together. When the network is stressed, they decouple. If you look at the above chart carefully, you’ll notice that when transactions are elevated (and block space is at a premium), outputs outpace inputs — look at the gaps in May and December 2017. However, prolonged activity always results in fragmented UTXO sets and wallets full of dust, which need to be consolidated. For this, users often wait until pressure on the network has decreased and fees are lower. Thus, after transactions decrease, inputs become more common than outputs. You can see this clearly in February/March 2018. Here we’ve taken the ratio of inputs to outputs (which have been smoothed on a trailing 7 day basis). When the ratio is higher, there are more inputs than outputs on that day, and vice versa. You can clearly see the spam attack in summer 2015 in which thousands (possibly millions) of outputs were created and then consolidated. Once the ratio spikes upwards, that’s consolidation. The spike in February 2018 after the six weeks of high fees in December 2017 was the most pronounced sigh of relief in Bitcoin’s history; the largest ever departure from the in/out ratio norm. There were a huge number of UTXOs to be consolidated. It’s also interesting to note where inputs and outputs cluster. Here we have histograms of transactions with large numbers of inputs or outputs. Unsurprisingly, round numbers are common which shows that exchanges don’t publish a transaction every, say, two minutes, but instead wait for 100 or 200 outputs to queue up and then publish their transaction. Curiously, 200-input transactions were more popular than 100-input transactions in the period. We ran into more curiosities when researching this piece, but we’ll leave those for another time. Future work on batching might focus on: Determining batched transactions as a portion of (adjusted) economic rather than raw volume Looking at the behavior of specific exchanges with regards to batching Investigating how much space and fees could be saved if major exchanges were batching transactions Lastly, we encourage everyone to run their transactions through the service at transactionfee.info to assess the efficiency of their transactions and determine whether exchanges are being good stewards of the block space. * * * We’d like to thank 0xB10C for their generous assistance with datasets and advice, the people at Blockchair for providing the core datasets, and David A.

Bitcoin has experienced a downward price trend since 5 May, when it looked set to break above the $10,000 price point. The last time its value was above that figure was March. Despite the recent price falls, predictions for bitcoin continue to be positive, particularly from those within the cryptocurrency space. Most recently, analysts claimed that the price of bitcoin would rally during the annual Consensus conference, which took place in New York last week . Typically, positive news coming out of Consensus results in a price boost for the cryptocurrency, however this year bitcoin finished the week around $800 down from its value at the start of the week. This was reflected across all major cryptocurrencies, with the markets falling an average of 10 per cent during the week of Consensus. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said before the conference that he expected bitcoin’s rally to be “even larger than past years,” however was forced to backtrack in an analysis report posted to Twitter . CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 rally did not happen, very disappointing. What we needed was a trifecta of progress: (i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed), but we got progress on (i) and (ii).

Other positive predictions from cryptocurrency experts include the views of the investor and self-described “bitcoin evangelist” Alistair Milne, who believes bitcoin will reach between $35,000 and $60,000 by 2020. Celebrated investor Tim Draper also revealed his prediction last month that bitcoin will soar to $250,000 by 2022 – a price increase that would see bitcoin's market capitalisation increase five-fold to around $5 trillion.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/997499507083538435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-latest-consensus-cryptocurrency-value-a8352356.html", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-live-updates-latest-cryptocurrency-value-ethereum-ripple-usd-exchange-trading-invest-a8301651.html&quot;", "https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/997499507083538435/photo/1?tfw_creator=iWriteCrypto&amp;tfw_site=Cryptocoinsnsews&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ccn.com%2Ffundstrats-bitcoin-price-rally-prediction-fell-flat-tom-lee-explains-why%2F&quot;", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Consensus2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-live-updates-latest-cryptocurrency-value-ethereum-ripple-usd-exchange-trading-invest-a8301651.html", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-latest-consensus-cryptocurrency-value-a8352356.html&quot;", "https://t.co/XcqNhgYgK7", "https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/997499507083538435/photo/1?tfw_creator=iWriteCrypto&tfw_site=Cryptocoinsnsews&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ccn.com%2Ffundstrats-bitcoin-price-rally-prediction-fell-flat-tom-lee-explains-why%2F", "https://www.tumblr.com/widgets/share/tool?posttype=photo&content=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fuu%2Fapi%2Fres%2F1.2%2FmVkvbVeY.0tZl8LiFWqyUA--~B%2FaD01NDI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fmedia.zenfs.com%2Fen-GB%2Fhomerun%2Fthe_independent_577%2F51b9549716ed0e8de9821f04b46a9f26&url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.news.yahoo.com%2Fbitcoin-price-bounces-back-cryptocurrency-135702024.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-sh%26soc_trk%3Dtu&clickthroughUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.news.yahoo.com%2Fbitcoin-price-bounces-back-cryptoc"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony cuthbertson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat global advi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T17:30:18.076+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f17c719779e91d64390698ab5c5f7b2f57f0adee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.siURHoRIoQmIadHpvGQRU2tZzH7CJM0ffLwuLM32yf.eJGmh0JzqzDlAZE5qpbEzvw--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Mr Pink doesn't want you to upvote bitcoin memes", "title_full": "Mr Pink doesn't want you to upvote bitcoin memes", "published": "2018-05-21T16:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f17c719779e91d64390698ab5c5f7b2f57f0adee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.siURHoRIoQmIadHpvGQRU2tZzH7CJM0ffLwuLM32yf.eJGmh0JzqzDlAZE5qpbEzvw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T16:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mr Pink doesn't want you to upvote bitcoin memes", "text": "Mr Pink doesn't want you to upvote bitcoin memes\n/u/thisdoyoucanbut\nsubmitted by /u/thisdoyoucanbut\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pink", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T16:58:06.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e68ed494a8f6372abd06f20da66ae4fa6baad16c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWikj1RTirSUc7cUAjFKQpRgMzByNYa_Br4H_MCtcK1p78E_WEEDnsF1ZcmuB7H_mR_dVu89aC2kPZBHhHULhtcrSzLZoLXUhyxXqiCob_UquwEbQYBJkYTTEZsMcMOBZ5Lk2BXJotPg--", "site_full": "topgoldforum.com", "site": "topgoldforum.com", "site_section": "https://topgoldforum.com/forum/116-cryptocurrencies-corner/", "site_categories": ["marketing", "non_standard_content", "business", "adult"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrencies Corner -

accused. Shailesh Bhatt, Surat-based builder, who had complained of extortion and kidnapping has been booked by the CID for allegedly extorting over Rs 155 crore in cash and bitcoins from two persons.\nThe CID-Crime lodged a fresh FIR against Bhatt and about nine of his accomplices yesterday at Surat after new details emerged during the ongoing probe into the original case, Director General of Police, CID-Crime, Ashish Bhatia, told reporters in Gandhinagar.\nTwo persons, including Shailesh Bhatt’s nephew Nikunj Bhatt and Dilip Kanani, were also arrested yesterday from Surat on charges of kidnapping and extorting bitcoins and cash at the builder’s behest, he said. After the arrest, the sleuths recovered 152 bitcoins (Rs 8.58 crore), which were in Kanani’s wallet, Bhatia said.\nBhatt had earlier alleged that some Amreli policemen extorted “bitcoins worth Rs 9 crore” from him four months back. While probing his complaint, the CID officials learnt that Bhatt had extorted bitcoins worth crores from others before he was kidnapped by the Amreli police.\n“Around two years back, one Satish Kumbhani of Surat floated a company called ‘Bit Connect’ and lured people like Bhatt to invest in it to get huge returns. Bhatt had invested Rs 2 crore in it. However, its promoters shut shop in January this year and went underground,” said Bhatia. To recover his investment, Bhatt’s accomplices first kidnapped Piyush Savalia by posing as Income Tax officials, as Savalia used to work for that company, he said.\nSavalia was confined in a farm house at gun-point for three days in January-end, the official said. “On February 1, Bhatt’s men kidnapped Dhaval Mavani at gun-point, as the latter was also attached with the bankrupt firm. Bhatt’s accomplices forced Mavani to transfer 2,256 bitcoins worth Rs 131 crore into their account. The builder and his accomplices had also transferred another 166 bitcoins worth Rs 9.64 crore into their account,” said Bhatia.\nTo set Mavani free, Bhatt and his accomplices also extorted Rs 14.50 crore cash, which the builder received through the ‘Angadia’ service, he said.\n“Bhatt and his accomplices extorted bitcoins and cash worth a total of Rs 155.21 crore. Later, they distributed the bitcoins among themselves. Bhatt had kept around 700 bitcoins,” the CID official said.\nSince Bhatt is not tech-ssavvy, he took help of his nephew Nikunj Bhatt to transfer these bitcoins, he said. The entire conspiracy was unearthed when Savalia was questioned by the CID recently, Bhatia said.\nBhatt had even paid Rs 34.50 lakh to Savalia to keep mum and also to give a false statement that he was never kidnapped by the builder and his men, he said.\nWhile two persons, including Bhatt’s nephew, have already been arrested on charges of kidnapping and extortion, a search is on for others, said Bhatia.\nThe original case pertains to a complaint filed with the CID-Crime three months back by Shailesh Bhatt. Bhatt had alleged that Amreli policemen had kidnapped him, and his business partner Kirit Paladia, from Gandhinagar on February 9 and extorted bitcoins, which were in the possession of Paladia.\nBhatt had alleged that former BJP MLA Nalian Kotadiya was also involved in this conspiracy of extorting bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore. Recently, a sessions court here had also issued arrest warrant against Nalin Kotadiya, who has been evading arrest ever since his involvement was surfaced during the probe.\nSo far, Bhatt’s business partner Paladia, Amreli Superintendent of Police Jagdish Patel, Amreli local Crime Branch inspector Anant Patel, two constables and a middleman have been arrested in the case. Seven constables of Amreli district police, allegedly involved in the case, are still on the run.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kanani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikunj bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashish bhatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dilip kanani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "general of police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gandhinagar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T17:56:38.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e25910623b1f9baf5d0ba2138aff7eade17a5d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb34kXoYntZW9513os.VNq5Qq4m53cip8SxtbjjK3hL.wSxgcjixpPl4LsObF_z17NDdTBfuL6QnJEwZ2gHGo9EZLOA3UkkAXfSw--", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Bitcoin Diamond Trading 0.6% Lower Over Last Week (BCD)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Diamond Trading 0.6% Lower Over Last Week (BCD)", "published": "2018-05-21T16:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2222.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e25910623b1f9baf5d0ba2138aff7eade17a5d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb34kXoYntZW9513os.VNq5Qq4m53cip8SxtbjjK3hL.wSxgcjixpPl4LsObF_z17NDdTBfuL6QnJEwZ2gHGo9EZLOA3UkkAXfSw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2018-05-21T16:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Diamond Trading 0.6% Lower Over Last Week (BCD)", "text": "Posted by ABMN Staff on May 21st, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin Diamond (CURRENCY:BCD) traded 2.8% lower against the U.S. dollar during the 1 day period ending at 9:00 AM Eastern on May 21st.

I set the ticket price at 0.000800 BCH. (Is that 8 bits? 800 bits? 80000 satoshis? Not sure the best vernacular or rates). So, when the user buys one ticket, they have bought 0.000800 BCH worth of coloured coins marked as my ticket. Call them ticket-coins for now.\nPutting aside the fact that the end user has to store that ticket somewhere, in some kind of specialized wallet, would I be able to just set up some kind of payment gateway for ticket-coins? Could I do it with a PayPal like payment system, or Bitpay, or something like that? Are there compliance regulations that would come into play? Legal restrictions based on the country where the purchase is happening? Would users have to first buy Bitcoin Cash and then exchange them for ticket-coins?\nIn short, for coloured coins to have the most utility, it seems ideal if they could be accessed without the user necessarily knowing they are reliant on a cryptocurrency or blockchain back end.

"text": "Bitcoin – Iran and Russia Consider Using Cryptocurrency to Evade US Sanctions: Report 21 May 2018 8536\nJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nIran and Russia could turn to cryptocurrency as a solution to evade Western financial sanctions and reduce their dependence on the US dollar.\nIran has been struck by a monetary crisis in recent months after its fiat currency, the rial, plunged to historic lows against the US dollar leading up to US president Trump formally withdrawing from the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran. Russia has also seen international sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union and a number of other countries in recent years following Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine.\nIn an effort to circumvent US-dollar-based commerce and escape their dependence on the global interbank system operated by SWIFT, Tehran is suggesting cryptocurrency as a solution in high-level discussions with Moscow, according to a report by Russian publication RBC citing major news agency Interfax.\nIran’s Parliamentary Commission of Economic Affairs has already “obliged the Central Bank of Iran to start developing proposals for the use of cryptocurrency”, revealed the authority’s chief Mohammad Reza Pourebrahimi.\n“Over the past year or two, the use of cryptocurrency has become an important issue,” the official reportedly said. “This is one of the good ways to bypass the use of the dollar, as well as the replacement of the SWIFT system,” he added.\nThe official made the revelation following a Moscow meeting with Dmitry Mezentsev, head of Russia’s Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy.\nNotably, Pourebrahimi confirmed that he had already held discussions with the Russian Parliament’s Committee on Economic Policy with the report suggesting that Iran ‘has established cooperation with Russia’ in their cryptocurrency pact.\nPourebrahimi added:\nThey share our opinion. We said that if we manage to promote this work, then we will be the first countries that use cryptocurrency in the exchange of goods.\nAs reported in February, Iran’s ICT Minister Mohammad Azari-Jahromi confirmed the state’s effort to develop a state cryptocurrency powered by blockchain technology. “A pilot model for review and approval will be presented to the banking system of the country,” the minister said at the time, hinting at a nationwide rollout if the cryptocurrency proved successful.\nRussia is also working on a state cryptocurrency, the cryptoruble, on Putin’s orders.\nRussian president Vladimir Putin has ordered the development of the ‘cryptoruble’, a state cryptocurrency.\nIn meeting with senior government figures, Putin’s economic advisor Sergei Glazev told officials that a state cryptocurrency would serve as a ‘useful tool’ to circumvent sanctions.\nHe notably added:\nWe can settle accounts with our counterparties all over the world with no regard for sanctions.\nRussia has been reported to be heavily involved in the development of Venezuela’s ‘petro’, the world’s first state cryptocurrency. The petro was first announced by Venezuelan president Maduro in December as a financial instrument to evade US-led economic sanctions before its official launch in February. Kremlin officials have dismissed any suggestions of being involved in the petro’s development and have rubbished a Time report that claimed Russian president Vladimir Putin personally signed off on helping Venezuela with the petro.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliamentary commission of econom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interfax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T00:42:12.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fe258be49896fa72248cb7ae9fc16b91d11c379", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVUrqLJ2B1Yhx5zxzknn2E4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Should You Still Invest in Bitcoin in 2018?", "title_full": "Should You Still Invest in Bitcoin in 2018?", "published": "2018-05-21T16:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3fe258be49896fa72248cb7ae9fc16b91d11c379", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVUrqLJ2B1Yhx5zxzknn2E4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nicko122", "published": "2018-05-21T16:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should You Still Invest in Bitcoin in 2018?", "text": "Why not, because 2018 is a good year for investing.

This makes sense as people invest in things in order to build their own financial wealth. However, that takes away from what bitcoin is actually all about, which is the greater social good.\nThe Bitcoin Investment Vehicle and Social Good\nFew people realize that it is actually quite a luxury to be able to have a bank account. There are numerous countries in Africa, Asia, and South America where very few people have bank accounts. Indeed, some countries have a 50% to 90% unbanked population. These people have the same rights as those in America and Europe, which means they should be allowed to own a bank account. However, many of those countries have rules and regulations in place that are so strict that the majority of citizens will simply not be able to ever open a bank account.\nBitcoin aims to resolve this by focusing on two things. First of all, because it is a decentralized and unregulated type of currency, anyone who has an internet connection is able to open an account. Secondly, it Focuses on the fact that the world is becoming increasingly cashless. Very few people still carry cash on them, purchasing they’re items online and using credit and debit cards to purchase things offline. Indeed, it is now even possible to make mobile payments at most merchants, which means card transactions are now being threatened. Bitcoin has been mobile for years.\nBitcoin uses what is known as blockchain technology, which is quite complex to understand. That complexity is what made a lot of people shy away from cryptocurrencies. However, because the technology is now properly established, most people can simply join it with ease.\nBitcoin is capable of a lot of different things, which is precisely what makes it so interesting. Some of those things include: It can take on what is known as the ‘remittance market’, which describes how funds are transferred between two people. It is highly superior in this compared to all other types of currency transfer institutions. It is capable of sending money from every corner in the world in a few seconds without charging administration and currency exchange fees. It can be exchanged into fiat currency, which means people all over the world can use their country’s own money as well. It stops the need for people to have a physical bank account, which is one of the things that makes bitcoin as powerful as it is. Essentially, it ensures those millions of unbanked individuals are suddenly able to have access to money – and therefore gain spending power.\nHowever, what is required is internet access. That said, because bitcoin was developed for the greater social good, it is now even possible through certain services to access bitcoin using text messages. Again, this means that those who are unbanked and who don’t have internet access are able to access financial services as well. Wake up Right!

Wide Global Experience in Many Countries\nJesudason had also served as the head of the strategy for Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a position he was appointed to in 2011.

Schneider will begin his new role at Block.one in early June.\nThe global general counsel will be charged with the responsibility handling the legal affairs of the startup as well as the proactive compliance and regulatory initiatives of Block.one.

Bitcoin’s official message board is bitcointalk.org .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be bought or sold on these cryptocurrency exchanges: BitForex, DragonEX, ZB.COM, BitBay, CoinsBank, Bitbank, RightBTC, Upbit, Sistemkoin, Bitinka, CoinEgg, Exmo, Coinrail, CEX.IO, WEX, GOPAX, OOOBTC, Tidex, Fatbtc, Korbit, BtcTrade.im, BitMEX, xBTCe, Trade By Trade, Ethfinex, Coinroom, EXX, CoinEx Market, BTCBOX, LakeBTC, IDAX, itBit, Poloniex, Lbank, Octaex, Fisco, TOPBTC, Paribu, Livecoin, BTCC, Simex, OEX, B2BX, Luno, Quoine, BCEX, Bitstamp, Negocie Coins, Gate.io, C2CX, Bithumb, Bit-Z, Coinone, Zaif, Kucoin, Gemini, CoinTiger, CoinBene, Coinsuper, bitFlyer, Omicrex, Huobi, Hotbit, Cobinhood, GDAX, Kraken, Bitfinex, Coinhub, fex, OKEx, Neraex, Bibox, Bittrex, Binance, OTCBTC, Exrates, HitBTC, Iquant and YoBit.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a digital currency created in August 2017, arising from a fork of Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Cash increases the size of blocks, allowing more transactions to be processed.Created upon the bitcoin model, Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that is:- Decentralized. The network is spread out across many different computers all over the world;- Peer-to-Peer. Person A can send Bitcoin Cash directly to Person B from anywhere in the world without needing an intermediary, like a bank.- Secure. Bitcoin Cash uses strong encryption to prevent hacking, fraud, and cyber attacks.- Open. The history of all Bitcoin Cash transactions is logged on a publicly accessible blockchain that can be viewed and verified by anyone.The biggest difference between bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash has to do with the size of blocks on the blockchain. By increasing block size from bitcoin’s 1MB up to 8MB, Bitcoin Cash allows many more transactions to be processed in one block. The idea is to process larger transaction volumes faster and for lower fees.

To recover his money he had posing as IT officer first kidnapped his partner Piyush Sawaliya and later abducted Dhawal Mawani who was also with Kumbhani in Bit-connect scheme. Bhatt posing as Surat Crime branch police official grabbed 2256 bitcoins worth Rs 131 crore from him.\nHe had with the help of Kirit Paladia, whom he had made accused in the case, also took away around 110000 light coins worth around 24.5 crore from Mawani. He had also transferred Rs 14.5 crores from Mumbai through Angadiya pedhi. Bhatt kept around 700 bitcoins with him and gave around 500 to Jignesh Mewalia and 350 each to Kirit wala and Raju. He had himself sent Dhawal and Piyush abroad.\nThe affidavit by Sawaliya that he was never kidnapped (which he had sent after another accused in the case lodged by Bhatt, former MLA Nalin Kotadiya’s allegation) was also forcefully done owing to the pressure from Bhatt and his henchmen and temptation of money.\nA case in this regard has been lodged in the Surat unit of the CID in which Bhatt is the main culprit and Jignesh and Kirit were co-accused. Bhatt is on the run. Around 153 bitcoins have been recovered from Dilip Kanani. Attempts to nab Bhatt were on. His sister’s son had also played a role in the crime.\nBhatia said that three teams of the CID-crime were also searching Kotadiya. IT department has also been informed about the bitcoin scam which was conducting a parallel investigation.\nNotably, Bhatt had in April this year filed a complaint with the CID-crime claiming that his former business partner Paladia had conspired and he was kidnapped by Amreli police LCB PI Anant Patel and bitcoin worth Rs 12 crore was forcefully transferred from his account.\nApart from PI Patel, the then Amreli SP Jagdish Patel, Paladia and some other accused were also nabbed in the sensational case.\nDeshGujarat Comment Related Stories", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satish kumbhani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumbhani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhawal mawani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashish bhatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piyush sawaliya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surat crime", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat surat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T19:40:19.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6723442406ac0ff2ec6cdd756819b1e44af148a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcxlSk54QPfnd1OQQ6PlyC4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What is the best pool for Bitcoin?", "title_full": "What is the best pool for Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-21T16:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6723442406ac0ff2ec6cdd756819b1e44af148a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcxlSk54QPfnd1OQQ6PlyC4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lotakasa", "published": "2018-05-21T16:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is the best pool for Bitcoin?", "text": "Bitcoin investing in these industries will be the best pool for bitcoin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T21:18:04.002+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 12809, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=19400", "requestsLeft": 468}
