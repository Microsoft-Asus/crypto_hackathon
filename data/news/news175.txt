This business has grown exponentially in a little over a year as has Bitcoin Cash since its inception even more recently in August last year. Bitcoin Cash is now pleased to be a payment option on her dynamic and ground-breaking company. Elizabeth White explained: “Trust is, obviously, vital in this space and I have watched with interest both the growth and the early-adopters of Bitcoin Cash and can see that The White Company and Bitcoin Cash are natural partners.” Bitcoin Cash : offers substantially lower transaction fees than the legacy Segwit Bitcoin.

Top industry experts, traders, financial gurus, and countless websites have been speculating since Bitcoin was launched into the market.\nAs the most prominent and valuable cryptocurrency available today, Bitcoin can create a great deal of volatility in this market.\nIf people want to invest wisely in this platform, they must keep track of the digital currency’s value.\nIt’s not surprising that one of the key industry players BitMex founder Arthur Hayes joined in on the speculation. Image credit\nHayes believes Bitcoin will hit $50,000 value by the end of 2018. His opinion on this prediction didn’t change when values dropped in January though he did point that it was his job to make predictions but he wasn’t concerned about whether he was right or wrong.\nWhile many industry experts take such speculations with a grain of salt, they have paid attention to what Hayes has to say.\nMany known publications in this industry have already published articles citing his comment. Here’s a look at why Hayes’ speculations hold merit: What is BitMex?

Experienced traders can get up to 100 times leverage in contracts and shorting, which increases the chances of making it big profits or losses.\nAdvanced traders are more comfortable with higher risk and that’s why this platform is so popular with them.\nBitMex only trades in BitCoins, which means profits and losses are made in Bitcoin even if you use altcoin to finance trading. This platform isn’t beginner friendly and not suitable for people looking to invest.\nIt’s the largest trading platform of its kind and holds the record for highest amount of Bitcoins traded in a day, which was 140BTC. About BitMex founder Arthur Hayes\nThis platform was founded by Hayes in 2014 and is based in Hong Kong. Hayes chose Asia as the company’s base because Asia markets are more comfortable with digital assets.\nThey have been using different types of digital currencies, including cyptocurrencies like Bitcoin, for a while.\nThis provides a more welcoming environment for a company dealing with advanced trading that other markets in Europe and US don’t offer.\nHayes is a Wharton School of Business graduate with ample experience in the trading industry. He was a top trader for traditional financing bigwigs like Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. Image credit\nOver time, he developed an intuitive understanding of financial trading and became a market maker with skills in Exchange Traded Funds and Financial Derivatives.\nThis industry experience came in handy when he decided to move into the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin had taken off spectacularly and many are scrambling to get a piece of this pie.\nPeople wanted a stable platform for advanced traders so BitMex delivered. Most focused on an investment space while Hayes relied on his roots to establish a trading space for people looking to profit from movements of the currency value. BitMex Benefits Image credit\nBitMex is a popular platform for because it offers a number of benefits to users. There are two types of contracts available; futures contract and perpetual contract.\nFutures agreement allows users to buy/sell assets at a specific time for a previously set cost.

Fund Security – All funds are stored in multisignature wallets with the highest levels of security. Access is only granted if majority partner allow it and even that is closely monitored. Wallets are stored offline so they’re disconnected from the internet, which reduces risk of hacking.\nAll of these factors ensure users find this platform trustworthy. BitMex has a good reputation when it comes to customer support. They resolve problems through an email ticketing system, answer questions or comments on Reddit, and have a detailed website. BitMex Review Image credit\nMost trading experts agree BitMex is a highly reliable platform with a transparent team at the helm. They keep investors, traders, and users up-to-date on all company-related information.\nWhile many traders are a part of the company’s affiliate programs, their endorsement is probably based on positive experiences.\nNo established trader would want to risk their reputation on an unreliable platform.\nThe success of this business tells you a lot about BitMex founder Arthur Hayes’ intuition as well as his familiarity with market conditions ensures any predictions he makes have considerable merit.\nFor more information on BitMex, you can check it out HERE!

Argentinian Banco Masventas (BMV), has announced a partnership Bitex to enable clients to use Bitcoin for international payments as an alternative to SWIFT, according to a Facebook post May 21. Bitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider based in Latin America. According to BMV , the new service allows customers to transfer money from account to account in less time than traditional bank transfers. BMV states that the new service will reduce transfer times by up to 24 hours. José Humberto Dakak, a principal shareholder of Masventas, said that the move intends to strengthen the bank’s digital and smartphone-based services and reduce banking service costs. He said: “One of the initiatives is to use Bitex as a strategic partner to provide our overseas customers with payment and collection services at the Bitex Exchange.” In addition to expediting transfers, Bitex claims that it can provide more secure transactions. According to their website , Bitex observes “the strictest compliance rules” and know-your-client (KYC) measures. They have also hired one of the “Big Four” accounting and audit firms, Deloitte , to serve as an impartial third party to review and report on operations, procedures, as well as on balances and funds of users and the company. Earlier this month, a pilot of Ripple (XRP)’s xRapid platform was launched, which is designed to facilitate cross-border fiat transfers between financial institutions. Organizations who participated in the project reported transaction savings of 40-70 percent. Payments through the new pilot reportedly took around two minutes, as opposed to the average 2-3 days required by many conventional cross-border payments.\nIn March, financial messaging provider SWIFT published a report on how distributed ledger technology (DLT) proof of concept (PoC) could help nostro account reconciliations. According to SWIFT, the PoC, “went extremely well, proving the fantastic progress that has been made with DLT and the Hyperledger fabric in particular.” Share this post ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ana alexandre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josé humberto dakak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "argentinian bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T06:01:35.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35ab35a4b0e1f48e2f1d1e6bb40a8684cd55d292", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNIheSwZacy1wkkjJU6CjoFecaUdMDt3eqYuBYYVcCo07gSTPRiCtKI9ZScZYDq.gL2boDwfSH5ibydxkMvFfuhWanI2CJj7NtgwViU.mUuiI-", "site_full": "redliontrader.com", "site": "redliontrader.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Cryptos Crushed: Bitcoin Battered Below $8k On China Crackdown, India Tax – RedlionTrader", "title_full": "Cryptos Crushed: Bitcoin Battered Below $8k On China Crackdown, India Tax – RedlionTrader", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.092, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35ab35a4b0e1f48e2f1d1e6bb40a8684cd55d292", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNIheSwZacy1wkkjJU6CjoFecaUdMDt3eqYuBYYVcCo07gSTPRiCtKI9ZScZYDq.gL2boDwfSH5ibydxkMvFfuhWanI2CJj7NtgwViU.mUuiI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Posted", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptos Crushed: Bitcoin Battered Below $8k On China Crackdown, India Tax – RedlionTrader", "text": "Cryptos Crushed: Bitcoin Battered Below $8k On China Crackdown, India Tax Posted By: ZeroHedge May 23, 2018\nHaving tested $8,000 last week, and bounced, Bitcoin has broken back below it – to six-week lows – as the entire crypto-space is under pressure following China crackdown headlines and news that India is considering a major crypto tax.\nIt’s a sea of red across cryptos…\nSo much for Blockchain Week…\nAnd the entire cryptospace is accelerating lower…\nWhile it is never clear what the driver of price action is, news from China and India appear to major potential catalysts in the last 24-48 hours… CoinTelegraph reports that India is working on proposals to make cryptocurrency transactions subject to goods and services tax (GST), sources told Bloomberg May 23.\nAccording to the anonymous parties with “direct knowledge” of the plans, the government’s Central Board of Indirect Taxes is considering applying the 18 percent tax to exchange operations, which it would view as “intangible goods.”\n“Purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies should be considered as supply of goods, and those facilitating transactions like supply, transfer, storage, accounting, among others, will be treated as services,” the publication reports in a summary.\nIndia has so far refrained from issuing regulations on cryptocurrency, despite efforts by its central bank to reduce the ability of businesses and citizens to interact with them.\nIn April, the Reserve Bank of India formally forbade domestic institutions from servicing cryptocurrency businesses in a move which has so far failed to curb the proliferation of new exchanges.\nIf the taxation rule goes ahead, it would signal a move towards legitimacy of the industry in the continued absence of hard-and-fast legislation.\n“If buyers and sellers are in India, the transaction would be treated as a supply of software and the buyer’s location will be the place of supply,” Bloomberg continues, noting elsewhere that: “Transactions beyond the Indian territory will be liable for integrated GST, and would be considered as import or export of goods. IGST will be levied on cross-border supplies.”\nThe move is not the first targeting taxation of cryptocurrency in India. In February, letters were sent to around half a million traders demanding they report profits on exchange activities.\nMeanwhile, CoinTelegraph notes a new report issued by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, reiterated the Chinese government’s concerns about “certain risks that cannot be ignored” in regards to ICOs, pyramid schemes, and fraud, with a new government-led study detecting 421 fake cryptocurrencies in China’s crypto space.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zerohedge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central board of indirect taxes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china crackdown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T18:51:07.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d31b3ddc119dd36ad00b17fcdafa28e779e14fbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf0XMy5u39NTrVAEDU2PLpEmnnWE48aqfBWcHwbywbi680Fq2B.jqLpBu76YVqY_n51xfia.MA9hlcDpH6fshGHK2XYWUsA31NLfcoovdsPU2l._KTNM5bRQ-", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Fmr.

He’s outraged by Min’s campaign attack ad, which he slammed as “reckless.” ‘Reckless and Sensationalist’\n“These comments about my supporters are sensationalist, wildly inaccurate, and in line with my opponent’s lack of understanding of the technology,” Forde told Motherboard. “If they were speculating, they wouldn’t have donated to my campaign in bitcoin. They didn’t ‘HODL.’ They donated to my campaign in bitcoin because they believe in the technology.”\nForde said part of the reason why he’s running for Congress is to shine a spotlight on the potential of new technologies such as crypto, which he believes is misunderstood by the public.\nMin is a law professor at the University of California at Irvine who was previously an enforcement attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nHis rep told Axios that Min “is a huge believer in the potential of distributed ledger technology,” but has “deep concerns about the deregulatory agenda being pushed by bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.” Senator Rand Paul Accepted BTC\nThis is not the first time that cryptocurrency donations have been a bone of contention in politics.\nIn April 2018, ethics officials in the state of Wisconsin debated whether to allow political campaigns to accept crypto-contributions, as CCN has reported.\nNo final decision was reached, but if Wisconsin approves the move, it will join Montana, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. federal government in allowing cryptocurrency campaign donations.\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky famously accepted BTC contributions when he ran for president in 2016. He eventually lost to Donald Trump, but made history for becoming the first U.S. presidential candidate to accept bitcoin to fund his campaign.\nPaul is a Republican by party affiliation, but a libertarian by personal philosophy, so it’s no surprise that he embraces crypto. Senator Rand Paul. (YouTube)\nMeanwhile, if California congressional candidate Dave Min is concerned about the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency industry, he may be heartened by recent developments.\nSince April 2018, U.S. and Canadian regulators have launched 70 investigations into crypto scams and fraudulent ICOs as part of a coordinated crackdown across North America called “ Operation Crypto Sweep.” SEC Chair Praises ‘Operation Crypto Sweep’\nThe North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) sent cease-and-desist letters to sham ICO operators in more than 40 jurisdictions across the United States and Canada. And that’s just in the past month.\nOperation Crypto Sweep is just getting started. The wide-ranging fraud crackdown won praise from SEC chairman Jay Clayton, as CCN has reported.\n“I applaud our fellow regulators in the United States and Canada who are coordinating and participating in efforts to police fraud,” Clayton said. “The enforcement actions…should be a strong warning to would-be fraudsters in this space that many sets of eyes are watching.”\nMany crypto evangelists welcome some regulation because ridding the space of con artists benefits the entire industry. The vast majority of market participants are law-abiding people who get lumped in with the few bad actors making all the headlines.\nFeatured image from Flickr/ Joi Ito .

Can Bitcoin Replace SWIFT?\nThrough a strategic partnership with Bitex, a cryptocurrency payment service provider based in South America, Dakak explained that the bank will outsource the conversion process of bitcoin to fiat currencies to Bitex, which will then send bitcoin to the recipient. The end cost would be the bitcoin transaction fee that is sent to the miners that verify transactions on the blockchain and the fee charged by Bitex.\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” said Banco Masventas.\nDakak noted that one of the initial actions the bank took to streamline the implementation process of bitcoin was to cooperate with the Bitex development team to ensure recipients of bitcoin payments can seamlessly receive cryptocurrency transactions without boundaries. Dakak stated:\n“One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad.”\nThe SWIFT network , which is utilized by the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions, is essentially a messaging network that enables banks to share information. Sending a payment from one bank to another requires a message to be sent on the SWIFT network, which has to be verified manually.\nSending international payments and remittance transactions on the SWIFT network can take at least five business days to three weeks, depending on the size of the payment. Because most international payments processed by banks are large, it often takes more than a week for the payment to be cleared. Source: Shutterstock\nBitcoin is not the most flexible blockchain network and it does not have the biggest capacity. But, it is the most robust blockchain protocol with the longest track record, equipped with one of the most active open-source development groups in the industry. Its transparency and security allow the Bitcoin network to operate as a reliable financial network for international payments.\nMoreover, most international payments sent by banks, as stated above, are often large transactions that cannot be processed by remittance outlets. Although bitcoin transaction fees could be an issue for $1 to $10 payments, for payments above $1,000, the bitcoin transaction fee is a non-issue. Why is SWIFT Still Used?\nThe SWIFT network is not only operated by leading banks by owned by the world’s biggest financial institutions. As such, even though the SWIFT network is outdated and utilizes an inferior technology, banks have the obligation to use it. That is, until minor banks like Bank Masventas opt out of the SWIFT network and begin to leverage public financial networks like bitcoin, which are completely decentralized and peer-to-peer.\nOther banks have started to pilot blockchain protocols like Ripple and Ethereum to process international payments, which could be crucial in demonstrating the potential of cryptocurrency as an alternative to the global finance sector in the long-term.\nImages from Shuttertsock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jose dakak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toshi times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:59:14.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aaf8aee302b53ea3880f7b37999648a877007b29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1lWjfk_47E13mSCNin4Zz4-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "title_full": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aaf8aee302b53ea3880f7b37999648a877007b29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1lWjfk_47E13mSCNin4Zz4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite your friends now to grow your network rapidly.

The currency is now trading for just over $7,600 – the lowest it’s been in about 35 days.\nThis marks a serious drop over the last two weeks. Just two weekends ago, the currency was trading for about $9,800 – the highest it had been in four weeks. As bitcoin was expected to spike to $10,000, many traders and investors alike sat with bated breath, hoping the currency would once again strike five figures and prove to the world it was not a fluke, and that its behavior during December of last year wasn’t just some random occurrence.\nSadly, bitcoin appears unable to show off for the time being. The currency has incurred serious drops ever since that weekend high, and even failed to garner major price boosts during last week’s Coindesk Consensus Conference, which even analyst Tom Lee of Fundstrat was surprised by. In the past, bitcoin has always rallied during these Conferences, so to witness the exact opposite behavior this year is not only frustrated and upsetting – it’s also concerning.\nWhy is bitcoin dropping to such a degree? Up to this point, the cryptocurrency has experienced falls of anywhere between $100 and $300 on a somewhat daily basis, all the while gaining a little traction here and there to slightly remedy the negative consequences. What could stir such a nasty, sudden and above all, large drop in such a short period?\nAt press time, most analysts appear to be of the sentiment that bitcoin is not only trapped in a bearish trend, but that it may last for some time. One source, for example, says that another sell-off is occurring – one comparable in size to the sell-off that occurred at the end of 2017. Indeed, bitcoin’s recent drop is a huge indicator that this practice has not yet passed on.\nUnfortunately, this same source suggests that bitcoin’s next support level sits at $7,200 – roughly $400 less than its current mark. From there, bitcoin could drop down to where it stood in March. The bearish trend we’re currently witnessing may not end until the currency falls to $6,000.\nAnother analyst is on the opposite side of the spectrum, and suggests that bitcoin support sits at $7,800. Thus, we could witness small price spikes in the coming days before any serious changes occur. He further states that bullish momentum is forming, and that bitcoin could potentially retrace its steps back to the $8,000 range.\nIn the meantime, some good things are still happening for the father of cryptocurrencies. Banco Masventas in Argentina, for example, has started a program that allows customers to make cross-border payments using bitcoin. The bank is looking to expand its services to as many as 50 separate countries.\nIn addition, executives say that customers can look forward to the bank’s rapid transaction speeds of less than 24 hours. This is a major milestone for bitcoin, which is noted for its slow transaction periods of roughly one to three days on average. Banco Masventas is now the first financial establishment to handle international fund transfers using BTC as a base currency.

Hodlers like what they like, and that’s the end of the matter. If the first hardware wallet you bought was a Ledger, you’re probably Ledger for life. Likewise if you’re in Team Trezor. Keepkey, which completes the holy trifecta of hardware wallets, is less famous than its siblings, but the sleek black plastic device still packs a punch.\nAlso read: A Review of the Swiss-Made Digital Bitbox Hardware Wallet Is Keepkey a Keeper?\nAt Consensus New York, my budget wouldn’t stretch to the €49,000 diamond-encrusted Nano on display, but there was space in my bag and my heart for a Keepkey. At $129, it’s a little pricier than the Ledger Nano or Trezor One, but cheaper than the swish new Trezor Model T. I should probably add a warning at this stage, incidentally: the review you’re about to read is painfully long, which is a reflection of how long it took to get this damn wallet working. But we’ll get to all that in due course. First, let’s start at the start…\nEver since last year, Keepkey has been the property of Shapeshift, who bought up the company, enabling Keepkey users to exchange between cryptos without exposing their private keys online. Keepkey promises “bank-grade security,” whatever that means, and a system so easy that “even your grandmother can protect her bitcoin wealth,” which seems a little patronizing. If gran was smart enough to buy bitcoin, she’s surely got the perspicacity to work a paper wallet. Beauty Is in the Eye of the Behodler\nIt’s funny how much form, rather than function, influences our purchasing decisions – even when we’re purchasing a cryptocurrency wallet that’s destined to be consigned to the dark recesses of a safe. Beauty is in the eye of the behodler, but there’s a strong case for asserting that Keepkey’s hardware wallet (they only make one) is more fetching than a Trezor, and arguably smarter than the Nano too, even if it lacks the latter’s brushed metal exterior. The Keepkey Chrome app.\nVisit the Keepkey store and you’ll find just two products to choose from: a single, regular Keepkey and a box of 50 which retails for $6,450. Perfect for the security conscious trader who likes to keep their shitcoins on separate sticks in separate vaults. The lightweight and plasticy feel of the device is somewhat tempered by the quality of the USB cable that comes bundled with it. It feels luxurious to the touch, but it’s here, after installing the Keepkey Chrome browser app, that I encounter my first problem: it has a standard USB connection but my Macbook Pro does not. That’s Apple’s fault, not Keepkey’s, but it’s a bummer when you’re on the road, as I found myself at the time of writing this review, and thus without access to a USB-thunderbolt adapter. Cables. Cables everywhere. Third Time’s a Charm\nAt home, 24 hours later, I plug the hardware wallet into my laptop via the thunderbolt adapter, but there’s no sign of life. I’d expected a USB drive to show up on my Macbook Pro, or for the Chrome app to display a notification and the Keepkey to light up, but nope. Not a peep. Figuring it might just be the thunderbolt adapter, I try connecting the device to my old Macbook Pro, which has a USB port, but still nothing. Then I try my Chromebook, and once again, nothing. In a moment of inspiration I google “keepkey setup” and salvation arrives.\nAccording to Keepkey’s Get Started page, you need to first open the app by “navigating Chrome to chrome://apps/”. This is less than intuitive, but is partly Chrome’s fault for having a crappy UI that conceals extensions and apps behind submenus. This does mean, however, that every time you go to use your Keepkey (if you’re as disorganized as I am) you’ll need to google “keepkey setup” to remind yourself of how you get into the damn thing. Wait, Not So Fast… The Keepkey interface is simple but functional.\nHaving successfully gotten my Chromebook to update the Keepkey, I decide to reconnect it to my Mac and see if the laptop can now detect it. It can, and am prompted to set up my PIN and then write down my 12-word recovery phrase. I’ve written it down once, and am just preparing to jot down a second copy when the device inexplicably disconnects and I’m forced to start the whole process all over again. After re-entering my PIN twice, I begin jotting down the new recovery phrase, when the same thing happens. Keepkey and my thunderbolt adapter can’t seem to get along, so I resignedly reconnect it to the Chromebook.\nEventually I succeed in finding the apps section of Chrome by pasting the URL into my browser, whereupon I’m prompted to hold down the button on the Keepkey and plug it in to update the firmware. When that’s done, I’m presented with a screen showing a BTC wallet set up by default and nothing else. I hit the plus sign to add a BCH address and then scan the QR code from my Bitcoin.com wallet. I select $5 of bitcoin cash and send it to my Keepkey address. The fee is 3 cents. While I’m waiting for the transaction to clear, the Keepkey logo lurches across the screen in instalments. It reminds me of the handheld monochrome soccer game I played as a kid. Anachronistic, but comfortingly nostalgic. The Bitcoin.com wallet Nice Device, Now How About Some Altcoin Support?\nI like the design of Keepkey, and I like the cable, if it’s possible to have affection for a USB cable, while the software is passable. Is the device capable of challenging Trezor and Ledger? Sure…provided you’re happy to hodl namecoin, doge, and dash. 2016 just called and it wants its altcoins back. In fairness to Keepkey, there is at least BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC support and native ERC20 token support is currently in beta so should eventually arrive. Given some of the ERC20s I’m embarrassed to own, it’s probably for the best I didn’t get a chance to screenshot them in this review. One Keepkey, now equipped with bitcoin cash.\nKeepkey’s biggest weakness right now, as its team are undoubtedly aware, is the shortage of coins that can be stored on it. While the market leaders are pressing ahead with monero support, Keepkey is still way behind the curve. It would be great to have EOS, cardano, zencash and maybe some ripple for the ladies. It’s odd that there’s support for the 295th coin by market cap (namecoin), but room for just six out of the top 20 cryptocurrencies – or top 100 if you wanna make that statistic even more damning.\nI’ll certainly keep using the hardware wallet, using it to store any spare BCT, BCH, and ETH I amass, but a device so easy that “even grandmother” could use it? Please. My grandmother could have mined the genesis block and she’d still struggle to connect this thing to her Chrome web app. I’ll keep my Keepkey, but in my heart I’ll be lusting after one of those diamond encrusted Nanos I saw at Consensus.

Dan Kitwood, Getty Images\nA crackdown on cryptocurrency-related scams is being coordinated by state regulators across the country as con artists play up the popularity of Bitcoin.\nVarious enforcement actions, including some taken in provinces of Canada, have included cease and desist orders involving companies with names like Cryptocashback, Cryptosecure, DasCoin, ThinkCoin, Ubcoin, Leverage and Krios.\nThe North American Securities Administrators Association — a group of state securities regulators who work to protect investors — said Monday that 70 investigations have opened up relating to initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency programs. There are 35 pending and completed enforcement actions nationwide since the beginning of May.\nMillennials are viewed as potential targets, as are consumers who are embracing products related to financial technology, or fintech.\nRegulators said Millennials are both most likely to use fintech products (84%) and most at risk of fraud relating to some fintech schemes (41%), according to a survey released by the North American Securities Administrators Association in February.\nICOs and cryptocurrencies are viewed as high risks for fraud.\nInitial coin offerings are fund-raising programs that could be used to kick off a new cryptocurrency effort. But some of the ICOs can be nothing but frauds where con artists keep the cash.\nMore: Cope with soaring gas prices: Avoid these cars, SUVs with the worst fuel economy\nEven offerings that are legitimate should be viewed as highly risky.\n\"Not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution,\" said Joe Borg, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association.\nWhy are people ponying up money after repeated warnings about the dangers of ICOs?\n\"People are afraid to miss out on the latest and the greatest,\" Borg said in a press conference on Monday in Washington, D.C.\nMany times, retirees and others can fall for these schemes because they're trying to make up for lost time and rebuild underfunded nest eggs, said Borg, who is the Alabama Securities Commission Director.\nSome consumers who never recovered from the stock market crash in 2008-09 can be lured into sending money — even using digital currency — on nothing but the promise of quick, sizable returns.\nRegulators said \"Operation Cryptosweep\" has uncovered roughly 30,000 domain names relating to cryptocurrency. Many were registered in the past year as the price of Bitcoin went bonkers.\nBitcoin — which had been valued around $1,400 in early May 2017 — rose above $19,000 by December.\nBitcoin has since dropped significantly in value to around $8,400 on May 21 but the buzz continues to build.\nIn some cases, fraudulent websites have used photos of popular personalities. The Texas State Securities Board shut down one initial coin offering site in early May that regulators claim used photos of Jennifer Aniston and other celebrities as part of fake endorsements.\nJoe Rotunda, NASAA Enforcement Section vice chair and director of Enforcement for the Texas State Securities Board, said fraudsters often use false claims that a well-known public figure or a celebrity is associated with an initial offering as a way to encourage potential investors to send money.\nOne fraudulent effort, he said, even used a photo of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to sell cryptocurrency.\nSome signs of a scam: Promoters promise lucrative returns tied to cryptocurrencies but manipulate photographs, possibly using stock photos available elsewhere online, in seemingly professional, polished presentations online.\nChristopher Gerold, NASAA Enforcement section chair and New Jersey Securities bureau chief, said state regulators used some old-fashioned detective work, including undercover tactics, to try to address the proliferation of cryptocurrency schemes.\nGerold said most, if not all, promoters do not have the proper licenses for selling such investments.\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876.

Nuclear advocates are looking for growth hotspots in regions like the Middle East and China ( thanks, Bill Gates! ), where local opposition is not a particularly troublesome obstacle for energy developers.\nThe situation is different in countries like the US, where the ghost of Three Mile Island still lingers over the prospects for renewing the nation’s stock of aging nuclear power plants.\nAside from environmental concerns, the falling cost of renewable resources in the US makes nuclear power look like bad economic policy , to boot.\nThat doesn’t mean nuclear energy will evaporate completely in the US, but it does mean that the prospects for growth are limited.\nMeanwhile, innovative new forms of solar power and other renewables have a good chance of leaping into the breach, . Solar Power As The New Nuclear\nThat’s where solar power comes in. More specifically, that’s where concentrating solar makes an entrance.\nThe US has been a big fan of concentrating solar power despite some earlier criticisms, and the Energy Department is still exploring ways to kick the technology up to the next level.\nThat brings up some interesting comparisons with the development of nuclear energy.\nRecall that the US solar industry got a jumpstart from the space race between Russia and the US, but it took another generation (or more) before the technology found its footing in commercial use on Earth.\nThat kind of trajectory is similar in the nuclear industry, where the nuclear arms race of World War II pumped up the early stage R&D muscle, then it took a while before the technology transferred to civilian energy production.\nCoal was the dominant power source back then, so it was relatively simple to sell nuclear on the basis of high output, high reliability and less air pollution.\nThe problem for nuclear power nowadays is that solar power and other, cleaner options are available.\nThe reliability issue is also becoming a moot issue with the advent of energy storage and smart grid technology.\nAs for high output, the Energy Department just announced a new $72 million round of funding for new high temperature concentrating solar power technology, so let’s take a quick look at one of the teams in that batch. The Falling Particle Factor\nThe new round of funding is split among three teams, which are competing to see who gets to build a new facility for testing new high temperature CSP technology.\nSandia National Laboratories will lead one of the teams with a $10.5 million slice of the funding pie, and earlier this week the lab sketched out its goal: Current concentrating solar power systems can heat a substance to 565 degrees Celsius. The goal of this new project is to reach temperatures greater than 700 C, which would boost efficiency and lower the cost of electricity generated from concentrating solar power.\nFor those of you new to the topic, CSP involves using specialized mirrors to focus sunlight on a central point. That heats a liquid that can be used to produce steam to generate electricity. The liquid can also double as an energy storage medium, and/or excess electricity can be stored in batteries.\nSandia’s twist is to use ceramic particles as a sand-like medium for trapping solar heat and storing it.\nThe technology is called “falling particle” because the particles are literally dropped through a beam of concentrated sunlight.\nThe advantage is that the ceramic particles are more durable than molten salt, which is the conventional material of choice for CSP : The falling particle receiver developed at Sandia drops sand-like ceramic particles through a beam of concentrated sunlight, and captures and stores the heated particles in an insulated container below. The technique enables operating temperatures of nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius. Such high temperatures translate into greater availability of energy and cheaper storage costs because at higher temperatures, less heat-transfer material is needed.\nAccording to Sandia, the current crop of CSP systems are only about 40% efficient in terms of converting thermal energy to electricity. Falling particle technology could jump that up to 50% — or far more.\nHere’s the outlook from Sandia engineer Cliff Ho, cited in a 2013 Sandia press release: Our goal is to develop a prototype falling particle receiver to demonstrate the potential for greater than 90 percent thermal efficiency, achieve particle temperatures of at least 700 degrees Celsius, and be cost competitive. The combination of these factors would dramatically improve the system performance and lower the cost of energy storage for large-scale electricity production.\nThe 2013 leg of the project was initially funded at up to $4 million through former President Obama’s SunShot Initiative, resulting in the successful demonstration of a prototype device.\nHo is still leading the project, and in this week’s press release he explains the next steps: We have demonstrated a prototype for the continuously circulating falling particles, and now we are adding six hours of storage, a 1-megawatt heat exchanger and a particle lift to demonstrate the entire thermal system.\nHo also explains the advantages of ceramic particles: We believe particles are the best option for going to higher temperatures for advanced power cycles. The particles are inexpensive, durable and non-corrosive. They can be stored directly, they don’t freeze and they can reach temperatures over 1000 C.\nSo, onwards and upwards. The Sandia team has two years to hammer out the details, then design a pilot-scale facility and see how it stacks up against the other two teams. The winning team will get another $25 million to construct and operate the facility. Speaking Of Nukes…\nMeanwhile, for those of you familiar with Saudi Arabia’s recent pursuit of nuclear energy , here’s an interesting tidbit: the Sandia CSP team includes King Saud University and the Saudi Electricity Company among its long list of partners. King Saud University was also a partner in the 2013 round.\nAnd, Saudi Arabia is also a partner in what will be the world’s largest PV power plant , so there’s that (wait — bigger than this one ?).\nHmmm, hedging bets, much? If you have any thoughts on where Saudi Arabia is heading with its energy policy, drop us a note in the comment thread.\nCome to think of it, lend us your ideas about bitcoin. Are we locked in a losing game of energy whack-a-mole or can bitcoin go mainstream without consigning us to all but certain doom?\nWe’ve reached out to Sandia to bring you some additional insights into falling particle technology, so stay tuned for more on that.\nFollow me on Twitter .\nPhoto: via Sandia National Laboratories, falling particle receiver for CSP.\nSupport CleanTechnica’s work via donations on Patreon or PayPal !", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cleantechnica hydrogen", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "three mile island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T18:50:28.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e867c7d58cf6ab942a55c32bf2367fab47ad52e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_tehq4EG1FsU2IVxvyw.j7d2chxxAJp4ggBq8w02S_5PcUJC0vTW.FzaFza.xfPn8CRSIkfEYNszRu.uiJ3FoijfS8VsluYVPdyfcO2KwOLHXvVUylF6GRBxhu3BF78cU7GYl5VS6.Iw--", "site_full": "www.kitco.com", "site": "kitco.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert - 6-Week Low And Bears Have Momentum - May 23 | Kitco News", "title_full": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert - 6-Week Low And Bears Have Momentum - May 23 | Kitco News", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "http://www.kitco.com/news/2018-05-23/images/Bitcoin_0523.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7841, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e867c7d58cf6ab942a55c32bf2367fab47ad52e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_tehq4EG1FsU2IVxvyw.j7d2chxxAJp4ggBq8w02S_5PcUJC0vTW.FzaFza.xfPn8CRSIkfEYNszRu.uiJ3FoijfS8VsluYVPdyfcO2KwOLHXvVUylF6GRBxhu3BF78cU7GYl5VS6.Iw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Http", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert - 6-Week Low And Bears Have Momentum - May 23 | Kitco News", "text": "Bitcoin Daily Chart Alert - 6-Week Low And Bears Have Momentum - May 23 Jim Wyckoff Wednesday May 23, 2018 08:13\nKitco News\nShare this article:\nEditor's Note: Welcome to Kitco's new Bitcoin Daily Technical Alert.

Tax Clarification Required\nA lot of concerns and queries by potential cryptocurrency focussed businesses culminated to the announcement by the Irish Revenue Commissioners on May 15, 2018.\nAccording to the tax office, the need for assistive clarification was required, in order to eradicate any confusion and uncertainty among taxpayers.\nIreland is among a number of countries that are trying to get a grasp on the know-how of cryptocurrency . The challenge here is to weave the existing tax structure seamlessly around digital currency and the Group of 20 (G20) are devised to come up with policy options for consideration in June 2018.\nCaroline Devlin, a Dublin -based tax partner at law firm Arthur Cox, stated to BloombergLaw on May 18:\n“There is a realization that while cryptocurrencies may not be for everyone, they are growing in popularity.” No Guidance on Initial Coin Offerings\nDevlin confirmed that the guidance is solitary from Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) along with the position of the tax structure of the company in question. ICOs come in a number of ways, one of them being utility payment tokens, out of which each will have to deal with tax issues separately.\nA mindful breakdown of tax will have to be considered in addition to regulatory and securities law aspects by companies aiming at dealing with cryptocurrency, she informed. “There is clear demand in the market to locate ICO issuing companies in reputable jurisdictions, and as such we expect the issues will become clearer over time.” Salient Features of Irish Tax Rules\nAccording to Devlin the guidance proved to be worthwhile, as every ounce of doubt and confusion was evaded from the domain of trade that was related to digital currency.\nThe tax authority informed that there were no “special” rules exclusively for crypto related transactions, which confirms our perspective that existing tax rules are to be applied to cryptocurrency transactions. Income tax (IT): the profits and losses of a non-incorporated business on cryptocurrency transactions must be reflected in their accounts and will be taxable on normal IT rules. Corporation tax: Normal rules will apply to crypto transactions and the same will be reflected in the accounts. Accountancy isn’t permitted using crypto as it isn’t defined for accounting and tax purposes, yet. VAT Exemptions: Being a ‘negotiable instrument,’ cryptocurrencies and financial services that are inclusive of crypto to traditional transactions are exempted from VAT (Paragraph 6(1)(c) of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010) by the tax authorities.\nMining is not considered an economic activity and hence, is out of scope for VAT. Based on the euro value of the cryptocurrency at the time of supply, suppliers of goods and services against crypto will be taxed for VAT purposes, according to the tax authorities.

The constant bashing from business icons and trend makers are the most prominent drivers for the steep selloff. Bitcoin price lost 20% of its value since it hit the $9,900 mark on May 12.\nThe selloff is quite surprising for bulls as they were expecting BTC price to generate solid gains considering Goldman Sachs, NASDAQ, and Intercontinental Exchange are all now backing the coin .\nBKCM founder Brian Kelly was also stunned by the market behavior. He believes the entrance of Wall Street into the cryptocurrency market isn’t a small event. Trend Makers Bashing\nTrend makers and remarks from influencers always have a substantial impact on investing markets. Stock market experts, business icons, and Fed’s officials have been expressing negative thoughts for the cryptocurrency market.\nWarren Buffett, Bill Gates, PayPal CFO and Ali Baba founder all have rejected the use of cryptocurrencies as the viable currency.\nSome of them have criticized crypto coins on higher volatility while others believe it doesn’t have any store of value. This is because they expect Bitcoin and other digital currencies might have a bad ending.\nA bearish outlook for Bitcoin price from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard’s added to the selling pressure. Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari has also banged the cryptocurrency market, saying it has become a “farce” due to unregulated chaos and escalating fraud. Bulls Have No Answer for Influential Criticism\nBulls have failed to defend Bitcoin price and the rest of cryptocurrency market. The entire market has been declining at a steady rate over the last two weeks, resulting in the loss of over 100 billion from total market capitalization since May 12. Although Bitcoin bull Tom Lee blames a lack of regularity clarity for the recent losses , retail investors are coming up with reckless claims.

While cryptocurrency isn’t really Revolut’s focus point, it’s a good way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\nIf you have a Revolut account, you can now buy and hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, XRP and Bitcoin Cash. Behind the scene, the startup has partnered with Bitstamp to process the transactions. Revolut currently charges a 1.5 percent fee for cryptocurrency transactions. There are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nCompared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. You don’t get a bitcoin address for instance. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you’ll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults . Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time.\nYou can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. For instance, if you pay $3.47 for that delicious ice cream, you’ll save 53 cents in your vault. You can also multiple that amount so that you save multiple times your spare change with each transaction. Many fintech startups also provide this feature.\nYou can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money each day, each week or each month. Interestingly, you get to choose the currency of your vault. So it means that you can decide to buy ethers with spare change and weekly payments for instance. It’s a great way to hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nUsers don’t earn interests on vaults. It’s just a way to set some money aside that doesn’t appear in your main Revolut account.

A wave of panic selling seems to have washed across crypto land once again and markets have hemorrhaged $27 billion in 24 hours. Bitcoin has plummeted below the psychological $8k barrier and shed 4.6% on the day trading at $7,930 at the moment. Further losses look inevitable. Altcoins as usual have all collapsed, many losing double figures in the last few hours. Only one is in the green in the top 50 at the time of writing and that coin is Zcash.\nCoinmarketcap is reporting a paltry gain of 2.8% on ZEC but it is a gain nevertheless while all around it have crashed. Zcash is currently trading at $330, up from $319 this time yesterday. On the week there have been no gains as this coin was trading at the same level last Wednesday. The monthly picture shows a gain of 22% for ZEC from $270 this time last month. Since Bitcoin has fallen below $8k ZEC is up 8% at 4166700 satoshis from 3855000 sats this time yesterday. Over the month Zcash has gained 35% on BTC from 3075000 satoshis this time last month.\nThe Gemini Exchange support gave this coin its initial boost on May 14 and trading was made available on the 19 th . According to the blog Zcash has invested in Agoric, which is a Javascript based programming layer. Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Zcash said, “This founding team are pioneers of some of the fundamental science of secure programming and distributed systems. And, some of them are my personal friends and mentors who have been among the biggest influences on my scientific career.” Zcash Company invests in Agoric to build better and more secure, javascript-based smart contracts.https://t.co/lZOp10yWBM\n— Zcash Company (@zcashco) May 21, 2018\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nZcash is traded across a range of exchanges with Bitfinex and Binance being the two most popular. Trade volume over the past 24 hours has doubled from $85 million to over $170 million. Market cap for ZEC currently stands at $1.3 billion positioning it at 21 st in the charts.\nOverall crypto markets have plunged 6.4% in the past 24 hours to $353 billion, bearish pressure is still strong so further losses are looking likely. All altcoins have been hammered today with Cardano, Monero, Bytecoin and Icon taking the biggest hits.\nMore on Zcash can be found here: https://z.cash/\nFOMO Moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the Asian trading session and analyses the best performing one, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.\nThe post Asian Cryptocurrency Trading Update: Zcash Investment Keeps it Climbing appeared first on NewsBTC.

Here's what you need to know. Kinsey Grant May23,20185:00PMEDT\nBitcoin prices were falling Wednesday, May 23, dragging the broader cryptocurrency market with them. Here's what you need to know. Prices Take a Hit\nAfter spending all but one other day in May above $8,000, bitcoin prices again fell through that threshold on Wednesday to reach a 35-day low. The top cryptocurrency by market value dipped to as low as $7,562 after selling off sharply around late morning. Bitcoin is now nearing a technical move that last happened in June 2014. The crypto's five-month moving average looks close to cutting through its 10-month moving average. When that crossover last happened in June 2014, prices plummeted by another 70% through the end of the year. If bitcoin continues on its current trajectory, it would likely make the crossover at the end of May, opening the possibility for a price decline to as low as $5,000 by year-end. CFTC Issues Derivatives Guidance\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has issued new guidance for exchanges and clearinghouses planning to list cryptocurrency derivatives products. The CFTC's Division of Market Oversight and its Division of Clearing Risk announced the changes this week, calling them a source of \"regulatory clarity.\" The new guidelines address areas including market surveillance, big trader reporting, risk management, corporate governance and more, identifying the key themes as \"areas that require particular attention.\" The outlined rules were designed to foster risk management programs for cryptocurrency products, the CFTC said, and to \"help ensure that market participants follow appropriate governance processes with respect to the launch of these products.\" Shiller Still a Skeptic\nNobel Prize economist Robert Shiller is still skeptical about bitcoin and its possible uses, he writes in Project Syndicate . Shiller detracted from bitcoin's claims to be the next wave of financial innovation by comparing it to other failed currencies that promised the same throughout history. The economist also noted that bitcoin will never truly take hold because too many people simply don't understand what it is and how it works - but that's what has earned it so many headlines in recent years. \"Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work,\" Shiller said. \"That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal.\" UK Cryptoassets Taskforce Makes Moves\nThe newly formed U.K. Cryptoassets Taskforce held its inaugural meeting this week and outlined plans to \"develop thinking and policy\" surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency. The group, announced in late March by Philip Hammond, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, said it created a list of objectives, including bids to address the impact of cryptocurrencies, the potential benefits and drawbacks of blockchain technology and how the sector may need to be regulated. The taskforce includes members from the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Treasury. It will host a roundtable discussion in July and publish its first working report in the third quarter of this year.

Also a published author. May 23 Down in the Weeds. Mining and the Bitcoin Network: (Explain Like I’m 5) Thoroughly Modern ASICs So last time, you tried to explain the Bitcoin network and failed abysmally. Care to try again? OK RookieBoy, it’s a “gossip network.” It’s called a gossip network because everyone (every node in the network) gets to hear everything (every message) that any other node relays. But in reality there are only two things a node ever hears: Hey, here’s a new Bitcoin transaction. Hey, here’s a newly completed Bitcoin block. How does the network know that the message is new and not just a duplicate of a previous message? It’s clever how this works. Nodes do not send the whole message. Instead, they calculate a hash from the message and they send that. Remind me again what a hash is. I can’t remember. That’s because I never told you. I just said its a mathematical way of creating a short unique reference from a record or block. This of it as a kind of abbreviation. So they send unique abbreviations? The hash will be unique whether it represents a new transaction or a new block. If the mining node receiving that message and it does not have a copy of the transaction or the block, it asks for one and gets it. In this way, every mining node knows the exact status of the blockchain at any time. Mining nodes are insanely focused. They do nothing except receive transaction data, try to work out the next block and receive completed blocks. That’s it. That everything. How do they know the addresses of the other mining nodes? They keep a copy of all the node addresses, and when they have something to say, they tell everyone they know. What about the wallets? Don’t wallets need to know the addresses of the mining nodes? Well, yes. But a wallet only needs to know one address, because when a mining node gets a transaction, it tells the other nodes. Wallets generally keep a list of nodes from their previous contacts with the network. However, it could happen that none of the nodes on their list exist any more. So what then? There is a fallback — DNS seeds. These are DNS hosts (such as dnsseed.bluematt.me) that provide a list of IP addresses known to be running Bitcoin mining nodes. Once a wallet makes a connection, it begins to receive lists of IP addresses of mining nodes and known clients. Tell me more about attempts to hack the Bitcoin network. What’s the 51% attack I keep hearing about? It’s complicated. Do you really want to know? I’m in the mood. OK, let’s begin with the possibility 51% of the mining power of a blockchain network could come under the control of one organization. If that happened that organization would control the mining consensus which determines the validity of the next block. What do you mean “mining power”? Technically, it is called “the hashrate.” As you surely know, some computers are more powerful than others. The ability of a computer to solve the Bitcoin “proof of work” problem is called its hashrate. It’s a measurement of compute power. More powerful computers (nodes) have higher hashrates. So if an organization controls the majority of the hashrate it may be able to control the mining consensus and subvert the blockchain. Could I become a miner and use my PC to mine the blockchain? I suppose you could, but if you are thinking of mining Bitcoin it probably wouldn’t be worth it. Why not? Well, you can run the “proof of work” algorithm on any computer. You could even try to work the next block out using a calculator. It’s possible. But mining aims to make a profit. Mining costs money. The cost is mainly the cost of the electricity you use to run the computer that does the mining. When the mining profit doesn’t pay the electricity bill, it’s time to turn the computer off. So would I need to buy a powerful computer to mine Bitcoin? The Bitcoin mining market has moved way beyond normal PCs and servers. They use way too much electricity. Nowadays miners use purpose-designed computers, called ASICs, to mine Bitcoin. What does ASIC stand for? Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. And that means? An ASIC is a computer that runs only one program — a program that is burned into the silicon. Bitcoin ASICs only run proof of work and the necessary networking functions. ASICs use far less electricity when mining Bitcoin. New models appear every now and then, which run better than previous ones. So, should I buy one and put it in the attic, next to the room where we lock away my crazy aunt? Unless you can think of a way of getting your crazy aunt to generate cheap electricity, I’d give it a miss. Miners also put their ASICs in places where the electricity is really cheap. Profit is everything. Where is it cheapest to mine Bitcoin? A good deal of Bitcoin mining is done in China (perhaps about 60%) because in some provincial areas both land and electricity is dirt cheap. But China, for reasons I do not understand, has decided it doesn’t like crypto. Last year, it started aggressively regulating crypto exchanges and encouraging Bitcoin mining groups to emigrate. So the popular Bitcoin mining countries now are Canada, Georgia and Switzerland — countries with very cheap hydroelectricity — and also Iceland, with its geothermal electricity. OK I’ve heard enough. I need to buy a giant hamster wheel for my crazy aunt. Speak to you again soon.

Its mere existence is an insurance policy that will remind governments that the last object the establishment could control, namely, the currency, is no longer their monopoly. This gives us, the crowd, an insurance policy against an Orwellian future.'\n-From the Foreword by Nassim Nicholas Taleb\nIn The Bitcoin Standard , economist Saifedean Ammous walks readers through the fascinating history of the technologies of money - from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. He explores what gave these technologies their monetary role, how they lost it, what that teaches us about the desirable features of money, and how Bitcoin is designed to improve on these.\nExplaining the economic, social, cultural, and political benefits of sound money over unsound money, Ammous discusses the potential role Bitcoin could play in the digital economy of the future.\nRather than as a currency for criminals or a cheap mass consumer payment network, he argues that Bitcoin is emerging as a decentralized, politically neutral, free-market alternative to national central banks, with potentially enormous implications for individual freedom and prosperity.\nThe final chapter explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knock-offs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin's 'blockchain technology'?\nWhether the reader is an investor or just has a general interest in the topic, The Bitcoin Standard is an essential resource for anyone looking for a clear understanding of this new digital money.\nThe Bitcoin Standard will be published in the UK in June 2018 and will be available wherever books and ebooks are sold.\n###\nAbout the author:\nSAIFEDEAN AMMOUS, PhD , is a Professor of Economics at the Lebanese American University, and member of the Center on Capitalism and Society at Columbia University.

All major markets are still down, a trend which began forming yesterday morning. Things have not improved in the past 24 hours by any means. The Bitcoin Cash price illustrates that problem perfectly, as it is slowly dropping to $1,000. Bitcoin Cash Price Woes Worsen\nThere is very little to be excited about when it comes to cryptocurrency prices as of right now. With all markets down in the dirt, it is evident there is a fair amount of panic setting in. Traders and speculators are more than willing to part with their cryptocurrency holdings right now, which will only push the prices down even further. This is quite visible when looking at the Bitcoin Cash price as of right now.\nTo be more specific, the Bitcoin Cash price has dropped from nearly $1,300 to $1,056 in the past few days. It is evident this is not the development most people are looking for these days, but there is very little to be done about it at this point in time. With the Bitcoin Cash price dropping 11.5% over the past 24 hours, the bigger question is whether or not the value can remain above $1,000 for much longer.\nAdditionally, the Bitcoin Cash price is also losing ground thanks to further declines in the BCH/BTC ratio. With another 6.61% decline in the past 24 hours, it is evident speculators are mainly interested in getting rid of BCH in favor of Bitcoin right now. This also applies to other cryptocurrencies as of right now, and it remains to be seen when the momentum turns in favor of the cryptocurrency industry.\nWith $696.16m in 24-hour trading volume , things are not looking all that bad for Bitcoin Cash. Although this volume isn’t the most impressive by any means, it is still pretty significant when looking at some of the other altcoins on the market. It also appears the total cryptocurrency trading volume is rising again, albeit this is mainly due to more people selling their holdings right now.\nLooking over the exchanges ranked by trading volume, BitcoiN Cash is extremely popular on OKex, Bitfinex, and HitBTC. LBank is also in the top five, and OKEx’s BTC pair closes out the top five. It is interesting to see so many markets generate over $30m in trading volume these past 24 hours. Unfortunately, there are only two fiat currency pairs in the entire top 10, which means less fresh capital is entering the BCH ecosystem as of right now.\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen how things will unfold for the Bitcoin Cash price. It is evident the current momentum is not looking all that hot, but there is no reason to wallow in despair either. Cryptocurrencies are volatile by nature, and there are a lot of reasons as to why the Bitcoin Cash price is suffering from major setbacks right now. Whether or not it will remain above $1,000, is the big question for today, as that seems very difficult right now.

ZEN is currently trading at the $40 area and Binance is about to list the digital currency on its platform. ZenCash Jumps 50% Ahead of Binance Listing, Operator Postpones\nBinance, a cryptocurrency trading platform originally from China that is planning to launch a decentralized exchange in the coming months, was about to list ZenCash (ZEN) at 2018/05/23 05:30 AM (UTC). A subsequent price pump caused high congestion on the network.\nDuring the listing period, which only lasted two hours, ZEN jumped from $33 to the $50 mark, a gain of more than 50%. Most trading volumes happened for ZEN/BTC at Bittrex (over $17 million) and Upbit (over $12 million). Binance was opening trading for ZEN/BNB, ZEN/BTC, and ZEN/ETH pairs and allowed users to start depositing ZEN in preparation for trading.\nTwo hours later, t he company founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao announced the postponement of the listing in a statement :\n“Due to high congestion on the ZenCash network, Binance will postpone the listing of ZenCash until their blockchain is stable. We will keep ZEN deposits open and provide a further announcement prior to listing. Thank you for your understanding.”\nBinance released a new statement announcing it will give it another try at 07:30 AM (UTC).\n“As the ZenCash network is now stable, Binance will open trading for ZEN/BNB, ZEN/BTC and ZEN/ETH trading pairs at 2018/05/23 07:30 AM (UTC).”\nThe fee structure of ZenCash on Binance includes a transaction fee of 0.002 ZEN and a minimum withdrawal of 0.004 ZEN. The minimum amount of trading for ZEN/BTC is 0. 1. As an end-to-end-encrypted system with zero-knowledge technology, ZEN combines the ability for transactions, communication, and competitive governance, in a secure and anonymous way. ZenCash is an evolution of the Zcash codebase .\nTrading around $42, ZenCash is now ranking #89 in the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to coinmarketcap.com , after having its market inflated to $190 million from $135 million in a couple of hours. Prior to the price pump, the digital currency wasn’t even listed on the top 100 coins by market cap.\nZenCash is the biggest winner in the last 24 hours, with close to 40% gains, followed by Bitcoin Private (+7.09%), MaidSafeCoin (+2.41%), and MonaCoin (+2.15%). The overall market is down today. Bitcoin trades below the $8,000 line and is bleeding nearly 5% of its value. Ethereum is losing 8.63% of its price and Ripple is down by 5.81%.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dump - helena bitcoin mining binance postpones listing of zencash following pump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bittrex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T11:39:30.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8c6bb427f5520ed4d9f956414db26f365329758", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcBzvNXhGAZSpENdBqmZW8rOVByYu52ah1537fKsaRESneF0hm5sMsaxYf_nPtI2ZyR4qLSYay0pcoYk_nv8QEVaIbQ8687AX1PbDw1KdR6bg-", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - South Africa: Three Suspects in Custody over Bitcoin Ransom Kidnapping - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - South Africa: Three Suspects in Custody over Bitcoin Ransom Kidnapping - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Kidnapping.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8c6bb427f5520ed4d9f956414db26f365329758", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcBzvNXhGAZSpENdBqmZW8rOVByYu52ah1537fKsaRESneF0hm5sMsaxYf_nPtI2ZyR4qLSYay0pcoYk_nv8QEVaIbQ8687AX1PbDw1KdR6bg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - South Africa: Three Suspects in Custody over Bitcoin Ransom Kidnapping - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New – South Africa: Three Suspects in Custody over Bitcoin Ransom Kidnapping Best New – South Africa: Three Suspects in Custody over Bitcoin Ransom Kidnapping Best New Cryptocurrency By root / May 23, 2018\nThree suspects have been taken into custody by local law enforcement in South Africa following the kidnapping of a 12-year-old boy named Katlego Marite. It’s believed to be the first example of such a crime in South Africa involving a ransom demand being requested in Bitcoin. Kidnappers Demand 15 Bitcoin be Paid for Victim’s Safe Return\nKatlego Marite was snatched on Sunday as he was playing with friends in the town of Witbank, South Africa. The last communication his family had received from the kidnappers was a ransom note. According to reports in The Guardian , it read:\n“This is a kidnapping … We demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child’s safe release – non-negotiable.”\nAlso in the note, threats were made against the boy’s life. The first deadline for the payment of the ransom was on Monday evening. According to a police official, the parent’s were understandably distressed by the whole ordeal. He said:\n“They don’t even know what this bitcoin is. They’re devastated and you can see they’re worried and asking themselves: ‘Where’s our son?”\nCCTV footage from a neighbouring property shows the boy being forced into a silver Toyota Corolla which promptly left the scene. Authorities and the boy’s family were alerted by one of his mother’s colleagues. The unnamed co-worker of Miriam Marite had gone in search of the car after seeing the private security footage. After he saw a similar car outside a local bar and reported it police were able to detain three men in connection with the kidnapping.\nLocal media outlet TimesLIVE report that no suspects have been arrested or charged as of yet. According to Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, taking suspects in did not mean that they would be charged. The three were merely being detained for questioning at present.\nThe publication also stated that it was still unknown if the three suspects were continuing to be held by police or if they had simply been questioned and then released.\nThe kidnapping of Katlego Marite isn’t the first example of such a ransom being made in Bitcoin. Last year, we reported on the case of EXMO Exchange employee Pavel Lerner being taken from outside his office in Kiev. He was freed three days later after the million dollars worth of Bitcoin was paid to the kidnappers. There has been no report yet to indicate that those responsible have since been arrested.

An AI compilation published on Youtube Tuesday that used pre-existing Bitcoin (BTC) explainers to come up with its own “basic stage training” on Bitcoin has resulted in almost complete nonsense, Mashable reports May 22. Created by Botnik Studios , which describes itself on Twitter as a “human-machine creative force,” the Youtube video is a voice over of the texts generated by an AI that used “predictive keyboard trained on dozens of Bitcoin explainers.” In order to introduce the viewer to the coin, the video first explains that “Bitcoin is the most valuable form of electricity.” The AI explainer then teaches the viewer exactly how Bitcoin transactions work according to its generated text: “Randomly pick a number between one and 30,000. Now spend that amount of money on Ethereum . This is known as hashing the code to get some of that Bitcoin.” The video also touches on the topic of blockchain , which a user can gain access to by installing “exploit.bin, and it will remind you every day of your biggest nightmares.” Having Bitcoin – whose most popular form is the “Wild Richard” which can be used to pay for “counterfeit coffee” – is described as having advantages despite its risks: “One benefit of Bitcoin is that you can upload a version of your future self on the darknet, but it will kill your retirement account, because it is over 1,000 years old.” The video ends with two warnings to all viewers, the first being that the “safest way to protect your Bitcoin wallet is simply to lose it,” and the second touching on a more personal subject: “Caution: the last time I mined a fresh Bitcoin, billionaire killer Mark February tried to patent my life.”\nCointelegraph has its own series of explainers that were not created with AI, including ones on Bitcoin , Bitcoin mining , blockchain , and crypto wallets .\nClick this link for the original source of this article.

Last October we asked a similar question regarding whether the SEC would approve a Bitcoin ETF in 2017 . At that time the prospects for such an instrument becoming available in 2017 didn't look very likely. And indeed that proved to be true.\nTo be sure, currently—and similar to the situation last fall—investors interested in exposure to Bitcoin via a fund specifically focused on the most popular cryptocurrency had access to Grayscale's Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC ), but that's traded over the counter, meaning off traditional exchanges. Real legitimacy, as well as more robust investor trust in the asset class, would only come from a vehicle traded on a major US exchange. But are investors any closer to seeing an exchange traded Bitcoin ETF launch this year?\nOne development that's occurred since our previous article, which has been a positive for the prospect of a major exchange traded ETF gaining regulatory approval, has been the launch, this past December, of Bitcoin futures trading via both the CBOE's XBT and CME's BTC . As many had said before Bitcoin futures trading became a reality, it could be a game-changer for the cryptocurrency sector overall and was often cited as a key step toward eventual regulatory approval of an exchange traded fund.\nThere's no doubt the launch of a Bitcoin ETF would add additional liquidity to this particular market. As well, it would enable institutional and retail investors to more safely bet on this extremely volatile asset. But as of this writing, interested investors continue to wait.\nThe good news is there has been some progress on the regulatory front since we last covered the rejection of ETF applications by the SEC, or the withdrawal of requests by prospective fund providers ahead of any SEC rejections. In early April, CNN reported that the regulatory commission had quietly begun considering a rule change that would enable ProShares to list two Bticoin ETFs on the NYSE Arca exchange. CBOE, others encourage Bitcoin ETFs\nCBOE, which is behind the launch of one Bitcoin futures exchange, is also actively encouraging the SEC to authorize cryptocurrency ETFs.\n”Cboe encourages the Commission to approach Cryptocurrency ETPs [exchange-traded products] holistically and from the same perspective that it has historically approached commodity-related ETPs … The Commission should not stand in the way of such ETPs coming to market\"\nThere are, however, a number of factors weighing on the launch of crypto ETFs says Rafael Delfin, head of research at Brave New Coin, an industry focused news and insight provider. \"Most notable are increasing regulations, custodianship and liquidity.\" Nevertheless, he believes \"the relevant stakeholders in each of these fields are setting up the groundwork toward an upcoming expansion of offerings.\"\nFor example, Delfin notes that US regulators are working to provide a clearer legal framework for liquidity, in both the spot and derivatives markets, as well as for custody providers. On the liquidity side he highlights recent examples of industry consolidation, with the goal of future expansion, include Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) working with JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ) to actively trade Bitcoin. In addition he says other large institutions that are rumored to be starting cryptographic asset operations of their own.\nAs well, there's the heavily chronicled fact of increasing record volumes of Bitcoin futures trading on both the CME and CBOE. Finally, on the custodianship end, large industry players such as Coinbase, Ledger and BitGo, are launching custody products for institutional customers.\nBut for every step forward in this environment, there are also what appear to be some missteps. ARK Trims Bitcoin Exposure\nFor those investors who may have wanted access to Bitcoin via an exchange traded fund, there was, until recently the option of investing in ARK's Innovation ETF (ARKK) or its Web X.0 ETF (NYSE: ARKW ) both of which offered limited exposure to Bitcoin within what ARK called a 'wrapper,' meaning Bitcoin exposure came from shares of GBTC, which the fund manager bought in 2015 when Bitcoin was trading below $250 per coin. ARKK:ARKW Weekly 2015-2018\nUntil recently the ARK Bitcoin allocation ranged from 6% to 10%. However, that exposure was recently trimmed. According to CNBC the fund provider \"divested much of its Bitcoin holdings, citing regulatory and tax concerns.\"\nETF.com reported that ARK trimmed its exposure to Bitcoin in both funds during mid January 2018, in conjunction with the rapid slide in the price of the token. BTCUSD Weekly 2015-2018\nToday Bitcoin represents only 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent in ARKK and ARKW respectively. ETF.com says that the cryptocurrency is almost a negligible allocation in both of these portfolios now and according to ARK, the \"complicated decision\" to dramatically trim Bitcoin exposure had little to do with the \"merits\" of Bitcoin itself. An ARK spokesperson was unavailable for comment further on the matter.\nAddressing the cuts, Brave New Coin's Delfin sees nothing crypto negative in the move. He points out that since ARK first ventured into the crypto space, Bitcoin had risen nearly 90 times, so it would be expected that ARK would take profit from those gains by reducing their exposure and their risk while looking for other opportunities with more attractive risk/reward ratios. Fundamentals Not Yet In Place\nDo crypto industry players believe ARK's move portends negatively for the launch of a Bitcoin ETF? Rohit Kulkarni, managing director, private investment research at SharesPost , a provider of liquidity solutions and private capital market research to late-stage private companies and investors, focuses on the fact that ARK's ETFs did not directly own Bitcoin, but rather simply owned shares of Grayscale's GBTC.\n“This is a privately offered trust, managed by Grayscale investments, and is available exclusively to accredited investors. Also, Bitcoin Investment Trust is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not subject to disclosure and certain other requirements mandated by US securities laws.”\nIn other words it likely has no bearing whatsoever on the whether an exchange traded ETF is ever authorized by the SEC.\nGabriele Giancola, co-founder and CEO of blockchain-powered loyalty ecosystem qiibee , agrees with Delfin's assessment. It's reasonable to assume that ARK’s decision to reduce its exposure to Bitcoin was simply the company taking profits. It decreased its position in the digital currency as Bitcoin prices dropped.\nGiancola says it remains to be seen whether the SEC will approve a Bitcoin ETF in the near future. In his view, \"the fundamentals that are still causes for concern haven’t yet been addressed, including extreme cryptocurrency price volatility and liquidity in related funds.\" He believes the SEC wants more time to ensure the Bitcoin futures market is efficient enough to weather turbulent market conditions. And he adds:\n“However, given that the public’s appetite for cryptocurrencies is bound to grow as blockchain technology sees increased mainstream adoption, we can expect more fund structures such as the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) — which buys and holds bitcoin on behalf of its clients — to be introduced to the market.” Is The SEC Any Closer To Authorizing The Launch Of A Bitcoin ETF?

Shiller, Professor of Economics at Yale and winner of a Nobel Prize for his work on financial bubbles, has come out yet again against Bitcoin stating that it may be just another failed currency experiment.\nIn his article entitled, “ The Old Allure of New Money ,” Shiller recounts a number of “revolutionary” and failed attempts at creating new forms of currency outside traditional monetary systems: an attempt by the proprietor of the Cincinnati Times Store in 1827 to trade merchandise for work using labour notes to keep track; an attempt in London by “father of socialism” Robert Owen to establish a National Equitable Labour Exchange using “time money” as currency.\nBut the most Communists ever managed to do to reform money and “abolish buying and selling,” writes Shiller, was to issue paper money emblazoned, “with vivid symbols of the working class.”\nAccording to Shiller, it’s the combining of the abstract mystique of money with that of technology that has historically created particularly potent forms of gaga.\nTechnocrats in the 1930s proposed that value be doled out to individuals in the form “energy certificates” representing a percentage of a nation’s total energy supply.\n“The Technocracy fad proved to be short-lived, though, after top scientists debunked the idea’s technical pretensions,” writes Shiller.\nShiller writes that after proposing an electricity-backed dollar in 1932, the American economist John Pease Norton was ridiculed by an newspaper columnist who mused on the idea of sending tax payments to the government in the form of “300 volts.”\nShiller quotes economist Ashoka Mody who has argued that the irrational mystique, “glamour” and “revolutionary zeal” that has accompanied past monetary innovations may even have informed the “groupthink” underlying the creation of the Euro.\nIn his book, Euro Tragedy,: A Drama in Nine Act, Mody argued that fans of the pan- continental Euro might want to give their heads a shake for believing, “the mere existence of a single currency…would create the impetus for countries to come together in closer political embrace.”\nNaive visionary notions, writes Shiller, inform the current fintech investing landscape, where, “Investing in an ICO is thought of as an entirely new inspiration,” and ICO (Initial Coin Offering) creators argue their inventions should be securities-law exempt because they’re innovative.\nShiller came down hard on Bitcoin last September when he told an interviewer at Quartz that Bitcoin was the “best (contemporary) example” of irrational exuberance. A significant driver of demand for Bitcoin was the “motivating quality” of its mysterious origin story. (Bitcoin was created by a pseudonymous cryptographer calling him or herself “Satoshi Nakamoto.” Nakamoto issued the Bitcoin software, witnessed it’s early proliferation then disappeared.) “Have you by any chance looked at initial coin offerings?” asked the interviewer at Quartz. “No, what’s an initial coin offering?” asked Shiller.

Olga Kharif and Lily Katz have reportedly had their Twitter accounts spoofed and fraudsters have used their identities to illicit payments in crypto from naive followers. Latest of Many High Profile Twitter Scams Involving Cryptocurrency\nThe premise of the scam is very simple. Fraudsters create a Twitter account that looks just like that of a respected member of the cryptocurrency or wider technology space and tells the followers of that person’s legitimate Twitter account that they’re giving away free crypto coins. All the naive Twitter user wanting to benefit from this supposed philanthropy needs do is send a small amount of digital currency to the personality to begin with.\nThe article published earlier today explains the timeline over which the scams have been running, along with the pair’s efforts to appeal to Twitter to get the fake accounts shutdown.\nDespite this being one of the most blatant scams around, it’s proving to be rather successful. This is in part because of how money-hungry many newbies in the crypto community are and also because it’s so easy to set up these spam accounts. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates commented for the Bloomberg article:\n“Setting up a bot is easy-peasy… The sign-up probably takes longer than the programming.”\nAccording to the Bloomberg article, the addresses associated with the fraudulent accounts have received around 10 Ether transactions over the last few weeks. These have been in the 0.5 to 1 ETH range. Whilst no one’s going to retire on such a scam, it’s clear that it is proving profitable.\nMany other high profile technology and cryptocurrency personalities have been targeted by the scam. The two Bloomberg reporters follow the likes of Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin and Tesla’s Elon Musk in having their online identities replicated. Vitalik has taken to trying to discourage the scammers himself by adding a disclaimer to his name that he isn’t giving away any free money. This is evidenced below in his latest Tweet. Reminder: the correct resolution to the \"can an omnipotent god make a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?\" paradox is: yes, he can, but as soon as the rock is created he will no longer be omnipotent, he'll be 'omnipotent except for that darn rock'\nNow you know.\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nMeanwhile, the community are appealing to Twitter to take a more proactive role in fighting back against such scammers targeting the cryptocurrency community. Despite Twitter reportedly working on fixes and Jack Dorsey claiming that his company is ‘trying to fight scams,’ many contest that Twitter could be working harder to this end. Kay added:\n“My impression is that Twitter could do much more… The problem is that cleaning up the platform is detrimental to its business model.”\nLuke McNamara of cyber security firm FireEye Inc. also opined as to why so many scammers had been drawn to cryptocurrency:\n“This is a space where individuals are responsible for their own security… That’s why we’ve seen so many bad actors gravitating into this space.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

It won’t take long but it will be extremely illuminating. You will probably come across many bitcoin forks such as Bitcoin , Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT, etc. Bitcoin Forks: Fully Comprehensive Blockgeeks Guide\nIn this guide, we are going to make a sense of this madness. However, it is not enough to simply know what each of these Bitcoin forks are. We need to know why these Bitcoin forks came up in the first place.\nFor that, we need to reacquaint ourselves with the scalability debate.\nHow do bitcoin transactions work?\nBitcoin was introduced by an unknown man/woman/group going by the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto in their, now legendary, research paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. What bitcoin provided was a peer-to-peer decentralized, digital currency system. The entire system of bitcoin functions due to the work done by a group of people called “miners”.\nSo what do these miners do? The two biggest activities that they do are:\nAdding transactions to the blocks.\nMining for blocks\nAll the miners use their computing power to look for new blocks to add to the blockchain The process follows the “ proof of work ” protocol and once a new block has been discovered, the miners responsible for the discovery get a reward, currently set at 12.5 bitcoins (it is halved after every 210,000 blocks), however, this isn’t the only incentive that the miners have.\nAdding transactions to the blocks\nWhen a group of miners discovers and mine a new a new block, they become temporary dictators of that block. Suppose Alice has to send 5 bitcoins to Bob, she isn’t physically sending him any money, the miners have to actually add this transaction to the blocks in the chain and only then is this transaction deemed complete. In order to add these transactions to the blocks, the miners can charge a fee. If you want your transaction to be added quickly to these blocks, then you can give the miners a higher fee to “cut in line” so to speak.\nFor a transaction to be valid, it must be added to a block in the chain. However, this is when a problem arises, a block in the chain has a size limit of 1 mb and there are only so many transactions that can go at once. This was manageable before, but then something happened which made this a huge problem, bitcoin became famous! The bitcoin scalability problem aka does size matter?\nYes, bitcoin became popular and with that came its own series of problems. In this graph you can see the number of transactions happening per month:\nImage source: Wikipedia\nAs you can see, the number of monthly transactions is only increasing and with the current 1mb block size limit, bitcoin can only handle 4.4 transactions per second. When bitcoin was first created, the developers put the 1mb size limit by design because they wanted to cut down on the spam transactions which may clog up the entire bitcoin network.\nHowever, as the number of transactions increased by leaps and bounds, the rate at which the blocks filled up were increasing as well. More often than not, people actually had to wait till new blocks were created so that their transactions would go through. This created a backlog of transactions, in fact, the only way to get your transactions prioritized is to pay a high enough transaction fee to attract and incentivize the miners to prioritize your transactions.\nThis introduced the “replace-by-fee” system. Basically, this is how it works. Suppose Alice is sending 5 bitcoins to Bob, but the transaction is not going through because of a backlog. She can’t “delete” the transaction because bitcoins once spent can never come back. However, she can do another transaction of 5 bitcoins with Bob but this time with transaction fees which are high enough to incentivize the miners. As the miners put her transaction in the block, it will also overwrite the previous transaction and make it null and void.\nWhile the “replace-by-fee” system is profitable for the miners , it is pretty inconvenient for users who may not be that well to do. In fact, here is a graph of the waiting time that a user will have to go through if they paid the minimum possible transaction fees:\nImage courtesy: Business Insider.\nIf you pay the lowest possible transaction fees, then you will have to wait for a median time of 13 mins for your transaction to go through.\nSolving the Scalability Issue\nNow, the scalability issue, on paper, has a very straightforward solution. If the issue is that the block isn’t big enough to account for more transactions , then simply increase the blocksize!\nHowever, it is not as straightforward as that, and this issue has pretty much resulted in so many different bitcoin forks. The Bitcoin community was split into two and they both argued for and against the block size increase.\nArguments for the block size increase Block size increase actually works to the miner’s benefit: Increased block size will mean increase transactions per block which will, in turn, increase the number of transaction fees that a miner may make from mining a block.\nBitcoin needs to grow more and be more accessible to the “common man”. If the block size doesn’t change then there is a very real possibility that the transactions fees will go higher and higher. When that happens, the common man will never be able to use it and it will be used exclusively only by the rich and big corporations. That has never been the purpose of bitcoin.\nThe changes won’t happen all at once, they will gradually happen over time. The biggest fear that people have when it comes to the block size change is that too many things are going to be affected at the same time and that will cause major disruption. However, people who are “pro block size increase” think that that’s an unfounded fear as most of the changes will be dealt with over a period of time.\nThere is a lot of support for block size increase already and people who don’t get with the times may get left behind.\nArguments against block size increase Miners will lose incentive because transaction fees will decrease: Since the block sizes will increase transactions will be easily inserted, which will significantly lower the transaction fees. There are fears that this may de-incentivize the miners and they may move on to greener pastures. If the number of miners decreases then this will decrease the overall hash rate of bitcoin.\nBitcoins shouldn’t be used for everyday purposes: Some members of the community don’t want bitcoin to be used for regular everyday transactions. These people feel that bitcoins have a higher purpose than just being regular everyday currency.\nIt will cause increased centralization: Since the network size will increase, the amount of processing power required to mine will increase as well. This will take out all the small mining pools and give mining powers exclusively to the large scale pools. This will in turn increase centralization which goes against the very essence of bitcoins.\nIt will split the community: A block size increase will inevitably cause a fork in the system which will make two parallel bitcoins and hence split the community in the process. This may destroy the harmony in the community. In fact, this is an important point that we must look into right now.\nThe Fork Dilemma\nOne of the biggest reasons why many people don’t want the block size to increase is because of the forking dilemma. To be more precise, a block size increase will lead to a hard fork. Don’t worry, we will be telling you what “hard fork” and “soft fork” means. But before that let’s understand what a “fork” in the context of blockchain means.\nA fork is a condition whereby the state of the blockchain diverges into chains where a part of the network has a different perspective on the history of transactions than a different part of the network. That is basically what a fork is, it is a divergence in the perspective of the state of the blockchain.\nAs we have discussed before, there are two kinds of forks: Soft Fork.\nWhat Is A Soft Fork?\nWhenever a chain needs to be updated there are two ways of doing that: a soft fork or a hard fork. Think of soft fork as an update in the software which is backward compatible. What does that mean? Suppose you are running MS Excel 2005 in your laptop and you want to open a spreadsheet built in MS Excel 2015, you can still open it because MS Excel 2015 is backward compatible.\nBUT, having said that there is a difference. All the updates that you can enjoy in the newer version won’t be visible to you in the older version. Going back to our MS excel analogy again, suppose there is a feature which allows to put in GIFs in the spreadsheet in the 2015 version, you won’t see those GIFs in the 2005 version. So basically, you will see all text but won’t see the GIF.\nWhat Is A Hard Fork?\nThe primary difference between a soft fork and hard fork is that it is not backward compatible. Once it is utilized there is absolutely no going back whatsoever. If you do not join the upgraded version of the blockchain then you do not get access to any of the new updates or interact with users of the new system whatsoever. Think PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. You can’t play PS3 games in PS4 and you can’t play PS4 games in PS3.\nAndreas Antonopoulos describes the difference between hard and soft fork like this: “If a vegetarian restaurant would choose to add pork to their menu it would be considered to be a hard fork. if they would decide to add vegan dishes, everyone who is vegetarian could still eat vegan, you don’t have to be vegan to eat there, you could still be vegetarian to eat there and meat eaters could eat there too so that’s a soft fork.”\nAlright, so you now know about the different arguments for and against the blocksize increase. You also know the difference between soft and hard fork.\nNow it is time to get into the different Bitcoin Forks\nBitcoin Core\nFirstly, we begin with the most widespread implementation of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Core. According to Bitcoin.org ,\n“Bitcoin Core is programmed to decide which blockchain contains valid transactions. The users of Bitcoin Core only accept transactions for that blockchain, making it the Bitcoin blockchain that everyone else wants to use.”\nBitcoin core releases a software client called Bitcoin core which consists of both full-node software for fully validating the blockchain as well as a bitcoin wallet.\nWhen it comes to the blocksize debate, Bitcoin Core’s solution was Segwit instead of a direct blocksize increase. According to them, since Segwit would be a soft fork as opposed to a hard fork, it is a better solution.\nSegwit utilizes sidechains to store signature data away from the main bitcoin blockchain .\nSidechain as a concept has been in the bitcoin circles for quite some time now. The idea is very straight forward; you have a parallel chain which runs along with the main chain. The side chain will be attached to the main chain via a two-way peg.\nThis is what Blockstream’s initial idea of the Bitcoin blockchain and a sidechain looked like:\nImage courtesy: Bitcoin Magazine\nDr. Peter Wiulle, who was part of the Blockstream team, thought of adding an extra feature to this sidechain.\nThis feature would include the signature data of all transactions, separating it from the main chain in the process. This feature would be called Segregated Witness aka Segwit.\nThis is what a block would look like once it implements Segwit:\nSo by removing the signature data from the transactions, it was killing two birds with one stone, the block space got emptier and the transactions became malleable free. There was one more thing that needed to be worked on however. Segwit activation was possible only via a hard fork, which is what everyone wanted to avoid. The developers wanted to look at soft fork alternatives. That was when Luke Dashjr hit gold. Segwit as a soft fork\nTo utilize segwit as a soft fork the developers had to come up with 2 ingenious innovations. They are as follows:\nArrange the signature data in the side chains in the form of a Merkle Tree.\nKeep a part of the signature data in a new part of the block.\nDoing this not only ensured that Segwit implementation was a soft fork, but it also increase the block size limit as well. This was a major breakthrough but not everyone was happy with this solution. In fact, this directly led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash, which we will talk about later.\nBut before we do that, we need to checkout some of the early Bitcoin Forks.\nBitcoin XT\nBitcoin XT was the first notable fork of the bitcoin protocol and faced widespread media coverage. Mike Hearn, launched the software in late 2014 to include some of the changes that he was proposing to Bitcoin Core. His Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP 64), called for the addition of “a small P2P protocol extension that performs UTXO lookups given a set of outpoints.\nIn simpler terms, he was looking to increase the number of Bitcoin Transactions from 7/ sec to 24/sec and the way he was looking to do that was by:\nIncreasing the block size from 1 mb to 8 mb.\nMaking sure that the blocksize would double in size automatically every 2 years.\nThis fork would have been fully activated once 75% of the miners gave their approval for the changes.\nXT gained a lot of interest in the early stages as more than 1000 nodes ran its software in the late summer of 2015 however interest soon began to drop as the 75% threshold was not achieved by early 2016, the earliest possible switchover date.\nImage: Number of Active Bitcoin XT nodes via coin.dance.\nBitcoin Classic\nEven though the Bitcoin XT experiment failed, some community members still felt that the blocksize increase was the way to go forward. Thus Bitcoin Classic came about, which aimed to increase the blocksize from 1mb to 2mb as opposed to 8mb.\nLike XT, Classic saw initial interest with about 2000 nodes using the software, however, the number fell dramatically over time.\nImage: Number of Active Bitcoin Classic nodes via coin.dance.\nOn November 10, 2017, Bitcoin Classic ceased operations and declared that “ Bitcoin Cash is now the only hope for bitcoin to become scalable.”\nBitcoin Unlimited(BU)\nBitcoin Unlimited, quite like XT and Classic, is a fork of Bitcoin Core, however, unlike those two, Unlimited doesn’t have a set limit. Bitcoin Unlimited grants their users the power to choose whatever blocksize they want to go with. The limit that achieves the majority consensus in the network would be the new blocksize limit.\nBitcoin Unlimited found support from Roger Ver, Antpool, bitcoin.com, BTC.TOP, GBMiners, and ViaBTC among others. Let’s checkout the number of active nodes over time using Bitcoin Unlimited via coin.dance.\nAs you can see, there are some very noticeable dips in the graph about. Those dips happened because of certain issues that have plagued Bitcoin Unlimited.\nA bug in BU caused Bitcoin.com to mine an invalid block on February 2 2017.\nBU nodes fell from 780 to 370 on 14th March 2017 after nodes were attacked following a bug.\n70% of BU nodes crashed due to memory leaks on 24th April.\n70% BU nodes went offline again on 8th May. According to developer Andrea Suisani, this happened because of an Xthin protocol.\nBitcoin Unlimited developers still maintain an edition of their software which works on Bitcoin Cash called “BU Cash.”\nBitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited are all forks of the Bitcoin Core software. What we are going to see now are the hardforks of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency itself.\nSo without further ado, let’s begin with….\nBitcoin Gold(BTG)\nBitcoin Gold is a hard fork of BTC which took place at block 491407, on 24 October 2017. The reason why this fork happened was because of Bitcoin’s perceived mining centralization.\nBitcoin follows the Proof of work protocol and does ASIC mining. Because of this, people and organizations that can afford faster and more powerful ASICs usually have better chance of mining than the others.\nAs a result of this, bitcoin isn’t as decentralized as it wants to be. Let’s check the hashrate distribution graph:\nAs you can see, over 50% of the Bitcoin hashrate is owned by 3 mining pools alone.\nThis is why Bitcoin Gold came about which uses the memory hard equihash as proof-of-work algorithm instead of the sha-256. Because of this small adjustment, BTG can’t be mined by ASICs, they can be mined via GPUs.\nAnother “interesting” thing that the BTG team did was post-mining. They mined 100,000 coins right after the fork via rapidly mining 8000 blocks at 12.5 BTG per block. These coins were used for two purposes:\nMajority of them were placed into “endowment” and will be used for the growth and research of the ecosystem.\n5% of the 100,000 coins were set aside as a bonus for the team.\nBitcoin Private(BTCP)\nThe Bitcoin Private hardfork took place on 28th February 2018 at block 511346.\nBTCP is a merger of ZClassic and Bitcoin. ZClassic itself is a fork of ZCash which was developed by blockchain developer Rhett Creighton.\nBTCP has two features that makes it pretty different from Bitcoin:\nFirstly, it utilizes ZClassic’s memory hard equihash algorithm, making it ASIC resistant.\nSecondly, it gives users the option to generate either public or private addresses. Private addresses work by using zk-SNARKs.\nZk-Snarks stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”. Its use in modern blockchain technology is immense.\nZero Knowledge proofs came about in 1980’s thanks to the work of MIT researchers Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali and Charles Rackoff. They were working on problems related to interactive proof systems, where a Prover exchanges messages with a Verifier (more on provers and verifiers later) to convince them that they have a knowledge of a certain proof without declaring what that knowledge is.\nFor a Zero Knowledge Proof to work, it needs to satisfy certain parameters:\nCompleteness : If the statement is true then an honest verifier can be convinced of it by an honest prover.\nSoundness : If the prover is dishonest, they can’t convince the verifier of the soundness of the statement by lying.\nZero-Knowledge : If the statement is true, the verifier will have no idea what the statement actually is.\nBitcoin Cash\nThe most successful Bitcoin fork yet is Bitcoin Cash.\nThis is how Bitcoin Cash project website is defining itself: “Bitcoin Cash is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet. It is fully decentralized, with no central bank and requires no trusted third parties to operate.” Did you notice the emphasis on the words “peer-to-peer electronic cash”? It is done by design because the primary motivation of bitcoin cash’s existence depends solely on carrying out more transactions as Jimmy Song points out in his Medium article.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a lot like Bitcoin but has some very noticeable differences:\nThe blocksize is 8 mb.\nIt won’t have Segwit.\nIt won’t have the “replace by fee” feature.\nIt will have replay and wipeout protection.\nIt offers a way to adjust the proof-of-work difficulty quicker than the normal 2016 block difficulty adjustment interval found in Bitcoin.\nSince BCH is a result of a hardfork, anyone who possessed BTC got the equal amount of coins in BCH PROVIDED they didn’t have their BTC in exchanges and were in possession of their private keys at the time of the hardfork. So now let’s go through certain interesting features of Bitcoin Cash.\nHow Bitcoin Cash prevents replay attacks?\nOne of the best features of Bitcoin Cash is how it circumnavigates one of the biggest problems that any cryptocurrency can face post-forking, the replay attack. What is a replay attack?\nA replay attack is data transmission that is maliciously repeated or delayed. In the context of a blockchain, it is taking a transaction that happens in one blockchain and maliciously repeating it in another blockchain. Eg. Alice is sending 5 BTC to Bob, under a replay attack she will send him 5 BCH as well, even though she never meant to do that.\nSo, how does bitcoin cash prevent replay attacks? (data taken from Andre Chow’s answer in stack exchange)\nUsing a redefined sighash algorithm. This sighash algorithm is only used when the sighash flag has bit 6 set. These transactions would be invalid on the non-UAHF chain as the different sighashing algorithm will result in invalid transactions.\nUsing OP_RETURN output which has the string “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” as data. Any transaction which contains this string will be considered invalid by bitcoin cash nodes until the 530,000th block. Basically, before that block you can split your coins by transacting on the non-UAHF chain first with the OP_RETURN output, and then transacting on the UAHF chain second.\nConclusion\nSo there you have it.\nThis guide should give you a clarity on the different “Bitcoin X” projects that are going around the market right now.\nThe idea of this guide was not to demonize any particular project. We just wanted to increase awareness and to reduce the confusion.\nWe hope you found value in it!

Back then, following an identical crossover in June 2014, the cryptocurrency subsequently dropped by 70 percent (from $580 to $166) in the seven months leading up to January 2015.\nThis time around, the bearish crossover will likely occur at the turn of the month, if bitcoin extends the current decline towards the $7,000 mark, and would open the doors for a deeper sell-off towards the $5,000 mark. Monthly chart\nCurrently, the five-month MA is seen at $8,916 and the 10-month MA is located at $8,379, according to Bitfinex data. Meanwhile, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,820 – down almost 5 percent in the last 24 hours. Daily chart\nThe observed lower-highs and lower-lows pattern (marked by circles) and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs indicate a bearish setup. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 10-day and 50-day MAs.\nFurther, the relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but holding well above 30.00 (oversold territory), indicating enough room for a sell-off towards $7,000. Weekly chart\nAcceptance below the 50-week MA, currently seen at $7,620, would only bolster the already bearish daily chart technicals and increase the odds of the bearish five-month/10-month MA crossover.\nThe 50-week MA worked as a strong support in April, so a break below that level could yield a sharp sell-off. View BTC risks deeper pullback towards $7,000. In such a case, the 5-month MA will cross the 10-month MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover and opening doors for a drop to $5,000. Bullish scenario : A solid rebound from the 50-week MA at $7,620 and a convincing break above $8,644 would signal a bullish reversal.\nDown arrow image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told CNN the incident in the coal-mining city of Witbank was over in minutes and the abductors seemed to make a beeline for Marite. Hackers hold hotel's keys hostage for bitcoin ransom \"It happened very fast and there was no struggle,\" Hlathi told CNN. \"His friends reported that these were full grown men who just went for him and grabbed him into the car and dropped a ransom note. They demanded that his parents should pay a ransom in bitcoins.\" Read More Hlathi said the sum demanded was 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash. A copy of the ransom note was also posted on several social media accounts. The kidnappers warn the parents not to involve the police, saying: \"We have your child. Your child will not be harmed if the following demands are met.\" The note asks the boy's family to pay 1 bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27. The family has yet to pay any of the ransom, Hlathi said. Bitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets. The ransom note also included information about a wallet to which to send the payment. Plz help find Katlego Marite aged 13.He was kidnapped Sunday, around 15h00 in Tasbet Park Ex1,Witbank, Mpumalanga, by a silver/Grey Toyota Corolla around my friends house well known to most as \"Nkandla\".\nKindly call 0607388298\nPlease RT #countryDuty pic.twitter.com/mukQo0Mjw7\n— B Suarez 🥂🥂🥂 (@Bonny_suarez) May 22, 2018 Hlathi said the case was puzzling as Marite's parents are not wealthy and do not know what bitcoin currency is. \"They are just in tatters right now,\" he said.

We soon realized this was relatively uncharted water. […] There were a couple of mosques abroad that also announced they were going to accept cryptocurrency. It looks like we may be the first in Britain to do so. Dealing With ‘Incompatible’ Crypto\nAs Britain’s only Turkish-owned mosque, Shacklewell is in a unique situation in terms of Ankara’s perspective on cryptocurrency.\nLate last year, Bitcoinist reported on how government advisors had determined that Bitcoin and altcoins were “not compatible” with Islamic tradition and were thus unsuitable for Muslims.\nIn response to a civil request, Turkey’s Directorate of Religious Affairs, also known as the Diyanet, said:\nBuying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation, they can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance.\nCountering the suspicion, however, Singh pointed out that Western capitalism had produced its worst crashes specifically due to the presence of the speculation to which some Islamic scholars object.\nSingh added:\nWould we have had […] the granddaddy of them all, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, if speculation was not standard practice in our conventional, Western banking system?\nWhat do you think about Shacklewell Lane Mosque’s decision to accept Bitcoin?

CFO Rainey Points Finger at Volatility\nSpeaking to CNBC in an edition of the network’s Mad Money segment, John Rainey, PayPal’s CFO, claimed that volatility was the reason PayPal did not “see a lot of interest” from its merchants regarding cryptocurrency acceptance.\nRainey told Mad Money host Jim Cramer:\nBecause of the volatility of the cryptocurrencies, if you’re a merchant and you have, let’s say, a 10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept Bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction. Lightning Network to Beat Processors on Fees\nThe perspective comes as little surprise from PayPal, as the company toyed with Bitcoin acceptance via its Braintree integrated payments solution since 2015.\nSince that time, Bitcoin volatility has curbed considerably, while merchant practices of instantly converting funds to fiat – a practice Rainey also highlights – could also soon change.\nAs Bitcoinist reported this week, advances in Bitcoin’s currency capabilities in the form of the Lightning Network continue to pressure both merchant processors and fiat-based solutions with conspicuously lower fees and near-instant transaction processing times.\nBraintree, which charges on average 2.9% plus a $0.30 flat fee per transaction, became the subject of a direct comparison to Bitcoin payments via Lightning-enabled payment tools, which incur zero costs to the merchant.\nLightning remains in its infancy, with a total network capacity of just under $170,000.\nRainey meanwhile signaled that PayPal was not about to give up on Bitcoin. He added:\nRight now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants.

Most coins are down anywhere between 3-15 percent over the past 24-hours. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) values have dipped 10 percent over the last day and prices hover around $1,055 today. Bitcoin Core (BTC) prices are under the $8K zone losing 4.1 percent today as BTC values average around $7,909 at the time of publication.\nAlso Read: Bank in Argentina Launches BTC Settlement Services Stormy Weather Continues to Dump on Crypto-Markets This Spring\nLast spring and more specifically in May of 2017 digital currency markets were on fire but this year is a whole different story. Cryptocurrency markets are not doing so well today as every single coin among the top 50 largest valuations are in the red showing losses. The overall market capitalization of all 1,600+ digital assets is around $345Bn today and 24-hour trade volume hovers around 17.8Bn. Trade volume pales in comparison to two weeks ago when cryptocurrency daily trade volumes where much higher. For instance, BCH 24-hour volumes today are around $722Mn when two weeks ago it was about $2Bn+. The same goes for BTC as its daily volumes used to be around $8-9Bn and now the metric stands at $5Bn during today’s trading sessions. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action\nBitcoin Cash values have dipped a good eight percent today, and roughly sixteen percent during the past seven days. The top exchanges today swapping the most BCH include Okex, Hitbtc, Bitfinex, Lbank, and Huobi. The top three currencies on these specific trading platforms traded for BCH includes tether (USDT), BTC, and USD. Today the most traded pairs with BCH is BTC by 39.3 percent, Tether (USDT 24.7%), USD (20.5%), KRW (10.3%), and the EUR (2.3%). Ethereum, the Japanese yen, and Waves are also capturing decent percentages of BCH trade volume on May 23. BCH/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the 4-hour BCH/USD chart on Bitfinex and Bitstamp shows bulls are attempting to regain some upper ground this morning after the dips. As we mentioned during our last markets update the two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) trend lines were about to cross hairs and this happened earlier today. The 100 SMA is now below the longer-term 200 SMA indicating the path to resistance will likely be on the downside. The Relative Strength Index is meandering in the middle showing some consolidation taking place and uncertainty towards the next big move.\nMACd shows similar sentiment as the indicator is hovering around -23 but shows room for improvement. Order books on the upside show BCH bulls need to press past big sell walls between $1,090-1,160. On the backside if bears manage to bring BCH down there is decent support between $950-1,000 at press time but if that resistance breaks things could drop much lower. Presently it looks like bears won’t get prices that low in the short-term, but these ranges are not out of the question. Bitcoin Core (BTC) Market Action\nBitcoin Core (BTC) prices are below the $8K region after holding above this zone for a couple weeks. Now prices are hovering around $7,927 per BTC and markets are down 4.6 percent during the last seven days. Daily trade volume is weaker than usual as traders are only swapping $5.6Bn worth of BTC during this morning’s trading sessions. The top exchange today trading the most BTC is Binance followed by Bitfinex, Okex, Huobi, and Bitflyer. The Japanese yen is the most dominating pair today with BTC at 55 percent and followed by the USD (19.8%), Tether (USDT 15%), KRW (3.7%), and the EUR (3.2%). BTC/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the 4-hour BTC/USD chart on Coinbase/GDAX and Bitstamp shows buyers are stepping up their positions this morning. The two SMAs have also crossed paths during the earlier morning BTC trading sessions as well with the short term 100 SMA now below the 200 SMA. This also indicates bears currently have the reigns and they may take the dips further in the coming hours if resistance above $8K cannot be broken. However, RSI levels show oversold conditions and this shows a bounce back may be in the cards today as well.\nLooking at order books shows much less resistance on the BTC/USD side in comparison to the BCH/USD side. Bulls only need to muster past the $8-8200 zone to get to higher regions but things become more difficult between $8,500-8,750. On the back side buy orders show solid foundations between $7,400 and $6,900 but after that things don’t look so hot. Overall chart patterns show it’s unlikely prices will get below the $7,400 region anytime soon, and bulls are fighting back with some success at the time of publication. The Verdict: Stormy Weather and Uncertainty is Slowly Breaking Optimism Down\nOverall most coins are feeling the losses and trying to regain some of the upper hand. Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple (XRP) are two coins who have managed to take less of a beating. Another market oddity today is the BTC/ZEC cryptocurrency fork called Bitcoin Private (BTCP) which is up 13 percent over the past 24-hours.\nTop 24-hour trade volume coins today are Tether (USDT), Ethereum (ETH), EOS, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Tron (TRX). The losses today throw another black cloud on enthusiasts and traders hoping for long positions to pull through this spring. However, for cryptocurrency traders, it has been nothing but stormy weather with a few brief instances of sunshine here and there. Positivity is lessening and people are definitely more skeptical this week than the past three weeks prior.\nWhere do you see the price of BCH, BTC, and other cryptocurrencies headed from here?

On May 16, 2018, they unveiled three new launches that included Jaxx Liberty, the Decentral Unity token and two new pieces of hardware. Decentral Project\nFounder Anthony Diiorio made the announcement on board the Cornucopia Majesty, a cruise after-party post the conclusion of Consensus 2018. “The Decentral Project is our vision for the future. For the past four years, Decentral has been working toward a paradigm shift where users gain control of their digital assets and their digital lives,” said the founder.\nIn the presence of over one thousand partners of Decentral Inc., Diiorio took the opportunity to announce his most ambitious plan yet. He hopes that the project will help make the company a leader in blockchain technology.\n“Our core objective of Decentral Project is to empower the ecosystem with unparallelled tools, enabling the masses to take control of their digital lives.”\nThe first announcement involved Jaxx Liberty which will be released on July 1, 2018. The company said that Liberty will be a gamified experience for users to engage with the Decentral platform. Users will be rewarded with Unity tokens for completing specific tasks which can then be used for accessing features over the platform. Revamped Jaxx Wallet 2.0\nThe Jaxx wallet will also be undergoing some rather significant changes. At the backend, the wallet will support more tokens, while the interface will experience a major revamp and include technical charts, graphs, live trading prices and allow users to create a portfolio holding. The team believes that these steps will help in making the wallet more user friendly, which will, in turn, drive up the total number of users on the platform.\nThe company announced that it aims to scale to ten million active users a month from its current figure of 750,000 users. Through an animated video, founder Anthony Diiorio said, “[the revamped wallet] will offer a simplified means of explaining technologies, the projects, different coins and tokens in an objective, meaningful way.” Decentral Unity as Native Coins\nDecentral Unity will become the official digital coin of the Decentral platform and is expected to work both, as a loyalty rewarding system as well as for Jaxx Liberty and all other products. Diiorio said “With the implementation of the Unity token, Decentral hopes to blur the line between the digital and real-world interactions of millions of people.” He further added:\n“It has always been our mission at Decentral to pioneer the new internet of value, and we plan to achieve this by providing our users with the tools to get them there. We believe that Jaxx Liberty, and the Unity token, in particular, will be key tools in that toolbox.”\nDecentral was founded in 2014 by Anthony Diiorio, who previously helped co-found Ethereum . The company went on to create Jaxx Wallet, a cryptocurrency wallet that supports several blockchains and computing platforms. Decentral also help launched the world’s first bitcoin ATM in Toronto.\nOn March 8, 2018, the company announced a collaboration with law firm Gowling WLG to create commercial applications of the blockchain.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "decentra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaxx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony diiorio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jaxx liberty and unity token unveiled", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "decentral inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "decentral unity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaxx liberty", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:05:55.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e20f0dd1d591f203776407fac318925188d5ff9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwwpGFO2jT1DCgd0RDuDE_s-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "title_full": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e20f0dd1d591f203776407fac318925188d5ff9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwwpGFO2jT1DCgd0RDuDE_s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInstall our official extension in Mozilla Firefox Store to start earning BTC – To get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

The index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project. Blockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet. Ethereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects. Bitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13. Blockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5. The index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly. The sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 <BTC=BTSP> on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62. China in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy.

Can Bitcoin Replace SWIFT?\nThrough a strategic partnership with Bitex, a cryptocurrency payment service provider based in South America, Dakak explained that the bank will outsource the conversion process of bitcoin to fiat currencies to Bitex, which will then send bitcoin to the recipient. The end cost would be the bitcoin transaction fee that is sent to the miners that verify transactions on the blockchain and the fee charged by Bitex.\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” said Banco Masventas.\nDakak noted that one of the initial actions the bank took to streamline the implementation process of bitcoin was to cooperate with the Bitex development team to ensure recipients of bitcoin payments can seamlessly receive cryptocurrency transactions without boundaries. Dakak stated:\n“One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad.”\nThe SWIFT network , which is utilized by the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions, is essentially a messaging network that enables banks to share information. Sending a payment from one bank to another requires a message to be sent on the SWIFT network, which has to be verified manually.\nSending international payments and remittance transactions on the SWIFT network can take at least five business days to three weeks, depending on the size of the payment. Because most international payments processed by banks are large, it often takes more than a week for the payment to be cleared. Source: Shutterstock\nBitcoin is not the most flexible blockchain network and it does not have the biggest capacity. But, it is the most robust blockchain protocol with the longest track record, equipped with one of the most active open-source development groups in the industry. Its transparency and security allow the Bitcoin network to operate as a reliable financial network for international payments.\nMoreover, most international payments sent by banks, as stated above, are often large transactions that cannot be processed by remittance outlets. Although bitcoin transaction fees could be an issue for $1 to $10 payments, for payments above $1,000, the bitcoin transaction fee is a non-issue. Why is SWIFT Still Used?\nThe SWIFT network is not only operated by leading banks by owned by the world’s biggest financial institutions. As such, even though the SWIFT network is outdated and utilizes an inferior technology, banks have the obligation to use it. That is, until minor banks like Bank Masventas opt out of the SWIFT network and begin to leverage public financial networks like bitcoin, which are completely decentralized and peer-to-peer.\nOther banks have started to pilot blockchain protocols like Ripple and Ethereum to process international payments, which could be crucial in demonstrating the potential of cryptocurrency as an alternative to the global finance sector in the long-term.\nImages from Shuttertsock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jose dakak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toshi times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:03:56.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15268b33c17efa87f5ca88fc526c9f9bbba827f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQfXkvuZ3kaKYmfVK4Bc.UhIKpKBBbxgqCPwyyW2q7DxCyUHfWAZzH8c7LoL_qdo3ZV42Gzjyx8vVhij673f0Awa_nJTSjUHcgZlVSBU_kDjUrICcZjHbWL", "site_full": "marketranger.com", "site": "marketranger.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "‘We’re Deep at Work’ on Bitcoin: German Stock Exchange Deutsche Boerse – MarketRanger", "title_full": "‘We’re Deep at Work’ on Bitcoin: German Stock Exchange Deutsche Boerse – MarketRanger", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.87, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15268b33c17efa87f5ca88fc526c9f9bbba827f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQfXkvuZ3kaKYmfVK4Bc.UhIKpKBBbxgqCPwyyW2q7DxCyUHfWAZzH8c7LoL_qdo3ZV42Gzjyx8vVhij673f0Awa_nJTSjUHcgZlVSBU_kDjUrICcZjHbWL", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘We’re Deep at Work’ on Bitcoin: German Stock Exchange Deutsche Boerse – MarketRanger", "text": "by kentjigga on May 23, 2018 with No Comments\nJust Posted By MarketRanger https://www.ccn.com/were-deep-at-work-on-bitcoin-german-stock-exchange-deutsche-boerse/\nGerman stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse is “deep at work” on evaluating whether to offer bitcoin futures and other cryptocurrency-related products, one of the firm’s top executives said on Wednesday.
