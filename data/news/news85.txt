It’s brought up a lot in the media, openly criticized by famous investors like Warren Buffet and parodied on an episode during the 5th season of the hit HBO show, Silicon Valley .\nThe character Gilfoyle has an obnoxious heavy metal alarm that blasts in the office every time the value of Bitcoin drops below a certain price point so he knows to stop mining it. The alarm went off too many times to count during the episode and it annoyed everyone in the office.\nIf you have money in crypto and you are trying to “hodl,” you know also know the pain of Guilfoyle’s alarm a little too well. The price moves up and down and then up again. It’s all over the place right now, but does it have the capacity to stabilize in the future?\nWhat makes Bitcoin so volatile?\nWhat makes Bitcoin so volatile is a few things: Lack of regulations Market manipulation Emotional crypto traders Low volume of transactions Some market manipulation tactics you can see any given day on crypto exchanges are Spoofing Wash trading Pumping These market manipulation tactics are much harder to carry out when there is a significant amount of money and more transactions in the market.\nThe more participation there is in the market , the more difficult it is to manipulate it successfully. It’s like the penny stock pink sheet world which is also very volatile for the same reason, a lack of trading volume and regulations (more than crypto).\nThe NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges aren’t so easy to manipulate because of the sheer amount of daily transactions and amount of money in the market.\nHow do we get more money in Bitcoin/crypto? The only way to fix this low volume is with a significant amount of institutional money brought into the crypto market. If this happens more conservative, retail investors will follow their lead. Which will eventually lead to a more stable Bitcoin price.\nBut how can financial institutions justify putting their money into something so volatile? They can’t put billions of dollars of their clients’ money into Bitcoin it’s irresponsible. Institutions like to hedge their bets and minimize risk while still turning a profit.\nIt’s objectively not a good bet to put a significant amount of money into something so volatile and pray that you entered the market at the right time. So it’s the classic chicken, and the egg dilemma and Bitcoin’s value remains volatile.\nOn the flipside, financial institutions are also at risk of losing their clients’ money if their fiat currency value significantly diminishes in the future. If the fiat currency crashes then they lose their clients’ money that way as well.\nHow do they hedge their bet and minimize their risk against this risk? The answer obviously is to invest a percentage of their portfolio into Bitcoin.\nAre Futures Contracts the Answer? Even though financial institutions knew they ran the risk of losing their holdings due to a fiat currency crash, there was still a minimal chance of institutional money legitimately entering the cryptocurrency market until December 2017. Their outlook started to change in December 2017 when the CBOE and CME began selling futures for Bitcoin.\nThis new development was and still is a game changer for institutional funds because they can now hedge against Bitcoin by shorting it (they make a profit if the price drops) as well profiting when it rises.\nAll of the sudden financial institutions can start responsibly participating in the crypto market. The only way they could participate beforehand and make money was to buy Bitcoin, “hodl” and hope for the best in a volatile market. It’s a well-known fact that hope is not a good strategy for investing other people’s money.\nThe introduction of Bitcoin futures into the market will propel more institutional money into Bitcoin. This uptick in the crypto market will happen because if a position in a futures contract isn’t closed out, the commodity goes directly to the contract holder. So this means exchanges will be brokering the sale of Bitcoins to institutional funds a little bit more each day.\nAs more exchanges start offering future contracts around the world, the more institutional funds will enter Bitcoin. This activity will eventually infuse enough money into the crypto market, and this increase in activity will begin to stabilize the price of Bitcoin eventually.\nBitcoin isn’t stable yet, because it takes time for a volatile market to stabilize. However, if things keep trending the way they are today, it’s not entirely impossible for the price of Bitcoin to stabilize.\nIf you enjoyed learning about Bitcoin’s volatility, please check our blog as we launch https://hybridblock.io/ the worlds most robust cryptocurrency eco system\nfrom FR33Q’s broadcasted articles on Inoreader http://j.mp/2J3BRrW\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gilfoyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guilfoyle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fiat price", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T12:04:39.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4881ae08ce4ed10b764d3c057a420c5dcac46928", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVaPiOCyT6KLo", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Global-Blockchain-Technologies-Corp-BLKCF-32642/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Global Blockchain Technologies Corp (BLKCF) Stock Message Board - InvestorsHub ", "title": "we seem to be trading separate from bitcoin", "title_full": "Global Blockchain Technologies Corp (BLKCF): we seem to be trading separate from bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T12:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=staticchart&amp;s=BLKCF&amp;p=3&amp;t=43&amp;showctype=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5565, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4881ae08ce4ed10b764d3c057a420c5dcac46928", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVaPiOCyT6KLo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MJAM2020", "published": "2018-05-31T12:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "we seem to be trading separate from bitcoin", "text": "we seem to be trading separate from bitcoin lately..but the 12 hr chart on BTC looks pretty good...figure that can only help matters..especially when FORK goes live because there is a pretty good chance we already have some BTC mined. I hadn't thought about it before for some reason...but I have to assume that the new bitcoin being created and coming into the system will help to bog the price down except in times of dramatic rises in demand..just like stocks with heavy dilution. I wonder once the last coins are mined what effect that might have on the entire currency. Maybe even in the face of falling BTC prices...it might be a good idea to continue mining them for the future payoff. Even though other platforms like Ethereum etc may pass BTC in market cap and usage etc..BTC only has one function..transmitting a payment from A to B which is what the common consumer will want..and the more commercial value from the name and being the first to get wide spread recognition. Will be interesting to see how it all plays out in the end...but maybe some of these wild forecasts we are seeing from Pro BTC guys could be more likely achieved down the road as global adoption comes in and the supply faucet is shut off. Maybe 2025 its possible we see that 200k bitcoin price?

You may completely avoid the Bitcoin phenomenon if you have no interest to know where the world is moving towards. But if you want to know the world’s future, in fact, our future, you should pay attention to this matter. Bitcoin Mining – The Power Hungry Network You will literally freak out after knowing the fact that last year a single Bitcoin was valued around $10,000. Isn’t it strange to know that something that doesn’t have a physical existence can worth so much? When this year started, it’s worth was around $1000. So, just imagine how much it’s value has increased within these few months. Which means you neither require Governments to issue currency nor need banks to complete the payment procedure. As per the experts, Bitcoin Mining will soon make the US dollar worthless. What Is It Exactly? The tremendous growth of Bitcoin has increased the extensive demand for computing power. The hashing algorithm gets harder along with the growth of bitcoin. That means you have to solve more complicated math problems in order to win more bitcoins. This whole process is called “Bitcoin Mining”. Today, the amount of energy that is used by ten homes in the USA, one Bitcoin transaction consumes equal to that. You will be shocked to know that the computing power of bitcoin network is 1,00,000 times more than the combined power of world’s 500 fastest supercomputers. This power hungry bitcoin network is increasing its energy uses every day. The world’s biggest bitcoin mining is in China where they convert energy from the hydroelectric dams . So, just imagine how much energy our world is losing every day due to bitcoin mining and how much more it would require in future. Bitcoin’s Proof Of Work In case, you want to contribute a block to the blockchain of Bitcoin, you will give some hashing algorithm to solve. Once you solve them the system allows you to add your block. This whole procedure is called “Proof Of Work”. You win bitcoin as the reward for solving those math problems.\nBut there is a trick that you cannot make any trick. Yes, it is designed in such a way that it will require super intelligent computing knowledge to crack it. Where Is The World Rolling Towards? If the situation continues, by the end of 2019, Bitcoin Mining would require more energy than the whole USA consumes right now. Again in 2020, it will increase to such a level where it would be equal to the powerful energy that the whole world is using now. Therefore, the situation can be scary and the world is going towards destruction soon.\nAlready, several measures have been taken to decrease the amount of energy that one bitcoin transaction consumes.\nHope someday it will issue coins with lesser energy. The constantly increasing energy burden of Bitcoin is basically electrifying the world.\nIf you are a nature lover and enjoy relishing the nature activities, Bitcoin mining would not mercy you as well.\nAs the value of bitcoin increases day by day, its energy consumption tends to increase even more. This situation either has to stop or we have look for some other way to produce more electricity maybe.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T17:20:03.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f623a2c8caca4c17c03eb38ba3295fce93ada79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisVvFENVBPCHWT.4U3GG_grQISKl5rfZVfz8T0gLkgI1IlHO1.c1uF0XQsOjsmJ6FUSaCYKH4yx32DAPkrTYTLFFUDQx2wOfwZcTENKsHMLe6PLnD.gzzsZAyvqdyH71dgg7NE8mxtsn1bTwJXbSy0tSIDvXJJJW9xxf95MWsCevj7PJWtEsQm6HH5Xd3TOkHfnYG95epgPjYVjMJuodidcVvsuUfXdyXFw--", "site_full": "www.forexcrunch.com", "site": "forexcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/ForexCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forex Crunch", "title": "Breaking news: Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse calls Bitcoin “the Napster of all digital assets” but says Ripple has passed the starting line in a 26-mile marathon", "title_full": "Breaking news: Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse calls Bitcoin “the Napster of all digital assets” but says Ripple has passed the starting line in a 26-mile marathon", "published": "2018-05-31T12:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forexcrunch-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/forexcrunch-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 70067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f623a2c8caca4c17c03eb38ba3295fce93ada79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisVvFENVBPCHWT.4U3GG_grQISKl5rfZVfz8T0gLkgI1IlHO1.c1uF0XQsOjsmJ6FUSaCYKH4yx32DAPkrTYTLFFUDQx2wOfwZcTENKsHMLe6PLnD.gzzsZAyvqdyH71dgg7NE8mxtsn1bTwJXbSy0tSIDvXJJJW9xxf95MWsCevj7PJWtEsQm6HH5Xd3TOkHfnYG95epgPjYVjMJuodidcVvsuUfXdyXFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Street", "published": "2018-05-31T12:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breaking news: Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse calls Bitcoin “the Napster of all digital assets” but says Ripple has passed the starting line in a 26-mile marathon", "text": "Litecoin price analysis: LTC/USD approaching key resistance; TapJets now allows LTC payments on its private jet booking platform Disclaimer Foreign exchange (Forex) trading carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.

Subscribe Now and get fast first class delivery of the July issue at no extra cost!\nBitcoin is the first uncensorable digital currency: When it moves between buyers and sellers, there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. The now-shuttered online marketplace Silk Road couldn't have existed before bitcoin, because it's unfathomable that Visa, Mastercard, or PayPal would approve transactions on an e-commerce site for buying and selling illicit drugs.\nBitcoin is often mistakenly described as a \"fully anonymous\" cryptocurrency. In fact, while global superpowers can't prevent you from spending your bitcoins, that doesn't mean they can't figure out what you bought. More than 100 Silk Road users have gotten into trouble with law enforcement since 2012, and the Snowden leaks revealed that the National Security Agency has worked to uncover the identities of other bitcoin users as well.\nThough you don't need to give up your real name to use bitcoin, transaction histories are fully visible in an online ledger called the \"blockchain.\" Skilled digital forensics investigators can link your real identity to a bitcoin address by extracting information from pervasive \"web trackers.\" These are hidden programs installed on your computer that capture information about your browsing and purchasing habits. Trackers, which are used by Facebook, Google, the FBI, and all sorts of malicious actors, can also record an IP address, the numeric code that identifies a home internet network. \"Anonymity is misrepresented in popular culture…it's not an absolute,\" cryptocurrency researcher and security consultant Kristov Atlas writes in his self-published 2014 book Anonymous Bitcoin , a practical guide to concealing your identity. \"The question at any given time is not, 'Am I anonymous?' but rather, 'How anonymous am I, and to whom?'\"\nThere's no such thing as perfect anonymity, but a handful of best practices can go a long way toward shielding your transactions from government spies and other malevolents.\nStep 1: Hold Your Own Bitcoins Don't keep your bitcoins on a custodial exchange such as Coinbase . These sites store your identity and may share it with law enforcement agencies, making transactions about as private as mailing a personal check with a return address. Instead, set up a bitcoin \"wallet\"—a software application that enables you to send or receive bitcoins in a peer-to-peer fashion, directly from your own computer. With a wallet, the secret codes required to spend bitcoins aren't stored by a third-party company or somewhere in the cloud. You maintain them yourself.\nAtlas recommends running your bitcoin wallet on a cheap, dedicated PC laptop with the open-source Tails Linux operating system, which makes internet use hard to track. Tails Linux is designed to run off an external USB drive. (Since your laptop won't be functional until you have a working operating system, start by downloading Tails Linux on a different computer and saving it to your external drive.) Every time you finish using your dedicated bitcoin laptop, turn it off, unplug it, and disconnect the battery. This creates a fresh, anonymous session for next time that throws off trackers.\nElectrum is an excellent bitcoin wallet that comes preinstalled on Tails Linux. Supplement it with a hardware USB device like a TREZOR or a Ledger Nano S , which add additional security layers that make it harder for an attacker to steal your bitcoins. The extra device will also help you detect if malware that compromises your anonymity somehow made it on to your computer. You can set the Electrum wallet to open only if one of these devices has been inserted into your computer and verified with a pin.\nStep 2: Buy Bitcoins in Person Start the buying process with the anonymous Tor internet browser, which comes preinstalled on Tails Linux. (You can download Tor on any computer, but you're less likely to be tracked if you use it on your dedicated bitcoin laptop.) Navigate to LocalBitcoins.com to look for a nearby bitcoin seller. Don't use your real email account to register. You can generate a temporary, anonymous email address using a service like Dispostable.com .\nMeet your seller at a coffee shop with a public WiFi network. Bring your laptop, and pay with cash. Once you're there, with a click of the mouse in your bitcoin wallet, you can generate a \"receiving address\"—an alphanumeric code that's the equivalent of a bank routing and account number—which the seller can enter or scan into his or her wallet to execute the transfer. Arrive in a borrowed vehicle or park far away. Don't give the seller your cellphone number, and don't show him or her pictures of your kids while waiting for your multiple transaction confirmations.\nStep 3: Bury Your Trail With a Bitcoin Mixer To obfuscate the movement of your funds, use a bitcoin \"mixing\" service. These are websites that accept your bitcoins and send you back different bitcoins that have no connection to your previous activities. It's like swapping cash for bills with different serial numbers. To make the transaction record harder to follow, mixing services will generally send the \"clean\" coins back to you in multiple transfers over a staggered time period.\nThe first step is to use your bitcoin wallet to generate several receiving addresses. (Again, a \"receiving address\" is the equivalent of a bank account and routing number—but bitcoin allows you to generate a fresh code with every transaction for better security.) Enter your receiving addresses into the mixer's website so it knows where to send your money when the time comes. Next, enter the receiving address of the mixer service into your bitcoin wallet. Execute the transfer.\nAfter the payment is confirmed, the mixing service will send back the clean currency. Some services let you specify the intervals in which the payments will be made.\nBitcoin mixers do have downsides: Their fees can run as high as 3 percent, and they involve a degree of risk. You're trusting that the service won't maintain a record of your activities and that it won't abscond with your funds. But if you care about anonymity, mixers are an important tool for covering your tracks.\nTake precautions, like using an established service, and test it with a small amount of currency before risking a large sum. The review site Darknetmarkets.co currently recommends Coinmixer.se, Helix, and Bitcoin Blender. Keep in mind, however, that bitcoin mixers can shut down or be compromised—a service that's reliable today won't necessarily stay that way. With bitcoin, you're in control of your own money.

(Video) | Prophecy", "text": "Call of the Year: Ronnie Moas most accurate BTC forecast and Clif High recent hits. 1:5 Ratio (BTC:LTC) is coming. Pay attention to the recent interview by Clif High.\nClif High has a patent on computer-assisted reading technology which allows reading from computer screens at up to 2000 words per minute. Reaching into other areas of hidden potential within language use by humans, he has been developing a system of software internet agents (like search engines use) and other proprietary processing methods to predict future events. The software project, begun in 1997, captures near-real-time changes in language patterns within internet discussions.\nThen, employing radical linguistic techniques of his own devising, he develops a model which anticipates future events with some seeming accuracy. The processing has, at its core, a method of assigning emotional values to complex content and time carry-values to predict changes in future behavior based on how people are using language now.\nSince June 2001 when the work projected a major ‘tipping point’, that is a ‘life-changing event’ with aspects of ‘military and accident’ that would forever change the way we live to occur inside 90 days, the web bot project has continued to give archetype descriptors of future events such as the anthrax attack in Washington, the crash of American 587, the Columbia disaster, the Northeast Power outage, the Banda Aceh earthquake and most recently the flooding of the Red River. As a continuing project, reports are offered from the extracted archetype information at his web site, www.halfpasthuman.com.\nWiki: The Web Bot Project is a bot that uses the World Wide Web to predict future events. The project was supposedly created in 1997, by Clif High and George Ure, to predict stock market trends. It uses a technology that they have dubbed “Asymmetric Language Trend Analysis” or ALTA, which searches the Web for certain keywords and, based on their context, quantifies the emotional impact. Somehow, this is meant to tap into the collective unconscious — which, of course, can predict the future.\nAmong other things, the Web Bot is claimed to have predicted the World Trade Center attack on September 11, 2001. It is also associated with the 2012 doomsday stuff and was even mentioned during a segment of the thought nausea-provoking History Channel special Decoded . The actual ALTA reports are interpretations of the data by High. Even with his attempts to organize these “predictions” the report is practically unintelligible:\nWithin the termination points here, there are many pointers to [attempts (some successful, some not)] against the [gangs] of the [banksters (aka -rose protected, and stone buddy boys)]. At least one of the successful [executions] is indicated to be [within sight/smell of] the [oil volcano].\nI host the Church of Mabus radio show and it is going on 8 years.

The original edition of the draft introduces the same caps for crypto donations as for fiat ones, while limiting anonymous contributions to $20. The move renders the overall picture of individual states’ handling political crypto contributions spottier than ever, as the last few months saw states adopting divergent approaches to the issue.\nAlthough a 2014 advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) remains a major reference point for anyone who seeks to boost their chances for election with digital money, this non-regulatory document is barely fit to serve as a definitive guide into the world of crypto campaign finance.\nThe FEC came up with a set of guidelines in May 2014, responding to an inquiry from a Super PAC named Make Your Laws. This entity, which advocates for replacing representative democracy with a more inclusive form of ‘ liquid democracy ,’ requested clarification on whether it could accept BTC donations to fund political action. At that time, Bitcoin was worth some $400, and altcoins were not even considered as a vehicle for campaign finance. The FEC ruled that Bitcoin could be received by campaigns as ‘in-kind donations’– a form of contribution that provides goods and services needed for organizations’ operations rather than the money to purchase those goods and services.\nEffectively, this means that campaigns cannot spend received Bitcoin directly, but rather have to ‘liquidate’ it and then deposit the money to their accounts. As far as donation caps are concerned, the commission was split across party lines, with Democrats advocating for a $100 limit, and Republicans standing for the standard federal $2,700 cap. Since the advisory opinion outlines recommendations rather than rules, GOP support for a larger cap had later inspired some politicians to allow themselves to go with the $2,700 limit.\nGiven somewhat inconclusive federal guidelines, many state authorities have been facing similar inquiries ever since the FEC ruling was issued. Building up to the 2018 wave of primaries and elections, these requests have intensified. Oftentimes it is state governments’ ethics bodies that are tasked with deciding whether crypto donations are appropriate and how they should be governed. So far this year, several state commissions have either ruled against cryptocurrency donations or wavered on the issue, so the Colorado initiative, if successful, might become a precedent for other undecided states to consider.\nIn October 2017, a Kansas candidate for office sought guidance on potential use of crypto contributions from the state’s Governmental Ethics Commission. Shortly after, the office had announced that Bitcoin is ‘too secretive and untraceable,’ and could be used by ‘totally unidentifiable lobbyists’ to influence local elections.\nWisconsin Libertarian Party asked the State Ethics Commission in April to clarify whether it deems the use of cryptocurrency political contributions acceptable. The commission held public hearings and concluded that the issue should be decided by the state legislature . The time frame for the state House to rule on the issue is yet to be announced.\nEmmanuel Wilder, a Republican candidate for North Carolina State House, has approached State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement with a similar request in April. In his letter, Wilder acknowledged that traceability concerns exist, but still advocated for giving voters a choice between fiat and crypto donation formats, as well as supporting the ‘new upcoming financial service.’ The request is still under review.\nIn South Carolina, the issue has been decided in a speedier manner, and not in favor of crypto enthusiasts. Britton Wolf, a 23-year-old Republican candidate for District 71 of the South Carolina House of Representatives in June primaries, asked the state House’s ethics committee whether he could use digital currency donations to support his campaign. The officials responded that he could not, since the definition of a campaign contribution, as provided by the state law, does not include cryptocurrency . Heroes of Crypto-Funded Campaigns\nInstitutional politics is a field permeated by inertia and adherence to the status quo, so there is little wonder that cryptocurrency as a vehicle of political finance is still far from mainstream adoption. Politicians who use it are still vastly outnumbered, and for the majority of those who do, crypto donations constitute a minor share of overall funds.\nHowever, certain brands of politicians, such as firebrand libertarians and technology advocates, are already naturally predisposed to be relying on digital currency donations – accepting digital currency contributions has become an integral part of manifesting their ideology. Increasing mass adoption and surging prices are also factors that nudge more establishment actors to be looking towards crypto. Here are some of the most high-profile U.S. politicians on both federal and state levels who are vocal about their embrace of crypto funding. Andrew Hemingway\nA Republican candidate for New Hampshire governor in 2014, Hemingway has been the first ever contender to the office to use cryptocurrency contributions in his campaign. Bitcoin donations amounted to about 20 percent of his overall funds. Hemingway never advanced to the general election, having lost to Walter Havenstein in the Republican primary. Jared Polis\nU.S. Representative Jared Polis, who is arguably the most outspoken supporter of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology on the Capitol Hill, claims the credit of being the first acting Congressman to accept Bitcoin from his supporters. During his successful 2014 re-election campaign, he collected a modest $2,000 worth of crypto donations . In his 2018 bid for Colorado governor, Polis will surely exceed this figure by a significant margin. Dan Elder\nThe libertarian’s 2016 bid for Missouri House of Representatives has the distinction of being the first campaign ever to be funded entirely in Bitcoin . The result of the experiment turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with Elder carrying just over 10 percent of the vote. In 2018, Elder is running for District 79 of the Missouri House of Representatives again. Rand Paul\nA feature of every list of Bitcoin-friendly politicians, Paul became the first presidential candidate to embrace cryptocurrency donations when he announced his bid for the 2016 election. Back in 2015, this caused quite a stir . Greg Abbott\nIn an apparent move to attract younger and tech-savvy voters, then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced in April 2014 that he will accept Bitcoin contributions for his gubernatorial campaign. The strategy seems to have worked, as in January 2015 Abbott was sworn in as Governor of the state. Austin Petersen\nA Republican seeking election to the U.S. Senate from Missouri this year, Petersen’s embrace of cryptocurrency is grounded in his pro-market ideology. His campaign manager called the use of bitcoin a ‘ no-brainer .’ Petersen’s campaign amassed just south of $10,000 and became renowned for having received the largest ever single cryptocurrency contribution of 0.284 Bitcoin ($4,500 at the time) in December 2017. This figure doesn’t quite add up with the FEC guidelines even for fiat contributions, but the donation page on Petersen’s website gives a hint to how this could be legitimized:\n“The maximum amount an individual may contribute is $2,700 per election. Your contribution (up to $2,700) will be designated for the primary election. The next $2,700 will be designated for the general election.” Patrick Nelson\nDemocratic candidate for Congress from New York, Nelson proclaimed that his is a ‘ 21st century campaign ,’ which readily embraces ‘technology like #bitcoin.’ He later faced crypto fundraising issues when BitPay, a service that his campaign used for processing crypto donations, ran into licensing trouble with the state of New York. Brian Forde\nForde is well situated to become a new political crypto star. A Democrat seeking election to the U.S. House to represent the 45th Congressional District of California this year, he had worked as both head of digital currency at MIT Media Lab and a tech adviser for the Obama administration. His embrace of the technology is explicit, and his electoral chances look solid. The crypto community has already acknowledged its unequivocal support of his candidacy by funneling a record-breaking $66,000 worth of crypto to his wallets in August and September of 2017 alone, while the biggest names in the industry pledged their support .\nEven though the weight of cryptocurrency contributions in campaign funds remains modest, the overall upward trend is consistent with the increasing degree of mass adoption. There is little doubt that we will soon see more campaigns funded exclusively by crypto, as well as more successful bids relying at least partly on digital currency contributions. As these processes unfold, the FEC will be compelled to chart clearer rules and grapple with the problem of crypto donations’ limited traceability.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/politics/in-accepting-bitcoin-rand-paul-raises-money-and-questions.html", "https://bitpay.com/247436/donate", "https://www.fitsnews.com/2018/05/16/south-carolina-wont-allow-bitcoin-contributions/", "https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/COSOS/2018/05/16/file_attachments/1008159/20180516_CPF_WorkingDraftRules.pdf", "http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article209242954.html", "http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2017/oct/25/kansas-ethics-panel-says-no-bitcoin-contributions-/", "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bitcoin-popular-political-campaign-donations/story?id=52873921", "https://www.makeyourlaws.org/introduction", "https://www.denverpost.com/2018/05/17/colorado-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-political-contributions/", "https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-reports/bitcoin-contributions/", "https://www.coinbuzz.com/2014/04/21/texas-attorney-general-greg-abbott-accepting-bitcoin-donations-governor-run/", "https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/24/could-wisconsin-politicians-take-contributions-bitcoin-ethics-commission-consider/542842002/", "https://twitter.com/PatFNelson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/cryptocurrency-candidates-politicians-embrace-bitcoin.html", "https://cryptovest.com/news/us-politician-invites-bitcoin-donations-for-congress-campaign/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/bitcoin-s-candidate-for-congress", "http://journaltimes.com/news/state-and-regional/ethics-commission-asks-legislature-to-decide-bitcoins/article_a34f0f3d-b17d-5738-bb1d-836b29ec2768.html", "https://www.coindesk.com/candidate-disavows-dollar-bitcoin-only-donations/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "colorado wayne williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrencies in campaign finance bitcoin for america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal election commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:34:39.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f378d1dd840fb18f3cc98e7c254afd508dc5d715", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQzhmDHFNnZ1s7FOTzF2j5k-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Have you ever tried to stop in bitcoin??", "title_full": "Have you ever tried to stop in bitcoin??", "published": "2018-05-31T11:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f378d1dd840fb18f3cc98e7c254afd508dc5d715", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQzhmDHFNnZ1s7FOTzF2j5k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "agatha90", "published": "2018-05-31T11:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Have you ever tried to stop in bitcoin??", "text": "Why do you give up easily? let's just say bitcoin is in correction, bitcoin I think is good enough with the current price, just imagine in 2015 bitcoin price is still worth 400 $, and in the year 2017 reached 15.000 $, which investment can be like bitcoin?

These stories include a new multi-GPU mining motherboard from Taiwan’s Asu; a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin.\nAlso Read: Austrian Financial Market Authority Stops ‘Active Managed Mining’ Operation H370 Mining Master\nAsus (TWSE: 2357), the Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer, has announced a new motherboard that increases density with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The H370 Mining Master greatly replaces its predecessor’s x1 slots with banks of vertical PCIe-over-USB ports that let riser cables plug directly into the motherboard.\nThe company explains that: “Mining is a numbers game; it’s only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. ” The motherboard includes several more mining-enhancing features including a suite of diagnostic features designed to make a rig easier to manage. Chief among them is GPU State Detection, which scans the system at boot and indicates whether each riser port is empty, connected to a functional graphics card, or whether it’s experiencing problems. It will be unveiled at Computex 2018 in Taipei, June 5-9. Real Estate Entrepreneur Buys Bittrade\nSingaporean property entrepreneur Eric Cheng has announced the acquisition of two Japanese companies for S$67 million, giving him a 100% controlling stake in FX Trade Financial and its affiliate Bittrade. Bittrade is one of only sixteen Japanese FSA-regulated cryptocurrency trading platforms. Speaking on the acquisition, Cheng commented: “The cryptocurrency industry is growing exponentially. Against this backdrop, the key to capturing the rising demand is having a well-regulated and licensed outfit. With this Japanese FSA-licensed platform, I will work closely with the regulators to scale this platform globally.” Ripple Loving Bank Hackers\nHackers and ransomware cyber criminals usually prefer privacy coins such as monero, or just BTC to avoid having to explain too much about the crypto markets to their victims. But a new group, possibly from Russia, has been more successful with Ripple’s XRP. According to a report from Canada, an address with about $5 million in XRP is controlled by hackers who recently attacked two banks.\nBank of Montreal (BMO) and Simplii Financial revealed personal information about 90,000 clients of the two banks was being held hostage for $1 million, to be paid in XRP. The hackers, using a Russian email service, explained that the banks’ lack of education security has enabled the situation. “They were giving too much permission to half-authenticated accounts which enabled us to grab all this information,” they said, adding that the system “was not checking if a password was valid until the security questions were input correctly.” $30 Million Gumi Cryptos\nGumi Cryptos is a new $30 million investment fund meant to help crypto ventures crack the Japanese market. It is led by Hironao Kunimitsu, founder and CEO of Tokyo-based mobile gamer publisher Gumi, and Miko Matsumura, founder of U.S.-based exchange Evercoin.\n“We’ll be bringing startups from outside of Japan to the Japanese market,” Matsumura told Gamesbeat . “We like early stage. We invest in equity or tokens. We like financial services. We like game technologies, and we believe there is a strong connection between gaming and crypto.” He added that “Having advised top global cryptocurrency startups alongside some of the best investors in the world, I’ve come to realize that all of them struggle to break into Japan, the largest cryptocurrency market in the world. I’m excited to join Gumi and their well-respected network in Japan.” James Rodriguez Coin\nColombian soccer star James Rodriguez, currently attacking midfielder for Bayern Munich Football Club, has announced he decided to create a new coin for fans to capitalize on his brand. The JR10 token, developed in collaboration with Selfsell, is planned to be used for exchange of match tickets, souvenirs, and exclusive merchandise as well as the opportunities to participate in Rodriguez’s fan club activities.\nPrevious crypto collaborations by soccer stars include Leo Messi promoting an ultra secure mobile phone for paranoid cryptocurrency users.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

"Shutterstock photo\nBitGive - the globe's first bitcoin-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit - has joined hands with the University of Edinburgh to research and examine the effects of digital currencies on both national and international charities. Both organizations are seeking to develop a stronger, more organized system for allowing charities to accept virtual currency donations.\nBitGive previously made headlines in October 2017 when it launched its new GiveTrack platform, which uses blockchain technology to clarify and record digital asset donations to global charities. Individuals can trace their funds in real time, and see how their money is spent once an organization receives it. They are also informed of the charity's project results, creating direct engagement between the donor and the receiver.\nBitGive's founder Connie Gallippi explained in a statement:\n\"It's been incredibly rewarding to see our GiveTrack platform gain unabating momentum. Throughout this process, we've discovered numerous opportunities, as well as challenges and barriers, that have helped shape the development of our platform and define crypto-philanthropy. Using this knowledge, in tandem with the bright minds at the University of Edinburgh, BitGive will be delving into how to overcome the roadblocks to effective crypto-philanthropy and establish how cryptocurrency can best be used to uplift and revolutionize the charitable sector.\"\nBitGive and the University of Edinburgh are seeking to uncover the challenges of using and converting cryptocurrencies in third-world countries. To do this, BitGive will analyze data collected from GiveTrack's implementations in nations like Indonesia, Kenya and India to better understand these regions' levels of cryptocurrency acceptance and feasibility.\nIn addition, both organizations are also hoping collected data will shed light on merchant adoption, regulation, and the effects of cryptocurrencies on local governments and cultures in each country.\nResearch partner at the University of Edinburgh Dr. Claudia Pagliari says:\n\"Through their experience of planning and delivering projects using the GiveTrack platform, Connie and her team have gained important insights into how cryptocurrency can be effectively used to support humanitarian efforts in developing countries, as well as some of the challenges involved. Through our research collaboration with BitGive, and meeting key stakeholders, we aim to learn as much as we can about the technical and contextual factors that can ultimately influence the success of these approaches so that this knowledge can be used to inform future programs worldwide.\"\nOpen Mind Africa This week, BitGive also launched its latest charitable project partnership with Open Mind Africa , aiming to raise funds to support a Summer Camp and Educator Summit in Ghana, where students will have \"fantastic opportunities to develop essential social-emotional skills, multiple intelligences, build friendships and make memories that will last a lifetime.\" Now in its second year, the camp is also inviting educators and facilitators from the U.S. and Australia, as well as Ghana.\nOpen Mind Africa was founded on a firm belief that there is a better future for Africa if we promote a quality education rooted in essential skills needed to succeed in school, career and life. Past projects that BitGive has successfully funded and supported in the past include the Maternal & Neonatal India Program , the Chandolo Primary School Water Project and the Shisango Girls School .\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.givetrack.org/view/55/open-mind-africa-2018-summer-camp-educator-summit-ghana", "https://www.bitgivefoundation.org/", "https://www.givetrack.org/view/50/maternal-neonatal-india-program", "https://www.givetrack.org/view/13/chandolo-primary-school-water-project", "https://www.givetrack.org/view/8/shisango-girls-school-example-project"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "connie gallippi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin nonprofit bitgive announces new project and research collaboration shutterstock", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T22:30:49.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c6d1e21e261f90d091b1f2417f1c930ce6a8099", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9P7lfk7pK26FiXHirbs5kKBSXLqIx0rp9tirYrK_OIg0e1Wz1THyFmtYLA1oxPtzvpWxrqSPtrifFBtG3BrduiPdFUdJgq9jQpwOHxSpabf7_Xx0ZTfw8QXIO8roKHks9aevNzf2nAfQ--", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Daily Stock Market Overview, Data Updates, Reports &amp; News - Nasdaq", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2018-05-31T11:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.037, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c6d1e21e261f90d091b1f2417f1c930ce6a8099", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9P7lfk7pK26FiXHirbs5kKBSXLqIx0rp9tirYrK_OIg0e1Wz1THyFmtYLA1oxPtzvpWxrqSPtrifFBtG3BrduiPdFUdJgq9jQpwOHxSpabf7_Xx0ZTfw8QXIO8roKHks9aevNzf2nAfQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Magazine", "published": "2018-05-31T11:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move", "text": "Shutterstock photo\nAfter days of sudden, strong selling, bitcoin has managed to find a local bottom in the low $7000s where it has been drifting around aimlessly. As many traders on Twitter have noted, we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle (outlined in red):\nFigure 1: BTC USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Symmetrical Triangle\nSymmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range ( TR ) - most notable is the volume profile:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Volume Trend\nOverall, the entire volume profile of the symmetrical triangle is sloping downward - this is indicating consolidation in the market. If we look closer at the consolidating volume trend, we can see a few details that are worth noting:\nThe red arrows are pointing out the decrease in volume off the peaks of the rallies. Typically decreasing volume off rally reactions indicates a diminishing pool of supply.\nVice versa, the green arrows are pointing out the increasing volume on the rallies. Increasing volume on rallies shows us there is still a steady amount of demand in the market.\nPoints 1 and 2 together also reveal something about the lows made at the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle: as the market pushes and establishes its lows, we see climactic volume. Climactic volume leading into support is a great sign of supply absorption and hints toward further demand in the market.\nThere is a really strong case for the current symmetrical triangle being a reaccumulation TR that, in the grand scheme of things, is nothing more than a pitstop in an otherwise upward-trending market. A breakout to the top of the symmetrical triangle would have a price target in the $15,000s. However, as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can also break to the downside. If the triangle breaks down, the measured move for the breakout would have us testing the $2000-$3000 price range.\nFor now, the volume is content with continuing to consolidate, but the market is poised for a very strong move that will likely shape the landscape of the market for the next several months. It's impossible to determine when a market will breakout, so all we can do is hedge our bets and wait.\nSummary:\nThe market has been consolidating for months in the form of a symmetrical triangle and is tightly wound for a strong, sustained move.\nThere is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout.\nSymmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T22:30:48.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4bee45473899a326eb77b9e45877bcc757153b34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyLpbutJXWWuPJ4hi7vjjmGHLEvpm4O4EYq8kpg1zLbWbTtBWM8zqL7bg1cvzL9KDqDtmcWIxaSeT6RzDFS1dK_DL8vQShTd4FrwdYxZ64Sikw5V6seAxKbqnrLEWDCmR0q_pAWABKM6YH6c78cSAT0gK1sTssJJ4-", "site_full": "www.brand-e.biz", "site": "brand-e.biz", "site_section": "https://www.brand-e.biz/?format=rss", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "brand-e.biz", "title": "Clinic tackles bitcoin addiction", "title_full": "Clinic tackles bitcoin addiction", "published": "2018-05-31T11:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/548b0006e4b052615d8e673d/58ba9ca7e4fcb597a231e8ce/5b0e7c2603ce644a397b284a/1527754738921/bitcoin-addiction.png?format=1000w", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4bee45473899a326eb77b9e45877bcc757153b34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyLpbutJXWWuPJ4hi7vjjmGHLEvpm4O4EYq8kpg1zLbWbTtBWM8zqL7bg1cvzL9KDqDtmcWIxaSeT6RzDFS1dK_DL8vQShTd4FrwdYxZ64Sikw5V6seAxKbqnrLEWDCmR0q_pAWABKM6YH6c78cSAT0gK1sTssJJ4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "brand-e", "published": "2018-05-31T11:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Clinic tackles bitcoin addiction", "text": "Society\nA UK hospital has launched a rehab programme for those afflicted with bitcoin addiction.

The market looks as if it is reaching towards the $7000 level next, and then perhaps even below there to reach towards the $6000 level. I think short-term rallies continue to show selling opportunities, and that the first signs of exhaustion I think the sellers continue to jump in and punish Bitcoin as it can’t seem to keep its head up. Overall, I believe that the US dollar continues to be one of the strongest currencies in the world, and therefore Bitcoin is going to continue to struggle to gain against the greenback for any significant amount of time. I believe that $8000 will offer a significant amount of resistance and therefore I would be surprised if we break above there in the short term.\nBTC\\/JPY\nBitcoin fell during the trading session against the Japanese yen as well, reaching towards the ¥800,000 level. I believe that the market will break down and go looking towards the bottom of the overall consolidation, which is at the ¥700,000 level. I have no interest in buying this market, and I think that every time we rally us an opportunity to pick up the Japanese yen “on the cheap.” If we can break down below the ¥700,000 level, and I think we will, this market will unwind to the ¥600,000 level rather quickly. I believe that the ¥1 million level above is the “ceiling” in this currency pair, and it makes sense that we will continue to see this pair fall as we have seen so much in the way of negativity when it comes to the entire crypto currency markets.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T15:46:21.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfeaca2d74f4bc8485038cf64d1f0e0fcac81f90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdtoSBFYtQLJh2ljxA8bE5Uk-", "site_full": "siteownersforums.com", "site": "siteownersforums.com", "site_section": "http://siteownersforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=28", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Coldfusion - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "published": "2018-05-31T11:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfeaca2d74f4bc8485038cf64d1f0e0fcac81f90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdtoSBFYtQLJh2ljxA8bE5Uk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HelenShuth", "published": "2018-05-31T11:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW top soft for CAPTCHA's automatic solution\nhttp://www.botmasterlabs.ru/images/recaptchav2.gif\n1.

When bitcoin goes up, so do all other cryptocurrencies. When bitcoin drops so does everything else .\nTo date the crypto markets have simply tended to swim along as one amorphous blob, with the most distinctive anomalies usually being the result of foul play, accidental failure or deliberate price manipulation. Even as bitcoin's market dominance waned the effect stayed strong.\n\"There's a very high correlation between the price of XRP [Ripple] and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies,\" said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse to CNBC.\nHe attributes it to a simple lack of maturity and experience in the market, and the lack of experience that leaves most people unable to differentiate between the use cases of different coins.\n\"It's early, over time you'll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that... It's still a nascent industry, the speculation in the market dominates the trading activity. I think it's a matter of time until people better understand the different use cases.\" A correction\nIt's only a matter of time until the market develops enough to see different use cases being broadly recognised, Garlinghouse says. This will take the form of a wipeout somewhere down the line, in which the coins which don't actually do anything die off.\n\"There's gonna be a bit of a correction along the way here where a lot of the players in the space that don't actually solve a real problem are going to get washed out,\" he said.\nIt seems inevitable, but it also seems a long way off at this point. How long will it take?\nCurrently most of the coins dominating the cryptocurrency markets are all basically the same, and simply intended to be a new kind of digital money.\nBitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are currently functionally identical, varying only in their transfer times and fees.\nRipple and Stellar Lumens stand out because they have a different marketing twist, touting themselves as direct solutions to the unambiguous awfulness of the SWIFT network . That's a nice way to pretend to be some kind of technical tool for solving a specific problem, while still functionally being yet another type of digital cash.\nTheir real uniqueness and problem-solving value comes from their network functions, rather than the token itself, which basically just functions as a kind of placeholder for money. There's no reason why a bank can't simply start using any other cryptocurrency for its own international transfers. Some banks already are in fact, bypassing the SWIFT network and Ripple alike with bitcoin .\nThe washout envisioned by Garlinghouse is probably still a long way off. It's such a novel asset class that people have the inevitably tendency to compare cryptocurrencies to each other, rather than to the legacy systems of the real world.\nMost of the most valuable cryptocurrencies aren't designed to solve real world problems. They're designed to solve bitcoin's problems. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are solidly in this category. Elsewhere there's another huge subset of cryptocurrencies designed to solve Ethereum's problems rather than real world problems. These include EOS, aeternity and basically any other platform whose whitepaper includes the words \"scalability\" and \"smart contract.\" Meanwhile, Stellar was designed to solve Ripple's problems .\nThese days most coins are still wholeheartedly focused on finding new ways of solving each other's problems, and trying to find a way of standing next to the big names. In such an incestuous industry it should be no surprise that bitcoin still dominates everything else.\nThe first coins to break free of bitcoin's shadow will be the ones that can start convincingly solving real world problems. Then they can start being valued in their own right rather than being valued relative to other coins.\nRipple might be making more progress than most though, by actively engaging regulators to push the entire space forward and finally let coins get their feet on the ground in the real world.\n\"Bitcoin may end up being the Napster of digital assets,\" Garlinghouse said . \"It's shown what's possible. But Spotify, iTunes, Pandora engaged the system and regulators, and they ruled the day.\"\nThey ruled the day by putting themselves in a position to solve real problems for users, not by relentlessly focusing on being slightly better than Napster in various specific ways.\nDisclosure: At the time of writing the author holds ETH, IOTA, ICX, VEN, XLM, BTC, XRB Disclaimer: This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering.

He was never going to hang on to peak price, he reckons, so he ended up getting pretty good value.\n\"It's easy to look back and say 'I could have been a millionaire,'\" he said to CoinTelegraph. \"I think it's more important to look at the mindset I had during the pizza transaction, not being that of acquiring an investment, but of making use of a form of currency. If I was looking to hoard coins, I very likely wouldn't have been in the right place at the right time.\"\nHanyecz is happy to have been a part of bitcoin's history, although he's slightly surprised that the pizza thing caught on so widely.\n\"You know, I don't regret it, he said. \"I think that it's great that I got to be part of the early history of Bitcoin in that way, and people know about the pizza and it's an interesting story because everybody can kind of relate to that and be \"Oh my God, you spent all of that money!\"... I've always kind of just wanted people to use Bitcoin and buying the pizza was one way to do that. I didn't think it would get as popular as it has, but it's gotten to be a really catchy story for people.\"\nHanyecz' involvement with early bitcoin didn't start with the pizza though. He also worked with anonymous bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto in the early days, exchanging hundreds of emails with the mysterious figure over the course of a year.\nHis take? It's no coincidence that Satoshi Nakamoto's identity was never discovered. He was a paranoid, weird and thoroughly committed to anonymity.\n\"He or she or whoever it was never told me anything personal,\" Hanyecz said. \"I asked a few questions, but he always dodged them. Those questions never got answered.\"\nThe name had Hanyecz convinced that Nakamoto was a \"slightly eccentric man of Asian descent\" in the words of Business Insider, but it was never confirmed.\nA few people have stepped up to claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto over the years, but one of the most prominent is probably Craig Wright, the billionaire, philanthropist, early bitcoin adopter, alleged fraudster and probable serial liar who almost certainly is not Satoshi Nakamoto .\n\"There were a few times when I got messages that seemed off-base,\" Hanyecz said. \"I brushed them off because I was like, who cares if this guy tells me to go pound sand and go away? This wasn’t my job or anything – it was a hobby. I was trying to be friends with him. He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it 'prerelease,' and I was helping him get it to release.\"\nThat paranoia and secrecy seems very well founded now.\n\"If anything had happened to the code early on, we wouldn’t be having this conversation today,\" Hanyecz said.\nPlus, Nakamoto's secrecy and mysteriousness almost certainly helped bitcoin take off. Not only did it help the project take off, and get too big too fail before anyone had the chance to stomp it out, but it also adds an undeniable allure to bitcoin.\nAs they say, never meet your heroes. Although \"gods\" might be more appropriate in the case of bitcoin and its near-religious significance .\nNakamoto was also prescient enough to recognise the enormous riches that potentially awaited early miners, and didn't seem too thrilled by it, sometimes chiding Hanyecz on his mining pursiots.\n\"He said, \"Well, I’d rather not have you do the mining too much,'\" Hanyecz said. \"He was trying to grow the community and get more commerce use cases. He fully recognised that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.\"\nIt doesn't really matter who created it though, Hanyecz said. What they created it more important.\n\"It’s exciting because people love a man of mystery, but I try to steer people towards the fact that it doesn’t matter who made it; he could be a psycho killer,\" Hanyecz said. \"People like to identify with heroes or villains, but in the cryptosphere, your code has to speak for itself. Charisma and being an interesting person only gets you so far when you’re a developer. Ultimately, you’ll be judged on the quality of your code and your idea.\"\nDisclosure: At the time of writing the author holds ETH, IOTA, ICX, VEN, XLM, BTC, XRB Disclaimer: This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering.

In just a 12-month period, the combined value of all virtual currencies added together rose from $17.7 billion to roughly $613 billion -- a gain of more than 3,300%. By comparison, it would have taken the stock market decades to generate the returns that virtual coins dished out in just one year.\nThis article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.\nWait, bitcoin can go down in value?\nHowever, 2018 has been a completely different story . Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, shed more than half of its value in just a one-month span toward the beginning of the year, and it's struggled to recover ever since.\nWhat's behind bitcoin's struggles, you ask? Part of the blame can be assigned to a step-up in regulation. Investors tend to appreciate the anonymity and unregulated nature of virtual currencies. However, in South Korea, a market that's critical to the success of bitcoin and digital currencies in general, new laws in place require banks to verify the identity of their members before linking their bank accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges. This newfound transparency likely goes a long way to validating bitcoin as an asset, but it's not been viewed as a positive by some within the crypto community.\nBitcoin's woes may also be partially blamed on what I refer to as the proof-of-concept conundrum associated with blockchain technology . Blockchain -- the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that underlies most cryptocurrencies and is responsible for logging all data in a secure and unchanging manner -- has proven its worth in numerous small-scale projects, but has yet to catch on in the real world. Until businesses are willing to give this technology a shot, and blockchain can demonstrate its ability to scale, it'll remain constrained.\nMore recently, though, legal concerns have held back bitcoin.\nAre traders manipulating the price of bitcoin?\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it was opening up a criminal probe into whether cryptocurrency traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and Ethereum for financial gain. The DOJ will be working side by side with the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which currently handles all derivatives trading tied to bitcoin.\nThe DOJ believes that bitcoin is susceptible to fraud for a number of reasons, as listed by Bloomberg . In particular, regulators question whether cryptocurrency exchanges have adequate measures in place to actively pursue those folks who attempt to cheat the system. They also point to the wild volatility in digital currencies as a lure for cheaters who are looking to manipulate the system. Lastly, the aforementioned lack of regulations could make it considerably easier for traders to move virtual coins like bitcoin.\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, regulators are looking into two specific types of manipulation: spoofing and wash-sale trades.\nSpoofing involves a trader, or group of traders, placing an order that creates a new best bid or adds to the perceived liquidity of an asset. Shortly thereafter, the trader(s) will then cancel their initial bid (the spoof) and place a trade on the opposite side of the market. This is done so a trader can sell their stake in an asset, but at an improved sales price thanks to their spoofed bid, which may have offered the perception of downside liquidity and/or support and encouraged other traders to bid up the price of an asset. The same can be done in reverse, with spoofed asks, ultimately allowing the trader(s) to net a more attractive purchase price on an asset.\nOn the other hand, a wash-sale would involve an individual, or group of traders, buying and selling an asset with themselves in the hope of pushing its price higher and giving off the perception of improved liquidity.\nIn this photo illustration, a visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin sits on US mobile payment company Circle application in Paris, France, Feb. 27, 2018. Photo: Chesnot/Getty Images Given how little regulation surrounds most decentralized crypto exchanges, spoofing and wash-sale trades may very well both be occurring, but we won't have any confirmation on that until the DOJ's investigation wraps up, which could take some time.\nYet another reason to avoid bitcoin\nIt's become pretty evident as time has passed that bitcoin, while being an incredible creator of wealth over the past couple of years, is rife with risk. In addition to potentially being manipulated by cryptocurrency traders, bitcoin's network has slowed to a crawl , relative to its peers.\nAccording to an analysis of transaction speed per second conducted by HowMuch.net, bitcoin peaks at a meager seven transactions per second. By comparison, leading global payments processor Visa can handle up to 24,000 transactions per second using its existing infrastructure.\nBitcoin's block-processing time of approximately 10 minutes also tends to be substantially longer than its peers, resulting in an average validation and settlement time of 78 minutes. Sure, this is still quicker than sending funds across borders using traditional banking networks, but it's substantially slower than practically all of its peers. Though the Lightning Network is supposed to resolve bitcoin's scaling issues, the damage may already be done.\nWhat damage you ask? We've witnessed a small handful of merchants moving away from bitcoin as a medium of exchange due to its slow network. Payment processor Stripe, which was the very first major company to accept bitcoin in 2014, dropped bitcoin as a payment method last month.\nAnd, just to round things out, there aren't any traditional fundamental metrics with which to value bitcoin. Unlike a stock, which has income statements, balance sheets, earnings reports, and management commentary that can be scoured, bitcoin offers nothing more than transaction speed and average daily transaction count, which tell us absolutely nothing about its long-term staying power.\nAs amazing as the gains have been, the writing appears to be on the wall to avoid bitcoin.\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned.

Peter said he thinks we’re seeing a lot of movement in a number of markets that are counter to the long-term trends. For instance, oil dropped late last week, but he expects its long-term trend to continue upward. The dollar has picked up strength, but the broader trend is toward a weaker dollar. And bond yields fell, but the overall trajectory for interest rates is up.\nHighlights from the Podcast “I think this is more technical noise. I don’t think the uptrend in the price of oil has changed based on this pullback from 73 now to 67 and a half. Maybe we have a little bit more downside but if you look at the chart, you can barely see the decline... I’m still bullish on oil.”\n“It’s not a coincidence that both [bond] yields and oil prices are falling at the same time because they rose at the same time, which also makes sense. If inflation is driving up oil prices, then inflation should also be driving up interest rates. And that’s exactly what we’ve been experiencing in these markets. And just as I think the upward trend in oil is intact, I think the upward trend in interest rates is intact.”\n“I think the dollar is going to run into some resistance. I thought it might have already happened. Maybe it’s going to go a little higher, but to me, the primary trend is down. We are in a bear market. The bear market started in January of last year, but there’s always corrections in every market, whether it’s bull or bear. In this case, if I’m right, this is early in a dollar bear, this is one of the first corrections - the correction being the up-move, and it’s sowing the seeds of its own destruction.”\n“I think the renewed optimism about the Fed hiking rates, I think, will soon give way to the new reality that they’re almost finished raising rates, and they’re not going to be able to raise rates nearly as much as the markets once believed.”\n“Bitcoin has probably lost more value this week than any of the emerging market currencies.”\n“The cryptos currencies did not do what they are marketed to do. This is when they’re supposed to shine, right? If you’re in an emerging market and your currency is going down, you’re supposed to buy the cryptos as a hedge. But that’s not happening. I mean, maybe somebody did buy Bitcoin as a hedge, but the hedge didn’t work out. If somebody sold their fiat currency on Monday and bought into Bitcoin, they jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire, because chances are Bitcoin went down by more than the currency they were worried about.”\n“What’s interesting about this decline that we’ve had (in Bitcoin) is that there hasn’t been any big panic. It’s just been a slow meltdown. And there have been plenty of rallies along the way, but they sell into every rally and it’s just a slow erosion of the price of Bitcoin.”\n“Overall, the immediate effect of tariffs would be to raise the cost of cars, and that is not going to bode well politically, so I don’t think the tariffs are going to happen.”\n“The question is, what does more damage to the economy? The deficits or the tariffs? Because they both do damage. I mean personally, I would think that the deficits would actually do more damage, but that damage is more long term. The more immediate damage is probably the taxes, right? Because we have some immediate benefit to the economy of the tax cuts, long term we’re going to have problems. The tax cuts are going to be a net negative because they led to bigger deficits, which, in the long run, are a bigger problem for the economy than the tax cuts are a solution. But the same thing would apply if we had tariffs.”\n“Every time there is a government program, it’s here forever.”\n“I want taxes as in your face as possible, so when a politician raises taxes, the taxpayers immediately see it and they know that they’re the ones paying it, because then politicians will be less like to pass a tax that’s going to hit in a very obvious way their constituents.”\n“My dad always described government aid as being a blood transfusion from your right arm to your left arm and you spill half the blood on the floor.”\n“And the point is, had 10 or 20 people died in this restaurant, it would have been a huge story. It would have been all over the news. And what would the consequence had been? ‘We need to ban guns.’ And at the very least, we need more gun control. But you would have had a lot of people coming out saying, ‘We need to ban guns! Guns kill! We need to outlaw guns!’ Well, in this case, guns didn’t kill, unless you count the shooter. Guns saved lives. These guns saved the lives of all the people in that restaurant who might otherwise have been shot had these other people not had guns to intervene.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/oavVcT8fJ9M"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter schiff potpourri", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bonds", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "peter schiff", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "peter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T09:52:04.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7114634e87edac68d23000b4bebdb3e256c3cf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJMA.lAzkjZvgi2EkgDF.XjDpc8FgsGjsOIUQDWbjgNL.DuyhWGMNj.y3FZQO5YQr910ioV0BG.Q--", "site_full": "boards.straightdope.com", "site": "straightdope.com", "site_section": "https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/forumdisplay.php?f=3", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "General Questions - Straight Dope Message Board", "title": "What is a computer doing when mining for Bitcoin?", "title_full": "What is a computer doing when mining for Bitcoin? - Straight Dope Message Board", "published": "2018-05-31T10:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6804, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7114634e87edac68d23000b4bebdb3e256c3cf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJMA.lAzkjZvgi2EkgDF.XjDpc8FgsGjsOIUQDWbjgNL.DuyhWGMNj.y3FZQO5YQr910ioV0BG.Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whack-a-Mole", "published": "2018-05-31T10:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is a computer doing when mining for Bitcoin?", "text": "I am not trying to be a crypto miner but I am trying to understand what, exactly, is happening when a computer is trying to mine Bitcoin.\nVaguely I have heard it is trying to solve a cryptographic problem but I am unclear on what that is.\nIs it simply trying a string of hashes to match to a given hash?

To solve this problem, the authority proposes the introduction of a three-tier structure to facilitate market access for small-scale platforms: \"MAS has observed the emergence of new business models in transactional platforms, including commercial facilities using Blockchain technology or platforms that enable P2P exchange without the participation of intermediaries. [...] As the current RMO regime has existed since 2002, the regulatory framework for market actors needs to be revised to ensure that they continue to meet the requirements of a changing landscape\" we can read in the official report.\nIn particular, the level 3 of the proposed rules apply to market participants that are significantly smaller than well-established stock exchanges. Its purpose is to enable the implementation of Blockchain and P2P technology and the introduction of services in the supervised environment: \"This new level is aimed at facilitating new market participants who develop solutions for wholesale market participants or business entities who have left the sandbox and are profitable, but whose enterprises are unable to meet the requirements of the existing RMO system\" - explains MAS.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The price is about to test the golden trend line from below around the level of $7,700. In a case of a breakout, the next target for bulls is seen at the level of $7,890 and $7,977. The immediate support is seen at the level of $7,435, the key support is still at swing low at the level of $6,984. The growing bullish divergence between the price and the momentum oscillator supports the bullish outlook.

However, some fear it is now in danger of getting left behind by the hottest emerging asset class – cryptocurrency. One of the main reasons for this appears to be the dominance of the big banks over the UK economy.\nBanks Hindering Progress Despite having a thriving fintech startups scene, an established trading ecosystem and a leading role in the traditional fiat currencies market, London appears to be missing the boat with regards to the rush of institutional money flowing into crypto finance. Locations such as Tokyo, Chicago, New York and even San Francisco are taking the lead with regards to regulated platforms, OTC and hedge funds, as well as exchange-traded derivatives such as futures. And many people in the industry believe this is mainly due to the outsize influence that the banks have in the City. “Banks have been unusually strict in dealings with crypto,” Max Boonen, a former Goldman Sachs trader and current CEO of B2C2, a London cryptocurrency market maker, told FT . “It’s nearly impossible to open an account for crypto in the UK. The problem is that in the UK there is a perception that banks have issues with anti-money laundering and decided to be a lot more conservative.” And David Mercer, CEO of LMAX, an FCA regulated FX trading venue which recently announced a physical cryptocurrency exchange dedicated to serving just institutional clients, expects UK banks would only join the market next year. “London is very bank-driven and we see it as being a late adopter,” he explained.\nNot Too Late? There are also factors that support London’s position in the crypto market, such as CFD brokers like IG Group and Plus500 achieving success with retail traders as well as Barclays agreeing to open an account for Coinbase. Additionally, there are those that think that the matter is overstated. “The City of London, taken as a whole, has the collective experience to make considered and forward-thinking decisions. This experience manifests itself in many ways, from the efficiency of trade execution to KYC & AML regulations and from the strength of our legal system to our culture of effective corporate governance. These reasons are why London dominates the international foreign exchange markets, and it is unthinkable that the City will not continue to be a dominant player in crypto markets,” commented to news.Bitcoin.com Nauman Anees, Co-founder of Think Coin, a multi-asset financial & cryptocurrency trading exchange. Anees added: “London is the dominant player in global financial markets thanks to the strength of its regulatory infrastructure and position as a gateway & conduit between every key global market – and while the crypto markets are novel in many ways, these key contextual advantages still apply. Moreover, events in recent years show the crypto space is one where ‘first mover advantage’ does not apply. Repeated hacks of key exchanges along with the slow pace of international regulation has meant that many ‘early adopters’ have not been positioned to fully develop and grow with the market, meaning that a more cautious approach will likely prove to pay the biggest dividends later. That said, the idea that there is a corporate resistance to crypto adoption in London is misguided. Most of the major investment banks have opened crypto desks, and the ones which haven’t already announced are undoubtedly experimenting behind the scenes.” How should London ensure that the crypto revolution does not pass it by?

That could be coming to an end as markets begin to understand the major differences between cryptocurrencies and their use cases, says Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. “It’s early, over time you’ll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that,” Garlinghouse says.\nCryptocurrency prices have been highly correlated with bitcoin, the first and most famous out of thousands that exist. But that could end soon as markets start to acknowledge the differences between these assets, according to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.\n“There’s a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies,” Garlinghouse told CNBC’s “Power Lunch” Wednesday. “It’s early, over time you’ll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that.”\nRipple is the name of the San Francisco-based company developing a network for faster global financial payments, while XRP is the name of the digital token that financial institutions on the network can use to transact quickly. The company itself had a record first quarter, signing 20 production contracts with new firms, Garlinghouse said. Ripple announced a deal with the largest bank in Kuwait on Wednesday, adding to companies like MoneyGram that are already testing XRP for cross-border payments.\nYet in that same time period, XRP lost 70 percent of its value and was the worst performer among the top digital currencies. The entire sector took a beating in the first quarter, and the market capitalization for cryptocurrencies fell by more than 50 percent, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin lost roughly 50 percent in those three months.\n“It’s still a nascent industry, the speculation in the market dominates the trading activity,” Garlinghouse said. “I think it’s a matter of time until people better understand the different use cases.”\nThere are more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The CEO predicted that 99 percent of those digital assets won’t exist in 10 years.\n“There’s gonna be a bit of a correction along the way here where a lot of the players in the space that don’t actually solve a real problem are going to get washed out,” he said.\nNot only do some cryptocurrencies have no proven use case, they have been accused of fleecing investors through a fundraising process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO. The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned of pump-and-dump schemes, shut multiple down, and recently charged one backed by Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khalid with fraud.\n“The SEC is getting involved as they should because there have been frauds committed,” Garlinghouse said. “We have been an advocate of yes the government should get involved, the government should be protecting investors and companies but there’s also examples of real utility.\nThe issue of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security has been a major focus for the financial watchdog. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton made it clear in March that all ICOs constitute securities. But Ripple has maintained that the XRP cryptocurrency should be categorized differently. Garlinghouse pointed out a few differences between XRP and classic securities, like stocks.\n“If you own XRP, you don’t own rights to the profits or any dividends to the company,” he said. “XRP has real utility.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "garlinghouse",

That’s the message of a Global Times editorial, which praises the digital currency. “There’s an increasing belief that just saying no to Bitcoin won’t be the eventual solution to the cryptocurrency issue,” writes Xiao Xin, author of the editorial. “A more fundamental approach would be to embrace the new technology without putting the country’s financial system at stake.”\nThis approach is a signal that Beijing is getting ready to tighten regulations around the digital currency, as U.S., Japan and Korea have done,rather than ban it altogether.\nAnd that could be bullish for Bitcoin prices, which have been all over in recent months. Regulating Bitcoin is certainly better than an outright ban.\nThe Global Times’ editorial comes months after Beijing banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading, crushing Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies—see table.\nCoin/Investment Trust Change 24H* Bitcoin (BTC) -9.66% Ethereum (ETH) -11.22 Litecoin (LTC) -16.92 BitConnect -7.81 *Friday September 7, 2017\nSource: Coinranking.com\n[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin.]\nThat was just the beginning rather than the end of growing efforts by big governments around the world to turn Bitcoin back into what itonce was—an exotic currency for the tech savvy and romantic radicals, as was discussed in a previous piece here .\nTo be fair Chinese and other governments, big and small, have a couple of good reasons to regulate the process of creating and exchanging cryptocurrencies. Like the protection of the public from market manipulation, and the ensuring of financial stability.\nThat’s something governments have been doing for years with conventional financial products and instruments. Why not with cryptocurrencies?\nBut shutting off ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges altogether, as China did, reaches beyond traditional regulation. It questions the very legitimacy of Bitcoin as a currency.\nWhy? Because it undermines the monopoly of government and the banking system on creating money and credit.\nChina more than any other country wants to have firm control of its banking system, and allocate credit according to a political agenda. This means that a competing currency like Bitcoin would threaten its political system. Why not crush it sooner than later?\nBut crushing Bitcoin could also crush innovation, something China badly needs as it prepares to make the Great Leap Forward from copying foreign technology to developing its own.\nBesides, banning Bitcoin trade in China won’t stop Bitcoin. It will just leave the country behind in the digital currency revolution. As Xiao Xin puts it, “fencing off bitcoin exchanges can’t effectively end Bitcoin trade, and fears of a Bitcoin bubble will leave China behind in the digital currency revolution.”\nAnd the digital revolution is what can help China make the transition from an emerging to a developed country.\nThat’s why Beijing seems to be having second thoughts on banning Bitcoin. I wouldn’t be surprised if the ban is lifted in the near future.\nGallery The Richest Person In Every State 2018 Launch Gallery 51 images", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1104753.shtml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiao xin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global times", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T10:05:43.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09ca37fd40e1a505324b2d7796c75c2272829edd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMp8M8SPX82PwFEpR._PNb2Sw0GTvqPb3ALKq0bZ8EMz4R7gpl7IqMNPaliDxHLpx69VsmQcbK7Xmk68RLqlFZ22", "site_full": "thenubiantimes.com", "site": "thenubiantimes.com", "site_section": "http://thenubiantimes.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Nubian Times", "title": "Bitcoin junkies offered therapy for addiction", "title_full": "Bitcoin junkies offered therapy for addiction", "published": "2018-05-31T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thenubiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "09ca37fd40e1a505324b2d7796c75c2272829edd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMp8M8SPX82PwFEpR._PNb2Sw0GTvqPb3ALKq0bZ8EMz4R7gpl7IqMNPaliDxHLpx69VsmQcbK7Xmk68RLqlFZ22", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Editor", "published": "2018-05-31T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin junkies offered therapy for addiction", "text": "Bitcoin junkies offered therapy for addiction Bitcoin junkies offered therapy for addiction By Editor • May 31, 2018\nCryptocurrency junkies who become hooked on trading virtual money can now get treatment at an addiction centre in the Scottish Borders.\nCastle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire has created a course of residential treatment for ‘crypto addicts’ to deal with the underlying issues and learn to live without Bitcoin and its rivals.\nExperts say the trading of digital currencies or assets such as Bitcoin can become a behavioural addiction.

Soon after that, the place was overrun with miners. Initially, there seems to be nothing really special about the gradually degrading industrial park in Saint-­Hyacinthe, Quebec. Located about 60 miles to the east of Montreal, this industrial park has the air filled with the scent of cacao being roasted from a massive chocolate factory nearby. The scene is filled with vacated offices and tractor trailers on the roads. There are other stores, warehouses, and laboratories, but nothing looks cutting edge. A lot of them have received a plastic sheeting showing that they are closed. The only sign of life you get is when you stand close to a building. There is a persistent hum from all the buildings. Each of those buildings is filled with thousands of computers. Each of them is dedicated to doing one single task over and over again, day after day. These computers belong to Bitfarms. It is one of North America’s largest cryptocurrency mining operation. Each of these crypto-mining rigs eats up a huge amount of power and generate massive amounts of heat in order to mine for bitcoins. Worthless puzzles. Cryptocurrencies are fundamentally energy intensive. They have a huge decentralized and globally distributed ledger that needs massive amounts of computation to maintain. Let alone the last of mining for bitcoins. About every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network generates a new coin as a proof of work for verifying a block of the transaction. The resource-intensive nature of bitcoins is based on the fundamental lack of trust between the participants in the bitcoin network. Besides requiring electricity for the generation of coins and the maintenance of the network, there is a massive cost attached to cooling these mining rigs too. Without a doubt, electricity is the cheapest form of energy available right now, and also the most easily accessible. From where we get this electricity matters. One of the reasons China had a mining boom is because coal is cheap in China and hence the electricity is available at a lower cost. But coal is the dirtiest form of energy. China’s contribution to climate change is simply not ignorable. The hydroelectric power being used in Canada is undeniably cleaner but does not come without consequences. The cost of hydroelectricity Hydroelectricity energy is generated by rotating turbines with the flow of water. This means that you have to hold water of a certain amount and at a certain altitude to generate that much force. This means having to clear out acres of land and using the area as a water reserve. This means that you are basically destroying forest land, homes of animals, and destroying entire ecosystems. This is just as bad as releasing carbon dioxide into the air. Maybe the scale is smaller. Blockchain hurts Researchers have been calculating how much carbon the facility would release if the blockchain operations would continue. Yearly, it would generate over 9,000 kilotons of carbon, along with 150 kilotons of methane. The latter is an even more deadly greenhouse gas. Moreover, in winter, the temperature in Quebec remains -20 °C for some days. Researchers will analyze the effect of blockchain on winter temperatures and may suspend the mining activities for energy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network#Energy_consumption"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hydropower energy operation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saint-­hyacinthe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T10:26:44.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7892499fbd3d05d6718a73aa160c1e7d3df2db4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSuqbox6T2R2WbuFNVeYCVUPrMJXeheAPC7_7WbipgR5R1AsGFbKoT2berQ_dHR1pw-", "site_full": "www.mt5.com", "site": "mt5.com", "site_section": "https://uncumaison.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "\"Forex Analysis and Reviews\" RSS feed", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for 31/05/2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for 31/05/2018", "published": "2018-05-31T09:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10090, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7892499fbd3d05d6718a73aa160c1e7d3df2db4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSuqbox6T2R2WbuFNVeYCVUPrMJXeheAPC7_7WbipgR5R1AsGFbKoT2berQ_dHR1pw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T09:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for 31/05/2018", "text": "Ichimoku cloud indicator analysis of USDX for May 31, 2018 Technical analysis on Gold for May 31, 2018 Forex Analysis: 31 May 2018, 04:53 UTC+00 recommend Bitcoin analysis for 31/05/2018\nSingapore's Monetary Office (MAS), the de facto central bank of a city-state, proposes changes to existing laws that would facilitate the entry of decentralized Blockchain-based exchanges.\nAccording to the published document, MAS claims that the current, single-level legal framework of \"recognized market entities\" (RMO) is not able to meet the demand for new business models based on new technologies. To solve this problem, the authority proposes the introduction of a three-tier structure to facilitate market access for small-scale platforms: \"MAS has observed the emergence of new business models in transactional platforms, including commercial facilities using Blockchain technology or platforms that enable P2P exchange without the participation of intermediaries. [...] As the current RMO regime has existed since 2002, the regulatory framework for market actors needs to be revised to ensure that they continue to meet the requirements of a changing landscape\" we can read in the official report.\nIn particular, the level 3 of the proposed rules apply to market participants that are significantly smaller than well-established stock exchanges. Its purpose is to enable the implementation of Blockchain and P2P technology and the introduction of services in the supervised environment: \"This new level is aimed at facilitating new market participants who develop solutions for wholesale market participants or business entities who have left the sandbox and are profitable, but whose enterprises are unable to meet the requirements of the existing RMO system\" - explains MAS.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The price is about to test the golden trend line from below around the level of $7,700. In a case of a breakout, the next target for bulls is seen at the level of $7,890 and $7,977. The immediate support is seen at the level of $7,435, the key support is still at swing low at the level of $6,984.

On the downside, a break below $7,330 may push BTC/USD toward the other direction to the $7,200 level,” it said\nBTC dominates the total market capitalization by occupying 38.4% of the current total market cap of $328 billion.\nOn December 17 th , BTC hit at a value of around $20,000.\nIt’s anyone’s guess where this s going, but addicts can now seek treatment.\nRead: Bitcoin is here to remind you that it is falling again, losing $18bn in 24hrs\nFirst the Slide\nCoindesk said recently that BTC risks falling to the key support level of $6,900, having failed to capitalize on signs of weakening bearish momentum.\nBTC hit a 7-week low of $7,040 Tuesday, 3.5% down in 24 hours, with losses signalling a continuation of the sell-off from the recent May 5 high of $9,990 and indicate scope for a drop to $6,900, “a level that the bulls need to defend at all cost. If they can’t, prices may go as low as $5,000.”\nAccording to FXStreet, several players are expecting to see strong renewed sentiment, once BTC/USD drops within the $6000 price region. “Any pressure further to the downside through $5000-6500 areas, could really send Bitcoin free-falling south,” it said.\nManipulation?\nAccording to the globalcoinreport, it is no secret that plenty of traders have speculated manipulation.\n“Besides, there is no regulation to protect against it in the crypto-verse in the first place and therefore, it is a free for all or whoever has the might to orchestrate a market coup.\nThese type of manipulations can only be done by institutional investors, large-scale traders and any other large entity that can do this,” said globalcoinreport.\nA Market Manipulation Theory by CCN, an industry site, claims a group of cryptocurrency researchers and traders suggested that the Bitcoin price has began to fall from its all-time high at around $20,000, on the same day the bitcoin futures market of CME and CBOE launched.\n“The group of traders claimed that through the futures market, institutional investors and large-scale retail traders manipulated the market to cash out short contracts by purchasing and selling massive amounts of Bitcoin in a correlated manner,” said CCN.\nVIDEO: Fundstrat’s Tom Lee sees Bitcoin at $25,000 by year end\nBTC to stabilize decades from now\nAccording to UK’s Express, Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, said it could be decades before BTC has a stable price.\nSpeaking to Express.co.uk, Greenspan said: “I don’t think the volatility is going to go away any time soon, especially since we still have a lot of Bitcoin ‘whales’ or people who are involved in Bitcoin early on who have amounted a large amount stockpile.\n“Once you see more distribution and more liquidity in the market, I believe we can then have a much more stable price fluctuation.”\nFrom October to December 2017, the value of BTC soared from $4,309 to $19,304 – a 450% climb.\nRead: Bitcoin flirting with $10,000: Here’s what’s triggering this\nBTC addiction/treatment\nFX street revealed that Cryptocurrency adherers who become addicted to trading virtual money can get treatment at Castle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, an addiction center that has developed a specialized course for ‘crypto addicts’ to help them to learn how to live without Bitcoin and other digital assets.\nNouriel Roubini, a famous Bitcoin critic, was quoted by FX street as saying on his Twitter account “Most crypto zealots have the symptoms of drug addiction & lunatic delusion of instant wealth that leads to mental/financial ruin.”\nBut could the BTC fad be fading?\n“The overall interest in cryptocurrency jobs also seems to bottom out. Fewer companies have Bitcoin or other crypto-related job offerings. This is in stark contrast to the blockchain-oriented job openings, which do not suffer from this same decline,” said FX street.\n“Additionally, the overall Google Search Trend for cryptocurrency has also taken a big dip. In late 2017, the global interest in cryptocurrency sparked all of a sudden. Given the price increases at that time, it was only normal. However, this year has been pretty different, and the Google Trends are following the price trend as of right now. Lower interest in cryptocurrency usually results in lower prices.” Previous Story", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T10:27:14.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de5e1b441039408a83c60b723fcf18c9c82311db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTtM_tZ0uulYRKqb1lHf_Vm025MCyScY7B0bMtkkwkLkZL568hNgVwu31b5Kr14xYlB67oPZ8WB_qHdODwIbOH3XEvo0drcVwLuYpVIqzG5eR.xhUYfI73IrWEaXoh6Y3gOg8FQ9ysXIw--", "site_full": "www.bitinvestors.club", "site": "bitinvestors.club", "site_section": "https://www.bitinvestors.club/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BitInvestors.Club | Invest Securely On BitCoins, Altcoins, Forex And More", "title": "51% Attack: Bitcoin Gold Hack Shows 51% Attack Is Real", "title_full": "51% Attack: Bitcoin Gold Hack Shows 51% Attack Is Real", "published": "2018-05-31T09:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de5e1b441039408a83c60b723fcf18c9c82311db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTtM_tZ0uulYRKqb1lHf_Vm025MCyScY7B0bMtkkwkLkZL568hNgVwu31b5Kr14xYlB67oPZ8WB_qHdODwIbOH3XEvo0drcVwLuYpVIqzG5eR.xhUYfI73IrWEaXoh6Y3gOg8FQ9ysXIw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Samuel Asingba (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T09:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "51% Attack: Bitcoin Gold Hack Shows 51% Attack Is Real", "text": "Up until recently, a 51% attack on bitcoin was considered an impossibility.\nIncreasingly, however, the attack, which involves a hacker gaining control of a majority of systems on bitcoin’s network and altering transactions on its blockchain, is becoming a plausible reality.\nThe latest proof of this comes from bitcoin gold, a bitcoin fork which began trading on exchanges last year. According to a post on one of the cryptocurrency's forums, the hacker is targeting exchanges that trade bitcoin gold.\n“We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits,” Edward Iskra, BTG’s communications director, wrote.\nThe hacker could attempt to double-spend stolen coins from an exchange by exchanging them into fiat currency or another crypto and using the same coins from his or her wallet to buy more crypto.\nThe online publication Bitcoinist estimates that the hacker stole $18 million worth of bitcoin gold.\nNot even the first 51% attack Bitcoin gold is the latest crypto to suffer from a 51% attack. The Verge has reportedly suffered three 51% attacks this year. The latest one occurred yesterday. Last week, a hacker exploited a vulnerability that had caused the previous 51% attack to decamp with $35 million worth of its cryptocurrency.\nAccording to recent research, the costs for hacking cryptocurrencies are declining. This is partly due to the increasing number of forks within cryptocurrencies. For example, according to a recent post on Medium an average of $70 million is required to cripple ethereum classic’s blockchain.\nThat amount can easily be generated by using profits generated from mining ethereum, a cryptocurrency that uses the same algorithm. The same post estimated a cost of $200,000 to instigate a 51% attack on bitcoin gold.\nBut Iskra's post suggests that sustaining such an attack for a long period of time could turn out to be expensive for the hackers.\n\"The cost of mounting an ongoing attack is high. Because the cost is high, the attacker can only profit if they can quickly get something of high value from a fake deposit. A party like an Exchange may accept large deposits automatically, allow the user to trade into a different coin quickly, and then withdraw automatically. This is why they are targeting Exchanges,\" he wrote.\nA separate blog post on BTG’s site outlined a series of steps that the cryptocurrency's developers intend to take in order to make it hack-proof. These include upgrading its network to an Equihash algorithm, which is a customized Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm that does not require as much processing power as the current algorithm.\nThe cryptocurrency is also developing an ASIC-resistant network to ensure that only large machines do not dominate its network.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edward iskra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T09:49:04.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "799c6816028ea5dec9808a6b48b5cf647b6fdf19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgwqWcSeYmpMU.cQyjkXBDWatY3k3080OhkojYCdvnOv1._huF_.qhzLOCUY1AZe0b", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "The Humanitarian Side of Bitcoin", "title_full": "The Humanitarian Side of Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T09:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "799c6816028ea5dec9808a6b48b5cf647b6fdf19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgwqWcSeYmpMU.cQyjkXBDWatY3k3080OhkojYCdvnOv1._huF_.qhzLOCUY1AZe0b", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-31T09:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Humanitarian Side of Bitcoin", "text": "Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters Health + Tech /31 May 2018 As many have rightly pointed out, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally represent a shift in how society and individuals view and value currency and the philosophy behind transactions, whilst the Blockchain technology that supports them has the potential to revolutionize trade and create a truly mutual […] The post The Humanitarian Side of Bitcoin appeared first on Internet Do.\n[ Please, visit website http://internetdo.com ] ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "humanitarian side of bitcoin carlos garcia rawlins/reuters health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T09:45:59.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70c19c0c9ffad65ca2d4911c4379faeb107b0b25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vnKLFHPNpYnaCURBWmGJGk1mRUNJLECVvqYLSj2yEsOUFRMQnLdZmNpp.UeGu5Pzbi9hvV.YqZA--", "site_full": "www.mobypicture.com", "site": "mobypicture.com", "site_section": "http://www.mobypicture.com/rss/public.rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Mobypicture.com public timeline", "title": "cryptopositive: A Guide to Bitcoin", "title_full": "cryptopositive: A Guide to Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T09:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://b0.img.mobypicture.com/p-0683c368cd6d197c2a2431047d0d6d0d8_large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11602, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70c19c0c9ffad65ca2d4911c4379faeb107b0b25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vnKLFHPNpYnaCURBWmGJGk1mRUNJLECVvqYLSj2yEsOUFRMQnLdZmNpp.UeGu5Pzbi9hvV.YqZA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T09:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "cryptopositive: A Guide to Bitcoin", "text": "26 minutes ago A Guide to Bitcoin CryptoPositive provide cryptocurrency guide for beginners and people who would like to start with bitcoin.

Bitcoin - Thursday, May 31, 2018. Submitted by Helen A. Ruf .\nAs the world's present front runner within the Crypto Currency industry place, Bitcoin come about to be producing some substantial headlines, and a few serious fluctuations inside the final six months. Just about everybody has heard of them, and pretty much completely everybody has an opinion. Some can not fathom the notion that a currency with any value may be created from absolutely nothing, though some appreciate the idea that some issue without having Government manage could be traded as a significant entity in its personal best.\nSpecifically exactly where you sit on the \"Should I Acquire Bitcoin?\" fence possibly in the end boils down to a single query: Can I Earn income from Bitcoin?\nAre you able to Produce earnings from Bitcoin?\nIn just the final six months, we've got observed the worth go from $20 a coin in February, up to $260 a coin in April, back down to $60 in March, and back as substantially as $130 in May possibly probably. The price tag tag has now settled to around $100 a Bitcoin, but what requires spot next is anyone's guess.\nBitcoin's future in the end rests on two main variables: its adoption as a currency by a wide audience, and also the absence of prohibitive Government intervention.\nThe Verge Coin neighborhood is escalating swiftly, interest inside the Crypto currency has spread drastically on the net, and new services are accepting Bitcoin payments increasingly. Blogging giant, WordPress, accepts Bitcoin payments, and African based mobile application provider, Kipochi, have designed a Bitcoin wallet that could permit Bitcoin payments on mobile phones in building nations.\nWe've currently observed folks today make millions around the currency. We're seeing increasing numbers of people today experimenting with living only on Bitcoin for months on end, while recording the practical experience for documentary viewing.\nYou may invest in a takeaway in Boston, coffee in London, and also some vehicles on Craigslist utilizing Bitcoin. Searches for Bitcoin have rocketed in 2013, with April's hike and subsequent fall inside the Bitcoin price. Final week the initial huge acquisition of a Bitcoin corporation was designed for SatoshiDice, a web-based gambling world-wide-web web-site, for 126,315 BTC (about $11.47 million), by an undisclosed purchaser.\nThis fast development in awareness and uptake appears set to continue, if trust inside the currency remains powerful. Which leads to the second dependency. Government regulation.\nWhile specifically designed to carry out independently from Government manage, Bitcoin will inevitably be impacted by Governments in some way. This ought to be the case for two factors.\nFirstly, to attain greater levels of adoption, Bitcoin will have to turn out to be accessible to huge numbers of persons today, and that implies spreading beyond the realms of hidden transactions to normal every day transactions for men and women and firms. Secondly, these Bitcoin transactions could turn out to be a trackable component of people's taxable wealth, to turn out to be declared and regulated alongside any other kind of wealth.\nThe European Union has at the moment declared that Bitcoin is just not classed as a Fiat currency, or as funds, and as such, won't be regulated in its personal appropriate. Within the US, the 50 state system and number of bureaucratic bodies involved has inevitably created possibilities additional hard, with no consensus reached thus far. Bitcoin just is not viewed as to come to be money as such, nevertheless it is deemed to act like income.\nA thriving Bitcoin market inside the US includes a much more uncertain future for now, and any conclusive legislation within the US could either possess a seriously good, and even a quite adverse impact on the future of Bitcoin.

(PYPL) believes that bitcoin could become less prominent in our daily investing and transacting.\nPeter Thiel, the billionaire entrepreneur and venture capitalist, expressed his belief that there is a 50% to 80% chance that bitcoin's price will decline to a point at which the cryptocurrency, currently the largest in the world by market cap, will be effectively useless.\nThe overseer of Founders Fund brought in up to $20 million of bitcoin to its portfolio back in January, prompting a 9% rise in the price of BTC within just a day of the purchase, according to AMBCrypto.com.\nMore Likely to Fail Thiel believes that bitcoin is significantly more likely to fail than it is to continue to climb higher in price.\nCompared with a chance of up to 80% that the digital currency tanks in value, Thiel sees a 20% to 50% chance that the digital currency could go higher in price in the near future.\nAlthough Thiel indicated his belief that it's possible, if somewhat unlikely, that bitcoin will continue to climb in price, he's betting against the leading digital currency.\nIn fact, he said that he's \"not sure [he] would encourage people to run out right now and buy these cryptocurrencies\" in a recent interview.\nOther Cryptocurrencies Could Surpass Though Thiel has long been an enthusiastic supporter of bitcoin, he nonetheless believes that it's likely other digital currencies like ethereum will surpass bitcoin in value.\nIf that does take place, Thiel believes that bitcoin could become a long-term store of value rather than a go-to asset for daily transactions. In this way, the billionaire sees bitcoin a bit like an online version of gold or another precious metal.\nRecent statements represents a shift in Thiel's earlier thinking.\nHe previously stated that he \"would be long bitcoin, and neutral to skeptical of just about everything else at this point with a few possible exceptions ... there will be one online equivalent to gold, and the one you'd bet on would be the biggest.\"\nFor now, BTC remains the largest digital currency in the world, but it's unclear whether this will remain the case going forward.\nSource: Investopedia ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter thiel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fail thiel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thiel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pypl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paypal inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T09:26:12.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0f6b7eb823bd8e7c44e51cf84efdec056495e62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW40c2fJtiiQnva3nrbu6jA4-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T09:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0f6b7eb823bd8e7c44e51cf84efdec056495e62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW40c2fJtiiQnva3nrbu6jA4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T09:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 31.

These computers draw in around 600 kilowatts of cheap hydroelectricity as they mine new bitcoins. Mining bitcoins are an energy-intensive process and solving a mathematical process over and over again. It is a trial-and-error brute force method that allows cryptocurrencies to be secure in the first place. There is no efficient version of this algorithm, you need to do computationally intensive mathematical operations repeatedly. Cheap Fuel for Hardware When you are mining for bitcoins, the largest drawback is the price of electricity. Many green activists are frowning upon bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for their huge energy requirement. According to Digiconomist, the energy use by the bitcoin network can surpass the earth’s total electricity requirement in a couple of years. That is essentially a big middle finger to the climate of our home planet. We are essentially ruining our planet by mining for coins that really do not exist. But people are using bitcoins. The value of bitcoins is proof that people are using it. And hence, more coins need to be mined. With bitcoins, people do not need a third party for transactions. Money is transferred directly without a bank in between; the transaction is recorded in a ledger that is globally distributed across the bitcoin network. This is the blockchain technology . Maintaining the blockchain requires a lot of energy too, but that’s a topic for another day. The Proof of Work Mining bitcoins are lucrative because of the Proof of Work concept. Miners need to maintain the ledger by adding blocks to the ledge once in every ten minutes and they are rewarded with a bitcoin. The nature of this is competitive and hence the more computing power you have the higher is your chance of winning. But this nature of incentive is also what is driving people to mindlessly burn energy to mine for bitcoins and get their prize. Changing the Mining Strategy One thing that bitcoin entrepreneurs think could help the industry is by getting their energy at some place better. People are looking at cheap energy for bitcoins. Sometimes, they are also the dirtiest source of energy. Take coal, for example. Abundantly available in China, that makes electricity cheap but also look at China’s contribution to climate change. Just like all industries are located at geographically strategic spots, mining can also be done in locations that provide easy access to renewable energy . Consider Africa for example. Sub-Saharan Africa receives abundance of sunshine for solar power plans. Coastal regions of Europe can be used for generating tidal energy. Hydroelectric energy, in small scale, can power a lot of these computers. Windmills are also a great way to power these computers.

In the meantime, could recover rate again and is currently testing the exponential moving average EMA50. Summary The price of Bitcoin has fallen this week. The initially followed a downward channel has been undercut. Meanwhile, the former Support of this backward channel is used as a Resistance, which is also being tested currently. Overall, one comes to a more bullish course evaluation. The most important Support is currently 6.080,00 Euro, the first interesting Resistance is 6.726,86 Euro.\nThe last week has been rather sobering: The course is more like it. In this course the fall he has not left only to the former uptrend channel behind, but also the last week discussed the downward channel. Yesterday, the price reached its previous Minimum, so that, as elsewhere shown, certainly hope for a Reversal. Currently, the exponential moving will certainly mean the end of EMA50 and thus, the former Support of the above-mentioned downside channel to be tested.\nCaution is the mother of the porcelain box and a view on the long-term development, it should calm down the euphoria over the current Rebound to a healthy level. Finally, it is yet to be decided, whether it was with the Test of Support of the Triangle Pattern:\nThe MACD on the four hour chart (second Panel from the top) is positive and increasing. The MACD line (blue) is above the Signal (orange).\nThe RSI is at 56 and is thus bullish.\nOverall, one comes to a rather bullish sentiment. Support and Resistance\nThe first Support is located at 6.080,00 Euro and is from the most recently attained month minimum described. A further Support is provided by the Plateau between the 30. March of and 11. April described at 5.805,85 euros. This is on the level of Support from the Triangle Pattern.\nThe first Resistance is located at 6.726,86 Euro and thus at the height of the EMA100. The course should overcome this Level, would be to find another Resistance at 7.127,30 Euro. This Resistance is also at the height of the Resistance of the former downtrend channel. Entry points, Stop Losses and Targets\nWho would like to what car, can open a Long Position, all others wait until the EMA50 was finally overcome. Stop Loss would be in the first case, the Support 6.080,00 EUR, in the second case, the EMA50, which currently stands at around 6,500 euros. As a Target you would choose the two Resistances.\nThe rate should Fall back to the second Support at 5.805,85 euros is very interesting. The price bounces off the second Support can be used as a Stop Loss for a Long Position. The Targets were the same as indicated above. Can the Support of the Triangle Pattern, a case Bitcoin course does not stop should be considered a Shorting Position. A possible Target would be € 5,000 up to € 5,200. In this Area the course was in the beginning of November 2017. As a Stop Loss, you would benefit from the Support in height of 5,805,85.\nDisclaimer: The presented on this page, rate estimates do not constitute buy or sell recommendations.

Digital distributed cryptocurrency – there can be only 21 billion of these coins and to generate each coin, a lot of computation needs to be performed. The process is known as mining . Mining is so computationally intensive that it exceeds the power of modern supercomputers by a multiple of thousand. The computation is usually performed using a global network of computers where usually anyone can start mining bitcoins by joining the network. These days, mining is done mostly using AISCs. Chips that are designed to perform very specific tasks. In case of bitcoins, they perform hashing. It is so computationally intensive that the bitcoin network uses more electricity than the country of Bangladesh. In a couple of years, around 2020, the bitcoin network will use more energy than the total electricity consumed by the world. Given that a lot of electricity is generated by fossil fuels, such as coals, it is a doomsday scenario for climate change. Bitcoin already is having a great effect on global warming. However, the effects are being ignored as effects of the automotive industry is probably far more. Moreover, if you compare bitcoins to the automotive industry, then you should know that presently, one year’s energy consumption of bitcoins surpass the energy consumption of a million transatlantic flights. So, maybe, in the long run, bitcoins cannot be sustainable. But the technology that drives the bitcoin network maybe. It is called the blockchain. The blockchain is a global ledger where all the bitcoin transactions are recorded . When Alice sends some bitcoins to Bob, there is no middleman involved. No bank, no third-party, or anything. Their transaction is recorded publicly in this ledger that is distributed globally. This makes all bitcoin transactions auditable, brings in more transparency. The Case of Blockchain Sustainability This blockchain technology, on the other hand, can be sustainable. It can be used in areas outside bitcoin to bring in more transparency. For example, if we use this to transfer energy instead of bitcoins. A company called Solar Bankers has developed their own blockchain technology called Skycoin. Skycoin is quite a novel idea. Using the Skycoin platform, a lot of businesses can perform their own transactions . The coin they will use is called Suncoin . It is essentially a peer to peer energy trading system. The idea is that you can generate (or gather) solar power. And if you do not spend the all of it, then you can trade it with others in terms of Sun coins. The idea is literally disruptive to power companies. Instead of having power generation and distribution companies, individuals generate their own power and then they can trade this power across themselves. There can be small communities of microgrids – something analogous to pool mining in bitcoins. The ledger that will be used to monitor the trade is called the Skyledger using its own dedicated network, called the Skywire. Skycoins model shows the blockchain does not necessarily have to be something anti-green in nature. It can power a lot of sustainable technologies too.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T10:26:50.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce927880476eebcfbfba7a76d4dbcfe5ca0c2aa0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSUCBYfWpIodVvI0bU.oVec-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "How is Bitcoin different from Etherium?", "title_full": "How is Bitcoin different from Etherium?", "published": "2018-05-31T08:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce927880476eebcfbfba7a76d4dbcfe5ca0c2aa0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSUCBYfWpIodVvI0bU.oVec-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lakash", "published": "2018-05-31T08:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "How is Bitcoin different from Etherium?", "text": "Both bitcoin and Ethernet are virtual currencies based on blockchain.

A smart contract is a program code that automatically executes when certain conditions are met, such as transferring some of the application profits to investors after a certain date.
