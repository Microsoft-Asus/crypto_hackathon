Today, we have Manufacturing PMI which is a high-impact catalyst. The different price developments that we’re monitoring are:\nScenario 1:\nThe current market mood is bearish. We saw five weeks straight of bearish price action dominating the market. If today, manufacturing levels disappoint and the result is lower than projected, we could see the euro drop even lower. Next support level is located at 1.1500.\nScenario 2:\nIf the support at 1.1500 gets smashed by price, we have to be cautious of more short interest coming into the market. Below that level bias would become strictly negative and traders will have to re-position the stance from trading a bull trend to trading in a bear one.\nScenario 3:\nIn the scenario where manufacturing news brings a positive change with a better than expected reading of if news hits the U.S. dollar badly, we could see the euro advance in positive direction. If price recovers beyond 1.2000, then next target would be 1.2200 and then the resistance at 1.2500.\nGold, Daily timeframe\nBias: Bearish\nGold has been moving sideways the last 5 business days. Probably the precious metal is biding its time before making a major move again. This is what very often happens- markets resume forceful action when unexpected. This trait is not a problem if traders are already in a trade. One of the cardinal rules of trading is never to chase the market.\nThat is why planning in advance gives structure to a retailer’s approach to trading. It is possible to emulate professionals – what it takes is discipline and constantly beating on your craft. Weekends are crucial- this is the time when markets are closed and traders can step back and identify potential opportunities and even markets that seem ripe for action. The scenarios we’ve outlined are:\nScenario 1:\nThe precious metal could lose more ground in the upcoming days. A further drop would likely be provoked by either volatility levels during the European and American sessions or a news event. Target level is the support at 1260.00\nScenario 2:\nA plunge below the support at 1260.00 would show a breach and higher chances of gold getting even lower. Next immediate target level is the area at 1240.00. The potential is big and as long as traders hold on to positions (when those trades are visibly making money), that could bring about higher levels of return.\nScenario 3:\nA reversal back and above the 1300.00 resistance level with price closing above it, would suggest that gold is back within the big range. Next target area would be the resistance at 1350.00. waiting patiently for the above mentioned levels requires patience and self-control. These qualities along with making informed decisions as much as possible are key qualities to successful trading.\nBitcoin\nBias: Bearish, Daily timeframe\nIt is clear that price falls in line with the established downtrend. Yesterday, the crypto market depreciated to trade below $8000. The market developments we’ve outlined are:\nScenario 1:\nBitcoin continues to drop. As long as market flow is moving in the same direction as the dominant trend, and we have a trigger candle pushing from a level of confluence, we have a green light to go short. Target is the support level at $5,800.\nScenario 2:\nOnce Bitcoin reached the support at $5,800 we may witness a reaction. If the reaction is in the form of a bullish rejection on the daytime frame, this would mean that the level is indeed a support and also an area where traders are looking to buy. Target level would be $9,500 and if broken next in line is $12,000.\nScenario 3:\nIt would be only a time to go long once the market has shown a clear recovery from bears- strength my come unexpectedly. It is up to traders to monitor their charts and trades at least once a day. A true recovery would be price trading above $13,000. Target level would then become the record high at $19,400.\nEther\nBias: Bearish, 4-Hour timeframe\nEther like Bitcoin is on the active side. Price slid on Tuesday and continued to fall in the early hours on Wednesday to trade around $630. The trend is clearly pointing south and price action is in agreement with it. Scenarios on our watch list are:\nScenario 1:\nPrice reaches the support at $600 and may go further down below it. This could attract more interest for traders looking to short the market since there is potential toward weaker prices. Next target is the farthest support level at $360.\nScenario 2:\nThere could be a bounce from the support at $360. We would better await a solid bullish formation of at least two daily candles. This would allow us to target the following resistance and potential target levels: $600, $740 and $860.\nScenario 3:\nAs we’ve previously discussed on multiple occasions, the line that separates bulls from bears is the area at $1,180. Should this resistance get conquered by Ether, then we could have solid positive bias and previous market movement feedback that bulls are back into play. Target level is the peak at $1,300.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/tradeostatic/legal/RiskDisclosure_WarningNotice.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ether cryptocurrencies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:01:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f9709f7d9686658f40692621a1e0974e60a61b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VENZLMuY3gNr9h3QY4smRViZfSf6CPaHg.G_.FSMY2_kamTZcjPv2Vu5k876ozCCO1dmenSDUEuPmDXXeh1C10uUVOvieCDOkTf_abAjz7iHnmPPP0HwdgN2kP0PYG4E-", "site_full": "www.topstocksblog.com", "site": "topstocksblog.com", "site_section": "http://www.topstocksblog.com/stocks/bank-stocks/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bank Stocks – Top Stocks For 2019", "title": "Bitcoin Prices Could Rally as South Korean Exchange Is Cleared", "title_full": "Bitcoin Prices Could Rally as South Korean Exchange Is Cleared", "published": "2018-05-23T08:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f9709f7d9686658f40692621a1e0974e60a61b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VENZLMuY3gNr9h3QY4smRViZfSf6CPaHg.G_.FSMY2_kamTZcjPv2Vu5k876ozCCO1dmenSDUEuPmDXXeh1C10uUVOvieCDOkTf_abAjz7iHnmPPP0HwdgN2kP0PYG4E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-23T08:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Prices Could Rally as South Korean Exchange Is Cleared", "text": " Bitcoin Prices Could Rally as South Korean Exchange Is Cleared\nBitcoin prices fell nearly 2% down, to $8,232, as the broader cryptocurrency market continues its correction, but recent scandals plaguing the currency are finally in the past.\nThe Mt. Gox trustees are selling their Bitcoin funds, and an ongoing scandal at South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, UPbit and Bithumb, put downward pressure on crypto prices.\nBut some good news is in sight. This week, South Korean accounting firm Yoojin released a report stating that the funds of UPbit matched the cryptocurrency exchange’s balance sheet. This alleviated major concerns about the exchange and its operations.\nPlus, today also marks the eighth anniversary of the famous Bitcoin pizza purchase, a reminder of just how powerfully lucrative cryptocurrencies can be.\nEight years ago today, a programmer paid 10,000 bitcoins for two Papa John’s pizzas.

Aliens May 23, 4 Comments\nU.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes announced that Louis Ong, 37, had been sentenced for effectively laundering millions of dollars in Bitcoin for undercover agents who had indicated their money originated from a successful drug distribution operation. U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik sentenced the man to three years of supervised release, suspended with 20 days in jail and a $1 million forfeiture. Ong was arrested in July 2017 for Operating an Unlicensed Money Transmission Business.\nOng, however, registered as a currency exchanger with FinCEN, the government agency responsible for regulation regarding money laundering, terrorist financing, and various financial fraud activities. Many know of the “Know Your Customer” (KYC) or “Anti-Money Laundering” (AML) laws that make dealing with some cryptocurrency exchanges a complicated mess. FinCEN, or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established those laws, including those that cover the regulation of cryptocurrency.\nU.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes reminded the public that the darknet was not a “free pass for crime and mayhem.” She failed to connect the dots between Bitcoin exchanges and “mayhem.” The attorney added, “this defendant knew full well [that] the laws and rules apply to crypto currency dealings just as they [apply] to other types of financial transactions.” Throughout the course of the operation, Homeland Security Investigations agents told Ong what he needed in order to legally—or legitimately—exchange Bitcoin for cash.\nCourt documents revealed that federal agents began their investigation into Ong in 2016. Federal agents had found an advertisement on the internet where he had offered to exchange Bitcoin for cash. For a fee. In February and in March 2017, Ong met with Homeland Security Investigations agents to exchange their Bitcoin . Even though Ong repeatedly informed the agents that he did not want to know where their Bitcoin had come from, the agents repeatedly informed him that they had earned the Bitcoin through drug distribution.\nMonths later, Homeland Security Investigations informed Ong that if he planned to continue exchanging currencies, he needed to register as a currency exchanger with FinCEN. Ong registered and informed Homeland Security that he had indeed taken the steps needed for legitimizing his growing business. (A business growing due to the influx of Bitcoin from Homeland Security Investigations agents.)\nAfter he had registered with FinCEN, Ong reportedly “failed” to report transactions deemed “suspicious” by the HSI agents behind the transactions. The agents wrote that they had informed Ong several times that they needed their funds laundered, and they were from drug related crimes. He maintained that he had no interest in knowing the origin of their funds. He wanted, in his own words, “plausible deniability.”\nThe agents conducted three transactions prior to the FinCEN registration. After the sixth transaction, HSI agents arrested Ong. He was indicted on August 27, 2017. He pleaded guilty to Operating an Unlicensed Money Transmission Business on February 15, 2018.\nIn court in May, U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik listened to Ong’s apology and apparent remorse. He sentenced the man to a suspended sentence and a fine of $1 million.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/canadian-who-operated-unlicensed-bitcoin-trading-business-sentenced", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "annette l. hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert s. lasnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis ong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aml", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fincen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial crimes enforcement network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T02:06:29.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54c18759d55c59af1b654ba6588d251edccec110", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSeRs5qMuWsDMKZTh3yhGqsktxwcVH4upVqA3ELAD1qIrJeltiJax36_3AqVSp8xMkqxYxqJ8eeup", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "MIT Is Testing A Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network", "title_full": "MIT Is Testing A Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network", "published": "2018-05-23T08:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54c18759d55c59af1b654ba6588d251edccec110", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSeRs5qMuWsDMKZTh3yhGqsktxwcVH4upVqA3ELAD1qIrJeltiJax36_3AqVSp8xMkqxYxqJ8eeup", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T08:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "MIT Is Testing A Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network", "text": "MIT Is Testing A Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network\n/u/BLMPNetwork\nsubmitted by /u/BLMPNetwork\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T08:44:35.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee00a1caa441dbb424e2c9e56603c83413ec74bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smsCxifrtchTI_jZxPMG.ZGW7GJuTtSfsYzT0wGnmXOhVg03rOAXC49Ymr3XM.tTbWV_02v9WdgJ", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "MIT Is Testing A Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network", "title_full": "MIT Is Testing A Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network", "published": "2018-05-23T08:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee00a1caa441dbb424e2c9e56603c83413ec74bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smsCxifrtchTI_jZxPMG.ZGW7GJuTtSfsYzT0wGnmXOhVg03rOAXC49Ymr3XM.tTbWV_02v9WdgJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T08:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "MIT Is Testing A Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network", "text": "MIT Is Testing A Smart Contract-Powered Bitcoin Lightning Network\n/u/BLMPNetwork\nsubmitted by /u/BLMPNetwork\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T08:38:12.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "293e86927739d9ac0b2eda4fbec9b9ee73b65adb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPuIlpXQcoQZ1t9ITuUuI4YOiQpor0A4FNcBzSpRNsuvnYmLDAeIsCR28EVfqBVUQHix3Hbnoow4K", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

Bitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider based in Latin America. According to BMV , the new service allows customers to transfer money from account to account in less time than traditional bank transfers. BMV states that the new service will reduce transfer times by up to 24 hours. José Humberto Dakak, a principal shareholder of Masventas, said that the move intends to strengthen the bank’s digital and smartphone-based services and reduce banking service costs. He said: One of the initiatives is to use Bitex as a strategic partner to provide our overseas customers with payment and collection services at the Bitex Exchange. In addition to expediting transfers, Bitex claims that it can provide more secure transactions. According to their website , Bitex observes “the strictest compliance rules” and know-your-client (KYC) measures. They have also hired one of the “Big Four” accounting and audit firms, Deloitte , to serve as an impartial third party to review and report on operations, procedures, as well as on balances and funds of users and the company. Earlier this month, a pilot of Ripple (XRP)’s xRapid platform was launched, which is designed to facilitate cross-border fiat transfers between financial institutions. Organizations who participated in the project reported transaction savings of 40-70 percent. Payments through the new pilot reportedly took around two minutes, as opposed to the average 2-3 days required by many conventional cross-border payments. In March, financial messaging provider SWIFT published a report on how distributed ledger technology (DLT) proof of concept (PoC) could help nostro account reconciliations. According to SWIFT, the PoC, “went extremely well, proving the fantastic progress that has been made with DLT and the Hyperledger fabric in particular.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josé humberto dakak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitex exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T08:29:34.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5edd9f293613f923dbc91b296b7b649857b8942e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C0NXQqaHDDuNhEQm9ekQdU4-", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "http://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=11", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion @ Forex Factory", "title": "HODL!

Whether it is a bad investment is a large question. Bitcoin can customarily be used as a middle of sell and in use has been distant some-more critical for a dim economy than it has for many legitimate uses. The miss of any executive management creates bitcoin remarkably volatile to censorship, crime – or regulation. That means it has captivated a operation of backers, from libertarian monetarists who suffer a thought of a banking with no acceleration and no executive bank, to drug dealers who like a fact that it is tough (but not impossible) to snippet a bitcoin transaction behind to a earthy person.\n“This is a abduction … We direct recover of 15 bitcoins to be paid into a next bitcoin wallet residence to secure your child’s protected recover – non-negotiable,” a note reportedly read.\nThe initial deadline for remuneration of partial of a recover upheld on Monday night.

They’re ravaged and we can see they’re disturbed and seeking themselves: ‘Where’s a son?” local media quoted a central as saying. The boy’s mom done an romantic interest on Tuesday, pleading with a kidnappers to “bring behind [her] son”.\nPolice in South Africa have reported a new arise in kidnappings, nonetheless it is customarily rich businesspeople who are targeted. The latest box appears to be a initial recover direct in done for a cryptocurrency in a country.\nIn Dec 2017, an worker during a cryptocurrency sell in Ukraine was released by kidnappers after a recover of some-more than $1m value of bitcoins was paid.

David Scott, an elected councillor, has pleaded not guilty to rubbing his genitals against a female council staffer at a function last year. The woman said the object she felt touch her back was 10-12 centimetres long. Scott’s defence argues that the complainant felt his wallet accidentally touch her as he moved past. But the accuser said the offending object pressing into her back could not have been a wallet, phone or insulin kit, and was in fact male genitalia. - AFP After Texas shooting, governor calls off gun raffle\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott has called off his re-election campaign’s plans to raffle off a shotgun, in the aftermath of the school shooting that killed 10 people last week. The raffle prize was changed to a $250 (just over R3,000) gift certificate. With an image of Abbott looking down the barrel of a shotgun, the governor’s campaign website had been raffling off a ‘Texas-made shotgun’. ‘As governor, Greg Abbott expanded 2nd Amendment rights, signing into law ‘campus carry’ and ‘open carry,’’ his website touts, referring to controversial policies that allow for the public carrying of firearms, including on state college campuses. – AFP What’s with the ancient pelvises on a stick?\nThousands of bones from boys and men likely killed in a ferocious battle 2,000 years ago have been unearthed from a bog in Denmark. Four pelvic bones strung on a stick were among the remains of at least 82 people found during archaeological excavations at Alken Enge, indicating an organised and ritual clearing of a battlefield. The more than 2,300 human bones were radiocarbon-dating and found to be between 2 BC and 54 AD. In this era, Roman soldiers were pressing an expansion northward, and around 7 AD, the Romans suffered a massive loss in which tens of thousands of warriors were killed by the Germanic people. Scientists believe these remains are one of those campaigns. Many questions remain. Who was involved in the battle? And what is the meaning of stringing pelvic bones on a stick? - AFP Violins created to mimic man\nMusic historians prove that the violin was created to imitate the human voice, and a study shows how 16th to 18th century luthiers in Italy did it. Researchers asked a professional violinist to play 15 antique instruments, including one from 1570 by Andrea Amati considered to be the father of the modern four-string violin. Others played in the study were from the Stradivarius family, conceived by Antonio Stradivari, who improved upon Amati’s design. Then, they recorded the voices of eight men and eight women, ranging in age from 16 to 30 years, who sang common English vowels. Performing a thorough acoustic analysis, they found that an Amati violin dating to 1570 and a Gasparo da Salo violin dating to 1560 mimicked the basses and baritones of male singers and, in contrast, Stradivari violins were marked by elevated formants, making them relatively more similar to female voices. - AFP A clean home can give your kids cancer\nKeeping children cocooned in ultra-clean homes away from other youngsters could trigger childhood leukaemia, a landmark study suggests. A major new analysis by Britain’s leading leukaemia expert has concluded a deadly chain of events is set in motion when susceptible children are not exposed to enough bugs to prime their immune system at an early age. Without sufficient immunity, if vulnerable youngsters catch even a relatively harmless virus like flu, the immune system malfunctions creating far more infection-fighting white blood cells than needed, causing leukaemia. The most important implication is that most cases of childhood leukaemia are likely to be preventable, a researcher concluded. - © The Daily Telegraph Google sued by 4.4m iPhone users\nGoogle is facing a potential payout of up to £3.2bn over claims it collected data on millions of iPhone users, the search giant has revealed. The group representing iPhone users, known as Google You Owe Us, represents 4.4 million people in a class action law suit which is taking action against the tech company. The group told the court that data collected included race, physical and mental health, political leanings, sexuality, social class, financial, shopping habits and location data. Google said in court documents that the group think each individual could receive £750 (over R12,00) if the case is successful.

So it has become a farce…I'm seeing more noise and more fraud than I'm seeing anything useful.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Kashkari Comments Bring Sellers In appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kashkari", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T07:59:35.055+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbe0c2474d510ca17c3ca92f05876bfbb251a541", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYVMGi1KlwfrfrumbtcSktc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin or Altcoin which is best?", "title_full": "Bitcoin or Altcoin which is best?", "published": "2018-05-23T07:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.054, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbe0c2474d510ca17c3ca92f05876bfbb251a541", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYVMGi1KlwfrfrumbtcSktc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "hirngespenst", "published": "2018-05-23T07:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin or Altcoin which is best?", "text": "of course bitcoin!

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\nJOHANNESBURG: A gang who kidnapped a South African teenager from a playground at the weekend have demanded a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency worth about $123,000, police said Tuesday. The 13-year-old boy was taken in the eastern province of Mpumalanga while he was playing with friends near his home and was driven away by captors in a car. “We are investigating a case of kidnapping that happened on Sunday in Witbank (town),” police spokesman Leonard Hlathi told AFP.\n“There was a demand that was made that the parents should deposit cash in bitcoins,” he said, declining to give further details. Local media said the ransom note was left at the scene. “We demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child’s safe release – non-negotiable,” read the reported note.\nThis case appears to be the first ransom demand in South Africa made in virtual currency. In March, US hackers demanding a ransom payable in bitcoin attacked computers of the Atlanta city government in the southern state of Georgia.\nPolice in South Africa, where violent crime is common, have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, although it is often wealthy business people who are targeted.\nAFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world`s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world`s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company`s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin`s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin`s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong`s central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand – especially for high-end machines – was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n“Since we weren`t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n“Investors are always looking for crypto `picks and shovels`, and that`s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation 2330 (TSMC), the world`s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator`s apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,” according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market – a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan`s deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain .\n“Its not your everyday investment world,” said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalisation of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favoured for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n“We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,” Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE`s second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan`s smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n“The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,” said Kenetic`s Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan`s IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan`s IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan`s industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves – just as soon as customer demand returns.

Unfortunately, this rally proved unsustainable, and the bitcoin price entered Tuesday morning trading near $8,400 and continued to decline throughout the day.\nShortly before 22:40 UTC, the bitcoin price slipped below $8,000, and it ultimately dipped as low as $7,943 before recovering back to a present value of $7,968, representing a daily decline of about five percent.\nBitcoin’s sluggish performance has not been an isolated occurrence. The cryptocurrency market cap as a whole has declined by approximately $18 billion for the day, from $381 billion on Monday to $363 billion at the time of writing.\nAs CCN reported , the recent market downtrend has been linked to several factors, including a scandal involving South Korea’s two largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex’s announcement that it will share some users’ tax information with the government, and the belief that the trustee of the Mt. Gox estate has begun selling more of the bankrupt exchange’s cryptocurrency holdings.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/big-investors-not-scared-by-bitcoin-price-drop-cryptocurrency-inevitably-replaces-fiat/", "http://ccn.com/marketcap", "https://www.ccn.com/happy-bitcoin-pizza-day/", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-ethereum-prices-drop-3-in-sluggish-crypto-market-factors-and-trends/", "http://ccn.com/bitcoin-price"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "josiah wilmoth", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T02:32:02.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09e0d21ecc84001656f8e51c140177bfe3ab41cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYAs9B_xuMqutevh8ywPBA7I", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "nd we're back!

According to the Bitcoin Wiki another user, who went by “jercos” on the forum, took Hanyecz up on his offer. Hanyecz sent the bitcoin to jercos, who then placed the pizza order. The transaction had to be finalized over internet relay chat.\nThis is widely believed to be the first purchase of a product with bitcoin, proving the then-nascent cryptocurrency’s potential as a means of payment. The reason for celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day by the Bitcoin Community like that of yesterday, 22nd May, 2018.\nImagine that \"jercos\", as was in the forum, was so excited about the first exchange with Bitcoin that he kept the 10,000 Bitcoin in a special wallet and never touched it till today. That means $82 Million worth of Bitcoin would have been dancing in his wallet now for just 2 slices of pizza he provided for someone.\nConcerns: Is such opportunity still available? Do I buy Bitcoin from 9jacash.com with my naira and store in my wallet to become million dollar man in few years? Is the value of Bitcoin still rising or will rise and then crash or never rise? Will Bitcoin one day seize to exist making the stored money useless?\nRe: What Is Special About The Bitcoin PIZZA Day? by 9jacash ( f ): 2:14pm On May 24 The fastest and most reliable means to Buy/Sell your Bitcoin with Naira is via www.9jacash.com.

They have been taking Bitcoin and a handful of other cryptocurrencies since they opened in 2017. Their sister restaurant STREET led the way for Portsmouth and the entire Seacoast region by being the first in town to accept the new currency. Their adventurism has paid off big-time, regularly drawing in new business from cryptocurrency lovers from out of town and even out of state. Bitcoin Pizza Day 2018 at STREET’Za in Portsmouth\nEven though the Boston Bitcoin Cash Meetup group just had an event there Saturday, a guy in Portland reached out to me and said the Portsmouth Bitcoin Network should have a meetup of its own on the official Bitcoin Pizza Day (May 22). We did, and it was excellent. Bitcoin Pizza Day 2018 at STREET’Za in Portsmouth\nOnly 4 people RSVP’d to the event, but you never can tell with these things. Eleven people showed up! One attendee works for Coinbase in New York City. He received some playful ribbing. Another has a business setting up merchants to take cryptocurrency. A few asked for his card. One was finance professor at a local university researching ICOs. He asked about classes at the Blockchain Institute of Technology. Three were students home for the summer. They installed their first hot wallets on their phones and loaded them with some coins. Attendee ages ranged from 16 to 55, with the average probably around 30. The Boston Bitcoin Meetup the previous Saturday drew in 4 people total, one from Haverhill and one from Portland. Bitcoin Pizza Day 2018 at STREET’Za in Portsmouth\nThe best part? Everyone used cryptocurrency to pay. Without exception. Some friendly nudging was offered when all but 2 attendees paid with Dash instead of Bitcoin. Rightly, these people were ridiculed. After all, we were there for Bitcoin Pizza Day. But then again, Dash has benefits over Bitcoin that make it more attractive for customers. First, transaction fees are lower. Much lower. Like 20 times lower. Those who paid with Bitcoin paid an extra twenty cents in fees on top of their payment compared with Dash’s fee of less than one cent. Bitcoin Pizza Day 2018 at STREET’Za in Portsmouth\nNot really a big deal, but then get this: Dash-Back. Because STREET’Za accepts their crypto using the Anypay digital cash register , their customers receive an instant rebate when they pay with Dash. In my case, I paid $12.50 for some chicken wings and received a dollar of Dash right back into my wallet. Not bad. All things being equal, when faced with the choice between two cryptocurrencies, using Dash makes a lot of sense if the merchant is using Anypay. Why not use the coin that pays you to use it instead of the one that you have to pay extra to use?\nHere are some shots of folks enjoying and paying for their meals. Bitcoin Pizza Day 2018 at STREET’Za in Portsmouth Bitcoin Pizza Day 2018 at STREET’Za in Portsmouth\nOh yeah, I almost forgot. Many of the attendees asked if they could pay the server’s tip with their crypto. The manager said yes and took the tips on his phone with the promise to pass them along to our server after setting her up with her own wallets, or paying her out in cash (whatever her preference). In the past, this has been a great way to introduce new people to crypto. They know it has real value because they can see it being used to buy things where they work.

But its origins trace back to 2008 and an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, whose vision was to create a rival financial system based on a technology called blockchain.\nStill, many merchants are wary of accepting bitcoin because of its spine-tingling volatility. Last year, Morgan Stanley described the lack of places to buy goods with bitcoin.\n\"The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin's rapid appreciation is striking,\" the analysts wrote .\nThat hasn't kept Wall Street away.

These changes are scheduled to occur in a matter of weeks.”\nCoinbase was responsible for converting the Bitcoin into fiat currency.

Instead of comparing bitcoin to past technological solutions, as has been done many times before, he puts it in the context of time-based and electricity-backed experimental forms of alternative money.\nPutting the technology of Bitcoin on the same level as primarily political movements, he also compared it to attempts to reshape how governments and economies operate. And while novel ideas by communist and technocratic thinkers have failed, the Euro – which was devised to help unite former warring nations – is still around.\nRevolutionary Zeal Is Not Enough Nobel Prize Laureate Robert J. Shiller After reviewing these past examples, Shiller explains that: \"Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.\"\n\"And, as in the past, the public's fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money's connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough,\" he concluded.\nWhether it's true or not that only computer scientists understand cryptocurrencies today, it is certainly accepted that having a story is not enough by itself, which is why bitcoin entrepreneurs continue to work on exciting use cases that are only made possible with this revolutionary technology.\nWhat should the bitcoin community make of the professor's observations?

He added:\nRight now, we don't see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it's something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we'll certainly support that.\nWhat do you think about PayPal's future relationship with Bitcoin?

The apparent openness to regulating cryptocurrencies contrasts significantly from the recent banking embargo targeting virtual currency recently witnessed in Chile.\nAlso Read: Spanish Regulator Open to Approving Funds Investing Directly in Cryptocurrencies Chilean President Discusses Benefits of Regulating Cryptocurrencies\nDuring a forum recently held by Chile’s Finance Commission of Deputies, President Marcel made comments indicating that his administration is considering developing a legislative apparatus designed to regulate and monitor activities pertaining to Chile’s cryptocurrency sector. Presently, cryptocurrencies are entirely unregulated in Chile, and are not legally recognized as a means of exchange or securities.\nMr. Marcel spoke in favor of developing an effective means through which to monitor the cryptocurrency markets, stating that “Incorporating a regulation would allow having a registry of the participants in these activities and thus have information to monitor the associated risks,” adding that “These activities could be developed under more robust standards and mechanisms, especially in terms of market transparency, consumer protection, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.”\nBy contrast, President Marcel warned that developing an ad hoc regulatory apparatus could risk providing a false “sense of security” whilst failing to effectively manage associated risks.\nDespite the comments, Mr. Marcel still questioned whether or not a regulatory framework for virtual currencies is warranted in Chile, stating “Considering that these assets exist in the country, there is an associated industry and people who own them, it is questionable if it would be appropriate to change this situation.” Chile Changes Course After Recent Cryptocurrency Banking Embargo\nThe apparent openness on the part of the Chilean administration to developing a regulatory apparatus for cryptocurrencies comprises a significant a departure from the recent banking embargo experienced in Chile.\nIn March, two Chilean cryptocurrency exchanges, Buda and Crypto Mkt, requested clarity on the position of the country’s banking association regarding virtual currencies after numerous banks suddenly terminated their accounts with the exchanges. At the beginning of April, both exchanges, in addition to a third exchange, Orionx, received notice from Banco del Estado de Chile (Banco Estado) that their accounts with the country’s sole state bank would soon be closed.\nDuring mid-April, the Buda sought to appeal against the account suspensions. The action would prove successful, with Chile’s anti-monopoly court ordering two of ten banks to re-open Buda’s accounts.\nThe verdict led to the Chilean Minister of Economy, Development, and Tourism, José Ramón Valente, issuing a statement seeking to emphasize the government is “not in favor [of] or against [cryptocurrencies], but simply see them as another innovation.”\nDo you think that Chile will move towards developing a permissive regulatory apparatus for cryptocurrencies?

Simply put, a blockchain is a database. However, there is one huge difference between how you probably currently think of a database and how a blockchain database works. In most cases, a traditional database sits on one computer or in one location. Even if a company has redundant servers around the world, the data might only be backed up between 3 to 5 locations. On top of that, these companies collectively spend billions of dollars a year on cyber security, to protect this data. With a blockchain database, the data can be backed up on potentially thousands of computers all over the world, for a much, much lower cost. The information in these databases is heavily encrypted and sometimes files are broken up into pieces, so even if one piece is exposed, it will not expose the entire file. If the information on one server does become compromised by hackers, the other copies of the databases have to “agree” that the compromised data was a legitimate change to the data. If the other copies do not agree, then the change is rejected and it is changed back to match the others. Obviously, this is an oversimplified explanation of the technology, but I hope that you are starting to see the benefits. Instead of just one point of failure, like on a single server, you now have multiple copies of the same database all over the world that is almost impossible to crack and will “fix” itself in the case of a hack.\nThis can also save a ton of money on cyber security software and services. Example. Let’s say that a hacker gets into your bank’s computer tomorrow and transfers all of your money to his account, then deletes any trace of the transaction. With today’s technology, you would probably be screwed. But with a blockchain currency like Bitcoin, if one server was hacked and a fake transaction was inserted into the database, then it wouldn’t match the transaction record on the hundreds other copies of the database. This transaction would be seen as a fake and rejected. Your money would be safe. This is one of the many reasons why blockchain technology is so exciting. The Characteristics Of A Currency To Be Aware Of. Although cryptocurrencies are all based on blockchain technology, they are not all created equal. Here are some differences that you need to understand to make informed trading decisions. Transaction processing speed. Total supply currently available. Will there ultimately be a limit on the total number of currency available? Will there be an unlimited supply of currency? Is there a real-world need for this software/currency? Real world adoption of the technology. Any big investors in the project? Does the use of the software make sense? Do the founders have a reputable background? These are just a few of the characteristics that you should look at.\nHowever, once you start digging into these details, you will begin to see which projects could work for their intended purpose and which ones are probably scams. This understanding will also allow you to assess the long-term viability of these different currencies and which ones will be more desirable in the future. Example. Tether is a cryptocurrency that wants to be the proxy for fiat currencies. So there is a Tether USD version, EUR version, etc. But each one is pegged to the value of the currency, so you can never make any money trading it. It is purely to provide stable and liquid transactions. So one USD Tether will always be worth about $ 1. If you didn’t know this and bought a bunch of it, thinking that it’s cheap compared to Bitcoin, you will tie up your money in an asset that will never appreciate. Sure, you won’t lose money either, but you would have lost out on other opportunities. So understand the nuances of each crypto, it’s very important. What are the Different Cryptocurrency Use Cases? Almost every currency software has a different intended purpose and individual implementation, with inherent strengths and weaknesses. It’s like Windows vs Mac. …or iOS vs Android. Here are a few examples of the different types of cryptocurrencies and what they are designed to do. This is not an exhaustive list, just a sample. Note.
