Sponsored Links\nFurthermore, Chinese President Xi Jinping mentioned in a speech that blockchain has “breakthrough applications” at a meeting of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering on May 28. While China has positioned itself as hostile towards cryptocurrencies, given that the blockchain cannot fully function without them, this may mean a softening of China’s crypto stance may be in the works.\nThe cryptocurrency community’s focus this week, however, was more on altcoin projects than on bitcoin. TRON moved its project onto an independent blockchain, EOS finally launched its platform, and IOTA released its Trinity mobile wallet.\nThe price of TRON (TRX) somewhat surprisingly didn’t jump as its platform moved onto its own independent blockchain and ended to week in the red. EOS (EOS) and IOTA (MIOTA), on the other hand, experienced 20+ percent price jumps off the back of their positive developments.\nIn other altcoin news, 51 percent attacks have been attempting or successfully initiated, with an attacker trying to attack the Ethereum Classic chain but ended up failing , while ZenCash saw two double spends in a 51 percent attack on June 2. As BTCManager highlighted, the theme of security and robustness against such attacks was the main theme for the week beginning May 28.\nThis week’s contributions have been provided by Cindy Huynh, Pratik Makadiya, Priyeshu Garg, Rahul Nambiampurath, and Shaurya Malwa.\nSouth Korea’s top court has recently confiscated $2.3 billion in cryptocurrency assets from a 33-year old man who operated a pornographic site. It is the first time cryptocurrencies have been confiscated in the country. Korea’s highest court confirmed on May 30, 2018, a court order that seized 191 bitcoins from a man named Ahn. The 191 bitcoin was worth approximately 2.4 billion won ($2.3 million ) which was earnt from an online pornography website.\nThe Supreme Court, therefore, recognized the cryptocurrency as an “asset with measurable value.” The court also mentioned that “the cryptocurrency is recognized to have value so it can be confiscated.”\nAccording to South China Morning Post , in the past, Ahn had also faced a sentence of 18 months in prison and a fine worth 696 million won ($646,375 ) by a lower court. He had also violated the Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse Law and was arrested and indicted in May 2017.\nChinese President Xi Jinping mentioned in a speech that blockchain has “breakthrough applications” at a meeting of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering on May 28.\nAccording to the CNBC , President Xi Jinping stated at the Chinese Academy of Science’s annual conference, “a new generation of technology represented by artificial intelligence, quantum information, mobile communications, internet of things and blockchain is accelerating breakthrough applications.”\nWhile the Government appears bullish on blockchain technology, China has halted cryptocurrency trading domestically. In September 2017, China also banned initial coin offerings and cracked down on all cryptocurrency exchanges. As a result, many cryptocurrency exchanges moved to Hong Kong. Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges had even moved to Malta as a result of the cryptocurrency crackdown.\nWith 51 percent attacks emerging on networks like Bitcoin Gold and Verge, many commentators believe it is just a matter of time before the weaker cryptocurrencies are exposed to attack. It could be the case that hackers are just testing the waters and will gear up toward more lucrative attacks on larger cryptocurrencies in the near future.\nWhile attacking a cryptocurrency network in of itself is not illegal, shorting the said crypto and conducting a 51 percent attack is, which may deter some attackers.\nInterestingly, after cryptocurrency markets were overstretched regarding valuation during early 2018, the rest of the year could well see attacks on smaller cryptocurrencies and weed out the good from the bad.\nIn China, OneCoin followed the moniker Weika Coin and offered investors an opportunity to buy OneCoin in a bid to progress through 140 different membership levels. It is from this leveled organizational standard that many have pinned “pyramid scheme” to the operation.\nAfter years of investigations, it now appears that Chinese authorities are ready to bring the pyramid scheme to a halt. Not only in China but regulators around the world where the company had spread have also started cracking the whip. Companies associated with OneCoin are currently being investigated in the U.K., United States, Italy, Canada, and Ukraine.\nIn China, 98 people have so far been prosecuted for their involvement in the OneCoin pyramid scheme, a number that is expected to rise as authorities have already uncovered related operations in 20 provinces in China.\nOne suspect was arrested for allegedly selling OneCoin in Dunhuang, a city in the province of Gansu. The arrest triggered a series of similar arrests that saw 33 defendants nabbed and sentenced to four years in jail each and fined between 10,000 and five million Yuan or ~$780,000.\nOn May 30, 2018, The TRON Foundation, the Foundation behind TRON, the tenth largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, launched their Mainnet. It is currently in beta stage and available for the public to test.\nThe TRON Foundation’s goal is to become a true independent token in the TRON Ecosystem and shed the ERC20 identity. While the TRON network is a basic-layer public blockchain like Ethereum, it, however, has additional features like a high throughput, high-extension, and high-reliability support for the protocol’s decentralized application operations.\n“The independence of our protocol is a crucial step in ushering in the next phase of the internet through democratization and decentralization,” said Justin Sun, founder of the TRON Foundation.\n“Our team maintains a high standard of excellence as we head towards becoming a mainstream public blockchain. The move of the TRON Protocol to Mainnet makes it easier for developers to break away from Ethereum and opens up new doors towards better scaling, commercialization and express lanes needed for global dApp development.”\nTRON made the move official on May 31, 2018, immediately after their live stream. Developers can, therefore, begin configuring their wallets and browsers for the full launch, also known as “Independence Day,” scheduled for June 25, 2018.\nBitcoin could be set for a significant boost as Russia prepares to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup on June 14, 2018. Numerous hotels across the country have announced plans to accept bitcoin as a currency to ease forex woes for tourists.\nHotels across the 11 World Cup venues had begun accepting bitcoin from as early as April 2018. Merchants across Russia will accept bitcoin too. The idea of adopting bitcoin is that tourists will no longer be subjected to the hassles of exchanging their currencies. The World Cup could be an event where bitcoin indeed emerges as a decentralized global currency.\nDue to the American trade embargo over Russia, certain companies cannot service within the geography of Russia. A few of the companies that fall under the purview are from the finance, banking and fintech industry. As a result, tourists arriving in Russia from around the world may be in for a surprise when they find out that they are unable to make payments.\nChile’s Tribunal for the Defense of Free Competition (TDLC) passed an order in April 2018 directing three of the country’s largest banks to reopen the accounts belonging to crypto exchanges that had been suspended indefinitely. Bancoestado, Scotiabank, and Itau were the banks ordered by the tribunal to resume regular banking services.\nThe order came after Buda sued ten banks for closing accounts belonging to the cryptocurrency exchange in the first week of April 2018 after issuing a notice. In the lawsuit, the firm claimed that the banks were violating fundamental anti-competition laws. It went on to state that the sudden closure of accounts meant complete loss of business, especially as it was forced to transfer all funds to its users within a very short span of time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexander lielacher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "chinese academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese academy of engineering", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T04:01:41.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb0a4a816971552a4e8b52a72a6ea2684976ceaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFD_7QAGYb4VeM0xlXva_Z7SKHJbxUsua6ETKewmxo8lil4y34vwgfxShI4yoxzpX12g_NWuuw6bLjqEIW4OJKlKjVJudC_hI.L8BTwaQ3UwKbWWx9ekeF", "site_full": "crypto.directpath.club", "site": "directpath.club", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Tron (TRX) & Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Tread Rough Waters – Upside Ahead | Direct Path CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "Tron (TRX) & Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Tread Rough Waters – Upside Ahead | Direct Path CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb0a4a816971552a4e8b52a72a6ea2684976ceaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFD_7QAGYb4VeM0xlXva_Z7SKHJbxUsua6ETKewmxo8lil4y34vwgfxShI4yoxzpX12g_NWuuw6bLjqEIW4OJKlKjVJudC_hI.L8BTwaQ3UwKbWWx9ekeF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tron (TRX) & Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Tread Rough Waters – Upside Ahead | Direct Path CryptoCurrency", "text": "Tron (TRX) & Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Tread Rough Waters – Upside Ahead Posted on June 4, 2018 by admin in Uncategorized // 0 Comments\nTron (TRX) & Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – This weekend, the cryptocurrency market began digging itself out of its hole made in May but unfortunately, has corrected again this morning. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading just below $7,500, and Ethereum (ETH) is nearly at $600, a coin.\nNews broke early this morning that open-sourced GitHub will be acquired by Microsoft , and this could very well be the reason the market is in the red. Many developers aren’t happy, but I wouldn’t see them cashing in just yet – this may be just newbie investor reactions.\nLet’s take a look at two coins on the market trending today.\nTron (TRX) Update\nJust five days ago, Tron (TRX) launched its main net, and TRX’s price has been all over the place.\nAs you can see, TRX had a sharp price dip and spike just before its launch but has been all over the place ever since. TRX’s price has behaved the opposite of EOS’s, who also launched its main net a few days ago.\nJustin Sun just announced that TRX will be listed on CoinEx starting June 6th. #TRON $TRX #TRX will be listed on @coinexcom , you can deposit #TRX and trade TRX/BCH, TRX/BTC at 11:00am, June 6, 2018 (GMT+8) 🔊 pic.twitter.com/pe3BXRe7G7\n— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) June 4, 2018\nCurrently, all major exchanges that hold TRX are set to handle the token migration.\nAt press time, TRX is trading at $0.0589 a coin, down -5.88 %, in 24 hours.\n>> Tron Independence Day\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Update\nOn June 2nd, HandCash released a new updated version of their Android App which allows its users to use handles in transactions to specify the address in which they are trying to send BCH.\nThis app was launched back in February and allows BCH holders to pay with a mobile wallet. IT also enables ‘hand-to-hand’ payments between devices without the need of a QR code or address. This is similar to ‘air drops’ done on iPhones. Currently, the app is in its BETA stage. Instant transactions for way less than a penny. Verified in about a second. Use $handles for convenience.\nThis is HandCash. This is #BitcoinCash . pic.twitter.com/N9ob9WfFov\n— HandCash (@handcashapp) April 17, 2018\nJust after the release of the new updated HandCash, BCH’s price spiked but has since corrected itself. At press time, BCH is trading at $1,113.43 a coin, down -5.09 %, in 24 hours.\nBitcoin Cash is expanding and will be available to tens of thousands of convenience stores in Japan soon, and Tron has its token migration in close to two weeks. This is good news for both projects and should impact its price positively shortly.

They don’t qualify for cash seizures, which are a function of physical money. A recent case involves the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Customs and Border Protection (CBP). TSA agents contacted CBP agents on October 27, 2017 when they noticed that a traveler was carrying large sums of cash in his carry-on luggage. The cash belonged to Rustem Kazazi, a 64-year-old Cleveland resident and former police officer from Albania, who was traveling from Cleveland to Newark, New Jersey, en route to Albania.\nAccording to a federal lawsuit filed last week by the Institute for Justice on Kazazi’s behalf, Kazazi was strip searched and interrogated about the large sum of cash in the amount of $58,100. Without any charges filed, the CBP seized all of the money, his passport and driver’s license, and released Kazazi, who was free to continue his trip to Albania.\nKazazi alleges that his life savings were seized illegally and he wants it back. He and his family, who were all traveling together, were planning to fix up a family home and possibly buy a home on the coast. They were also intending to use some of the money to help extended family members in Albania. Court documents indicate that the money was saved income from lawful jobs and that they have tax documents and bank statements covering 13 years to prove it.\nCash seizures are not uncommon. The CBP reports a range of instances, particularly involving family members who split up while traveling, each taking a cash portion of a lump sum in order to avoid having to report an aggregate amount that exceeds the $10,000 limit.\nIn Kazazi’s case, the family had not yet attempted to leave the United States, as they were attempting to board a domestic flight from Cleveland to New Jersey.\nFor international travelers, currency is reported by filling out FinCEN Form 105 and handing it to a CBP officer when entering or exiting the country. Currency includes “all negotiable monetary instruments such as Traveler’s Checks, money orders and securities.”\nBitcoin, a digital currency that has no physical form, is transmitted from country to country, crossing borders, virtually. It’s analogous to an email, compared to physical fiat which is similar to a letter that has to be transported or transferred from point A to B. Fiat is usually carried on one’s person for individual transactions or transported by armored truck for commercial purposes. Bitcoin is sent by desktop computers, laptops and mobile phones.\nAdvocates of Bitcoin, which is the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, point out that it can cross borders without banks. It requires no intermediaries or financial services to complete transactions. Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

But, the thing is, what powers their nemesis, cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is not going anywhere anytime. It is changing how things are being done. Unfortunately, playing along is but inevitable. So, over the weekend Bittrex through their CEO Bill Shihara did announce that they now have a new partnership with New York’s signature. Sponsored Links\n— へんなゆうちゅうばぁCHOPE (@YouTuberCHOPE) June 3, 2018\nIn their agreement, customers in some US states would directly purchase cryptocurrencies using their US Accounts. Of course, this applies to customers who have an account with signature and comply with the always tight KYC and AML rules which stifle innovation and creativity. If this goes through, Bill Shihara said, then a better environment would exist which would foster business for banks and crypto exchanges who are already working hard to sync with regulatory stipulations.\nWhile this is happening in the US, Japanese corporations are taking crypto to a new level. While laying their new strategy, Abic Corporation said they shall, beginning June 1-On Friday last week-offer Bitcoin secured loans. This is a smart move because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency capital gains are subject to tax which is “sometimes high as 55 percent”.\n— Kevin Helms (@kevinhelms01) June 3, 2018\nWith this initiative, Bitcoin holders can access JPY loans without necessarily liquidating their coins and as you can see, this is overwhelmingly beneficial for BTC users. Bitcoin is the only collateral and borrowers can get up-to $9.13 million or 1 billion Japanese Yen enjoying up-to 15 percent in annual interest rates. Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Weekly Chart by Trading View\nIf we draw a trend line to gauge the direction of price action then we can see that bears are in charge in this time frame. That’s when we consider the last five months price action. In the last quarter though, prices have been “all over the place” if we may say but the last two months events are changing our view on trend direction. Bitcoin prices are bottoming out and we can compare April and May candlestick where the former was extremely bullish with prices testing $10,000 before that correction in May.\nOur metrics indicate that last month was a long covering event with lower lows recovering more than 70 percent of April gains simply because participation was low. The average weekly volumes in April were about 170K while in April it’s above 200K. After last week’s bullish candlestick and rejection of lower prices albeit high volumes is an indication of bear pressure exhaustion and a possible shift of momentum. Daily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nFor buyers to be truly in charge what I need to see is a surge past $7,800 and $8,000. It’s that simple and clear and that’s why despite these streams of bullish candlesticks, nothing is conclusive until we see Bitcoin supporters pulling our buy triggers at $7,800.\nConsidering how price action is shaping out in the daily chart, we might see that happening today and for that to happen, we must see a spike in participation as that minor resistance is hit. Afterwards, we might be free to buy on pullbacks on lower time frames and aim first at $10,000.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dalmas ngetich | jun", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dalmas ngetich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill shihara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price technical analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "btc) price technical analysis", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T03:15:02.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de83ba4835444d49365036a9c07b7fb184f7afee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyeRjYGVLJTCICekTbROep9CSzfbvoB1iDcs9ZYJmgE0x2qdXEWrS6yfo1a50lJdZK9l74ey0A7l4gIRzIVotG9zBxao0aX4KKs0SLVdWjxA--", "site_full": "coinspectator.com", "site": "coinspectator.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports", "tech", "adult", "social", "climbing", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "If Bitcoin stays above here, buy these here | Digital Currency News,Coin Clarity,Bitcoin,Analysis - CoinSpectator", "title_full": "If Bitcoin stays above here, buy these here | Digital Currency News,Coin Clarity,Bitcoin,Analysis - CoinSpectator", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.048, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de83ba4835444d49365036a9c07b7fb184f7afee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyeRjYGVLJTCICekTbROep9CSzfbvoB1iDcs9ZYJmgE0x2qdXEWrS6yfo1a50lJdZK9l74ey0A7l4gIRzIVotG9zBxao0aX4KKs0SLVdWjxA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "If Bitcoin Stays Above Here", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "If Bitcoin stays above here, buy these here | Digital Currency News,Coin Clarity,Bitcoin,Analysis - CoinSpectator", "text": "If Bitcoin stays above here, buy these here\nPublished 1 minute ago by Jonathan Morgan Digital Currency News Coin Clarity Bitcoin Analysis Bitcoin is, again, sitting right against a strong resistance Gann angle.

The highlighted red box shows a confluence zone of the inner arc, a natural harmonic pivot, and a minor Gann angle. Based on the 4 hour chart, Bitcoin Gold will enter a breakout entry at the 47.12 area.Bitcoin Gold frequently lags the market but does return to equal value given time. However, if the Bitcoin breakout happens, the next entry in EOS is at a return and a cross above the Conversion Line at 15.56. But if we want to wait for the Bitcoin breakout, then we need to look at the breakout here of the lagging span to cross above the cloud. Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service.

Starting today, the mega corporation’s crypto spot trading service is available for approximately 20,000 users. Its full crypto exchange launch for the general public is set for next month with two additional cryptocurrencies.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space\nSBI Exchange Partially Launched\nSBI Holdings announced on Monday, June 4, that its wholly-owned subsidiary, SBI Virtual Currencies, has launched a cryptocurrency exchange service called Vctrade. “We have officially announced the availability of the virtual currency exchange service ‘Vctrade’,” the company wrote.\nVctrade is currently available only to users who pre-registered in October last year. “We began mailing passwords etc. necessary for transactions to more than 20,000 customers who had applied to open accounts in advance…We [will] accept applications for general account opening in July,” Nikkei elaborated.\nAccording to Itmedia, the “Applications for general account opening will be accepted from July 18.”\nWhile claiming to have “the industry’s lowest spread,” SBI confirmed:\nAs [for] the virtual currencies handled, first of all, we deal with XRP, [then] sequentially, bitcoin (BTC), [and] bitcoin cash (BCH).\nAccording to Business Insider Japan, “BTC and BCH will start trading” by the July launch.\nService Details\nAt present, the only currency pair listed on the exchange’s website is XRP/JPY for spot trading. There is no transaction fee and settlement is made in Japanese yen. The withdrawal free, tax included, is 51 yen for any amounts withdrawn to SBI Sumishin Net Bank, an Internet bank jointly established by SBI Holdings and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. For withdrawals to all other financial institutions, the fee, including tax, is 165 yen for any amounts of less than 30,000 yen and 258 yen (tax included) for any amounts over that threshold.\nIn terms of security, SBI explained that it is collaborating with Secom Trust Systems “on the operation of [a] wallet and we will strive to provide services in a perfect system.”\nA Licensed Exchange\nSBI Virtual Currencies became a fully licensed crypto exchange operator in Japan in September last year. It is among the only 16 government-approved exchanges in the country.\nThe company was going to launch its exchange last year but postponed in December, citing the need “to strengthen the account opening application acceptance system.” In February, the company further postponed the launch of the exchange, stating that it “decided that it will take a certain amount of time to further strengthen security measures, how to manage assets under custody, and customer management system in user conservation of virtual currency exchange operators.”\nIn addition, SBI Holdings also had plans to partner with Huobi Group to develop its crypto business in Asia, focusing on China. However, in March, the company decided to “stop the capital and business tie-up with the Huobi Group,” in order “to build a system with robust security and sufficient processing capacity by utilizing SBI Group’s resources” instead.\nWhat do you think of SBI’s crypto exchange?

In a recent interview with CNBC , the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.”\nWozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked.\nHe also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.”\n“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed.\nWozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nThis is not the first time Wozniak has been vocally positive about bitcoin. At a Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, the Apple co-founder lauded the cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology as stronger and more financially sound than both gold and USD. He stated that traditional currencies are “kind of phony,” as they are widely vulnerable to inflation, and that the problem with gold is that there is no fixed supply.\n“There is a certain amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,” he continued. “Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated, and nobody can change mathematics.”\nWozniak also called for further regulation efforts , saying they were crucial to bitcoin’s survival.\n“Regulation is an essential element to the fintech transformation happening today,” he exclaimed. “Fairness, equality and truth is the foundation for good regulation and that will lay the groundwork for good development.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nSource: BitCoin Magazine ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "news apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T09:46:06.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb12e9421414af2421dcf15ac1e1d26cf1a82637", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSExt2l7rX.o2drSOOxaRXDauD4oz10jbOSK6Jfgrvnk.pG6cMexHtiCmC9IXqmUzksk4JOl87HS.Jc6MQPeNhExTj4KhId7GYwKtH5UHT.kt_9HWWKoyoJwxBU9dNEvRNdg--", "site_full": "bitcoin-notes.com", "site": "bitcoin-notes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Japanese Bank SBI Announces Opening Of Cryptocurrency Exchange VCTRADE – Bitcoin Notes", "title_full": "Japanese Bank SBI Announces Opening Of Cryptocurrency Exchange VCTRADE – Bitcoin Notes", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.096, "main_image": "https://bitcoin-notes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Japanese-Bank-SBI-Announces-Opening-Of-Cryptocurrency-Exchange-06-04-2018.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb12e9421414af2421dcf15ac1e1d26cf1a82637", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSExt2l7rX.o2drSOOxaRXDauD4oz10jbOSK6Jfgrvnk.pG6cMexHtiCmC9IXqmUzksk4JOl87HS.Jc6MQPeNhExTj4KhId7GYwKtH5UHT.kt_9HWWKoyoJwxBU9dNEvRNdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Japanese Bank SBI Announces Opening Of Cryptocurrency Exchange VCTRADE – Bitcoin Notes", "text": "by info · June 4, 2018\nSBI continues to take cryptocurrency seriously, becoming the first Japanese bank to create its own cryptocurrency exchange.

The processor converts BCH to pesos immediately, allowing merchants from Colombia to accept BCH. He continues on to reveal the that the supposed Bitcoin rival, BCH, is being rolled out as a payment option in thousands of stores in Japan:\n“I didn’t post it or talk about it publically yet but we just had a meeting over this week; Bitcoin Cash is coming to tens of thousands of convenient stores in Japan and you’ll be able to buy anything in the entire convenient store with Bitcoin Cash which means including like paying your electric bill”.\nVer continued by reminiscing about the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and its maiden purchases of pizza and coffee; implying that BCH is following in its stead.\nThis announcement came very close to the current bull run which seems to be elevating the market.\nRoger Ver has yet to take to Twitter to announce this momentous step for BCH but did tweet out stats from Moneytoken pointing to BCH as ‘superior’ to BTC. Interesting that more people are already using BCH than BTC as a store of value on https://t.co/gfsnKHSnbR pic.twitter.com/uXOMu92DlF — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) June 2, 2018\nThis has been met with some controversy by Twitter users who call out Ver for being an advisor of Moneytoken but not declaring it within the post. You’re an advisor of MoneyToken and there really isn’t much funds tied up in MoneyToken anyways.

Bitcoin Searches Take a Nosedive\nFigures from Google Trends don’t paint a pretty picture. Mid-December searches for Bitcoin were recorded at 100 out of a scale of 100. However, fast-forward six months later and Google Trends show that number at 10, a drop of 90 percent. From January, when results were pegged at 44, the decline in interest is over 75 percent.\nNotably, the results highlight that this time last year low figures for Bitcoin searches were recorded in June as well.\nAccording to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, this drop in interest is not a good sign for crypto prices, reports CNBC .\n“We use Google Trends to track search queries for ‘bitcoin’ as a proxy for potential new buyers,” he added. “Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.”\nSince the beginning of the year the number one digital currency has dropped in value by over 55 percent, and is currently trading at over $7,500, according to CoinMarketCap. Interestingly, while Colas admits that the company loves the idea of the cryptocurrency, he adds that his team are not fans of purchasing it at current levels.\nOthers, however, think that now is the perfect time to invest in the market.\nDan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital Management, a hedge fund company focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, was reported at the beginning of the month as saying that Bitcoin’s value may have reached a bottom, and that now is the time to buy.\nThe founder of the San Francisco-based company said on CNBC’s ‘ Fast Money ‘ that ‘all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.’ Back in April, Morehead also said that the worst could be over for the digital currency. He said then that was a good time to purchase Bitcoin, calling it a ‘ screaming buy ‘ when it was valued around $6,600.\nIt’s not just Bitcoin, though, that is feeling the brunt of disinterestedness from potential new traders. Google searches for other major cryptocurrencies have also declined. Ethereum is down by 85 percent since the beginning of the year; Ripple has dropped by 91 percent; and Bitcoin Cash has experienced a decline of 80 percent. Featured image from Shutterstock.

If the upward movement of bitcoin fades and the dominant cryptocurrency is unable to bounce back quickly to the higher end of $7,700, a bleed out to the $6,000 region can be expected. Conditional Rally\nThe corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,700 sparked significant optimism, especially amongst short-term bulls that have predicted the price of bitcoin would rebound back to the $10,000 region within June. While the $10,000 June target is still in play, another correction in the upcoming days will likely occur, given that the corrective rally from $7,040 has stopped at $7,700 and BTC has declined to $7,600.\nA short-term break out to the $8,000 region supported by the corrective rally from $7,040 was conditional, as it required the volume of BTC to spike and the cryptocurrency to sustain momentum at its weekly peak, in the $7,700 region.\nHowever, due to its low trading volume, BTC has failed to test a major short-term support level at $8,000 and fell to $7,600. A drop to $7,500 could result in BTC experiencing yet another minor correction, potentially to the higher end of $6,000.\nWhile the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of BTC is 43.3, it is not demonstrating an oversold condition for BTC. A further drop in BTC would not lead the RSI to drop by large margins and thus, a short-term turn around back to the $7,700 mark if BTC falls to $7,500 is unlikely.\nThe daily candle on June 4 was supposed to be the big short-term break for BTC, rising above the one-month descending trendline from May 6 and effectively establishing a bottom at $7,040. But, the recent decline in the price of BTC will likely send BTC back to the lower end of $7,000 or in worst case scenario, to the $6,000 region. Short-Term Not Important\nDespite the negative price trend of BTC, most multi-billion dollar hedge funds are still extremely optimistic in BTC and the entire cryptocurrency market.\nThe expected decline in the price of BTC is a 5 to 10 percent drop maximum, which could extend to 15 percent at its worst. But, as Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead stated, which oversees more than a billion dollars in cryptocurrencies and digital assets, hedge funds look at the 5 to 10-year trend of the market.\nIn the mid to long-term, Morehead stated that bitcoin is still a screaming buy, adding:\n“As digital tokens continue to multiply and gain wider use, the $400 billion crypto market could balloon to $4 trillion, and even $40 trillion is definitely possible. It’s the 10-year forecast.”\nIf BTC recovers gradually from the $6,000 to $7,000 region and establish major support levels with strong and volume in the upcoming months, the $20,000 to $50,000 BTC targets of large-scale investors can still be in play.\nOften, tokens enjoy a surge in volume and price when the price of BTC is increasing gradually and volume of the cryptocurrency market picks up. If BTC enters the $7,500 region, it is likely that tokens will experience a substantial drop in value, once again.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

It looked as if the price would reach the $8,000 level but instead it retreated several hundred dollars over today's trading ending up below the $7,500 level. CoinDesk\"s analysis CoinDesk's analysis which came out earlier this morning noted that there was a low volume indicating what it calls a \"bull trap\". The price had broken through a key trendline through the May 6 high to the May 21 high back last Sunday which together with last Tuesday's outside-day-candle signaled a short-term change to a bullish trend. However, trading volumes have been falling. Rolling 24-hour trading volume is at $4.95 billion down fully 22.5 percent from the current quarterly average of $6.38 billion. The low volume should be of concern as it is a sign that a rally has peaked and will be short-lived. As the analysis was posted at 10:00 UTC bitcoin was trading at $7,591 on Bitnex, down about two percent from the previous day's close of $7,718. A slight pull back should come as no surprise. CoinDesk says that the decline in trading volume negates the bullish signs previously noted and puts into question whether the rally from the May 29 low of $7,040 through the Sunday night high of $7,779. However, the 4-hour chart shows volumes are picking up as the price fell back to $7,549 from a high of $7,764. This may indicate the possibility of a fall back to last week's low of $7,040. CoinDesk's outlook On the basis of its analysis CoinDesk predicts the following: \"The upside break of the falling trendline has opened the doors for a rise to $8,000. However, low volumes may indicate a false breakout. A downside break of the rising wedge seen in the 4-hour chart would allow a drop to $7,040. Only a high-volume break above $7,700 could yield a sustainable rally to $8,000.\" Present situation June 4th was definitely a down day for bitcoin. The price opened at $7,711. 36 but ended up closing at $7,490.49 well over two hundred dollars below its open. The high was only $7,754 although above the $7,700 level that could lead to a challenge of the $8,000 level but perhaps the volumes then were still low. However, the low was just $7,456 far from the $7,040 level mentioned by the CoinDesk analysis. It is now one hour into June 5 UTC. The bitcoin price is marginally up since the open of $7,490, at $7,493. We will have to wait and see whether the down trend continues or if the price may begin to recover again and penetrate the $8,000 level. For now, it appears stuck in the mid-range between $7,000 and $8,000.

Bitcoin Developers Call For GitHub Exit\nThe takeover, which anonymous sources claim should see an official announcement later Monday, has led to multiple calls to remove Bitcoin activity from the code repository.\nGithub had previously stated it would strive to remain independent, even planning an IPO in 2017. The company’s CEO and co-founder Chris Wanstrath resigned in August, with executives “struggling” to find a suitable replacement since, Business Insider reported when it first broke the news Friday.\nBitcoin development has traditionally used the website as a global participation environment. Unsurprisingly, news of a corporate takeover failed to impress community figures, who demanded Bitcoin activity be taken elsewhere.\n“Yes,” Bitcoin core developer Wladimir J. van der Laan wrote on Twitter when asked whether developers should abandon GitHub permanently.\n“No real hurry, but I expect this is the beginning of a long painful road of (GitHub) toward obsolence (sic), possibly ending the same way as codeplex did,” he explained.\nTo be clear: many bitcoin core contributors already preferred moving to independently hosted infrastructure in the long run. This may or may not speed it up. Rival Service Sees 10X Growth\nOthers continued the narrative that Microsoft would stunt the project’s potential.\n“There is no GitHub replacement, we all know (Microsoft) will run it into the ground,” one Twitter comment reads in response to criticism of the potential bill Microsoft paid for ownership.

We are used to hearing stories about established men from the legacy system telling us how terrible Bitcoin is for the world. The only thing it is good for is money laundry, drugs, terrorism etc. As Andreas Antonopoulos says, then Bitcoin would not be real money, if it could not be used for those purposes. Real money can be used in general. Surprise. Guess what is still the biggest currency used for those illegal activities? Normal fiat currencies. Bitcoin can bring so much more positive to the world than negative. I have always felt that, but recently I got involved with a project, where a specific use case stared me right in the face. https://mathbot.com (still very early stage) is a website, where kids and adults from anywhere around the world can go and learn math and programming. This is done by programming a robot to solve first very simple tasks to increasingly more complicated tasks. It is a game. It is fun. This is free for everyone and will no doubt have a positive impact on the world. Where does Bitcoin come in? If parents wants to incentivize kids, they can pay any amount they like and feel is sufficient and then the kid will earn back 90 percent of that amount at each level they pass. This carrot might go a long way in the industrialized world, where kids have a lot of choices of things to do and games to play, which can be hard to compete with for an educational game. Enter Bitcoin . If this payment from parents to the open source organisation was with credit cards, then charge back fraud would absolutely finish off the project financially. Bitcoin is non-reversible transactions and thereby enables this project to exist and finance the development of a game that hopefully will have a lot of positive impact in this world. Advertisement advertisement Already it is a huge advantage for merchants to receive non-reversible transaction, but it is the first time, where I have seen that a positive impact project would otherwise not even have been possible. Thanks to Satoshi for making this a better world! The end. No need to read any further, the rest is just personal. When I was a kid my grandfather offered me that for each multiplication table I would learn, he would pay me 20 Danish Krones. At the time (before money printing inflation) that was a good amount for a young boy. So my sister would teach me and I would rehearse and then go for the test. I loved it. I learned the multiplication tables and made a buck at the same time. If a financial incentive can work for me, it will also work for other. Maybe not all, but for some. I am pretty optimistic about that. I was bored in kindergarden and wanted to start in school one year earlier than what the law prescribed. So I convinced my parents to go talk to the school and to convince them to let a motivated kid start earlier. I was naturally told that certainly NOT was going to be the case. I had to start at the same age as everyone else. Somebody wants to learn and you squash it? How dare you!? At least if someone could have given me Mathbot, then I could just have learning math and programming. And you know what, by the time I started school I could be helping the teacher, because there is no one holding you back saying that you can only learn one year of math per year. Scary thought right? I could have progressed to high level math before starting school. Why don’t we offer this opportunity to our kids? Going through 1st to 9th grade in Denmark, they were not allowed to do split education. I was not challenged enough so by the time I reached high school math all of a sudden went from super easy to pretty hard. I wish I could constantly have been challenged at the level where I was. This is another problem that Mathbot solves. But hey, it is free to play, why don’t you test it out and let us know if there are any bugs still to be fixed. We might just all learn something 😉 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mediu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andreas antonopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anders kargaard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "guest post", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "mathbot", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T11:01:46.099+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58f5000e0a603d62ace2e7524f2dcaddbaebb181", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyXxhQEYUoDsWjd8AXOBayQ-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Highest Paying Bitcoin Website", "title_full": "The Highest Paying Bitcoin Website", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58f5000e0a603d62ace2e7524f2dcaddbaebb181", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyXxhQEYUoDsWjd8AXOBayQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Highest Paying Bitcoin Website", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nUse your personal link to invite more people and increase your chances of winning.

A TASE shell company has switched its focus from trying to enter the blockchain racket to newer trends like the legal cannabis business.\nAlso Read: Huobi Creates Its Own Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) Fantasy Blockchain\nFantasy Network is a shell company traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: FNTS). On Monday the company announced drastic changes to its leadership, ending all the plans it previously had to enter the blockchain space. The company’s CEO quit last week after FNTS attempt to merge with A2Z Blockchain Technologies failed.\nFNTS has switched its focus a number of times in recent years. At one point it was a Biotech company, specializing in the cryo-preservation of amniotic fluid stem cells. Later it was in the online gaming business, offering technology solutions to fantasy sports operators, hence the name. Its plans to enter the blockchain space were first announced by Fantasy Network about six months ago.\nOn December 10, 2017, following the company’s report that it was examining the possibility of operating in the field, the company’s stock price skyrocketed by hundreds of percentages within a few days. However, towards the end of December, following warnings by then-chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, Prof. Shmuel Hauser, about preventing “backdoor listing” by bitcoin-related companies, the FNTS share plummeted back down. Cannabis Business\nThe decision by the board of directors to remove the previous leadership came after several of the company’s shareholders claimed that the board had made “wrong decisions” in a manner that “jeopardized the company’s continued normal operations.” They thought that the merger deal was miscalculated and that “the risk inherent” will harm the shareholders in the company. “This is a research company, with unproven technology, and its value is not based on an income forecast.”\nThe shareholders who requested the cancellation of the merger deal added that they intend to “work to create significant value for the company.” And for this purpose they “examined a number of alternative deals in areas that are preferable, for example in cannabis, which is an evolving and regulated field.”\nWhat does this development mean for “blockchain” companies?

Users with Japanese IP addresses will be asked to provide their residency information within the exchange’s know-your-customer (KYC) procedure to prove they are not residents of Japan.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Suspending Services in Japan\nHitbtc, the world’s eighth largest crypto exchange according to Coinmarketcap, has announced a service suspension for Japanese residents.\nOn its website, the Hong Kong-based exchange added a new section called Service Restriction to the Legal Information page of its Terms of Service. “You shall not use our services and immediately cease using those if you are a resident or become a resident at any time of the state or region where Hitbtc is not authorized to act,” the exchange wrote, adding:\nFor the avoidance of any doubt and in accordance with the Japan Payment Services Act, Hitbtc has temporarily suspended providing virtual (crypto) currency exchange services to residents of Japan.\nThe exchange elaborated, “In case our technology detects that you use our services from an IP address registered in Japan, or any other services registered in Japan, you would be asked to confirm that you are not a resident of Japan by providing information on your residency within KYC procedure.”\nThe exchange subsequently posted a notice on its website on Sunday confirming the suspension, reiterating that it “will apply only to those living in the country.”\nHit Solution Ltd provides access to crypto assets exchange platform under the registered trademark Hitbtc. Since 2013, the platform “has been providing markets for bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, dogecoin, monero, USDT, and more than 300 cryptocurrencies in total,” its website details. The exchange’s 24-hour trading volume at the time of this writing is $281,395,577. Avoiding Trouble with the Regulator\nThe Japanese Payment Services Act that Hitbtc refers to went into effect in April last year, legalizing cryptocurrency as a means of payments.\nHowever, it also mandates any crypto exchanges operating in the country to register with the country’s financial authority, the Financial Services Agency (FSA). So far, 16 crypto exchanges have been granted a license to operate and the same number were allowed to operate while their applications are pending. Out of the latter 16, the FSA recently revealed that 8 have indicated that they are withdrawing their applications.\nThe agency has also warned some exchanges that have been operating in Japan without a license. Among them was Binance, the exchange whose 24-hour trading volume often tops the list of the world’s largest. On May 23, the agency sent a letter to Binance and its representative, CEO Changpeng Zhao, warning them about operating in Japan without a license.

A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. As of January 1, bitcoin's popularity was 37 and fell to a 9 as of June 2.\nColas also uses wallet growth as a proxy for interest, and said even small demand is a determinant for bitcoin prices. Wallets store the public and private keys which can be used to trade, or receive cryptocurrencies.\nGrowth in new wallets was roughly 2 percent in both April and May, and first-quarter compounded monthly wallet growth was 3.7 percent this year, Colas said. But for the last quarter of 2017 when bitcoin prices were nearing $20,000, wallet growth compounded monthly was 7.6 percent.\n\"The comparisons between the 2017 back half comps (excellent) and 2018-to-date (poor) are stark and explain essentially all of bitcoin's fall from grace this year,\" Colas said. \"Simply put, history shows bitcoin wallet growth needs to be +5%/month to see meaningful price appreciation.\"\nBitcoin prices have dropped by roughly 50 percent this year, trading just below $7,500 Monday, according to CoinDesk. The world's first and largest cryptocurrency surged more than 1,300 percent last year, nearing $20,000 in December.\n\"This dog will have its day, but today isn't it,\" Colas said. \"While we love the idea of bitcoin (and own a little ourselves), we are not fans of buying it at current levels.\"\nGoogle searches for most other top cryptocurrencies has also cratered. For ethereum , the world's second largest cryptocurrency, searches are down 70 percent this year. XRP searches have fallen even more sharply, down 87 percent since January 1. Searches for the fourth largest digital currency, bitcoin cash are down 82 percent.\nBut for EOS , the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, searches gone in the opposite direction. Google searches for that term have jumped 97 percent this year.\nMuch of that could be due to the company's recent fundraising efforts through what's known as an initial coin offering, or ICO. Start-up Block.one raised more than $4 billion through the cryptocurrency in a yearlong ICO that closed Friday.\nUnlike an IPO, which gives investors stock ownership in a company, an ICO gives out tokens whose use case is based on a promise the platform will be useful in a digital network once it gets built.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nicholas colas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google trends", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datatrek research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T19:34:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4acf9e9bbc4445e4efd7978fba2d366ae6e16d9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RmGhr604sW9TThvn9hd0.kqhSsy37WNQBvRjHa9Kn81PrapZF.d_ZR9iZ6Y7lmJhi7WRBI1SAKIKkB.apOH1Zpc-", "site_full": "www.marketslant.com", "site": "marketslant.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Respite for Bitcoin Traders Might Be Deceptive | News and views from a different angle", "title_full": "Respite for Bitcoin Traders Might Be Deceptive | News and views from a different angle", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://www.marketslant.com/sites/default/files/field/image/bitcoin-alert-2018-06-04-01.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4acf9e9bbc4445e4efd7978fba2d366ae6e16d9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RmGhr604sW9TThvn9hd0.kqhSsy37WNQBvRjHa9Kn81PrapZF.d_ZR9iZ6Y7lmJhi7WRBI1SAKIKkB.apOH1Zpc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Respite for Bitcoin Traders Might Be Deceptive | News and views from a different angle", "text": "Get the daily Marketslant newsletter Respite for Bitcoin Traders Might Be Deceptive By MarketSlant Editor 0\nThere seems to be some respite for Bitcoin traders. It might be tempting to take this breather as a sign of the tide turning. We highlight the reasons why you probably shouldn’t.\nIn the last couple of days, Bitcoin has gone up a bit. This has brought questions if the current move is only a correction within a decline or already an important sign of a shift in the market. In an article on CoinDesk, we read :\nBitcoin looks primed for a move to $8,000, but low trading volumes point to the risk of a bull trap.\nThe cryptocurrency broke through a key descending trendline (drawn through the May 6 high to the May 21 high) on Sunday, adding credence to last Tuesday's bullish outside-day candle and signaling a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.\nHowever, at the same time, daily trading volume fell 1.77 percent to $4.85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Further, rolling 24-hour trading volume currently stands at $4.95 billion – down 22.5 percent from the current quarterly average of $6.38 billion.\nLow volume is a cause for concern for the bulls, as it is widely considered a sign that the market is approaching a peak; that is, the rally will be short-lived.\nWe have a slightly different take on whether Bitcoin is set to move above $8,000 – the currency might shoot up above this level but we haven’t really seen enough signs that this is the case just yet. Other than than, we generally support the conclusions of the cited couple of paragraphs.\nBitcoin is up and it went above the declining resistance line but this line might have just turned out to stop the appreciation. The declining volume seems to be a classic bearish indication. And we might see a daily close below this line today, which would be bearish as well. We still think that a move up can’t be ruled out but the move down we’ve seen today weakens the recent bullish signs.\nAny Important Bullish Implications?\nOn BitStamp, we see the recent move up and the depreciation of today. The appreciation of the last couple of days brought Bitcoin above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level and this is a slightly bullish indication. Only slightly, because this particular level is not an extremely important one.\nA more bullish indication is the breakout above the declining resistance line based on recent tops. This indicates that the move up might be stronger than the preceding ones but the fact that Bitcoin turned South today and is now closer to this level weakens the bullish implications slightly.\nHave we seen very important bullish indications, though? Not really. Bitcoin is still below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and the action hasn’t really changed the short-term outlook. And this is only for the short term, without really considering the bigger picture into account.\nVerification in Disguise\nOn the long-term Bitfinex chart, we see the depreciation from $10,000 and the recent appreciation in perspective. In particular, the recent move up does seem like a correction within a larger decline. This is further reinforced by the long-term declining trend line. It might be the case that today’s move down is a bounce back down off this line.\nAdditionally, we see that in spite of the recent move up, we haven’t really seen a move above the 78.6% retracement level based on the rally to the all-time high around $20,000/ Actually, it rather seems that we might have seen a verification of the breakdown below this level. This is a bearish indication, at least for the longer term.\nThe current situation is quite curious in terms of the price action. We are seeing a move up on relatively low volume followed by one day of depreciation and the current environment looks like the late stage of a short-term correction within a long-term decline. This means that, in our opinion, the situation is still bearish and we might see a stronger move to the downside in the next couple of weeks.\nSumming up, the decline might resume and become even deeper.\nIf you have enjoyed the above analysis and would like to receive free follow-ups, we encourage you to sign up for our daily newsletter – it’s free and if you don’t like it, you can unsubscribe with just 2 clicks.

These tickers should offer some solid long-term returns but without the extreme ups and downs of your average cryptocurrency.\nRead on to see why our panelists would prefer owning Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Square ( NYSE:SQ ) , and International Business Machines ( NYSE:IBM ) over taking massive risks with bitcoin today.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nA rising digital-payments player that's benefiting from new trends Chris Neiger (Square): There's a massive shift happening right now in how people pay for goods and how they pay each other. Cash (and credit cards) might still rule, but digital payments are undeniably the heir to the throne. The rise of Apple Pay, peer-to-peer (P2P) payment apps, and digital point-of-sale (POS) payment terminals mean that consumers have more options than ever before to pay for items -- and Square's hardware and services make it all possible.\nMost of Square's revenue comes from its transaction-based sales, which include payments using not only traditional cards but also wireless mobile transactions, including Apple Pay. Square's transaction-based revenue in the first quarter rose by 29% year over year to $523 million. That's great momentum for the company's largest revenue segment, but investors will be pleased to know that Square's software and services segment -- which includes its Instant Deposit service, which allows customers to gain immediate access to their funds, and Square's Caviar food-delivery company -- is booming. Software and services sales spiked 97% in the first quarter to $97 million.\nWhat's great about Square is that it's already positioned itself to adapt to the ever-shifting payment landscape. The amount of mobile P2P payments is expected to reach $244 billion in the next three years, and Square is already poised to benefit because its Square Cash app, which allows users to send payments to each other, already boasts 7 million monthly active users.\nInvestors who want some exposure to bitcoin should also know that Square's Cash app began allowing users to buy and sell bitcoin at the beginning of this year. The company generated $34 million in bitcoin sales in the first quarter and, after related expenses, ended up with $200,000 in profit from the transactions. That's not a lot, but it does prove that Square can easily accommodate new digital-payment trends as they emerge.\nIf you add to all of this the fact that Square's share price is up more than 300% over the past three years, it's easy to see how this company can give investors safe exposure to bitcoin and other digital-payment trends -- and deliver huge gains at the same time.\nBig, Blue, and on the rebound Anders Bylund (IBM): Yes, this is the good old Big Blue you and your grandfather always knew. But it's not the same old IBM, and that's exactly why I'd recommend it over investing in bitcoin today.\nFirst and foremost, IBM's stock is spring-loaded for a huge rebound. The company's shift to focusing on \"strategic imperatives\" has been a long and painful road, involving the sacrifice of large but low-growth revenue streams in the hardware markets for the promise of higher growth and wider margins in the future.\nAs a reminder, strategic imperatives initiative include sectors such as data analysis, artificial intelligence, mobile computing, and blockchain platforms. Yes, IBM is an early leader in employing the blockchain concept to solve business problems. It's the technology behind bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, with a twist -- IBM's blockchain tools are all about distribution and storage of important information.\nAt this point, IBM has reached a crucial tipping point, as about half of its total sales come from businesses under the strategic imperatives banner. That ratio is sure to keep rising thanks to the high-growth nature of these hand-picked focus areas . The strategic-imperatives focus is absolutely the right thing to do in the long run, even if the last few years have been difficult to watch.\nInvestors have punished IBM's stock over the last five years as the strategic remodeling led to more pain than profits. Today, Big Blue shares are trading at just 12 times trailing earnings and 15 times free cash flows. At the same time, a strong commitment to dividend increases combined with sliding stock prices to create a fantastic 4.5% dividend yield.\nSo you can get a piece of the blockchain action without ever touching a cryptocurrency and while also locking in a great dividend yield. IBM remains a well-run business with great returns on equity and solid cash flows. This company has been around for a hundred years, and management is not afraid to do whatever it takes to stick around for another century.\nCan you say that about bitcoin?\nImage source: Getty Images.\nGoing with a trusted technology stock Ashraf Eassa (Apple): Instead of buying bitcoin, I'd much rather scoop up shares of Apple. It's one of the most successful technology companies in the world, thanks in large part to its iPhone product category, which made up more than 62% of its revenue last quarter.\nOf course, while I think Apple is doing a good job of trying to diversify beyond the iPhone, particularly with its aggressive move into subscription services such as Apple Music, as well as the continued impressive growth of its App Store revenue, I like Apple's prospects ahead of the upcoming iPhone product cycle.\nIn particular, last year, Apple introduced three new iPhones -- two straightforward refreshes of its previous-generation models and one all-new device (with a huge price tag, to boot), the iPhone X. This year, if the rumor mill is correct, Apple will be bringing an entirely redesigned device at standard price points and will also be introducing a larger variant of its iPhone X.\nApple is poised to more aggressively compete at lower price points while also expanding its higher-end offerings, making its lineup far more compelling and opening up opportunities to gain highly profitable market segment share.\nIf my thesis plays out, Apple could see a solid boost in revenue and profit growth, which could ultimately send the stock higher. And, if I'm wrong, I don't think the stock would necessarily crater -- and the company still pays a decent dividend (the stock yields 1.52% as of this writing) as a consolation prize.\nThat, to me, seems like a far more sensible bet than buying bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris neiger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stocks bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business machines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motley fool", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T00:28:32.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d13e6b1796859442578b080857407553e73aa93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jeYyRfdwH6woMwrsKoKpx_S3FtUK8aMkVpNbFpFdmPjVRuXC40QW3yOZYGgW886c1Ms1NHGy.nG8_kYv1Pd0DA0O8lQZRNwoZXmehq3Xzvp0fyKYSxQ9GU17mJ0aBpdF3ofKv6d.W4SLw--", "site_full": "coindevil.com", "site": "coindevil.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Exchange Paxful Recognizes the Opportunity Cryptocurrency Offers Africa - CoinDevil", "title_full": "Bitcoin Exchange Paxful Recognizes the Opportunity Cryptocurrency Offers Africa - CoinDevil", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://coindevil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/43793/bitcoin-exchange-paxful-recognizes-the-opportunity-cryptocurrency-offers-africa.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d13e6b1796859442578b080857407553e73aa93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jeYyRfdwH6woMwrsKoKpx_S3FtUK8aMkVpNbFpFdmPjVRuXC40QW3yOZYGgW886c1Ms1NHGy.nG8_kYv1Pd0DA0O8lQZRNwoZXmehq3Xzvp0fyKYSxQ9GU17mJ0aBpdF3ofKv6d.W4SLw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Exchange Paxful Recognizes the Opportunity Cryptocurrency Offers Africa - CoinDevil", "text": "Bitcoin Price Sheds $800 In Drop to 1-Month Low 6304 Bitcoin hit a one-month low on Wednesday as its price slipped below $8,300 during afternoon trading.

Another One Bites The Dust\nAccording to the official ZenCash blog , at approximately 2:43 UTC on June 3rd, ZenCash became the target of a 51% attack.\nFor the uninitiated, a 51% attack is when a malicious person or group takes control of a blockchain through obtaining over 50% of the hashrate, allowing for the hacker(s) to take control of the network.\nHowever, ZenCash’s team was ready for a situation like this to occur.\nThe team quickly initiated an investigation on the hashrate distribution to confirm that it was, in fact, a 51% attack. While hash rates were being investigated, other members of the ZenCash team simultaneously contacted exchanges to increase confirmation times to help mitigate the risk of a double-spend.\nOnce the investigation was finished, the ZenCash team still found that there were two double-spent transactions. This meant that the hacker, whoever it was, was permitted to spend their 19,000 ZenCash two times, effectively doubling the worth of their ZenCash.\nAt current market values, the over 19,600 ZenCash which the hacker double-spent is worth around $558,000, not a figure to laugh at.\nZenCash’s price took a hit in direct correlation with the 51% attack. Just after the hack, ZenCash was from $30 to $28 and still has not fully recovered even though the attack has concluded.\nAccording to the aforementioned blog post, ZenCash ensured that all user funds were safe and encouraged worrisome investors to contact exchanges if deemed necessary.\nThe blog also mentioned that the team is also working with the exchange affected by the double-spend in an attempt to figure out who the hacker was;\nThe Zen team will continue monitoring the network and conducting forensic analysis with the affected exchange. All information gathered will be provided to the appropriate authorities. How Did This Happen?\nDue to the increasing number of PoW blockchains, it has become increasingly difficult to secure every single blockchain, as hashing power begins to spread thinly on some algorithms.\nAlthough ZenCash is still a relatively large cryptocurrency compared to some, the hashing power of ZenCash could still be taken over if enough money gets thrown at the problem.\nAt the time of the hack, the ZenCash blockchain was utilizing over 58 MSols/s. Although this is still a respectable number, it is likely that the hackers rented out a large amount of hash power through a service like NiceHash.\nSeeing as the hacker got away with over $550,000 worth of ZenCash as a result, it is fair to assume that the attack cost less than the value of their ZenCash.\nThese types of attacks have become quite common over the past month, with Verge, Bitcoin Gold, and Electroneum also falling suspect to this method of attack. Due to these attacks, many of these coin’s values took a large hit and still have not recovered.\nUnless a network is secured by an absurd amount of hashrate like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ZCash it is difficult for developers to fully secure a blockchain against a 51% attack.\nImage from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zencash", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T14:26:13.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e787e25be610572be903fc5982cbf8777821896", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuDoSvsdcMkA6SsS2X42BDstoCW6rqNpuZCHfhanutGNz5bHN7qjUifMp42Ae7wWaLSmMRA3AHDC8Nr9y8MO8KSFEDDf9c.AEO5QDsW4SHMZUch5OEyOgDj5COHEQnSgx9JphdMbwpwAk-", "site_full": "www.benzinga.com", "site": "benzinga.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Targets $8,161, Ethereum $648, Ripple $0.6925 If They Break Technical Resistance – Confluence Detector | Benzinga", "title_full": "Bitcoin Targets $8,161, Ethereum $648, Ripple $0.6925 If They Break Technical Resistance – Confluence Detector | Benzinga", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.971, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23263, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e787e25be610572be903fc5982cbf8777821896", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuDoSvsdcMkA6SsS2X42BDstoCW6rqNpuZCHfhanutGNz5bHN7qjUifMp42Ae7wWaLSmMRA3AHDC8Nr9y8MO8KSFEDDf9c.AEO5QDsW4SHMZUch5OEyOgDj5COHEQnSgx9JphdMbwpwAk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yohay Elam", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Targets $8,161, Ethereum $648, Ripple $0.6925 If They Break Technical Resistance – Confluence Detector | Benzinga", "text": "What are you waiting for?

In a recent interview with CNBC , the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.”\nWozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked.\nHe also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.”\n“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed.\nWozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nThis is not the first time Wozniak has been vocally positive about bitcoin. At a Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, the Apple co-founder lauded the cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology as stronger and more financially sound than both gold and USD. He stated that traditional currencies are “kind of phony,” as they are widely vulnerable to inflation, and that the problem with gold is that there is no fixed supply.\n“There is a certain amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,” he continued. “Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated, and nobody can change mathematics.”\nWozniak also called for further regulation efforts , saying they were crucial to bitcoin’s survival.\n“Regulation is an essential element to the fintech transformation happening today,” he exclaimed. “Fairness, equality and truth is the foundation for good regulation and that will lay the groundwork for good development.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "become the world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "progdemon steve wozniak wants bitcoin to become the world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T01:29:48.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84b7a2bb8e5d5c8e800c915f747af02703bc4931", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMveUVbQRPMUBBnwgR7lTxqMOPXUk2nouD8-", "site_full": "vid.staged.com", "site": "staged.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "", "title": "Staged - Bitcoin Q&A: Job opportunities with cryptocurrencies", "title_full": "Staged - Bitcoin Q&A: Job opportunities with cryptocurrencies", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://vid.staged.com/stage/thumb/5053563.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96355, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "84b7a2bb8e5d5c8e800c915f747af02703bc4931", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMveUVbQRPMUBBnwgR7lTxqMOPXUk2nouD8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Staged - Bitcoin Q&A: Job opportunities with cryptocurrencies", "text": "Investing - How to Swing Trade Stocks for Profit! https://t.co/dG3C3abLsQ #bitcoin #bitclub #blockchain https://t.co/gFDlmztEs9 Jun 4 Bitcoin Q&A: Job opportunities with cryptocurrencies https://t.co/WdkttVFQY8 #bitcoin #bitclub #blockchain https://t.co/v6kFRhpwO8 Jun 4 REFEREUM A TOP 20 COIN IN 2018? | MY FIRST ICO INVESTMENT https://t.co/tfirznTlG5 #bitcoin #bitclub #blockchain https://t.co/vmGx2LDfDw Jun 4 I use GetResponse to send newsletters and grow my business.

Price has been trading above an ascending trend line connecting the lows since May 29 and looks due for another test of support.\nApplying the Fibonacci retracement tool on the latest swing low and high shows that the 50% level lines up with the trend line around 123.20. A larger pullback could find support at the 61.8% Fib which coincides with an area of interest or former resistance around 120-122.\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the upside. In other words, the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. These moving averages are also within the area of interest to add to its strength as a floor. A break below this, on the other hand, could lead to another selloff.\nRSI is still pointing down to signal that bearish pressure is present. Stochastic appears to be on the move down as well, signaling that the correction could go on for a bit longer until the oscillators indicate oversold conditions. If any of the support areas hold, LTCUSD could make its way back up to the swing high at 130 or higher.\nCryptocurrencies staged a pretty solid rebound late last week, with some attributing the rallies to month-end flows. Others say that optimism for a new month has also led to investors reopening their long positions.\nBesides, a good number of positive developments were reported in the industry last week, as some countries like Uganda are warming up to bitcoin and blockchain. The launch of mainnet for Tron and EOS has also generated interest while conferences also featured some positive commentary from leaders in the industry.\nAt the same time, the dollar was on weaker footing due to trade war concerns, so much so that the currency shrugged off stronger than expected NFP data.

Source: Ticketfly Possibility Of Compromised Client Information\nStarting on the night of May 30, 2018, the security incident began with unusual activity on the Ticketfly website including a “V” image from the Hollywood movie ‘V for Vendetta’ and a message saying “Ticketfly HacKeD By IsHaKdZ. Your Security Down im Not Sorry.”\nWhile Ticketfly scrambled to ascertain the extent of the damage to their security infrastructure and contain it, someone claiming to be ‘IsHaKdZ,’ the purported hacker contacted the media claiming that he found a vulnerability in the Ticketfly website and was brushed off when he attempted to report it to them. Huh, well shoot. Not every day you see a site as high profile as @ticketfly get taken down. Take your security seriously. pic.twitter.com/JUGOjjwqkI\n— Michael Stenberg (@MichaelStenberg) May 31, 2018\nThe hacker went on to demand 1 BTC “for protection” from Ticketfly , and when he did not receive it, he publicly exploited the existing vulnerability, potentially compromising sensitive personal information about thousands of Ticketfly customers and vendors, including names, email addresses, phone numbers and physical addresses.\nMotherboard was able to confirm personal details of six users to be correct, implying that hacker managed to compromise the data of Ticketfly users. Latest Developments in Ticketfly Case\nSubsequent information released in a tweet by Ticketfly indicates that the breach is not yet over, as some Ticketfly services remain offline as the platform races to contain the embarrassing service outage.\nIt was earlier reported that the hacker threatened to release another database labeled ‘backstage,’ though as yet there is no indication as to what sort of data is contained therein.\nThe only available information came from a statement by a Ticketfly spokesperson who said:\n“We’ve determined that Ticketfly.com has been the target of a cyber incident. Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken all Ticketfly systems temporarily offline as we continue to look into the issue. We realize the gravity of this decision, but the security of client and customer data is our top priority. We are working tirelessly, and in coordination with leading third-party forensic experts, to get our clients back up and running.” Crypto Crimes on the Rise?\nThe incident is the latest in a growing pattern that sees bitcoin used as the currency of choice for hackers and blackmailers. In March 2018 , Atlanta’s government computers were attacked by the notorious WannaCry ransomware virus, with hackers demanding $51,000 in bitcoin before they would end the attack.\nThe following month, on June 1, 2018, BTCManager reported Chinese authorities arrested 97 people and recovered $267 million associated with OneCoin pyramid scheme. In a separate case, hackers demanded $1 million in XRP after stealing bank’s customer data.\nEarlier in January 2018, a hospital in Indiana, USA was hacked , with an unspecified ransom amount demanded in Bitcoin. Another ransom surfaced on May 25, this time a South African teen was kidnapped and the kidnappers demanded $120,000 in bitcoins.\nThe pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies makes them a hot target of hackers and criminals since cryptocurrencies are less likely to be detected than bank transfers or cash deals. Hackers who hacked Coincheck were able to launder over $500 million worth of NEM tokens on the deep web without anyone getting arrested.\nThese incidents are among a growing list of reasons for the increasing push by governments around the world to regulate bitcoin exchanges and mandate KYC frameworks for cryptocurrency trading platforms.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael stenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ticketfly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ticketfly possibility of compromised client information starting", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T19:56:05.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9fe4f072693e3d47da5de4e0d561b3efa65fca0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4e0ArESXtgWna.xNeGbiz_TagN_Qa.fOEwLhEe9fCRgmShGcs3FmXoDKi.gEpY0GzeyJUWYiZ1jmJR.bHbgRVENBNp72g9eakflJURU4HVGxIqeFjqJRN5w-", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Forget Bitcoin: You're Better Off Buying These 3 Stocks -- The Motley Fool", "title_full": "Forget Bitcoin: You're Better Off Buying These 3 Stocks -- The Motley Fool", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F484431%2Fbitcoin-confused.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1336, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9fe4f072693e3d47da5de4e0d561b3efa65fca0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4e0ArESXtgWna.xNeGbiz_TagN_Qa.fOEwLhEe9fCRgmShGcs3FmXoDKi.gEpY0GzeyJUWYiZ1jmJR.bHbgRVENBNp72g9eakflJURU4HVGxIqeFjqJRN5w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anders Bylund", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Forget Bitcoin: You're Better Off Buying These 3 Stocks -- The Motley Fool", "text": "This post was originally published on this site\nBitcoin prices have swung from $1,940 to $19,200 over the last year, only to crash back down again. Today, one bitcoin is worth $7,500. Some investors find these wild swings exhilarating and hope for more of the positive moves, but others can’t stand these roller-coaster rides.\nSo we asked a few of your fellow Motley Fool investors what they would recommend buying right now instead of bitcoin. These tickers should offer some solid long-term returns but without the extreme ups and downs of your average cryptocurrency.\nRead on to see why our panelists would prefer owning Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Square ( NYSE:SQ ) , and International Business Machines ( NYSE:IBM ) over taking massive risks with bitcoin today. Image source: Getty Images. A rising digital-payments player that’s benefiting from new trends\nChris Neiger (Square): There’s a massive shift happening right now in how people pay for goods and how they pay each other. Cash (and credit cards) might still rule, but digital payments are undeniably the heir to the throne. The rise of Apple Pay, peer-to-peer (P2P) payment apps, and digital point-of-sale (POS) payment terminals mean that consumers have more options than ever before to pay for items — and Square’s hardware and services make it all possible.\nMost of Square’s revenue comes from its transaction-based sales, which include payments using not only traditional cards but also wireless mobile transactions, including Apple Pay. Square’s transaction-based revenue in the first quarter rose by 29% year over year to $523 million. That’s great momentum for the company’s largest revenue segment, but investors will be pleased to know that Square’s software and services segment — which includes its Instant Deposit service, which allows customers to gain immediate access to their funds, and Square’s Caviar food-delivery company — is booming. Software and services sales spiked 97% in the first quarter to $97 million.\nWhat’s great about Square is that it’s already positioned itself to adapt to the ever-shifting payment landscape. The amount of mobile P2P payments is expected to reach $244 billion in the next three years, and Square is already poised to benefit because its Square Cash app, which allows users to send payments to each other, already boasts 7 million monthly active users.\nInvestors who want some exposure to bitcoin should also know that Square’s Cash app began allowing users to buy and sell bitcoin at the beginning of this year. The company generated $34 million in bitcoin sales in the first quarter and, after related expenses, ended up with $200,000 in profit from the transactions. That’s not a lot, but it does prove that Square can easily accommodate new digital-payment trends as they emerge.\nIf you add to all of this the fact that Square’s share price is up more than 300% over the past three years, it’s easy to see how this company can give investors safe exposure to bitcoin and other digital-payment trends — and deliver huge gains at the same time. Big, Blue, and on the rebound\nAnders Bylund (IBM): Yes, this is the good old Big Blue you and your grandfather always knew. But it’s not the same old IBM, and that’s exactly why I’d recommend it over investing in bitcoin today.\nFirst and foremost, IBM’s stock is spring-loaded for a huge rebound. The company’s shift to focusing on “strategic imperatives” has been a long and painful road, involving the sacrifice of large but low-growth revenue streams in the hardware markets for the promise of higher growth and wider margins in the future.\nAs a reminder, strategic imperatives initiative include sectors such as data analysis, artificial intelligence, mobile computing, and blockchain platforms. Yes, IBM is an early leader in employing the blockchain concept to solve business problems. It’s the technology behind bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, with a twist — IBM’s blockchain tools are all about distribution and storage of important information.\nAt this point, IBM has reached a crucial tipping point, as about half of its total sales come from businesses under the strategic imperatives banner. That ratio is sure to keep rising thanks to the high-growth nature of these hand-picked focus areas . The strategic-imperatives focus is absolutely the right thing to do in the long run, even if the last few years have been difficult to watch.\nInvestors have punished IBM’s stock over the last five years as the strategic remodeling led to more pain than profits. Today, Big Blue shares are trading at just 12 times trailing earnings and 15 times free cash flows. At the same time, a strong commitment to dividend increases combined with sliding stock prices to create a fantastic 4.5% dividend yield.\nSo you can get a piece of the blockchain action without ever touching a cryptocurrency and while also locking in a great dividend yield. IBM remains a well-run business with great returns on equity and solid cash flows. This company has been around for a hundred years, and management is not afraid to do whatever it takes to stick around for another century.\nCan you say that about bitcoin? Image source: Getty Images. Going with a trusted technology stock\nAshraf Eassa (Apple): Instead of buying bitcoin, I’d much rather scoop up shares of Apple. It’s one of the most successful technology companies in the world, thanks in large part to its iPhone product category, which made up more than 62% of its revenue last quarter.\nOf course, while I think Apple is doing a good job of trying to diversify beyond the iPhone, particularly with its aggressive move into subscription services such as Apple Music, as well as the continued impressive growth of its App Store revenue, I like Apple’s prospects ahead of the upcoming iPhone product cycle.\nIn particular, last year, Apple introduced three new iPhones — two straightforward refreshes of its previous-generation models and one all-new device (with a huge price tag, to boot), the iPhone X. This year, if the rumor mill is correct, Apple will be bringing an entirely redesigned device at standard price points and will also be introducing a larger variant of its iPhone X.\nApple is poised to more aggressively compete at lower price points while also expanding its higher-end offerings, making its lineup far more compelling and opening up opportunities to gain highly profitable market segment share.\nIf my thesis plays out, Apple could see a solid boost in revenue and profit growth, which could ultimately send the stock higher. And, if I’m wrong, I don’t think the stock would necessarily crater — and the company still pays a decent dividend (the stock yields 1.52% as of this writing) as a consolation prize.\nThat, to me, seems like a far more sensible bet than buying bitcoin.\nAnders Bylund owns shares of IBM and a fraction of a bitcoin. Ashraf Eassa has no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned. Chris Neiger has no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Square, but has no position in any cryptocurrencies at all. The Motley Fool has the following options: long January 2020 $150 calls on Apple and short January 2020 $155 calls on Apple.

Developers have taken measures to increase the difficulty of future attacks. The event-ticketing platform Ticketfly is also trying to recover from a hijack. 26 million accounts have been reportedly compromised by a hacker who asked for bitcoin ransom.\nAlso read: This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round Zencash Attacked with Two Double-Spends\nThe Zencash network has been targeted in a 51% attack on Saturday, June 2. The attacker managed to successfully perform two double-spend transactions while reorganizing the blockchain multiple times and reverting 38 blocks in the longest reorganization.\nAccording to a released statement , the Zencash team received warning of potential attack from a pool operator and took measures to raise the difficulty of future attacks on the network, contacting exchanges to increase confirmation times and recommending a minimum of 100 required confirmations.\nThe attacker(s) caused the reorganizations of the blockchain between blocks 318165 and 318275. They performed the double-spend attacks in blocks 318204 and 318234 – for 13,000 and 6,600 ZEN, respectively, worth more than $550,000 at current prices.\nAccording to the forensic analysis conducted with the affected exchange, the suspect pool address is znkMXdwwxvPp9jNoSjukAbBHjCShQ8ZaLib and the suspect exchange deposit address is zneDDN3aNebJUnAJ9DoQFys7ZuCKBNRQ115.\nAt the time of the attack the network’s hashrate was 58MSol/s. Developers believe that the attacker has a private mining operation large enough to conduct the attack and/or supplement with rental hash power. Zencash is a proof of work coin based on the equihash algorithm. All equihash-based networks are exposed to possible influx of new equihash power, the team noted. Ticketfly Hijacked by Hacker, Trying to Recover\nTicketfly has been reportedly attacked by a hacker who breached its website last week and demanded a ransom in bitcoin to release it. The event-ticketing platform is still trying to recover from the “cyber incident.” “We’re working to bring ticketfly.com back up as soon as possible,” its team said, notifying users that the site is offline.\nIn correspondence with Motherboard , the supposed hacker claimed to have warned Ticketfly of a vulnerability that allowed him to take control of its database and website. The hijacker asked for 1 bitcoin (BTC) to explain the issue in details but did not receive a reply. According to the publication, after no ransom was paid, the attacker posted the user data online.\n“We have learned that some customer information has been compromised as part of the incident, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers of Ticketfly fans,” the company admitted without revealing how many accounts have been affected. According the data breach tracking website haveibeenpwned.com, more than 26 million accounts have been compromised, Marketwatch reports.\nIt’s unclear whether any event tickets have been stolen but a number of promoters, clubs and upcoming shows have been affected by the breach. Ticketfly is owned by San-Francisco based Eventbrite, which bought the platform from Pandora Media in a $200 million deal about a year ago. Avalon Blockchain Unwinds Acquisition of Crypto Assets\nAvalon Blockchain Inc., formerly known as World Mahjong Ltd., has announced it has reached an agreement with Avalon Life S.A. to unwind the acquisition of crypto mining assets and cryptocurrencies it has previously bought. According to a press release, the two sides have not been able to reach a consensus in regards to the holding, conversion, trading, and arbitrage of the acquired digital currencies.\nWorld Mahjong Limited, a provider of online games and entertainment services, decided to enter the crypto sector through the acquisition of crypto mining abilities and cryptocurrency assets from the mining and community knowledge network Avalon Life SA and Avalon Projects Canada Inc. More than 27,000 ASIC mining machines were purchased, along with a number of Dash, Vivo, and Pura coins.\nEarlier this year it was reported that the company had also changed its name to Avalon Blockchain. In its latest statement, however, it said it was unable to execute its proposed business plan involving these crypto assets. Following the agreement with the vendor, Avalon Blockchain will return them to Avalon Life SA and will arrange the cancellation of 120,000,000 common shares that have been issued.\nAvalon Projects Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Avalon Blockchain, has completed the offering of 37,154,502 subscription receipts, at a price of $0.50 each. The company now intends to allow subscribers to rescind their subscriptions. All of them will be offered the option and will be entitled to a full refund of all subscription proceeds tendered to the company.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

Most people ask how to buy cryptocurrency in a safe way. On this occasion I will share information and reviews about the best and most popular exchange sites in the include types of coins / cryptocurrency that can be purchased on the exchange, as well as its payment methods.\nThe first thing to notice when looking for bitcoin exchanges is how secure websites and servers are. Locations usually give an idea of ​​what’s on offer. On this occasion I will review the full range of trading exchange cryptocurrency at binance.com, following binance.com review: Register Binance.com\nOn their site, it says they are capable of processing 1,400,000 orders per second! An impressive number if you consider the number of people who visit their site every day. The company had an initial ICO in July 2017 and after a few months, released their exchange site where their BNB coins can be used to pay for transaction fees. This is a website that has just entered online cryptocurrency trading.\nAvailable Coins for Binance.com TradingBitcoin, Ether, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Ripple, BNB, ARK, AST, BNT, BQX, BTG, CTR, DASH, DNT, ENG, ENJ, EOS, Monero, litecoin, and more! To get a complete list of available coins, please go to their website and create an account.\nEase of use Binance.com. This site is not created for new players in world exchanges. They do not have a guide that says what is where and directs new merchants to the right path! With that said, it would be wise to read more about exchange websites even before trying to trade on Binance.com if you are new to the world of commerce. In addition to the non-user-friendly interface, we’ve noticed that their website has absolutely no lag issues. This means that when we move from one tab to another, it all happens in a flash and you are not forced to wait in an awkward silence to get to the next page. When it comes to ease of use, we give them a good 7/10 experience because everything is going well, the only advantage we have is that we know like graphics and numbers. Register Binance.com\nBinance.com Customer Support. After all exploring with features and how to trade, it is time to see what kind of support they have for their customers. One of the important things in looking at an exchange / trading platform is knowing their customer service. We have emphasized on so many reviews that when it comes to money-handling websites, customer service is essential for its advancement as it bridges the gap between the company and the customer.\nHere, in Binance.com, registered customers can contact them through email support because they do not have a live chat system that is integrated into their website, maybe features to be added in the future.

Prices are bottoming up and that might be correct. We don’t want to tag along and buy with the crowd and that’s why we need to see our buy triggers at $7,800 if not $8,000 being hit in the coming days. That’s not all, for us to be confident that Bitcoin buyers would add to the five percent it has in the last week, then volume spikes must accompany that up-thrust. From The News\nIt is true that banks are really finding it hard to adjust to new competition. But, the thing is, what powers their nemesis, cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is not going anywhere anytime. It is changing how things are being done. Unfortunately, playing along is but inevitable. So, over the weekend Bittrex through their CEO Bill Shihara did announce that they now have a new partnership with New York’s signature. Bittrex、米ニューヨーク Signature Bankと提携へ https://t.co/W546yySpdX @YouTubeより\n— へんなゆうちゅうばぁCHOPE (@YouTuberCHOPE) June 3, 2018\nIn their agreement, customers in some US states would directly purchase cryptocurrencies using their US Accounts. Of course, this applies to customers who have an account with signature and comply with the always tight KYC and AML rules which stifle innovation and creativity. If this goes through, Bill Shihara said, then a better environment would exist which would foster business for banks and crypto exchanges who are already working hard to sync with regulatory stipulations.\nWhile this is happening in the US, Japanese corporations are taking crypto to a new level. While laying their new strategy, Abic Corporation said they shall, beginning June 1-On Friday last week-offer Bitcoin secured loans. This is a smart move because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency capital gains are subject to tax which is “sometimes high as 55 percent”. Japanese Corporation Begins Offering Loans Secured by #Cryptocurrency #btc #bitcoin #Abic https://t.co/WzISi7EYR4\n— Kevin Helms (@kevinhelms01) June 3, 2018\nWith this initiative, Bitcoin holders can access JPY loans without necessarily liquidating their coins and as you can see, this is overwhelmingly beneficial for BTC users. Bitcoin is the only collateral and borrowers can get up-to $9.13 million or 1 billion Japanese Yen enjoying up-to 15 percent in annual interest rates. Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Weekly Chart by Trading View\nIf we draw a trend line to gauge the direction of price action then we can see that bears are in charge in this time frame. That’s when we consider the last five months price action. In the last quarter though, prices have been “all over the place” if we may say but the last two months events are changing our view on trend direction. Bitcoin prices are bottoming out and we can compare April and May candlestick where the former was extremely bullish with prices testing $10,000 before that correction in May.\nOur metrics indicate that last month was a long covering event with lower lows recovering more than 70 percent of April gains simply because participation was low. The average weekly volumes in April were about 170K while in April it’s above 200K. After last week’s bullish candlestick and rejection of lower prices albeit high volumes is an indication of bear pressure exhaustion and a possible shift of momentum. Daily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nFor buyers to be truly in charge what I need to see is a surge past $7,800 and $8,000. It’s that simple and clear and that’s why despite these streams of bullish candlesticks, nothing is conclusive until we see Bitcoin supporters pulling our buy triggers at $7,800.\nConsidering how price action is shaping out in the daily chart, we might see that happening today and for that to happen, we must see a spike in participation as that minor resistance is hit. Afterwards, we might be free to buy on pullbacks on lower time frames and aim first at $10,000.\nCoinCapPrice CoinCapPrice – Cryptocurrency Market Capitalizations, The latest Bitcoin price for today (up to the minute).

According to Steve Wozniak, of the 1,500 cryptocurrencies in existence, only Bitcoin can be considered ‘pure.’ Wozniak Hopes for Bitcoin to Become a Single Global Currency\nIn an interview with CNBC on Monday, Wozniak stated that he hopes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s belief in Bitcoin will come true. The Apple co-founder made the following comments at the Money 2020 conference being held this week in Amsterdam:\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.”\nWozniak was referring to Dorsey’s comments back in March of this year. The founder and CEO of both Twitter and Square stated that he felt that a single currency would emerge for the internet and the world. He went on to state that this currency would be Bitcoin.\nAccording to the article in CNBC today, Wozniak had bought Bitcoin when each was around $700. He’d since sold all but one. However, even someone as technically capable as the co-founder of Apple was a still able to fall victim to a scam. He was defrauded out of a quantity of the digital currency when exchanging them back to dollars. In addition to his single Bitcoin, he also holds two Ether coins – the native currency on the Ethereum network.\nIn the interview today, Wozniak sang the praises of Bitcoin more astutely than many commentators are capable of. He spoke fondly of its qualities of decentralisation and limited supply, likening it to a natural phenomenon that doesn’t require human intervention to work:\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nFinally, Wozniak addressed the altcoin space . He claimed none could ultimately compete with Bitcoin since each must serve the company that created it. Again, the topic of decentralisation was raised in his assessment:\n“Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

Another One Bites The Dust\nAccording to the official ZenCash blog, at approximately 2:43 UTC on June 3rd, ZenCash became the target of a 51% attack.\nFor the uninitiated, a 51% attack is when a malicious person or group takes control of a blockchain through obtaining over 50% of the hashrate, allowing for the hacker(s) to take control of the network.\nHowever, ZenCash’s team was ready for a situation like this to occur.\nThe team quickly initiated an investigation on the hashrate distribution to confirm that it was, in fact, a 51% attack. While hash rates were being investigated, other members of the ZenCash team simultaneously contacted exchanges to increase confirmation times to help mitigate the risk of a double-spend.\nOnce the investigation was finished, the ZenCash team still found that there were two double-spent transactions. This meant that the hacker, whoever it was, was permitted to spend their 19,000 ZenCash two times, effectively doubling the worth of their ZenCash.\nAt current market values, the over 19,600 ZenCash which the hacker double-spent is worth around $558,000, not a figure to laugh at.\nZenCash’s price took a hit in direct correlation with the 51% attack. Just after the hack, ZenCash was from $30 to $28 and still has not fully recovered even though the attack has concluded.\nAccording to the aforementioned blog post, ZenCash ensured that all user funds were safe and encouraged worrisome investors to contact exchanges if deemed necessary.\nThe blog also mentioned that the team is also working with the exchange affected by the double-spend in an attempt to figure out who the hacker was;\nThe Zen team will continue monitoring the network and conducting forensic analysis with the affected exchange. All information gathered will be provided to the appropriate authorities. How Did This Happen?\nDue to the increasing number of PoW blockchains, it has become increasingly difficult to secure every single blockchain, as hashing power begins to spread thinly on some algorithms.\nAlthough ZenCash is still a relatively large cryptocurrency compared to some, the hashing power of ZenCash could still be taken over if enough money gets thrown at the problem.\nAt the time of the hack, the ZenCash blockchain was utilizing over 58 MSols/s. Although this is still a respectable number, it is likely that the hackers rented out a large amount of hash power through a service like NiceHash.\nSeeing as the hacker got away with over $550,000 worth of ZenCash as a result, it is fair to assume that the attack cost less than the value of their ZenCash.\nThese types of attacks have become quite common over the past month, with Verge, Bitcoin Gold, and Electroneum also falling suspect to this method of attack. Due to these attacks, many of these coin’s values took a large hit and still have not recovered.\nUnless a network is secured by an absurd amount of hashrate like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ZCash it is difficult for developers to fully secure a blockchain against a 51% attack.\nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Another Cryptocurrency Experiences 51% Attack, Following Bitcoin Gold and Verge appeared first on NewsBTC.

In a recent interview with CNBC , the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.”\nWozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked.\nHe also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.”\n“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed.\nWozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nThis is not the first time Wozniak has been vocally positive about bitcoin.

He told CNBC :\nI buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking. Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of Bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing.\nWozniack himself has previously invested in Bitcoin – buying at around $700, although he has since sold all but one of his supply, stating that his interests lie in the technology rather than the investment opportunity. Fixed Supply\nWozniack’s belief that Bitcoin is such a great candidate for being a single currency is founded on the idea that it is a limited supply – and that nothing can ever be done to artificially inflate it because of this. This, he feels, is the issue with fiat currency and with gold – the resource that Bitcoin is so often compared to. He said:\nGold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.\nDo you agree with Wozniak and Dorsey, or are you more of a Warren Buffet?

In a recent interview with CNBC , the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.”\nWozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked.\nHe also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.”\n“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed.\nWozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nThis is not the first time Wozniak has been vocally positive about bitcoin. At a Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, the Apple co-founder lauded the cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology as stronger and more financially sound than both gold and USD. He stated that traditional currencies are “kind of phony,” as they are widely vulnerable to inflation, and that the problem with gold is that there is no fixed supply.\n“There is a certain amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,” he continued. “Gold gets mined and mined and mined.

Updated: June 5, 2018, 4:34 PM IST Raj Kundra with Shilpa Shetty. (Image: Instagram/ Shilpa Shetty Kundra ) Mumbai: The ED on Tuesday questioned Raj Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, in connection with a money laundering probe related to a bitcoin transactions case, officials said. The businessman was summoned at the ED office and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government, they said. There are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating. The Enforcement Directorate (ED), sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. It is alleged that about 8,000 investors lost about Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme. The ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier. Bhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals. The central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments. It is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state. Last year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there are no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the RBI has not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies. The government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, saying they are like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection.

Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.
