Bitcoin has previously indeed started rising after hitting the USD 7,000 mark, and Sluymer believes this to be the first step in price recovery.\n“Bitcoin is stuck in purgatory,” Melissa Lee of CNBC begins, while Bob Pisani of the New York Stock Exchange says that the current narrow range of around USD 600 is unusual for Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Bitcoin futures trading volume fell since May, with Asian markets less intimidated than the US ones. The US Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory issues are also considered one of the constraints for cryptocurrency prices recently.\nGrowing numbers of trading desks for cryptocurrencies are also a surprising turn of events, as this may be the only area where those are rising. Guy Adami, an American trader, TV personality, and professional investor consider this healthy, as it speaks of the marketplace maturing.\nSluymer, meanwhile, points out that the long-term trend is still technically up when considering the graph of price fluctuation since 2016. All lows were a series of high lows compared to the previous ones. In his opinion, Bitcoin is currently in the bottoming phase, and now it’s at the point where it’s challenging its downtrend, but that it needs to get through USD 7,800 to prove its trend reversal.\nAs previously reported, according to a popular cryptoanalyst, Willy Woo, the USD 8,000 support was bound to give up. He thinks that the next support sits near USD 7,000, which may perhaps break if sellers remain in control.

According to data compiled by Upwork, Q1 of 2018 saw demand for blockchain experts increase by 6,000%. With the year-on-year stats skyrocketing off the back of bitcoin’s meteoric price rise in 2017, the workspace is now bursting with opportunities. For those operating in a freelance capacity, specialists can command up to $150 per hour as per ComputerWorld’s May 2018 report . Of those that drift into fulltime employment, blockchain developers can win $130,000 per annum, while software developers can bank $105,000.\n\" Bitcoin Private (BTCP) Blockchain \" ( CC BY 2.0 ) by Descryptive\nBy all measures, the cryptocurrency market is an employment goldmine but what opportunities can you take advantage of? On the technical side of things, engineers are the people that help program, develop and maintain blockchains. Although a degree in software engineering or computer science is crucial for anyone eyeing up these roles, additional training is also important. Because blockchain technology is still relatively new, traditional computer-based courses don’t cover it in as much detail as they otherwise would. This, however, could be set to change. When you read the latest bitcoin headlines at Coinlist , you’ll learn about how the major crypto companies are helping the industry to grow. The team at Ripple launched a $50 million initiative in 2018 to help universities improve their research into blockchain.\nWith academic institutions now being funded by the major players in the space, students have a better chance of finding employment. Away from the technical aspects of blockchain, analysts are going to become more important over the next decade. Tracking the latest trends, analyzing data and making financial predictions within the blockchain market is something all major businesses will need in the future. Indeed, as banks, tech companies and more start to become more active with blockchain, they’ll need analysts on board to help guide their development and investments. Similarly, as more businesses embrace this technology, they’ll need project managers to oversee the growth of blockchain departments. For example, when BBVA started the development of its blockchain-based system for handling corporate loans, it was a mere novice in the space.\n\" Blockchain is Worldwide \" ( CC BY 2.0 ) by Descryptive\nHowever, by adding blockchain experts to its existing team of banking pros, the company has been able to do something unique. With project managers helping to organize these fledging departments, companies like BBVA would struggle. Finally, as more people start to become aware of blockchain and all its capabilities, there will be a need for commentators, journalists and, potentially, social media experts. Just like any other industry in the world, people want to know what’s going on. Whether it’s CNN giving us the latest political news or ESPN analysts talking through the latest football game, information is essential. In fact, for an industry to grow, it needs the interest of the masses. Blockchain and the crypto world is no different, which is why media roles will become more common within the decade.\nTech has been a hotbed of opportunity over the last two decades and this trend doesn’t look as though it’s going to end anytime soon. Thanks to bitcoin and all that comes with it, those with an interest in computers and alternative currencies now have a ton of interesting and lucrative prospects.

SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function, not an encryption function.\nBeing able to compute a lot of SHA-256 is useful for an attacker only in situations where: there is some secret value S that the attacker wishes to obtain; the value S is part of a space of possible values which is small enough to be enumerated with existing technology (meaning: S is not a random 128-bit key; rather, S is some password that an average human user can remember); and the attacker has access to the value f(S) where f() is a function that mostly uses SHA-256.\nSo, in practice, ASIC for Bitcoin mining may be good tool to try to crack passwords which have been hashed with SHA-256 or a derivative which relies on SHA-256 for most of its structure (e.g. PBKDF2 ). Usual attackers normally rely on GPU, but the ASIC are supposed to offer a better efficiency/cost ratio (otherwise, Bitcoin miners would use GPU too...).\nAn ASIC for Bitcoin mining would be bad at doing anything else than SHA-256, so the \"normal\" way of using PBKDF2 (that is, with SHA-1, not SHA-256) is unimpacted. So are bcrypt and other password hashing functions.\nSalient points:\nThe Bitcoin ASIC show that it is possible, for a given hardware building and running budget, to get substantially more computing out of dedicated circuits (ASIC) than what you get with generic hardware (i.e. PC and GPU). However, the ASIC has a huge one-time overhead, when you design the circuit, then go to a foundry and proceed to make a million of chips. Economically, the cost benefits are all in the scaling; you have to make and run a lot of ASIC to reach a high efficiency/cost ratio.\nSpecialized circuits being specialized, they cannot be easily retargeted. An ASIC for SHA-256 has no value when trying to break a SHA-1 based algorithm, let alone anything AES-based. Still economically, generic CPU and GPU are cheap because they are produced by the million because they are generic and thus can be used to a multitude of tasks.\nBrute force enumeration works only for values which lie in a small enough space of possible values. All the Bitcoin ASIC on Earth won't help you do some brute-force on a 128-bit symmetric key.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T22:26:24.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9324e72b2e029d7ba939fe76c130df455cee06d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQwaGx8sYrXnDlvwVMw1Npc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Where to invest long term aside from Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Where to invest long term aside from Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-08T14:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9324e72b2e029d7ba939fe76c130df455cee06d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQwaGx8sYrXnDlvwVMw1Npc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aimata27", "published": "2018-06-08T14:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Where to invest long term aside from Bitcoin?", "text": "Hi, good day guys!

Source : CNN\nChanos, who achieved fame and notoriety at the turn of the millennium for being the Wall Street analyst who made millions by shorting Enron stocks ahead of its collapse in 2001, said that despite the hopes of bitcoin evangelists, the digital currency would become worthless in times of crisis or upheaval.\n\"Food Would Be Better\" Speaking in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking on June 4, 2018, Chanos stated that in times of uncertainty, fiat currencies such as the US Dollar have a critical comparative advantage over digital currencies.\nHe believes in fiat's superiority because the government enforces its use, and it can provide backing for them as a lender of last resort, which gives fiat a guarantee of stability that cryptocurrencies cannot have.\nGoing further Chanos said:\n\"For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that's exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. The last thing I'd want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down. Food would be better.\"\nMuch Ado about Failure of Bitcoin The comments made by Chanos mirror a sense of antipathy toward bitcoin which is shared by a widely varying group of interests ranging from Altcoin founders to institutional investors and banks. BTCManager earlier reported comments by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stating that bitcoin will share a similar fate to Napster and other defunct Internet startups.\nIn April 2018, Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America was also quoted saying that bitcoin has peaked and the bubble is set to burst.\nIn all of these cases, bitcoin appears to be disliked because while it dominates the cryptocurrency market so heavily to the chagrin of competitors, it refuses to behave as a conventional asset, which makes it difficult for institutional investors and traders to engage with it either for portfolio trading or short trades.\n\"Speculation Game Masquerading as Breakthrough\" Chanos on his part remains convinced that bitcoin has no long-term future, describing the market optimism for bitcoin and other cryptoassets as a part of the \"fraud cycle.\"\nOutlining his thoughts on bitcoin 's future, he said:\n\"As business and particularly financial markets improve, people's sense of disbelief and caution that they've often earned from the previous downturn begins to erode. Schemes that before might have seemed too good to be true begin to be embraced.\"\n\"I suspect going forward we're going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging. We're now nine years into this bull market, same as the '90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate. I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that.\"\nThe post Jim Chanos is Not a Fan of Bitcoin: Here's Why appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chanos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for new economic thinking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T14:13:36.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17e9eaf4fcfabc97c9c7d1ff9c08736516e83ddc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz6OaS3JmGScUFGxpjEBc7Bk-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-08T14:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "17e9eaf4fcfabc97c9c7d1ff9c08736516e83ddc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz6OaS3JmGScUFGxpjEBc7Bk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T14:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 8, 2018 NEWS A portrait of the artist as a crypto speculation.

To make these thefts possible, some criminals are turning to tools on the dark web: Cybersecurity company Carbon Black said there are around 12,000 marketplaces related to cryptotheft — a nd malware, which can come as low as $1.04, is bundled with customer service at times.\n“It’s surprising just how easy it is without any tech skill to commit cybercrimes like ransomware,” Rick McElroy, Carbon Black’s security strategist, told CNBC. “It’s not always these large nefarious groups, it’s in anybody’s hands.”\nThe cybercrime unit of a police department in South Korea may bring charges against a cryptocurrency exchange due to its margin trading efforts, CoinDesk reported.\nIn a statement to CoinDesk, a representative from crypto exchange Coinone said, “At this time, we are focused on cooperating with the ongoing investigation, and will continue to do so as the case is in the process of moving over to the Prosecution Service from the Police Agency.”\nIn other news, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon made a measured remark about bitcoin in a CNBC segment on Thursday (June 7), CoinDesk reported. Though Dimon had previously called bitcoin a “fraud,” he took a different tact in his latest remark: “I don’t [want to] be the bitcoin spokesman. You know, just beware.”\nIn addition, Dennis Rodman may be in talks with the Canadian company behind PotCoin to back a trip to attend the upcoming summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, CoinDesk reported. PotCoin spokesperson Shawn Perez branded the effort as a “peace mission.”\n“The PotCoin team, as a community, has been incredibly supportive of Rodman’s peace mission from the beginning,” Perez told The Washington Post . “We’re thrilled to see how the political climate has improved between North Korea and the U.S. since he became involved.”\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/report-potcoin-may-send-dennis-rodman-to-singapore-for-trump-summit/", "https://www.carbonblack.com/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/07/1-point-1b-in-cryptocurrency-was-stolen-this-year-and-it-was-easy-to-do.html", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-cryptocurrency-for-marijuana-is-backing-dennis-rodmans-trip-to-singapore/2018/06/07/b37e6214-990b-4e9e-ad92-b28839375754_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0bc2bf90b4b5", "https://www.potcoin.com/", "https://www.coindesk.com/just-beware-jamie-dimon-will-say-bitcoin/", "https://www.coindesk.com/korean-police-allege-coinones-crypto-margin-trading-is-illegal-gambling/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick mcelroy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "carbon black", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prosecution service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T15:02:39.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "230be33038c07255a32b5d2e7369dab089f9b4f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFTDPZlR5cWSCAdftJOlOhk9nJanWpFraAPmuQqA4QiYFr.0gdU_4zknqmQY9mHOxCA-", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Andy Warhol Is a Bitcoin Star for 15 Minutes", "title_full": "Andy Warhol Is a Bitcoin Star for 15 Minutes", "published": "2018-06-08T14:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "230be33038c07255a32b5d2e7369dab089f9b4f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFTDPZlR5cWSCAdftJOlOhk9nJanWpFraAPmuQqA4QiYFr.0gdU_4zknqmQY9mHOxCA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-06-08T14:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Andy Warhol Is a Bitcoin Star for 15 Minutes", "text": "Home / Bitcoin News Wire / Andy Warhol Is a Bitcoin Star for 15 Minutes Andy Warhol Is a Bitcoin Star for 15 Minutes Posted by: Bitcoin News Editor in Bitcoin News Wire 1 min ago\nThe world of finance isn’t done yet with its effort to turn artistic masterpieces into tradeable securities.

Jim Chanos . Source : CNN\nChanos, who achieved fame and notoriety at the turn of the millennium for being the Wall Street analyst who made millions by shorting Enron stocks ahead of its collapse in 2001, said that despite the hopes of bitcoin evangelists, the digital currency would become worthless in times of crisis or upheaval. “Food Would Be Better”\nSpeaking in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking on June 4, 2018, Chanos stated that in times of uncertainty, fiat currencies such as the US Dollar have a critical comparative advantage over digital currencies.\nHe believes in fiat’s superiority because the government enforces its use, and it can provide backing for them as a lender of last resort, which gives fiat a guarantee of stability that cryptocurrencies cannot have.\nGoing further Chanos said:\n“For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. The last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down. Food would be better.” Much Ado about Failure of Bitcoin\nThe comments made by Chanos mirror a sense of antipathy toward bitcoin which is shared by a widely varying group of interests ranging from Altcoin founders to institutional investors and banks. BTCManager earlier reported comments by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stating that bitcoin will share a similar fate to Napster and other defunct Internet startups.\nIn April 2018, Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America was also quoted saying that bitcoin has peaked and the bubble is set to burst.\nIn all of these cases, bitcoin appears to be disliked because while it dominates the cryptocurrency market so heavily to the chagrin of competitors, it refuses to behave as a conventional asset, which makes it difficult for institutional investors and traders to engage with it either for portfolio trading or short trades. “Speculation Game Masquerading as Breakthrough”\nChanos on his part remains convinced that bitcoin has no long-term future, describing the market optimism for bitcoin and other cryptoassets as a part of the “fraud cycle.”\nOutlining his thoughts on bitcoin ‘s future, he said:\n“As business and particularly financial markets improve, people’s sense of disbelief and caution that they’ve often earned from the previous downturn begins to erode. Schemes that before might have seemed too good to be true begin to be embraced.”\n“I suspect going forward we’re going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging. We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ‘90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate. I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chanos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for new economic thinking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T14:16:34.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aded1a803ca1e8919e179d34a8ce5f03a3a187bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgo2ToRkRLncVzIAomCbh66ML_ocdtAFCizeMYn4BaSh7fXeCkwNZU8uWEI8hAcetmEBiPIW1lyacvLaw4647qHPfPNgJouLA5g--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "2 More Bitcoin Cash Mining Pools Agree to Process Zero-Fee Transactions", "title_full": "2 More Bitcoin Cash Mining Pools Agree to Process Zero-Fee Transactions : btc", "published": "2018-06-08T13:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.075, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aded1a803ca1e8919e179d34a8ce5f03a3a187bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgo2ToRkRLncVzIAomCbh66ML_ocdtAFCizeMYn4BaSh7fXeCkwNZU8uWEI8hAcetmEBiPIW1lyacvLaw4647qHPfPNgJouLA5g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DedMozai", "published": "2018-06-08T13:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "2 More Bitcoin Cash Mining Pools Agree to Process Zero-Fee Transactions", "text": "submitted by /u/DedMozai\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://telegra.ph/2-More-Bitcoin-Cash-Mining-Pools-Agree-to-Process-Zero-Fee-Transactions-06-08-2"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T11:06:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08f1a0a109cbdcae3e42f236be5d09d9acee0f20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR7rn_n2HEDTbpc1uNcfcWkrEk3p6vIb.I_nQ3njSQ9LUuPJuCl1eJkg_gCo1KHN.bVtsr5x1sc3JOHI7JH3.T_m01NrqAGbGr3PeDsxCWUhn83wn7exMpe", "site_full": "qz.com", "site": "qz.com", "site_section": "http://qz.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Quartz", "title": "The Swiss are voting on the radical concept of “sovereign money”—the anti-bitcoin", "title_full": "The Swiss are voting on the radical concept of “sovereign money”—the anti-bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-08T13:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Thw-Swiss-will-vote-on-sovereign-money.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1461, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08f1a0a109cbdcae3e42f236be5d09d9acee0f20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR7rn_n2HEDTbpc1uNcfcWkrEk3p6vIb.I_nQ3njSQ9LUuPJuCl1eJkg_gCo1KHN.bVtsr5x1sc3JOHI7JH3.T_m01NrqAGbGr3PeDsxCWUhn83wn7exMpe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "John Detrixhe", "published": "2018-06-08T13:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Swiss are voting on the radical concept of “sovereign money”—the anti-bitcoin", "text": "Future of Finance June 08, 2018\nOne response to the 2008 financial crisis—popular among the bitcoin camp, in particular—has been to decentralize authority. That is, take power away from the elites and spread it among regular people who suffered the most and had the least recourse when the economy crashed. And it isn’t just crypto enthusiasts—you can make the case that the small-government, low-taxes Tea Party, which surfaced in the US in 2009, has similar DNA .\nAnother response to crisis has been to give even more power and responsibility to a centralized authority. Switzerland’s “ sovereign money ” referendum fits into this category. On Sunday (June 10), Swiss voters will decide whether to ditch the fractional-reserve banking system (pdf), in which banks create money as a byproduct of extending credit, lending out far more than they hold in deposits. The radical reform, called Vollgeld, would give the Swiss National Bank a monopoly over this power, and require commercial banks to lend only what they have on hand. ( Read more about it here .)\nIf the referendum succeeds, it would cause convulsions for the country’s enormous banking sector and spark another Brexit- or Trump-like market panic if it happens. That said, some economic luminaries (paywall) think such a proposal would indeed make the panic-prone banking system more robust.\nSwitzerland’s sovereign money initiative would concentrate even more power into the Swiss National Bank—which, by the way, abhors the idea . The bank says money creation would be centralized at the institution, and the corresponding profits would end up there as well. This politicized, state-controlled credit system would hold sway over who should and shouldn’t receive loans across the economy.\nThe referendum is generally seen as a populist response to the previous financial crisis. Switzerland, notably, has had far fewer crises than most countries, according to IMF data . It has a low unemployment rate and the Swiss franc is a haven currency that is, if anything, too strong. There are some imbalances. The country’s housing market is showing signs of overheating and, in an effort to keep the currency from appreciating too much, the central bank’s balance sheet has grown to epic proportions .\nIt feels less revolutionary—maybe because I write so many bitcoin stories —but it’s arguable that centralization has been a bigger force following the financial crash than a push towards the stateless, decentralized power promoted by the crypto crowd. There are fewer banks than before, and they’re bigger and more profitable. Ordinary fiat bank deposits are growing. The US and Europe enacted sweeping regulatory overhauls that gave regulators more heft. The Swiss initiative, in fact, would give officials power that they don’t even want.\nAlas, the referendum is seen as unlikely to succeed ( sound familiar ?). The most likely outcome is more of the same—until the next crisis comes along. The future of finance on Quartz\nThe number of bank accounts in Nigeria and Mexico has fallen. In low- and middle-income countries, less than half of all people have an active account, according to the World Bank. Headline stats on the growth of financial inclusion often mask a large rise in inactive accounts.\nA London asset manager has started a doomsday fund. After years of heavy monetary stimulus, Algebris Investments thinks global economies have become vulnerable to a shock . Geopolitical flareups and debt defaults are among the things that could go wrong, and the money manager’s tail-risk fund stands to profit when they do.\nChina suddenly has nice things to say about blockchain. China Central Television, the government-controlled broadcaster, used to blast crypto projects. Now, it promotes blockchain with Chinese characteristics .\nGermany’s biggest bank is worth the same as a medium-sized regional US lender. Deutsche Bank’s market capitalization falls between Chicago-based Northern Trust and Fifth Third, which has its headquarters in Cincinnati. Yet its assets are 12 times bigger.\nThe most valuable banknote in circulation is worth about as much as a bitcoin. That bill is Brunei’s B$10,000 note , which is worth about $7,500, roughly the same as bitcoin. Brunei’s ruler is among the few remaining absolute monarchs and one of the longest reigning. The future of finance elsewhere\nAnt Financial raised a whopping $14 billion. The Alibaba affiliate exceeded the $10 billion targeted earlier, achieving the largest private fundraising round ever. International investors including The Carlyle Group bought the dollar-denominated tranche. Ant says it’s investing in blockchain, artificial intelligence, security, and the Internet of Things.\nAdyen could be valued at more than $8 billion when it goes public. The Dutch payment firm’s technology is used by the likes of Netflix and Facebook. It generated revenue of €218 million ($257 million) last year, up 38%. Crypto is supposedly the future of money, but regular old fiat payment processors still handle all the transactions.\nFortune says blockchain consortium R3 is floundering. R3 disputed claims that it missed revenue targets and is running low on money. It has been 10 years since Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper was published; people are anxious to see viable projects that provide more than an opportunity to gamble.\nIn crypto’s Wild West, the CFTC is Wyatt Earp. Commissioner Rostin Behnam said crypto will proliferate in every part of the world: “Perhaps we are witnessing a modern miracle.” Is the US commodities regulator crypto’s biggest cheerleader?\nCoinbase says it’s on track to operate a regulated broker-dealer. If approved, the crypto exchange would be able to offer blockchain-based securities under the oversight of US watchdogs.

Chanos said that in the event of a global crisis, it would be “better” to own food, or a government-backed ( fiat ) currency. Speaking to the Institute for New Economic Thinking and quoted by various media outlets, Chanos, who last year stated he “didn’t understand” Bitcoin or blockchain technology, issued stark warnings about cryptocurrency investment. “We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate,” he told Bloomberg. He also called the past year’s increased public interest in Bitcoin part of the “fraud cycle,” adding: “This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.” Chanos added that in the event of a global crisis, governments would step in with fiat currency as lenders of last resort, an option unavailable to cryptocurrency, given its decentralized nature: “For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. The last thing I’d want to own is Bitcoin if the grid goes down.” The well known short-seller, who predicted the fall of Enron, joins an ever-decreasing pool of steadfast Bitcoin naysayers.

Seemingly, the two billionaires have been spending time together this week.\nRecently in a joint interview on CNBC , both Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffet were widely popularized by their criticisms of bitcoin. The host of CNBC questions them: “ You both have said some pretty nasty things about bitcoin recently”, “Which one of you hates bitcoin more?”.\nAt first, Warren Buffet responds that, “I set a high standard” . This isn’t the first that business tycoon has delivered withering criticisms. Earlier he had named a bitcoin, “real bubble” , a “bad ending” , bitcoin is similar to “gambling” . Recently, in the month of May, he called bitcoin “ rat poison squared ” . Buffet add on his statement, stating that,\n“I don’t know whether Jamie can top me or not”. Further, in response to Buffets statement, Jamie Dimon was more precise than his own previous critiques,. He said,\n“I don’t want to be a bitcoin spokesman, you know. Just beware”.\nJamie Dimon has always been a opponent bitcoin, in 2015 he known for calling bitcoin “a waste of time” . Dimon disgracefully labeled a bitcoin a ‘ a fraud ’ in September 2017.\nSimultaneously, the annual report of JP Morgan with SEC in 2017, revealed that the bank was accepting disruptive cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as threat to his business. Dimon stated publicly;\n“I’d fire them in a second. For two reasons. It’s against our rules and they’re stupid. And both are dangerous”.\nSince, mid December bitcoin has lost its high value of reaching $20,000. At the press time, Bitcoin was trading at 7637.32 USD.

Nick Ayton explains", "text": "by Nick Ayton\nThere have been a few key shifts in crypto worth mentioning…\nI get asked all the time what is going on with Bitcoin? Will it go back up? Is it finished?\nIn recent weeks we have seen the crypto economy, it seems, move only sideways with little sign of pumping close to the levels we saw at the very beginning of 2018. And of course, the haters love this, claiming all sorts of things like “Bitcoin is finished”, “Bitcoin has no value”, words that normally come from fat old bloated bankers and fund managers that have destroyed the value of Fiat currency that would love to see the crypto economy go the same way.\nFor me, the reasons for this movement is clear maybe because we are working at the coal face and dealing with BTC every day. There are other forces are at work here, each placing very different external pressures on Bitcoin and the broader crypto economy.\nBefore going into this just a few comments on ICOs. Look, the heady days of the second half of 2017 when ICOs exploded are unlikely to ever return. The simple reason, the crowd is not sitting on profits to burn investing in a range of ICOs at a whim. Much of this initial crowd got burned bad as the price correction came through at the end of January ’18. Many newbies also came into the market, lost their cash and left.\nThus far in 2018, we have seen capital flowing into ICOs shift from the crowd to institutional monies where many ICOs now get full or partial funding privately, before the crowd is invited. And of course, the regulatory landscape where some jurisdictions are clarifying their position (SEC for example) is also not helping here.\nIn real terms this means an increasing number of ICOs are competing for a smaller piece of the pie, and where competition to get investment is very intense and to a degree desperate. ICO activity is increasing and the search for capital much harder to find, against a background where all tokens are now being considered securities anyway, anyone buying a token will have to pass some form of KYC and AML which is also pushing the crowd away.\nSo now is not a great time to launch your ICO unless you are really special and you are prepared to go on the road and find investors yourself or with the help of firms like ours. With value moving sideways we need Fiat currency to come into the crypto economy, and to attract this capital you will need to package your proposition differently when pitching your idea to investors. An Information Memorandum and pitch deck supported by some real numbers and projections. And if you want to sell a security token to the crowd you can! A Prospectus will get you started and adds credibility to your goal. And please no utility tokens, as investors will not buy these as don’t forget you are competing with non-blockchain projects where most offer real returns.\nSo why are Bitcoin, Ether and the larger coins moving sideways?\nThe simple explanation is that Bitcoin has never been better, more sought after and in demand. The change is the explosion of OTC (Over The Counter) where, rather than just a dozen OTC traders and brokers, we now seeing thousands globally emerge all chasing the big Buy Sell in search of the big pay-out. This in itself is not so bad, but here is the thing: very few deals actually complete and strangely the US banks that hate crypto so much, apart from buying through the back door as the ones providing escrow and custody services?\nThe reality is a large volume, maybe more than 50%, of BTC is changing hands outside the primary crypto exchanges and therefore not being reflected in BTC price. The recent patterns are BTC rises at the start of the month and then falls at the end as market makers who have shorted BTC clear their positions creating unnecessary and additional short-term volatility. Because they can. These bankers only see BTC as just another financial product to short to make money on without adding any value to the ecosystem whatsoever, because they know there are still BTC holders that are easily spooked and will sell and take their losses which is their gains.\nIn our business, we have been involved in OTC trades for several months and have on our books a range of Buyers and Sellers, from Mining Pools who Sell clean coins at a premium, to High Net Worth individuals and Institutions who are keen to Buy. And then Hodl which doesn’t help. We have also had our own deals presented back to us by the layers of traders, brokers and intermediaries that are strangling deals to get a piece of the commissions. All believing they are going to get rich quick on the back of a 100,000 BTC deal. Sorry boys it doesn’t work like this.\nWhilst the underlying BTC volumes show strong activity, it is nothing compared to what it could be right now as demand for BTC remains very high and supply is slowing, which normally means prices go up right. And they will, as BTC, as of writing this, will start to test the next resistance level deemed to be $7800.00. But $20,000? Quarter 4 always surprises us, so never say never.\nIt is worth remembering that it is still early days although BTC is nearing a decade of existence it is only the past two years that have seen the crypto economy explode. This pre-pubescent crypto economy is experiencing the teenage years before maturity. The new Crypto Capital Markets will emerge from this far stronger but it will take a few more years to understand, as regulators try to hold it in check, banks try to destroy it one moment, then make money from it the next (they are, after all, bankers) and let us remember the majority of the crowd remain unaware of Bitcoin.\nBTC is doing well although has largely transitioned from a payment network to a new asset class and will eventually manifest itself as a more stable source of value than any other financial instrument or currency. The future is good.\n“Ignorance is further Strengthened”…\nNick Ayton", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nick ayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiat", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-09T00:00:21.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9da83537d7e8a6926b9f230b83aa7771242a4d56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.V.IIufsImVLM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-08T13:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9da83537d7e8a6926b9f230b83aa7771242a4d56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.V.IIufsImVLM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MarkDaniel5", "published": "2018-06-08T13:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "text": "I think that Not all banks, and not all government was scared on bitcoin, but to answer your question is, maybe because bitcoin is very risky in a person who really don't know the nature of it.

Most people assume this new form of money is something owned only by younger people. Moreover, there is a growing focus on quick flips and even quicker gains. A paradigm shift is taking place in terms of who owns Bitcoin, albeit that doesn’t have to be a bad thing per se. The Bitcoin Hodlers Still Exist\nThere are many different reasons why Bitcoin isn’t a major payment method yet. A lot of early investors are still holding on to their Bitcoin balance in the hopes of seeing the value going up. Late last year, such a major price spike occurred , which caused all kinds of consequences. For the Bitcoin holders, it was a validation of their strategy working first and foremost.\nAt the same time, the Bitcoin price has taken a massive dip throughout early 2018. For the average Bitcoin holder, that is not a positive development. There’s still a very good chance a new Bitcoin all-time high will be reached later this year or in 2019. Not everyone can wait for such a spike, though, as the current volatility makes it a lot easier to score quick profits – or losses.\nWhile there are still plenty of reasons to become a Bitcoin holder, the paradigm is shifting. During last year’s bull run, a lot of long-term holders decided to liquidate assets to those seeking short-term gains. While that is not exactly uncommon, it does show some of the initial belief in Bitcoin may be waning. At the same time, distributing the wealth to more people also indicates Bitcoin is still growing as a currency. The Bitcoin Short-term Speculators\nGiven the current Bitcoin price volatility, speculation has taken center stage again. Although that will only lead to even more volatility down the line, it also shows the interest in cryptocurrency isn’t waning in the slightest. Chainalysis data seems to confirm the average Bitcoin holder is changing. Not the person itself, but the overall mindset associated with speculating on Bitcoin in general.\nMore specifically, the number of long-term holders is virtually the same as short-term speculators. Although there is still a gap between the two sides in favor of long-term holders, that situation can change at any given moment. Whether or not that should be considered to be a bad thing, remains unclear at this time. A transfer of wealth is bound to take place sooner or later, as it is the natural evolution of financial markets.\nIn the short-term, the increasing \\u00a0liquidity of Bitcoin for trading can cause price declines. However, there is only so much volume to be bought up before the situation returns to normal. The coming months will be crucial for the future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. If the long-term faith remains elusive, things will not necessarily improve anytime soon. Nothing is set in stone at this point, and everything remains subject to change at all times.\n Image from Shutterstock\nThe post Bitcoin Investor Expectations Shift From Holding to Short-term Gains appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T15:26:38.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d250e497f24ede3f5c4044fac7715368ae7551a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg86mg0fC7Ursvd9tipvNnoOe26QmlTRvsX7q2HJKG31eXwubyLY_rwmad0x25l0RyM-", "site_full": "www.baystreet.ca", "site": "baystreet.ca", "site_section": "http://www.baystreet.ca/publish.aspx", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Baystreet.ca - ACCESSWIRE ", "title": "First Bitcoin Capital Corp Enters Into Partnership Involving One of the Most Recognizable and Legendary eSports Brands: Updates Shareholders", "title_full": "First Bitcoin Capital Corp Enters Into Partnership Involving One of the Most Recognizable and Legendary eSports Brands: Updates Shareholders", "published": "2018-06-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.531, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d250e497f24ede3f5c4044fac7715368ae7551a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg86mg0fC7Ursvd9tipvNnoOe26QmlTRvsX7q2HJKG31eXwubyLY_rwmad0x25l0RyM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ACCESSWIRE", "published": "2018-06-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "First Bitcoin Capital Corp Enters Into Partnership Involving One of the Most Recognizable and Legendary eSports Brands: Updates Shareholders", "text": "[ACCESSWIRE]\nTEL AVIV, ISRAEL / ACCESSWIRE / June 7, 2018 / First Bitcoin Capital Corp (OTC PINK:BITCF), a prolific generator of more than 100 unique cryptocurrencies and developer of blockchain powered technologies is proud to announce that it has has reached an agreement with the mother of PHIZZURP ( known as @PHIZZURP_MOM) to license the rights to the brand PHIZZURP and PHIZZURP TKO and other related intellectual properties.\nPhillip \"Phizzurp\" Klemenov (1992-2016) was a professional Call of Duty legendary player and a popular video game streamer.

Despite their centralized nature, consumers and speculators rely heavily on these platforms on a daily basis. For Bitfinex users, there was a slight scare on Tuesday when trading was halted for a short while. Another Issue for Bitfinex Although cryptocurrency exchanges have seen their fair share of issues throughout the years, it seems some problems will persist. In the case of the Bitfinex trading platform, its popularity is also the root cause for some of the problems the company has had to deal with. Addressing these issues will not be easy by any means. On Tuesday, the company was forced to suspend all trading activity for a while. As one would expect, this decision sparked a lot of debate and confusion regarding what was going on exactly. In most cases, such developments mean the trading platform in question has run into major issues of some kind. Thankfully, it seems this particular incident was not linked to a hack or other mishap affecting the company. Instead, its servers were the target of another DDoS attack. Anyone who has kept close tabs on the cryptocurrency industry will know how common DDoS attacks are, especially when it comes to specific exchanges. Bitfinex is currently under extreme load. We are investigating the issue and will keep you all up to date as we learn more. — Bitfinex (@bitfinex) June 5, 2018 One of the Bitfinex infrastructure service providers had to deal with a denial of service attack, but it seems the issue was resolved fairly quickly. The attacker’s identity remains unknown at this time, and it’s also unclear why this provider was attacked in the first place. While trading on Bitfinex was suspended, the Bitcoin price fell by slightly over 2%, further confirming the feeble state of this market today. It is important to note that this DDoS attack did not disrupt Bitfinex accounts or user balances whatsoever. It only impacted the trading operations themselves, which is why the company was forced to suspend all trading for a brief while. Thankfully, it seems all users can now trade on Bitfinex once again without any major problems, although this may not necessarily be the last DDoS attack against a cryptocurrency firm, either directly or indirectly. It will be interesting to see how Bitfinex and its service providers address issues like these moving forward. Centralized exchanges will always remain a critical problem in this industry until decentralized cryptocurrency trading becomes the new normal. Until then, cryptocurrency trading platforms will need to beef up their DDoS protection, among other things. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T11:00:54.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f326ceda9055d093a712da00ee4d3e8e6d18dfb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCRY8lh0tKn5r0QPQK2ksE5dYDQfhZZRlvbH6DqyfcbzZfxIQK2ael7icF0iBg02rXRRnbXAtIlQThiLWOLjZn6fUyZ.kekpDL3yNOOLwO9.U-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S.", "title_full": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S.", "published": "2018-06-08T12:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1528420084_56486319.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f326ceda9055d093a712da00ee4d3e8e6d18dfb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCRY8lh0tKn5r0QPQK2ksE5dYDQfhZZRlvbH6DqyfcbzZfxIQK2ael7icF0iBg02rXRRnbXAtIlQThiLWOLjZn6fUyZ.kekpDL3yNOOLwO9.U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-08T12:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S.", "text": "6 hours ago Bitcoin Technology Bitcoin Magazine 71 Coinmint , a cloud mining service provider, has confirmed it will go ahead with its proposed plan to open a cryptocurrency mining plant in an abandoned smelter previously used by Alcoa, in Massena, New York. In a statement published online , the company said it will repurpose the 1,300-acre, 435-megawatt site into the biggest cryptocurrency mining plant in the world. The move, which was approved in February , will see the mining service invest up to $700 million and the creation of 150 jobs in the coming months. The company remains unfazed by the slump in bitcoin prices, which has seen a drop of almost 50 percent this year, according to data from Coinmarketcap . In correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine , Coinmint CTO Prieur Leary said, “Current bitcoin prices affect the value proposition. That being said, we are very comfortable with current metrics, given our technology and infrastructure.” Coinmint sees upstate New York as the perfect environment for them to set up shop. Operations have begun at the complex through Coinmint’s wholly owned subsidiary North Country Data Center Corporation, and the facility is expected to be at full capacity within 12 months. The company believes this move will impact the crypto industry in a positive way. Leary went further by saying that “given the current concentration of digital currency data centers in Asia, launching the largest of such facilit[ies] in the U.S. makes a bold statement that the West is active within the industry and is a driver of growth and innovation within the space.” New York is not known for being friendly to crypto companies or to miners, but as Steven O’Shaughnessy, Massena’s town supervisor, remarked in a local interview , “Our main marketing point is that we have cheap, reliable power.” Mining is a power-hungry activity that has been getting a lot of attention lately. In May, an expert panel met at a mining conference to discuss the implications of high energy consumption among miners worldwide, where they refuted the notion that energy devoted to proof-of-work operations is a wasteful by-product of cryptocurrency mining.

At the start of the year, the consensus was that the number one cryptocurrency would reach even greater heights. However, BTC prices have declined from its record-setting highs of $19,500 in mid-December 2017 to hovering around the $7,700 mark. Bitcoin will Approach the $15,000 Mark by December 2018 Finder, a financial comparison platform, released a Bitcoin forecast that said BTC prices would cross the $30,000 mark by December 2018. Six months into the year, the platform seems to have revised its predictions with a new report released in June. According to the latest forecast figures, Bitcoin will end the year trading at $14,638. This new figure predicts an almost 100 percent increase in BTC price based on its current trading value. The Finder cryptocurrency prediction panel consists of 10 members with experience in the digital currency and blockchain industry. The figures published by Finder are an extrapolation of the individual predictions of each panelist. Examining the figures published by Finder, the lowest end-of-year BTC price prediction was $5,778 while the highest was $25,000. Some of the members of the panel include James Lynch of Castlecoin, Aaron LePoidevin of Every Capital, and Kunal Patel of the Gerson Lehman Group. Speaking to The Independent , David Hanson, CEO of Ultra, said that he expected Bitcoin to continue hovering between $6,500 and $8,500. According to Fundstrat analyst, Robert Sluymer , Bitcoin’s bottom price is $7,000. Thus, with an influx of institutional investors, the price of BTC is expected to increase. Many experts and commentators share this notion that the entry of institutional investors into the market will drive up prices. In 2018, people like Tom Lee, also of Fundstrat, Dan Morehead (Pantera CEO), and Iqbal Gandham of eToro have expressed similar views. EOS to See the Highest Gains The Finder cryptocurrency prediction survey highlighted EOS as the cryptocurrency to watch. The results of the survey indicate a predicted price of $38.25 at the end of the year. Based on the current value of Eos tokens, this price estimate is a 200 percent increase. According to Hanson, EOS is generating a great deal of interest in the market, especially with the hype surrounding its mainnet launch. In a recent Weiss rating report , EOS was also identified as one of the best altcoins in the market. How accurate do you think these predictions are?

June 8, 2018\nThe Robinhood app has finally opened trading for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on its platform for Texas users. A tweet in this regard was posted on the official Twitter account of Robinhood yesterday.\nFirst, it rolled out the crypto trading option in Virginia, followed by Indiana, Utah, Arizona, and Pennsylvania last month. It first made the option available for users in California and then later on in Colorado in April. According to reports, Robinhood intends to expand this service to its European Union investors in the future.\nSan Francisco-Based Finance App Empower Announces Cryptocurrency Exchange Integration\nRobinhood App Allowing Trading For Very Small Amounts\nThere is tough competition among cryptocurrency exchanges and the competitive landscape is heating up especially in the United States. This new expansion by the zero-commission startup exchange is an indication that the Robinhood app wants to gear up for the competition. Regular users of the app may not feel comfortable at the start with the new applications and volatility of the cryptocurrency as they are more used to traditional financial instruments.\nThe platform is carrying out crypto coin trading through a separate entity that follows different rules. On this, Robinhood says , “Cryptocurrency trading is done through an account with Robinhood Crypto, LLC. Robinhood Crypto is not a broker dealer and is not a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).”\nHowever, the app is providing support to its users by making crypto available even for very small amounts including any fractional amount above 0,001 ETH and 0.00001 BTC. At present, the app is not allowing any margin trading since the coins will not serve as collateral. Only the users with some amount in their portfolio will be able to generate trades.\nRobinhood To Allow Limited Range Orders\nAs of now, Robinhood is allowing only limited range orders to avoid directly being a part of the volatility of the crypto market.

I think the only way by which bitcoin can be forced to be legalized is through mass adoption,if majority of the population in a country start accepting jt ,then government will give it full support.\nAlthough bitcoin is decentralized, it requires the legality of a government to be used by people in the country. If the government has banned the use of bitcoin cannot be done freely. The government has full authority over the existence of bitcoin in the country, of course, in terms of its use.\nYes because in many cases bitcoin can also affect the specific currency of a country, it can affect the economy so that it is needed to be legalized.\nEven if you legalize Bitcoin or not, it will still affect the economy of a country for maybe a little since Bitcoin holders and investors don't really use their Bitcoins because they are just holding it waiting for the right price to come and then they will be selling it at that time.

A study has found that despite their volatility, cryptocurrencies do not endanger the financial system and the economy of Russia, as the risks are offset by the highly concentrated ownership of digital assets. Crypto fluctuations are not believed to affect consumption either. Russian residents have controlled cryptocurrency worth between $7.5 and $14 billion in the first quarter of this year, according to estimates published in the report. The technical picture on Bitcoin looks neutral to bullish.\nTrading recommendations:\nAccording to the H1 time - frame, I found that price is trading inside of the potential bullish flag, which is a sign that selling looks risky. My advice is to watch for potential buying opportunities if you see a valid breakout of bullish flag.

CHOOSE PROTOCOLS & PLATFORMS (OVER DAPPS). The state of cryptocurrency is in flux with different blockchain platforms all vying for dominance. BTC, the first cryptocurrency, itself is outdated. It does not support smart contracts, it’s slow, it’s expensive, and there’s a vicious civil war between the core developers who task themselves with improving the BTC infrastructure and the large mining companies & businesses with a vested interested in making as much money as they can from it. But the siren call of blockchain is strong. Some of the smartest people are promising that blockchain can optimize (through decentralization) many inefficient systems present in banking, government, supply chain, insurance, and many other broad areas. The real winner in a few years may not be Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other specific coin but Blockchain technology and how it disrupts our current technology. There is a mad scramble to find the blockchain /s that come out on top. The blockchain/s that prove they are the best and gain widespread adaption in the marketplace. Infrastructure projects also tend to give the best returns. If dApps built on a platform succeed in what they promise and gain real use, the fundamental value of the platform the dApp is built on itself will increase. For example, Microsoft Windows derives its value from the applications that have been developed on it. With cryptocurrency, you can invest in the actual underlying platform and profit as that platform succeed.\nImagine investing in the railroad infrastructure during the 19th century and getting paid rent as those rails were used by the trains. Would you want a piece of that? What about if you were paid when people used the ‘HTTP’ protocol. You would be gaining dividends in the web protocol itself, earning more and more as the protocol gains use. You would essentially be owning a piece of the web infrastructure. What would that be worth now? Billions. Trillions? Cryptocurrency platforms & protocols projects give you that option. Many are calling Blockchain the Web 3.0. A safer, more secure layer on which the new internet can be built upon, one centred around the idea of decentralization. That’s the longterm view anyways. But we still have ways to go — years likely — before this vision becomes a reality. At present, this web 3.0 is still in alpha and the best example of it is brought to its knees by a few thousand gamblers addicted to buying and selling digital cats. But if you hold to the long-term vision that the blockchain will be the seed of a new web 3.0, then investing in its infrastructure is a good play. dApps, beyond the speculative value they give now, will ultimately be tied (when the speculative frenzy has died down in the future) to the value of the company behind the application. Most dApps offer utility tokens which are, frankly, not at all needed as part of the core functionality. What am I saying here? Platforms and Protocols have delivered some of the biggest ROI.\nAnd if the market turns bear, these are the projects that will likely retain real value in the future — not the dApps built on them. So when evaluating potential ICO’s, give big preferential treatment to infrastructure projects over dAPPS. You’ll likely earn more over the long run. And they are safer bets over dapps. Look at some of the top cryptocurrency by market cap: EOS. ADA. IOTA. NEO. ICX. LISK. Notice a trend? A significant portion of the top 20 list is filled with infrastructure cryptocurrencies, not dApps. I don’t expect this to change until dApps actually start getting real-world use in the marketplace and disrupting industries. I figure we have anywhere from 2 to 5 years before this occurs. 2. ANTICIPATE THE MARKET TRENDS. Want to make millions. Here’s how. Anticipate the direction the market will go. Then invest in cryptocurrencies that promise those solutions. Now, this does sound easy but does involve knowing quite a bit about market trends and the general state of blockchain tech. You only get this by following crypto news and looking at what cryptocurrencies are currently rising. For example, I’m personally interested in cryptocurrency platforms & protocols that aim to solve the fundamental problems with current blockchain technology, the problems that must be overcome if blockchain is to be used to solve real problems and not just a speculative investment. Some of these problems that MUST be solved are scalability (increasing throughput of transactions speeds).\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben krypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T11:55:48.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc669482c916392d8db78a030c682b3816ee2315", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeaOahyJGRvCkl5q_F8ifJ0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=12.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Project Development", "title": "Faster and Autonomous Large Bitcoin Collider fork", "title_full": "Faster and Autonomous Large Bitcoin Collider fork", "published": "2018-06-08T11:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc669482c916392d8db78a030c682b3816ee2315", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeaOahyJGRvCkl5q_F8ifJ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andzhig", "published": "2018-06-08T11:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Faster and Autonomous Large Bitcoin Collider fork", "text": "Quote: from: userghost on June 07, 2018, 08:29:36 PM Here is a list of address's.

The price is battling to find a balance above $1,100 before attempting to recoil above the resistance at the trendline which also coincides with more resistance from the 23.6% Fib retracement level with the previous swing high of $1,201 and a low of $881.\nA recent study in Russia reports that the volatility of the virtual currencies has a very little effect on the stability of the traditional financial system. The risks on the economy are canceled out by the high ownership of the virtual currencies. Besides, consumption of goods and services is not affected by the cryptocurrencies. The residents in the country held $7.5 to $14 billion in digital assets in the Q1 of $2018 according to the report.

Breaking above this level will see BCH/USD battle with the resistance at $1,150, before breaking the short-term barriers towards $1,200.

The last two quarters saw BTC prices unravel from nearly $20,000 to the current levels around $7,500. The statistics show that the longest sideways drift for Bitcoin was between 2013 and the summer of 2017, when prices picked up again. BTC has had its temporary peaks during that time, but failed to set new records. In the past weeks, BTC prices have been less volatile. After a bigger shakedown from around $8,000 to the current levels, BTC once again remained stable. BTC traded at 7,677.83, on thin volumes of $4.3 million in 24 hours. !Bitcoin! There have been predictions for a new rally starting from July, but for now, BTC has been losing its appeal, and dragging down altcoins as well. The more the price and trading of BTC stagnate, the more influential Japanese Yen trading becomes, according to CryptoCompare data. Right now, more than 63% of BTC volumes are against the Japanese yen, an all-time record. Even Tethers (USDT) have withdrawn, to around 15% of trading volumes.\nOutright USD investment has shrank from the habitual 20% to around 15%, and the share of the Euro is negligible. BTC prices have seen more predictions of a new bull run, but so far, the price rise has been limited, again continuing on a downward trend. But a further price weakness, with a bottom as low as $5,000, is also a part of the prediction.\nThe worst case scenario is for another two years of a long downward slide. The last Bitcoin rally coincided with the vast increase in USDT supply, along with an unprecedented public interest. BTC rose to new peaks almost constantly in 2017, on volumes of $1.5 billion that now seem extremely slim.\nThe dominance of BTC in terms of market capitalization has stagnated around 38.2%. And BTC has lowered its share of trading, which hovers around 30% of the market, as not all altcoins are paired with BTC, instead paired with USDT, Ethereum, or other assets.

Goldman Sachs, for example, also intends to open its bitcoin trading desk soon, while the NYSE’s parent company announced plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange.\nHowever, Susquehanna already has skin in the game and claims to have a “lot more money” backing its trading desk. One can only speculate the potential returns the firm may have reaped since 2015, a period which saw bitcoin’s value increase by 21,900 percent.\nWhile bitcoin’s volatility attracts traders and investors in the hopes of turning colossal profits, staunch supporters dislike the move citing that the peer-to-peer payment model is now reduced to a speculative vehicle. Bart Smith, head of cryptocurrencies at Susquehanna, explained:\n“The firm believes that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inspired by it are likely to have a wide array of uses, but for now, he said, Bitcoin’s best bet is to challenge gold as a scarce commodity that can be moved around more easily.”\nThe comments may hold true until bitcoin’s circulating supply reaches its peak in 2040 – when the last bitcoin is mined.

There was a break below a major connecting bullish trend line with support at $7,640 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $7,600 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average to avoid further slides.\nBitcoin price is currently correcting lower against the US Dollar. BTC\\/USD might bounce back from $7,600 if buyers defend the 100 hourly SMA. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nAfter a decent upside move , bitcoin price faced a lot of offers near the $7,750 level against the US Dollar. The BTC\\/USD pair formed a short-term top near $7,748 and started a downside correction. It declined and moved below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the last wave from the $7,350 low to $7,748 high. There seems to be a minor increase in selling pressure below the $7,700 level.\nMore importantly, there was a break below a major connecting bullish trend line with support at $7,640 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. The pair is currently trading above the $7,600 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Moreover, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the last wave from the $7,350 low to $7,748 high is also around the $7,600 support. Should there be a bearish break below the $7,600 support, the price could extend declines towards the $7,500 level.\nLooking at the chart , the price is facing a bearish trend line on the upside with resistance at $7,680. A successful break and close above the trend line and $7,700 may perhaps clear the path for more gains in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is slowly moving back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is moving lower and is currently moving well below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $7,600\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $7,700\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC\\/USD Hold 100 SMA? appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T15:26:32.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95978a068aff1e04793adb4544959fe75b100849", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKKyIkA2j5ihptshYbBylWWUQkz2YbJpMpJoTFk7aDVJngNzyxrWchhg0ambFsA7eIizpEPM5cPQc-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com", "site": "freelancer.com", "site_section": "http://www.freelancer.com/rss/affiliatejob_truseo_Software-Architecture.xml", "site_categories": ["job_search", "hobbies_and_interests", "jobs", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freelancer Software Architecture projects", "title": "I want a quick freelancer to write a Windows based bitcoin wallet.", "title_full": "I want a quick freelancer to write a Windows based bitcoin wallet.", "published": "2018-06-08T11:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1547, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95978a068aff1e04793adb4544959fe75b100849", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKKyIkA2j5ihptshYbBylWWUQkz2YbJpMpJoTFk7aDVJngNzyxrWchhg0ambFsA7eIizpEPM5cPQc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-08T11:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "I want a quick freelancer to write a Windows based bitcoin wallet.", "text": "Bitcoin I want a quick freelancer to write a Windows based bitcoin wallet.\nHello everyone!

We had previously formed a hammer, and it now looks as if the 20 SMA is going to continue to cause a bit of a short-term reaction. I think that the $8000 level above offers a significant amount of resistance, and I would be a bit surprised if we managed to break above that level. I think that we will eventually roll over, and at this point I have no interest in buying bitcoin. It makes more sense that we will continue to go lower, perhaps reaching down towards the $6000 level over the longer-term. If we did break above the $8000 level, then we could go as high as $8500 in the short term. However, it should be said that the longer-term highs have been getting lower for some time.\nBTC\\/JPY\nBitcoin markets initially tried to rally against the Japanese yen as well but gave back most of the gains to form a short shooting star. The ¥850,000 level continues to be resistance, and I think if we can break above the top of the candle we could go looking towards the ¥900,000 level. That ¥900,000 level would continue to be important, and I think that we would struggle to break above there. The ¥800,000 level underneath would be a decent target, but I think if we break down below there we will probably go down to the ¥700,000 level which has been the bottom of the overall consolidation area. I believe that rallies that show signs of exhaustion will continue to be the best way to play this market. I have no interest in buying the pair as it continues to fail.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T15:34:17.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7973d0c1a7bcbcc7046ff28203c1dfd6755a2bb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdn47.ikCxJskpx.cFCZHVME-", "site_full": "siteownersforums.com", "site": "siteownersforums.com", "site_section": "http://siteownersforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=16", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Search Engine Optimization - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "title": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS", "title_full": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "published": "2018-06-08T11:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7973d0c1a7bcbcc7046ff28203c1dfd6755a2bb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdn47.ikCxJskpx.cFCZHVME-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HelenShuth", "published": "2018-06-08T11:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW top soft for breaking any Captcha\nhttp://xrumersale.site/img/botmasterlabs_xevil3_en.png\n1.
