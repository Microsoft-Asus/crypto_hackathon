Bitcoin Core (BTC) is an experimental currency that does not have a white paper and has only operated under its current model for two years” Roger Ver says .

Search For Articles Steve Wozniak: I Want Bitcoin to Succeed, It Is ‘Natural’ By Akshay Makadiya on June 6, 2018\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak has once again weighed in with support of bitcoin, heralding that the world’s first cryptocurrency could supplant fiat currencies to one day serve as a single global currency. Wozniak has been impressed at how “mathematically defined” the OG crypto is, giving it a moniker of “pure digital gold.” Despite being a bitcoin proponent, though, Woz has refrained from heavily investing in the asset.\nSubscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts Wozniak: ‘I Want’ Bitcoin to Win\nOn the sidelines of the Money20/20 conference in Amsterdam , Wozniak gave his most supportive remarks of bitcoin yet, sending yet another shot across the bow that the mainstream worlds of finance and tech will be hard-pressed to ignore.\nThere, the former Apple computer wiz expressed his agreement with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey’s March 2018 comments that bitcoin (BTC) may be the universal currency of choice on the international stage within ten years.\nWoz noted:\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way , that is so pure thinking.”\nIt’s certainly not a surprising sentiment coming from a technical aficionado like Wozniak. He admires bitcoin for the definiteness of its math-based system — it’s a definiteness that’s not possible with traditional commodities like gold, much less the ever-slippery and complex social arenas that are the wellspring of fiat currencies.\nBitcoin, the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies, is wholly decentralized, making it different in kind from most crypto projects that have centralized foundations or similar top-down bodies backing them — say Ripple or Ethereum, for example.\nBitcoin is not run by a single entity and relies on the consensus of its network participants. It is this uniqueness that’s clearly won Wozniak over. Emphasizing Bitcoin’s Naturalness\nWoz sees in bitcoin less the hand of man than the hand of nature. In his latest Money 20/20 comments, he argued the decentralized nature of bitcoin is an indication that it is “natural” and “nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nHe also went on to re-emphasize bitcoin’s conventional description of being “digital gold” and of its uniqueness among digital currencies:\n“Only bitcoin is pure digital gold […] I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.”\nWoz has sold what bitcoin he once had, he later explained, deciding to keep one single bitcoin as a fan of its mission. But he’s got other projects he’s intrigued in, too. A few weeks ago, Woz made a bullish prediction that the Ethereum project could be the next Apple .\nAs such, he also clarified at Money 20/20 that he’s holding two ether to dip his toes into the tech.\nWill Wozniak be able to convince newbies to get into the bitcoin scene?

The CEO, however, thinks Bitcoin will continue to work as the store of value; saying “ We as a world have decided to store the value to the tune of about $130 billion… that’s a store of value. It’s hard to argue that .” Source Image: firefox\nAlthough he claims that there is no competition among cryptocurrencies, he still believes that Bitcoin cannot compete with XRP as a means of transfer of payments. XRP is Better Than BTC\nBrad Garlinghouse has continuously been criticizing Bitcoin’s dominating position in cryptocurrency markets. He thinks Ripple is in a better place to lead the cryptocurrency market considering mass adaptation from banks and payment services companies.\nExplaining his stance, the CEO said, “ the Bitcoin blockchain, the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency, is “quite slow,” whereas XRP transactions are “a thousand times faster .”\nBitcoin blockchain network on average takes 42 minutes for each transaction based on Blockchain.info record while XRP’s transaction stands in the range of four seconds. Source Image: twitter.com\nRipple CEO has previously highlighted his concerns over the correlation between Bitcoin price and the rest of digital currencies, saying “ There’s a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies .” Source Image: twitter.com\nBrad Garlinghouse looks so optimistic over the future fundamentals of XRP network; the claim for mass adaptation isn’t out of context as RippleNet agrees with more than 100 companies and banks to enhance their domestic and cross-border payments.

Clayton, when speaking about the “incredible promise” of distributed ledger technologies driving efficiencies in markets, clarified during today’s CNBC interview his thoughts on cryptocurrencies that are “replacements for sovereign currencies:” “Replace the dollar, the yen, the euro with Bitcoin. That type of currency is not a security.” While Clayton did not comment on specific assets besides Bitcoin about their status as securities, he went on to explain that what he considers to be securities are tokens that act as digital assets: “Where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture […] and in return for me giving you my money, you say, ‘You know what, I’m going to give you a return.’ That is a security, and we regulate that. We regulate the offering of that security, and we regulate the trading of that security.” When asked to make clear his statement on whether Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are securities, Clayton told the interviewers, CNBC’s Bob Pisani, “Bob, I just did.” Clayton added that the SEC won’t support changing the definition of a security to support the ICO community, as they are not “going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security which has worked well for a long time.” The SEC chair had previously praised distributed ledger tech, blockchain as an example, during February’s SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) cryptocurrency hearing. At the time, Clayton had noted that every ICO that the SEC had seen so far would be considered a security. Altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have come up in the cryptocurrency security question, with Joseph Lubin of Ethereum emphatically denying that ETH was ever a security, and Ripple similarly rejecting a security classification.\nRipple is now facing a class action lawsuit from a disgruntled investor claiming that the sale of XRP is the sale of an unregistered security, with a former SEC chair recently appointed to represent Ripple in court.

According to Steve Wozniak, of the 1,500 cryptocurrencies in existence, only Bitcoin can be considered ‘pure.’ Wozniak Hopes for Bitcoin to Become a Single Global Currency In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Wozniak stated that he hopes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s belief in Bitcoin will come true. The Apple co-founder made the following comments at the Money 2020 conference being held this week in Amsterdam: “I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.” Wozniak was referring to Dorsey’s comments back in March of this year. The founder and CEO of both Twitter and Square stated that he felt that a single currency would emerge for the internet and the world. He went on to state that this currency would be Bitcoin. According to the article in CNBC today, Wozniak had bought Bitcoin when each was around $700. He’d since sold all but one. However, even someone as technically capable as the co-founder of Apple was a still able to fall victim to a scam. He was defrauded out of a quantity of the digital currency when exchanging them back to dollars. In addition to his single Bitcoin, he also holds two Ether coins – the native currency on the Ethereum network. In the interview today, Wozniak sang the praises of Bitcoin more astutely than many commentators are capable of. He spoke fondly of its qualities of decentralisation and limited supply, likening it to a natural phenomenon that doesn’t require human intervention to work: “Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.” Finally, Wozniak addressed the altcoin space . He claimed none could ultimately compete with Bitcoin since each must serve the company that created it. Again, the topic of decentralisation was raised in his assessment: “Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.” Featured image from Shutterstock. - ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wozniak hopes for bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T12:10:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5152e889876db2a46f54a3e7c2977f14b9becd03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyD24hL2TbfoyjCseqwkRZA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5152e889876db2a46f54a3e7c2977f14b9becd03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyD24hL2TbfoyjCseqwkRZA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nThe number of referral network levels will be reduced for all newly registered users shortly!

The largest virtual asset by market capitalization is trading marginally above $7,450. Similarly, it is up a subtle 1% on Tuesday.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) continues to advocate for the adoption of digital assets in the mainstream financial sector. The financial institution has once before encouraged central banks to consider starting central bank governed digital assets. It states that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are volatile because of the speculative nature of their prices. IMF, however, believes that digital assets outdo the fiat currencies when it comes to cost and time used to send money especially cross-border payments.\nThat aside, if Bitcoin breaks above the short-term resistance at $7,500, the upside will be limited by the bearish trendline as observed on the chart. The 100 SMA will also hinder movements slightly below $7,600. The breakout for BTC/USD is at $7,600, which will pave the way for retracements heading to $7,700, before attacking the psychological $8,000.\nA weak bullish trend is forming, similarly, the moving averages gap shows that the bulls are regaining control. The MACD, on the other hand, is dipping slightly into the negative to show that bear pressure is still looming. A weak support is seen at $7,400, but $7,300 is a good entry position. A break below this level will see BTC/USD test the demand and buy position at $7,250.\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Analysis\nLitecoin price has approached the breakout at $18.00 and there is a bullish trend in progress. LTC/USD is testing the short-term resistance at the 50% Fib retracement level with last swing high of $127 and a low of $110.5. The price is still trading below the ascending trendline, however, indicators are pointing towards a short-term breakout.\nThe 50 SMA is closing in towards the longer term 100 SMA to signal that the buyers are gaining momentum. Moreover, the MACD momentum indicator is pointing upwards signaling for more buy entries in the short-term. On the upside, $120 is a key resistance and the next target is at $122 which could open the door towards the major resistance at $122. Litecoin price support is at the 61.8% Fib retracement level around $118 – $116.\nEOS price analysis\nEos price is one of the biggest gainers on the day surging by over 4%. The crypto has breached the resistance from the 38.2% Fib retracement level with the last high leg at $15.1 and a low of $11.87. The buyers are pushing the price towards the breakout position at $15.00 but first, they must overcome the resistance at $14.50.\nBoth the moving averages and the MACD indicators are showing bullish signals, besides the 50% Fibonacci level with the last swing high of $15.1 and a low of $11.87 at $13.50 is offering immediate support. If declines precede the 50 SMA will also offer support above $13.00. However, EOS/USD major support area lies at $12.50 – 12.00. EOS price has been lagging reaction to the mainnet, however, a break above $15.00 could allow it to find the momentum to attack the major resistance at $18.00.

PermaBull Tom Lee Appears on CNBC Fast Money\nOn Monday, Tom Lee, long known as a cryptocurrency bull in the space, went on CNBC to dispel bearish sentiment against Bitcoin’s viability and more importantly, its price. ‘Fast Money’ host, Melissa Lee, pointed out that bears held three things against Bitcoin.\nFirstly, that the Google search trends for Bitcoin are down, dropping to almost 25% of the levels seen at the start of the year. Many Bitcoin bears believe that this indicator shows that direct investment interest in this cryptocurrency. Although this may be somewhat true, this indicator tells far from the whole story. As well, Tom was quick to point out that the Google Trends indicator was not fully indicative of the price and popularity of Bitcoin :\n“Google searches aren’t the leading indicator for Bitcoin, but instead, acts as a ‘coincident indicator,’ and therefore shouldn’t be looked to as some sort of BTC price predictor .”\nIn this case, this “coincident indicator” means that it moves in correlation with Bitcoin’s price, instead of preemptively signaling the price movement of the popular cryptocurrency. Lee also assured viewers that he believes that traditional institutions are still interested in investing in the space, despite the short-term bear market which the cryptocurrency market has experienced.\nAnother point which Bitcoin bears made was that trading volumes have plummeted since last year’s bull run. According to CoinMarketCap , trading volume is down by over 75% since the late December highs seen in the industry.\nTo help combat this supposed bearish indicator, Lee called the run-up last year a “parabolic blow off.” This essentially means that he thought that the volume seen during late last year was an abnormal figure, and should not be as relevant now. He also compared the daily figures to other volume figures from earlier in 2017;\n“Compared to a year ago, (over) the same time (the first 6 months of 2017), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent .”\nThis fact affirming that he believes that the volume present in the cryptocurrency trading space is still “healthy.” Tom Lee Affirms That Bitcoin Will Move In An Upward Direction\nFinally, Lee addressed the bearish sentiment that Bitcoin has been struggling to break over the mental and technical barriers in the $10,000 range. To help assist his bullish views on the market, he utilized some research done by his market analysis firm, FundStrat. The Bitcoin bull said specifically:\n“Bitcoin makes all of its performance in 10 days, in any year. So I don’t think that the fact that it is at the current levels is going to prevent it from actually rising before the end of the year.”\nAccording to his prior appearances on CNBC segments, Bitcoin’s price movements can be mainly attributed to 10 days throughout a whole year. If you took out those 10 days in any year, Bitcoin would be down an average of 25% in that year. With this data, he made it apparent that he believes that a Bitcoin price surge will occur within the time span of a few days.\nIf Bitcoin somehow manages to continue its downward trend, Tom Lee made it clear that he believes that Bitcoin will hold price levels at the cost of mining a single Bitcoin. According to research from his firm, the current cost of mining a Bitcoin sits at an average of $6,000 and if history is any indication, that means Bitcoin should hold at $6,000 if worst comes to worst.\nImage from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin bull tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "permabull tom lee appears", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:45:59.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3577d333e2bb1267b1a3a64d4e380974c75ee7a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJU5DyDDHNbNA3xpjszbFK2C0M.s4A.Q56o92qEzO2nZpRVnS_LCWY6ErgrsTy5BiauQZsFHOr8SVK9_sfuCDoqtZdzt3QfiMxA-", "site_full": "no1options-scam.com", "site": "no1options-scam.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Litecoin IMG_3448 | no1options scam and cheat", "title_full": "Bitcoin Litecoin IMG_3448 | no1options scam and cheat", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.102, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/no1options-scam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/no1options.png?fit=253%2C304", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3577d333e2bb1267b1a3a64d4e380974c75ee7a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJU5DyDDHNbNA3xpjszbFK2C0M.s4A.Q56o92qEzO2nZpRVnS_LCWY6ErgrsTy5BiauQZsFHOr8SVK9_sfuCDoqtZdzt3QfiMxA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Litecoin IMG_3448 | no1options scam and cheat", "text": "Categories about us\nthis site for exposing this big scam binary options company called no1options.com .which steal the money of their members . .the aim of this page is to expose it to the world and prevent scamming people ...please like and share us to prevent it from scamming any new victims\nplease follow us at all social media below Social ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T07:28:58.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ac87a78303d579b6ae0a3878103d6822f3fdb2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jeB4pbNN3E7UhoG8IEO9KcClgwxTLqQvA6jk04uaoSDwk4rkB5pfG67M8JQdGLfdGz.hZVlluoLCpdFHBKoYBq7", "site_full": "cryptonewslab.com", "site": "cryptonewslab.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website - Crypto news lab", "title_full": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website - Crypto news lab", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cryptonewslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/russia-court-13.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ac87a78303d579b6ae0a3878103d6822f3fdb2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jeB4pbNN3E7UhoG8IEO9KcClgwxTLqQvA6jk04uaoSDwk4rkB5pfG67M8JQdGLfdGz.hZVlluoLCpdFHBKoYBq7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website - Crypto news lab", "text": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website Blog Share\nA Russian court has overturned a previous court decision to block a bitcoin-related website because it contains information about cryptocurrencies. The Supreme Court ordered the city court to hear the appeal. Russian Court Overturned Previous Decision St. Petersburg City Court.\nThe St. Petersburg City Court has overturned the ruling of the Vyborgsky District Court of St. Petersburg to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in Russia.\n“The St. Petersburg City Court quashed the decision of the district court to recognize the information posted on the Bitcoininfo.ru website,” Tass reported the city court explaining on Monday, June 4.\n“Vyborg District Court of St. Petersburg will again consider the case of the blocking of the site on cryptocurrencies, www.bitcoininfo.ru,” Rapsi learned from the city court, adding:\nThe city court canceled the decision to block the site and sent the case [back] to the Vyborgsky District Court for a new hearing. Problem With Spreading Crypto Information\nThis case began in July 2016 when the St. Petersburg Vyborgsky District Court made the ruling to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in absence of the site owner. The court “considered the statement of the prosecutor’s office that the site contains information about cryptocurrencies” and decided to block the site, the publication detailed. According to the case file, Tass explained that the prosecutor’s office demanded the site be blocked based on its content about cryptocurrencies that “do not lend themselves to state control,”“promote the growth of the shadow economy,” and “do not have certain consumer properties.”\nThe representative of the website’s owner, Sarkis Darbinyan, told the publication that the prosecutor’s actions “takes place without the involvement of site owners,” adding that none of them received “requests for the removal of prohibited information, and the city court refuses to accept appeals after the actual blocking of websites.”\nHe further detailed:\nAccording to the statements of the prosecutor’s office of St. Petersburg, about 100 sites devoted to cryptocurrencies have been blocked.\nThe domain administrator appealed against the court’s decision, believing it to be illegal. However, the city court did not consider his appeal so he appealed to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which subsequently ordered the city court to consider his complaint.\nIn March, the St. Petersburg City Court struck down a ban on 40 bitcoin-related websites offering information about cryptocurrencies and exchange services in Russia, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nDo you think bitcoin websites will finally be unblocked in Russia?

The ETF would use a price index based on over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading desks located in the US, as opposed to the prices generated through trading activity on cryptocurrency exchanges.\nUPDATED | June 6, 2018:\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the proposed ETF's price per share as $200,000. That's not quite right.\nETHNews heard from SolidX, which said, \"A more accurate way of putting it is that the share price is expected to be approximately $200,000. There are 25 bitcoin per each ETF share, so the approximate price is derived by multiplying 25 bitcoin by the price of bitcoin (currently around $7,500), which gets you to the approximate $200,000 per share price.\"\nFor the record, 25 * $7,500 is not $200,000. It's $187,500. That's a $12,500 difference.\nORIGINAL | June 6, 2018:\nOh, bitcoin give me one more chance! Investment management company VanEck and financial services company SolidX have unfinished business.\nOn Wednesday, the firms joined forces, filing registration paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pursue an exchange -traded fund (ETF) that would allow investors to purchase shares in a trust that holds bitcoin. If approved, the ETF would grant investors – ostensibly institutional buyers, rather than retail buyers – the opportunity to procure shares in the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust. The companies' application form suggests that the shares would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange .\nReaders may remember that in March 2017, shortly after denying the Winklevoss twins' bitcoin ETF proposal, the SEC cut short SolidX's pursuit of a bitcoin ETF. The agency disapproved of a proposed rule change by NYSE Arca , which sought to list and trade shares of the product.\nThen, in September 2017, VanEck separately withdrew its own registration document for a bitcoin ETF, explaining that the SEC said it would not review the firm's application until bitcoin futures began trading.\nNote: ETHNews extensively covered bitcoin futures trading in the US, which began on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange in December 2017.\nProposed bitcoin ETFs have stirred up controversy because of the cryptocurrency's volatility and (up until recently) the relative absence of financial products that allow people to bet against rising prices. Not to belabor the point, but shortly after the introduction of bitcoin futures, the price of bitcoin came tumbling down from its December 2017 highs – a phenomenon that was recognized by the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco .\nEven though futures facilitated short interest , the lack of a tangible commodity or product backing bitcoin has confounded nearly everyone. How is a person supposed to determine a fair price for an internet currency that has no government backing its value?\nAltogether, the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust ETF is vaguely interesting for two reasons: The insurance aspect might entice some particularly wealthy and risk-loving investors. If approved, the financial product could grant institutional traders greater license to enter the cryptocurrency markets (though many have shied away in the past).\nThat said, the SEC has not yet approved or rejected the financial product and there are important questions that remain. (For instance, what would investors be entitled to in the event of additional bitcoin forks?) Also, potential investors will need to consider whether buying into the ETF (which would include fees) makes more sense than individually buying bitcoin through a well-established cryptocurrency exchange. Liquidity and security should be chief among buyers' concerns.\nNote: Attempts to reach SolidX were unsuccessful. The company's e-mail address ( ) was invalid and the phone number listed on its website was ostensibly disconnected. VanEck did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

Various firms are looking at the concept of introducing trading desks. One company, which has flown under most people’s radar, already took the plunge a while ago. Susquehanna International Group has built up a trading desk of a dozen people buying and selling cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is an Appealing Currency\nA lot of money can be made and lost with cryptocurrencies. The volatile nature of this industry makes it appealing to speculators and investors. It was a matter of time until the Wall Street big shots began dabbling in these currencies as well. So far, most of the major firms are still in the early process of developing these new options for their clients.\nThat is not the case for Susquehanna International Group. The firm is best-known for trading stocks, ETFs, and options. In that regard, it is not all that different from most Wall Street firms on the market today. What does make it unique is its position in the cryptocurrency trading industry. The privately owned firm has been buying and selling Bitcoin and other currencies through private deals for two years.\nExpanding this functionality will occur shortly. The company indicates they will expose 500 of its clients to cryptocurrency trading in the coming weeks. If successful, the venture will be expanded upon rather quickly. It is another sign of how cryptocurrencies are bound to go mainstream very soon. Moreover, it seems a matter of time until other financial institutions follow this lead by example. A Major Gamble by the Wall Street Firm\nTwo years ago, Bitcoin was not in the position it is right now. In fact, its value was a lot lower and far less attractive to Wall Street. Even so, this particular Wall Street firm saw merit in jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon at such an early stage. In hindsight, it seems to have been a very smart decision when it comes to Bitcoin.\nUnder the current circumstances, not everyone favors Wall Street getting involved in cryptocurrency trading. A lot of people wonder whether or not this will lead to even more speculation and price volatility. Susquehanna’s head of the digital asset group isn’t too concerned in this regard. In his opinion, Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold as a scarce commodity. Even so, Smith acknowledges the currency has a “wide array of uses”, but did not further specify which those may be.\nAll of this shows there is a bright future ahead for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. When Wall Street firms prepare to take the plunge on this industry, it is a matter of time until mainstream traction occurs. Even so, cryptocurrencies still have very few real-world use cases outside of speculation. Changing that will not be easy by any means. Future scaling solutions for Bitcoin and Ethereum may effectively speed up that change a lot sooner than people anticipate.

In this regard, Wozniak joins Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, in his enthusiasm for Bitcoin becoming the single worldwide currency. Bitcoin: The Native Currency of the Internet\nA growing number of influential voices are claiming that Bitcoin should become the currency of the Internet.\nMost recently, during a CNBC interview, Wozniak conveyed his sentiment that Bitcoin should become the currency of the Internet, affirming Bitcoin’s purity and power. During the interview, Wozniak said:\nBitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.\nWozniak also indicated that he agrees with Jack Dorsey regarding the fact that Bitcoin should become the single global currency. Specifically, Wozniak said:\nI buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.\nWozniak was referring to Dorsey’s prediction, “The Internet is going to have a native currency.” Dorsey issued this prediction at the Consensus Blockchain Conference in New York in May. As reported by CNET , Dorsey also stated :\nThe internet is going to have a native currency, so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin, but I hope it will be. Bitcoin Makes Square Profitable\nDorsey seemed to acquiesce to client demand when Square started to provide Bitcoin trading capabilities to its Cash App. When announcing these new features, the company stated :\nCustomers can now buy and sell Bitcoin in Cash App. We observed that this was a feature our customers wanted, and we support Bitcoin because we see it as a step in the long-term path toward greater financial access for all.\nDorsey was right. Since Square, Inc. added Bitcoin trading features to its payment app, the value of its stocks has increased significantly. As a result, last April, Dan Dolev, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, believing that this ascending trajectory would most likely continue, raised its Square target price to USD 65, from USD 50. As of this writing, a share of SQ is already over USD 61.\nDorsey and Wozniak remain faithful to their vision that the Internet will eventually have only one currency, preferably Bitcoin. Some time ago, Wozniak declared that Bitcoin was better than gold, and Dorsey said :\nBitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade.\nWhat do you think of Bitcoin becoming be the single currency of the Internet?

This move took the open-source community by storm, including those who work on the best-known cryptocurrency’s core software.\nTo say that Wladimir van der Laan, the maintainer of Bitcoin Core and one of its most avid developers, was upset about this is a bit of an understatement, according to his tweets.\nhttps://twitter.com/orionwl/status/1003549916462047232\nAs a maintainer of the project, he can move the code anywhere else without any issue and then shut down the GitHub repository. Of course, this also means waiting until everyone involved in the project is informed of the move and manages to reconfigure their development environments to commit to another repository.\nIt also means waiting until everyone who downloads Bitcoin Core knows where to go to pick up releases without experiencing any unpleasant surprises.\nThis isn’t just Bitcoin Core leaving GitHub, though. GitLab, a direct competitor to GitHub, reported a sudden increase of user flow at ten times the ordinary daily number.\nhttps://twitter.com/gitlab/status/1003409836170547200\nThe company took advantage of this and put out a campaign called “#movingtogitlab,” offering a 75% discount on its Gold and Ultimate subscriptions.\nThe panic among open-source developers may be a bit premature, however, as Microsoft doesn’t appear to have any intention to discontinue free memberships for them.\nThe only reason people pay for GitHub at this current moment is for private repositories, which are used in closed-source (usually commercial) projects. Nothing stops current public repository holders from continuing as if nothing happened. × Stay up to date with market trends and exclusive crypto news!

Bitcoin, the worlds biggest digital currency, continues to lack direction, hovering around $7,500.\nThe lack of activity and inability to recover losses early in 2018 prompted research firm Trefis to lower its year-end price target for the No.1 digital currency. “Adjusting our forecast for transaction volumes in our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator now leads to a year-end price target of around $12,500—down from our earlier estimate of $15,000,” or about 17%, according to Trefis in a June 5 research note.\n“The global cryptocurrency industry has seen a flurry of new developments since December. Many of these developments had a negative impact on the growth prospects of cryptocurrencies, like restrictions by banks on the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, and calls by financial regulators across the world for caution while investing in digital currencies.”\nThe Trefis Price Estimator tracks the current price trend with two inputs; daily active users and daily transaction volume and according to its website has an accuracy rate of over 94%.\nA single bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.14% was last valued at $7,526.32, down 1.3% since Tuesday 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange.\nRead: If bitcoin is a bubble, the ‘panic’ stage is near: economist\nAltcoins and futures trend lower Wednesday Major altcoins, or coins other than bitcoin, also traded lower Wednesday.

The BCH Geek event was held on June 1-3 and firms like Bitmain Technologies, Viabtc, and BTC.top were in attendance. According to local reports and BCH-focused forums , the hackathon featured 100+ programmers who produced solid research, prototypes, and applications built using the BCH blockchain. The BCH Geek event was initiated by the blockchain video portal Chongqing TED.CC, and other members of the BCH community. BCH-Based Browser Plugins, an Authenticator, and a Quiz App\nThere were more than 11 teams who consisted of developers from firms like Viabtc, and students from Chongqing University. This week on Reddit, a BCH Geek attendee stated the hackathon resulted in a “satisfactory way,” while detailing the platforms created by a few of the top teams who participated in the event. Three teams mentioned in particular were the groups Mempool, Viabtc, and Gon. According to the report, Mempool created a URL-paying browser plug-in based on bitcoin cash which integrates with the HTTP and Status Code 402 protocol. Image credits: Cindy Daily\nViabtc developers designed a BCH-based authenticator that can store data and synchronize across multiple devices. The application does not require a server and authentication data can be restored easily. Another team called Gon designed an application called Token Dice which is a decentralized on-chain 1v1 quiz application based on BCH. The Token Dice programmers used the OP_Code , ‘ OP_DATASIGNVERIFY,’ to build the quiz platform. Another application featured was called ‘ IF Password’ a password management software (ifpass.cash) that is tethered to the BCH blockchain.

The industry luminaries also spoke about currently built platforms like Memo , Blockpress , and Cointext that are providing the on-chain ‘killer apps’ once heralded a few years ago. The BCH Geek event ended with great success and it’s safe to say quite a few bitcoin cash-infused platforms demonstrated at the event in Hangzhou will be released into the wild shortly.\nWhat do you think about the BCH Geek event held in China this week?

It might be tempting to take this breather as a sign of the tide turning. We highlight the reasons why you probably shouldn’t. In the last couple of days, Bitcoin has gone up a bit. This has brought questions if the current move is only a correction within a decline or already an important sign of a shift in the market. In an article on CoinDesk, we read : Bitcoin looks primed for a move to $8,000, but low trading volumes point to the risk of a bull trap. The cryptocurrency broke through a key descending trendline (drawn through the May 6 high to the May 21 high) on Sunday, adding credence to last Tuesday's bullish outside-day candle and signaling a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, at the same time, daily trading volume fell 1.77 percent to $4.85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Further, rolling 24-hour trading volume currently stands at $4.95 billion – down 22.5 percent from the current quarterly average of $6.38 billion. Low volume is a cause for concern for the bulls, as it is widely considered a sign that the market is approaching a peak; that is, the rally will be short-lived. We have a slightly different take on whether Bitcoin is set to move above $8,000 – the currency might shoot up above this level but we haven’t really seen enough signs that this is the case just yet. Other than than, we generally support the conclusions of the cited couple of paragraphs. Bitcoin is up and it went above the declining resistance line but this line might have just turned out to stop the appreciation. The declining volume seems to be a classic bearish indication. And we might see a daily close below this line today, which would be bearish as well. We still think that a move up can’t be ruled out but the move down we’ve seen today weakens the recent bullish signs. Any Important Bullish Implications? On BitStamp, we see the recent move up and the depreciation of today. The appreciation of the last couple of days brought Bitcoin above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level and this is a slightly bullish indication. Only slightly, because this particular level is not an extremely important one. A more bullish indication is the breakout above the declining resistance line based on recent tops. This indicates that the move up might be stronger than the preceding ones but the fact that Bitcoin turned South today and is now closer to this level weakens the bullish implications slightly. Have we seen very important bullish indications, though? Not really. Bitcoin is still below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and the action hasn’t really changed the short-term outlook. And this is only for the short term, without really considering the bigger picture into account. Verification in Disguise On the long-term Bitfinex chart, we see the depreciation from $10,000 and the recent appreciation in perspective. In particular, the recent move up does seem like a correction within a larger decline. This is further reinforced by the long-term declining trend line. It might be the case that today’s move down is a bounce back down off this line. Additionally, we see that in spite of the recent move up, we haven’t really seen a move above the 78.6% retracement level based on the rally to the all-time high around $20,000/ Actually, it rather seems that we might have seen a verification of the breakdown below this level. This is a bearish indication, at least for the longer term. The current situation is quite curious in terms of the price action. We are seeing a move up on relatively low volume followed by one day of depreciation and the current environment looks like the late stage of a short-term correction within a long-term decline. This means that, in our opinion, the situation is still bearish and we might see a stronger move to the downside in the next couple of weeks. Summing up, the decline might resume and become even deeper.

If a user wants an instant transaction, the user can choose from a range of small fees made offered by miners.

With all top 13 cryptocurrencies in the green, it is a rather odd sight given all of the negativity which occurred on Saturday and Sunday. While there are no major changes to speak of, the Bitcoin price is definitely heading in the right direction as of right now. Bitcoin Price Momentum Continues\nAny Bitcoin price chart is usually a mix of up and down momentum, for rather obvious reasons. While there is positive momentum in the market right now, things looked very different just a few days ago. Rest assured this situation will look completely different by tomorrow or the day after, as cryptocurrencies are not known for their stability whatsoever. The Bitcoin price is perhaps the best example of this trend.\nEven so, there is something positive to note over the past few hours. Although the current Bitcoin price gain is pretty small, all things considered, it is still a lot better compared to what most people had expected at this time. Thanks to this small increase, the Bitcoin price has increased to $7,632 once again, although it seems unlikely it will stay there for long. More specifically, remaining above $7,600 will be the primary challenge for the Bitcoin price.\nJudging by the chart of the past week, the Bitcoin price has surpassed $7,600 on at least two occasions. Every single time, the price was pushed to well below $7,500 fairly quickly. It is likely this situation will happen once again, although there are no certainties when it comes to cryptocurrency whatsoever.\nThe Bitcoin trading volume hasn’t changed all that much, albeit one shouldn’t expect anything less these days. With $4.666bn, there is still plenty of interest in trading Bitcoin – either for profit or otherwise – albeit this volume will need to pick up the pace sooner rather than later if major gains are to be achieved. Whether or not that will happen, is a different matter altogether.\nLooking over the exchanges ranked by trading volume, it quickly becomes apparent Binance continues to dominate the markets at all times. The exchange’s USDT pair generates the most volume, and its EOS pair is also in the top five. Huobi and OKEx’s USDT pair, as well as Bitfinex’s USD pair, are all in the top five as well. A very peculiar mix of currencies, although it seems sufficient to keep the Bitcoin price momentum going, for the time being.\nAs far as the Bitcoin price is concerned, there are no certainties whatsoever. While the momentum seems relatively positive right now, things can turn on a dime at any given moment. If the Bitcoin price remains above $7,600 for a few days, interesting things are bound to happen sooner or later. According to the bigger picture, the Bitcoin price trend remains in place rather firmly, for the time being.

In this regard, Wozniak joins Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, in his enthusiasm for Bitcoin becoming the single worldwide currency. Bitcoin: The Native Currency of the Internet\nA growing number of influential voices are claiming that Bitcoin should become the currency of the Internet.\nMost recently, during a CNBC interview, Wozniak conveyed his sentiment that Bitcoin should become the currency of the Internet, affirming Bitcoin’s purity and power. During the interview, Wozniak said:\nBitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.\nWozniak also indicated that he agrees with Jack Dorsey regarding the fact that Bitcoin should become the single global currency. Specifically, Wozniak said:\nI buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.\nWozniak was referring to Dorsey’s prediction, “The Internet is going to have a native currency.” Dorsey issued this prediction at the Consensus Blockchain Conference in New York in May. As reported by CNET , Dorsey also stated :\nThe internet is going to have a native currency, so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin, but I hope it will be. Bitcoin Makes Square Profitable\nDorsey seemed to acquiesce to client demand when Square started to provide Bitcoin trading capabilities to its Cash App. When announcing these new features, the company stated :\nCustomers can now buy and sell Bitcoin in Cash App. We observed that this was a feature our customers wanted, and we support Bitcoin because we see it as a step in the long-term path toward greater financial access for all.\nDorsey was right. Since Square, Inc. added Bitcoin trading features to its payment app, the value of its stocks has increased significantly. As a result, last April, Dan Dolev, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, believing that this ascending trajectory would most likely continue, raised its Square target price to USD 65, from USD 50. As of this writing, a share of SQ is already over USD 61.\nDorsey and Wozniak remain faithful to their vision that the Internet will eventually have only one currency, preferably Bitcoin. Some time ago, Wozniak declared that Bitcoin was better than gold, and Dorsey said :\nBitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade.\nWhat do you think of Bitcoin becoming be the single currency of the Internet?

Key Points Bitcoin price formed a support base near $7,350 and recovered nicely against the US Dollar. There is a key connecting bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to move past the $7,650 and $7,680 resistance levels to gain traction.\nBitcoin price is showing positive signs above $7,500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must clear the $7,650 barrier for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nYesterday, we saw a bearish wave below the $7,400 level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded as low as $7,369 before buyers appeared. A base was formed near $7,350 before the price started an upside move. It traded higher and broke the $7,450 level along with the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $7,780 swing high to $7,350 swing low.\nThe price also succeeded in settling above the $7,500 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Later, there was a close above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $7,780 swing high to $7,350 swing low. However, the price is currently struggling to clear the $7,650 resistance. There is also a key connecting bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, a close above the $7,650 resistance is needed for an upside acceleration towards $7,800.\nLooking at the chart , the current price action is positive, but a proper break above $7,650 is needed for buyers to take control. On the downside, an initial support is around $7,500, followed by $7,400. Below this last, the price may perhaps retest the $7,350 support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD has reduced most of its bullish slope.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now placed well above the 55 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,400 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:09:00.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14ae7056ec4641d107d0c1bd1f2664337ea12f11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5962uBEp3RSiltzBNGL3krvsaoWo.wNuEGWHArOzLE4J3T_4INFu.4VkpVh1u.rEpQECAYm7WdKxCr5rm0WePPLJOnpYjRxdgRgqKc3qboMgXbXW8IYCZ", "site_full": "thrillercrypto.com", "site": "thrillercrypto.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website – Thriller Crypto", "title_full": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website – Thriller Crypto", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/russia-court-768x768.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14ae7056ec4641d107d0c1bd1f2664337ea12f11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5962uBEp3RSiltzBNGL3krvsaoWo.wNuEGWHArOzLE4J3T_4INFu.4VkpVh1u.rEpQECAYm7WdKxCr5rm0WePPLJOnpYjRxdgRgqKc3qboMgXbXW8IYCZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website – Thriller Crypto", "text": "Share 1 Shares\nA Russian court has overturned a previous court decision to block a bitcoin-related website because it contains information about cryptocurrencies.

This is a $100 spike from yesterday’s dreary $7,400, which bitcoin had previously fallen to from $7,600. It appears the currency is experiencing solid resistance at this mark, and how long it will stay there is difficult to predict.\nThe price drop may have been caused by recent news regarding popular cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. The platform suffered a DDoS attack during the early morning hours of Tuesday June 5, and was forced to temporarily halt its trading services so executives could examine the damage and perform necessary maintenance. At press time, the operation appears to be back to normal and users’ account balances appear unaffected.\nHowever, the price of bitcoin did drop by roughly two percent following the attack. The currency was trading for as low as $7,300 during Tuesday’s evening hours, though bitcoin has managed to recover somewhat since then.\nIt’s not the first time Bitfinex was the subject of malicious activity. The trading platform incurred a nasty flash crash in December 2017 when cryptocurrency was at its peak and hundreds of thousands of new customers were flocking to crypto exchanges to get in on the action. Several users demanded answers and refunds as they were left in the dark.\nIn addition, Bitfinex was hacked roughly two years ago and was forced to suspend its operations in August of 2016 after hackers made off with approximately 120,000 bitcoins.\nLong-term sentiment towards bitcoin seems to be relatively mixed. Trefis Research, for example, which originally predicted a year -end bitcoin price of roughly $15,000, is now retracting this statement and saying that bitcoin will probably finish 2018 at around $12,000 only. Data analysts say trading, buying and selling is likely to increase in the coming months, but that growth will not be as steady as expected.\n“The global cryptocurrency industry has seen a flurry of new developments since December,” representatives of the firm explained. “Many of these developments had a negative impact on the growth prospects of cryptocurrencies, like restrictions by banks on the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies and calls by financial regulators across the world for caution while investing in digital currencies.”\nOn the other hand, trader Jeff Kilburg is much more bullish in his sentiment, and he expects bitcoin to experience a significant boost in the coming months. As the CEO of KKM Financial, the analyst and entrepreneur explained:\n“All these people who want access and want allocation to cryptocurrency – it takes time to get those accounts open, so that’s happening, but right now, yes… There are cryptocurrency folks still driving around in New York in their Lamborghinis waiting for the price to go back above $8,000. I think it is coming; it has been a slow-moving ship, but there has been a quiet period, and we haven’t had a boost yet. We haven’t had somebody come out and really support it – if it’s someone saying something positive – we just haven’t seen that in a while. I think the news cycle, which really drives bitcoin, is due for a pop.” Post navigation ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T00:57:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd04741b912440938f9eff7b4cadc0ecbe5f4241", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgsjehx.Sw1tdO0TcMJTMJNwNJ1JZcNo80U_RVUzn2E.byY57zkcvmEU-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin symbol on newsnight uk : btc", "title_full": "Bitcoin symbol on newsnight uk : btc", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.112, "main_image": "https://www.redditstatic.com/icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd04741b912440938f9eff7b4cadc0ecbe5f4241", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgsjehx.Sw1tdO0TcMJTMJNwNJ1JZcNo80U_RVUzn2E.byY57zkcvmEU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin symbol on newsnight uk : btc", "text": "subscribe unsubscribe 204,746 readers 3,771 users here now\nWelcome to /r/btc !

Zing.vn publication elaborated:\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance, mining machines are not on the list of goods banned from importation and are not subject to the list of specialized management or unsafe goods, so enterprises are easily allowed to complete the import procedures.\nThe ministry outlined in its report that the use of mining equipment for bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country is difficult for the authority to manage. “From there, it is easy for people to use [cryptocurrencies] as a currency or another method of payment,” the City Economic News Kinhte & Dothi quoted the ministry. “This is in violation of the amended government Decree 101 on non-cash payments,” Zing.vn conveyed.\nThe publication also noted that data from the General Department of Vietnam Customs shows that “from 2017 to half of 4/2018, the country imported about 15,600 mining machines,” adding that most of them were imported into Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang. Last year, more than 9,300 rigs were imported into Vietnam and over 6,300 rigs were imported in the first four months of this year. Decision to Ban Mining Imports\nThe ministry also referred the case where Modern Tech Corp in Ho Chi Minh City was “accused [of] over VND 15 trillion [~US$656 million] of fraud by more than 32,000 people through its Ifan and Pincoin virtual currency investment models.” According to the ministry, protecting the Vietnamese people from similar scams in the future “requires state management agencies to take strict control measures with the import and use of this commodity.” The Vnexpress reiterated:\nTo prevent other possible events, in the immediate future, the Ministry of Finance proposed to apply the import suspension measures for the above types of mining equipment.\nThe Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc recently signed a directive to strengthen “the management of activities related to bitcoin and other virtual currencies,” as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nWhat do you think of the proposal to ban mining rig imports?

Within the crypto community, opinion is, to put it mildly, divided. Should you own one ahead of the other? Both? Or neither? You should definitely own a little bit of cryptocurrency Let me start by answering one part of that question straight away. If you are an investor, you absolutely should own some cryptocurrency in your portfolio, even if only a small amount. The transformative potential of the technology is too great not to have some exposure to it. If you haven’t already got some crypto, get some, even if it’s only a tenner’s worth ( read my step by step instructions on how to do that here ). Start small, as I always say, educate yourself, get used to the tech and, once you’re familiar, if you still think this thing has legs, increase your exposure. It’s important you make the decision whether to increase your exposure yourself (not based on what somebody somewhere said) and that you make that call from an informed position. I rather suspect you have plenty of time to get educated. My macro view is that, for the time being, the sector is in a period of consolidation. After the enormous gains of last year, it needs a period of digestion. This is normal and natural. Use this consolidation period (assuming I’m right that it is consolidating) to your advantage and get educated, if you are not already. Right. Onwards. When Satoshi Nakamoto announced his invention, bitcoin, to the world on an out-of-the-way mailing list for cryptographers, the very first thing he said was: “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.” It’s important to distinguish, here, between cash and money. In the physical world, we are using cash less and less. That’s not to say we do not need it: the recent breakdown of the Visa network showed the dangers of relying on third parties for transactions. Cash involves no third party. There is no dependence on anyone else, no intermediary. It is paid directly from A to B. We use it for small transactions, which are too expensive to process (a pint of milk from the corner shop). We use it for quick transactions (throwing money to a busker). We use it for private transactions (things you don’t want your spouse to know about) and, yes, we use it for illegal transactions (paying the cleaner or buying AK47s). The birth of bitcoin cash The idea of bitcoin was to be a system of cash for the internet: an online payment system, which involved no third parties. But the developers of bitcoin cash felt bitcoin had strayed from that original goal. Transaction fees were too high for small payments. Transaction times too slow for quick payments. The criticism was valid. Bitcoin has morphed into a speculative asset, more like digital gold than cash. Gold has its uses as a store of value. It once provided the backbone of the global monetary system. But its use in payments was always limited. People preferred to hoard gold and pay with copper, nickel, silver or paper. Bitcoin’s role in the crypto eco-structure is similar. Interestingly, Nick Szabo, who developed a precursor to bitcoin called bitgold, once told me his aim with it was “To become a reserve, high-powered currency”. (You can read more about that conversation in my book ). Bitcoin has fulfilled that goal. But, for payments, it was failing. And so bitcoin cash was forked out of bitcoin (see it as a spin-out). Everyone who owned bitcoin on 1 August, 2017 got some bitcoin cash. Bitcoin cash has since proved to be better for payments. The transaction times are quicker. The fees are lower. However, a multitude of other cryptocoins are perhaps as just as good as bitcoin cash for online cash payments: Dash, Monero, Zcash, Stellar, to name some of the better-known. Bitcoin diehards argue that bitcoin cash has unscrupulously tried to steal bitcoin’s limelight. They say that people are misled into buying it thinking it is bitcoin. One of the key bitcoin cash developers, Craig Wright, has – falsely, they declare – claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. I once met Wright. He’s supremely bright, but he is also awkward and he rubs people up the wrong way. He has rubbed up much of the bitcoin community the wrong way. This has only added to the friction. Certainly, the politics of the fork could have been handled better (though I have to say I have some sympathy with why they have not). No matter. We are investors. We keep our politics out of our investment choices. Which one is the better investment now? Bitcoin, bitcoin cash – or both? Bitcoin is the backbone of crypto. Though there are better coins, bitcoin has a network effect like no other. You should own some. But – and I know I am going to upset a lot of people by saying this – at current prices I think bitcoin cash is actually the better investment. Whereas in the bitcoin community there is quite a bit of in-fighting amongst developers, bitcoin cash seems to be more united. I went to meet some of the developers to discuss my financial gameshow , when I was looking for sponsors. Within about three minutes of talking to me, they were trying to get me to arrange for bitcoin cash to be a means of payment for the entire Edinburgh Festival, and offering to build the infrastructure. Given that this is the most ticketed event in the world after the Olympics and the World Cup, this is no small undertaking. I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used. (Full disclosure, we have shaken hands on a deal to sponsor my show, though nothing has yet been announced, so I am almost certainly biased. On the other hand, I wouldn’t have a bunch of bozos sponsoring my product). When the fork happened last August, bitcoin was sitting around $2,800. Bitcoin cash began life around $250. At its highs bitcoin went to $20,000. Bitcoin cash hit $4,000. Today bitcoin sits around $7,500. Bitcoin cash is $1,100. Bitcoin cash has outperformed. Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash. One way of looking at it is to see bitcoin cash as silver to bitcoin’s gold. The bitcoin cash people won’t like me saying that. They want it to supersede bitcoin – and there’s a very outside chance it might. I like bitcoin. Gosh, I wrote a book about it. I like bitcoin cash. My view is that you should own both. And if you want to get started with both, head on over to bitcoin.com . My guide to getting started with bitcoin is here (though it was written before the fork). Remember – start small and don’t speculate significant capital until you know what you are doing. Of course, all research into bitcoin should begin with what is surely the definitive book. And if you are free this Sunday and in London, I’m doing another try-out of my Financial Gameshow at the Backyard in Bethnal Green . You could actually win yourself some bitcoin cash as well as some silver. Entry is free. Did I say free? Yes, I did.

The cryptocurrency was on the defensive yesterday, courtesy of a failed breakout and a rising-wedge breakdown and looked set to re-test the recent low of $7,040.\nHowever, sellers ran out of steam at $7,372, as indicated by a doji candle and prices moved back above $7,600 in the Asian session today.\nWhile the exact reason behind the bear exhaustion is unclear, it fits with a recently observed pattern that bitcoin changes direction in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month.\nThe cryptocurrency is down more than 30 percent from the recent high of $9,990, meaning the bulls are on the back foot. So bitcoin could turn higher today, as indicated by the historical pattern.\nFurthermore, the fear of getting trapped on the wrong side of the market may have forced the bears to stay on the sidelines, despite the false breakout and rising-wedge breakdown.\nThat said, the cryptocurrency is still treading waters in the bearish territory, as seen in the chart below. 4-hour chart\nThe bearish rising-wedge breakdown remains valid as long as bitcoin keeps trading below $7,780 (June 3 high). So, the downside is still in play and the sell-off could accelerate if the support at $7,372 is breached.\nHowever, the 50-candle moving average (MA) has started rising in favor of the bulls and the 100-candle MA has flatlined (shed bearish bias), so the odds of a break below $7,372 are low. View A high volume break above $7,780 would add credence to the quirky \"6th of the month\" pattern and signal a bullish trend reversal. In this case, prices will likely rise to the 10-week MA, currently located at $8,310. A break below $7,372 would put the focus back on the rising-wedge breakdown and allow a drop to $7,040.\nHourglass image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin bulls", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T15:31:54.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc54fee9b87110722a4716a58e2f36ab80d932d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvKqHJVBn1lEPol7MWit3mf1PSBCf17E5_vT4vDDWtrxAkdDqumcJamiutd2I._drUfiVvnkK_6xJ6a8DpeJx.ZI_Rt1BWf2jXupV3FKWQCGFlCrDqksp1TspI_RKpII3VTXzMcoVf6IC8xqveKOZny_txdNYsQ4pp4IbW.umnCXRdI09PApkHSHJcg6jg0WUQcc6TbpKb4T_3gccSlPqOz9Lot1Tue.DHci6P96DR0zu9b3ZeTYnWCg--", "site_full": "www.4-traders.com", "site": "4-traders.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - 4-Traders.com", "title": "SinglePoint Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10 | 4-Traders", "title_full": "SinglePoint Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10 | 4-Traders", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27554, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f49807f3ce61ce765164563a40280f8afc55835f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9_b24040rb6.MwT7MJEvvKqHJVBn1lEPol7MWit3mf1PSBCf17E5_vT4vDDWtrxAkdDqumcJamiutd2I._drUfiVvnkK_6xJ6a8DpeJx.ZI_Rt1BWf2jXupV3FKWQCGFlCrDqksp1TspI_RKpII3VTXzMcoVf6IC8xqveKOZny_txdNYsQ4pp4IbW.umnCXRdI09PApkHSOtLSuJilReq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "www.4-traders.com", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "SinglePoint Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10 | 4-Traders", "text": "SEATTLE, June 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- SinglePoint Inc.

digital currencies traded lower Wednesday, erasing gains from the prior session. Bitcoin, the worlds biggest digital currency, continues to lack direction, hovering around $7,500.\nThe lack of activity and inability to recover losses early in 2018 prompted research firm Trefis to lower its year-end price target for the No.1 digital currency. “Adjusting our forecast for transaction volumes in our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator now leads to a year-end price target of around $12,500—down from our earlier estimate of $15,000,” or about 17%, according to Trefis in a June 5 research note.\n“The global cryptocurrency industry has seen a flurry of new developments since December. Many of these developments had a negative impact on the growth prospects of cryptocurrencies, like restrictions by banks on the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, and calls by financial regulators across the world for caution while investing in digital currencies.”\nThe Trefis Price Estimator tracks the current price trend with two inputs; daily active users and daily transaction volume and according to its website has an accuracy rate of over 94%.\nA single bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.06% was last valued at $7,526.32, down 1.3% since Tuesday 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange.\nRead: If bitcoin is a bubble, the ‘panic’ stage is near: economist\nAltcoins and futures trend lower Wednesday Major altcoins, or coins other than bitcoin, also traded lower Wednesday. Ether ETHUSD, +0.52% is down 2% to $596.20, Bitcoin Cash BCHUSD, +1.38% has lost 3.6% at $1,110.70, Litecoin LTCUSD, +1.30% is lower by 1.5% at $119.37 and Ripple’s XRP coin XRPUSD, +2.02% is down 2.5% at 66 cents.\nBitcoin futures closed Wednesday in the red. The Cboe June contract XBTM8, +2.46% finished the day down 1.3% at $7,525, while the CME June contract BTCM8, +2.39% closed lower by 1.2% at $7,540.\nRead: Bitcoin is ‘the last thing I’d want to own’ if the grid goes down, says famed short seller Jim Chanos\nAaron Hankin Aaron Hankin is a MarketWatch reporter in New York who covers cryptocurrency and financial markets.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/ltWyAUTf", "http://twitter.com/@ahhankin"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "trefis research", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trefis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T18:20:49.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "faf8a0a1b7c07d88674bb6be4273c1f039960d96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS0ZVT0AfiZxbDk19P9t7gfo-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "faf8a0a1b7c07d88674bb6be4273c1f039960d96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS0ZVT0AfiZxbDk19P9t7gfo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nCryptoTab work is based on a smart system, which dynamically switches mining between several cryptocurrencies for increasing profit up to 4x relative to continued mining of the only one cryptocurrency.

After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Stock analytics firm Trefis has recently lowered their Bitcoin (BTC) year-end price forecast from $15,000 to $12,500, according to a blog post June 5. Lowering Our Year-End Bitcoin Price Target To $12,500 Due To Weaker Transaction Volume Outlook https://t.co/Plya7iHWKo\n— TREFIS (@Trefis) June 6, 2018\nTrefis’ BTC forecast analytics is based on fundamentals of supply and demand, where demand is the number of users and the amount of transactions, and supply is the number of available BTC. Trefis pointed out significant recent losses in total transaction volumes across crypto exchanges, and attributes a surplus in supply and subsequent drop in price to Mt. Gox dumping BTC onto exchanges this spring. “Adjusting our forecast for transaction volumes… leads to a year-end price target of around $12,500 – down from our earlier estimate of $15,000.” Trefis’ interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator reflects the number of unique BTC users, as well as transaction volumes for each month till the end of 2018. At press time, BTC market capitalization is over $131 bln according to Coinmarketcap . Trefis noted that while the major cryptocurrency has seen some gains over the last days of May, it still declined sharply over the month, having dropped to monthly lows after almost touching the $10,000 mark. Recently, the crypto market’s low capitalization was noted in a study by the Dutch government. The study found that low trading volumes in addition to minimal institutional exposure made crypto a low risk to the country’s financial stability. Earlier in May, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart claimed that Bitcoin will trade “at least” above $10,000 by the year’s end, also arguing that most altcoins are possibly “overvalued” and “have significant headwind.”\nWhile the overall Bitcoin year-end price estimations see a downward trend, Fundstrat’s Thomas Lee recently said that he still expects it to reach as high as $25,000 by the end of this year.

Many Bitcoin bears believe that this indicator shows that direct investment interest in this cryptocurrency. Although this may be somewhat true, this indicator tells far from the whole story. As well, Tom was quick to point out that the Google Trends indicator was not fully indicative of the price and popularity of Bitcoin :\n“Google searches aren’t the leading indicator for Bitcoin, but instead, acts as a ‘coincident indicator,’ and therefore shouldn’t be looked to as some sort of BTC price predictor .”\nIn this case, this “coincident indicator” means that it moves in correlation with Bitcoin’s price, instead of preemptively signaling the price movement of the popular cryptocurrency. Lee also assured viewers that he believes that traditional institutions are still interested in investing in the space, despite the short-term bear market which the cryptocurrency market has experienced.\nAnother point which Bitcoin bears made was that trading volumes have plummeted since last year’s bull run. According to CoinMarketCap , trading volume is down by over 75% since the late December highs seen in the industry.\nTo help combat this supposed bearish indicator, Lee called the run-up last year a “parabolic blow off.” This essentially means that he thought that the volume seen during late last year was an abnormal figure, and should not be as relevant now. He also compared the daily figures to other volume figures from earlier in 2017;\n“Compared to a year ago, (over) the same time (the first 6 months of 2017), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent .”\nThis fact affirming that he believes that the volume present in the cryptocurrency trading space is still “healthy.” Tom Lee Affirms That Bitcoin Will Move In An Upward Direction\nFinally, Lee addressed the bearish sentiment that Bitcoin has been struggling to break over the mental and technical barriers in the $10,000 range. To help assist his bullish views on the market, he utilized some research done by his market analysis firm, FundStrat. The Bitcoin bull said specifically:\n“Bitcoin makes all of its performance in 10 days, in any year. So I don’t think that the fact that it is at the current levels is going to prevent it from actually rising before the end of the year.”\nAccording to his prior appearances on CNBC segments, Bitcoin’s price movements can be mainly attributed to 10 days throughout a whole year. If you took out those 10 days in any year, Bitcoin would be down an average of 25% in that year. With this data, he made it apparent that he believes that a Bitcoin price surge will occur within the time span of a few days.\nIf Bitcoin somehow manages to continue its downward trend, Tom Lee made it clear that he believes that Bitcoin will hold price levels at the cost of mining a single Bitcoin. According to research from his firm, the current cost of mining a Bitcoin sits at an average of $6,000 and if history is any indication, that means Bitcoin should hold at $6,000 if worst comes to worst.\nImage from Shutterstock Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Refutes Bearish Sentiment, Predicts Further Gains was last modified: June 6th, 2018 by nickchong ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin bull tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "permabull tom lee appears", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:42:06.026+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 29108, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=3100", "requestsLeft": 631}
