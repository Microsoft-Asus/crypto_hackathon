Can Bitcoin Replace SWIFT? Through a strategic partnership with Bitex, a cryptocurrency payment service provider based in South America, Dakak explained that the bank will outsource the conversion process of bitcoin to fiat currencies to Bitex, which will then send bitcoin to the recipient. The end cost would be the bitcoin transaction fee that is sent to the miners that verify transactions on the blockchain and the fee charged by Bitex. “The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” said Banco Masventas. Dakak noted that one of the initial actions the bank took to streamline the implementation process of bitcoin was to cooperate with the Bitex development team to ensure recipients of bitcoin payments can seamlessly receive cryptocurrency transactions without boundaries. Dakak stated: “One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad.” The SWIFT network , which is utilized by the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions, is essentially a messaging network that enables banks to share information. Sending a payment from one bank to another requires a message to be sent on the SWIFT network, which has to be verified manually. Sending international payments and remittance transactions on the SWIFT network can take at least five business days to three weeks, depending on the size of the payment. Because most international payments processed by banks are large, it often takes more than a week for the payment to be cleared. Source: Shutterstock Bitcoin is not the most flexible blockchain network and it does not have the biggest capacity. But, it is the most robust blockchain protocol with the longest track record, equipped with one of the most active open-source development groups in the industry. Its transparency and security allow the Bitcoin network to operate as a reliable financial network for international payments. Moreover, most international payments sent by banks, as stated above, are often large transactions that cannot be processed by remittance outlets. Although bitcoin transaction fees could be an issue for $1 to $10 payments, for payments above $1,000, the bitcoin transaction fee is a non-issue. Why is SWIFT Still Used? The SWIFT network is not only operated by leading banks by owned by the world’s biggest financial institutions. As such, even though the SWIFT network is outdated and utilizes an inferior technology, banks have the obligation to use it. That is, until minor banks like Bank Masventas opt out of the SWIFT network and begin to leverage public financial networks like bitcoin, which are completely decentralized and peer-to-peer. Other banks have started to pilot blockchain protocols like Ripple and Ethereum to process international payments, which could be crucial in demonstrating the potential of cryptocurrency as an alternative to the global finance sector in the long-term.

Speaking at an industry even in London sponsored by the Association for Financial Markets, Deutsche Boerse head of clients Jeffrey Tessler said that the firm is holding serious discussions about listing bitcoin products, though it still has reservations about the nascent asset class. “Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do,” Bloomberg quotes him as saying, “we want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.” “We are deep at work with it,” he added. Tessler said that the company is “not at the same stage” in its comfort level with bitcoin as CME, its Chicago-based rival and the world leader in regulated bitcoin futures trading. CME has also said that it is gauging client interest in an ethereum futures product , and its recent launch of an ether price index has laid the groundwork for that development. But while CME and fellow Chicago exchange CBOE have seen as much as $670 million in combined bitcoin futures volume during a single trading session, no major European exchange has listed derivatives products for bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. As CCN reported , regulated UK trading platform Crypto Facilities has launched futures products for bitcoin, ether, and XRP. Pricing data from the exchange’s bitcoin and ether products is included in CME’s bitcoin and ether reference rate indices. However, these products have yet to catch on at larger venues like Deutsche Boerse. In the US, meanwhile, the operators of both the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are holding discussions about listing cryptocurrency products , and the NYSE is rumored to be considering whether to launch a full-fledged cryptocurrency exchange.

At the same time, he admitted that if cryptocurrency stabilizes in the future and becomes “better currency”, his company will “certainly support that”. Rainey added that the volatile crypto swings threaten the viability of the businesses Paypal is working with.\n“If you’re a merchant and you have, let’s say, a 10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction,” Paypal CFO told CNBC. “You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that,” Rainey elaborated.\nDespite Paypal’s current position on cryptocurrencies, a recent patent filing revealed that the payment provider might be considering expanding its exposure to the crypto ecosystem. Reports came out in March this year that Paypal has filed a new patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for an “expedited virtual currency transaction system”. Back in 2016, it was reported that the company had applied for another crypto-related patent – one that envisages the development of a payment module accepting bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin. www.colossusgists.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john rainey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:14:35.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70b52ea146d00cf9e6de1781ac647e5f735af59f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XL1UWd_wAib9rSxIVUc3JJRrSS_n0wQxWmAR2.eJV8vN9i.JcxdZ3VS5Q7gRd.qRGw1HpAKb.iQ--", "site_full": "www.zobo.co.za", "site": "zobo.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.zobo.co.za/feed/mpumalanga-news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Mpumalanga News | Zobo.co.za:South Africa News, Updated Every Minute", "title": "Boy in Bitcoin kidnapping case found", "title_full": "Boy in Bitcoin kidnapping case found", "published": "2018-05-24T11:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70b52ea146d00cf9e6de1781ac647e5f735af59f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XL1UWd_wAib9rSxIVUc3JJRrSS_n0wQxWmAR2.eJV8vN9i.JcxdZ3VS5Q7gRd.qRGw1HpAKb.iQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T11:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Boy in Bitcoin kidnapping case found", "text": "Boy in Bitcoin kidnapping case found\nKidnappers left a note demanding a ransom in the form of Bitcoin.

There are two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently moving higher, but it is likely to face a strong selling interest just below $8,000.\nBitcoin price nosedived towards $7,500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD is currently recovering ground towards a few key barriers like $7,800 and $8,000.\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nThe past 5-6 sessions were mostly bearish as bitcoin price tumbled below the $8,000 support against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair declined sharply and even broke the $7,600 support level. It traded towards the $7,400 level before finding buyers. A low was formed near $7,440 from where a fresh upward correction was initiated and the price moved above $7,600.\nThe price managed to move above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low. However, there are many hurdles for buyers around the $8,000 level. At the moment, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low is acting as a resistance near $7,700. There are also two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The second trend line is significant since it is formed via connecting the $8,300 swing high.\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing a few positive signs above $7,500. Having said that, a break above the $8,000 barrier is must for buyers to gain control. On the other, if buyers fail to push the price above $8,000, there is a risk of yet another slide back to $7,500.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is struggling to move back above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,500", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

If you got a phone call and the surveyor says “do you own crypto!” a crypto holder will get their dick all frenzied up and then answer the questions, where a regular human that doesn’t buy Chuck E. Cheese virtual tokens will just hang up because it’s “spam calls.” Out of the 2000 surveyed, don’t you think they could have called 5... 10 thousand people before they got enough data to make 2000 respondents? (Question is how they lead up to the question is the premise here that invalidates the study)\nAlso their averages are screwed up to hell, they state that each person who is invested has an average of $3000 invested. Most of America is in debt, so it’s hard to believe that there isn’t a huge standard deviation & outliers to this number. Or it’s just confirmation bias that rich people are more likely to buy crypto, which is an alternative hypothesis. Regardless, if they tapped a bitcoin millionaire, he could have made the numbers skyrocket.\nTL:DR I don’t take surveys seriously. Look at elections, look at anything of meaning. Take a peek at what was predicted vs what actually happened and that my friends, is what happens when you extrapolate biased data to the whole population.\nSource: I have a statistics final tomorrow and I am studying over night for it [link] [comments] from Cryptocurrency news and discussions. https://ift.tt/2LphfHX Bitcoin.com pushed out an article saying that 8% of Americans own cryptocurrency.

The institution has partnered with the Latin America–focused exchange startup Bitex — founded in 2014 — to potentially compete with SWIFT , a global, bank-owned messaging network. SWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is built to handle and process international bank payments. Unfortunately, the project has been suffering from security issues since it first entered the monetary arena. Banco Masventas is now the first financial establishment to base its cross-border payment system on the Bitcoin network. The website states that the service is set to enable international transfers to as many as 50 countries and that payments can be processed in 24 hours or less. Translated from their website, the service “allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers, as there are no international banks [serving] as intermediaries.” The move was reportedly inspired by the bank’s goal to enhance its digital services and lower transaction costs. One of the establishment’s principal shareholders, José Dakak, stated that the bank is also looking to grow its list of international customers. “One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad,” he explained. Dakak then added, “The customers will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the bank uses Bitex as a provider. For the customer, it’s transparent, they don’t touch, they don’t see the bitcoin. We are a provider for them, and they are not touching bitcoin.” Aside from accelerating transaction times, Bitex — according to its website — will provide heightened security for customers by enforcing “strictest compliance rules,” including know-your-client (KYC) measures. The company has also contracted one of the “Big Four” accounting and audit firms, Deloitte, to review and report on specific procedures, operations and balance funds. Argentina’s blockchain and cryptocurrency ambitions have witnessed regular growth over the past several months, and the Argentinian government has been relatively welcoming to the technology. Earlier this year, for example, new legislation paved the way for approximately 4,000 bitcoin ATMs , which are now being installed throughout the country. In April, Argentina became one of the first countries to declare an official “Bitcoin Day.” This article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

While cryptocurrency isn’t really Revolut’s focus point, it’s a good way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\nIf you have a Revolut account, you can now buy and hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Behind the scene, the startup has partnered with Bitstamp to process the transactions. Revolut currently charges a 1.5 percent fee for cryptocurrency transactions. There are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nCompared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. You don’t get a bitcoin address for instance. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you’ll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults . Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time.\nYou can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. For instance, if you pay $3.47 for that delicious ice cream, you’ll save 53 cents in your vault. You can also multiple that amount so that you save multiple times your spare change with each transaction. Many fintech startups also provide this feature.\nYou can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money each day, each week or each month. Interestingly, you get to choose the currency of your vault. So it means that you can decide to buy ethers with spare change and weekly payments for instance.

The result is an incredibly misleading ad that says Bitcoin fans are for drug deals and human trafficking. Fellow Democrats Dave Min and Brian Forde clashed over accepting cryptocurrencies as donations while running for California’s 45 th Congressional race. Forde is promoted by the media as amongst the earliest politicians to start accepting cryptocurrencies as donations. With that said, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, have made their way into mainstream politics over the last couple of years. Back in September 2017, Austin Petersen, a Senate candidate in Missouri also began accepting Bitcoin for campaign contributions. Cryptocurrency and politics is a relatively new phenomenon. Winston Edmonson, a four-time mayoral candidate in the Texas city of Lewisville, proposed the issuance of a municipal cryptocurrency as means of funding the local police force without having to raise taxes. Then there was firebrand Ron Paul putting forward a bill to allow competing currencies. Democratic Deer Fight As reported by multiple outlets, Brian Forde has stated that his campaign has managed to raise upwards of $130,000 in different cryptocurrencies. This clearly shows that Forde is currently a favorite among the world of crypto enthusiasts. Another proof for that is that he’s managed to get more Bitcoin contributions than all of the previous candidates for Congress combined, according to Bloomberg. Naturally, this fires up the spark of competition. A rival Democratic candidate of Forde – Dave Min, who’s also a former SEC attorney, launched a TV ad which contained the following line about his rival: Brian Forde’s big donors? Bitcoin speculators who oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking. Now that’s harsh. Pressing Where It Hurts Naturally, a strong statement of the kind is to be expected to trigger a serious reaction. As such, one would expect for it to be substantiated with facts, as politics is all about hard facts and decisions based on them, right? Don’t answer that. According to Axios , Min’s campaign manager failed to provide any reasonable merit for these serious accusations. As a matter of fact, as if she’s realized that the ad might have gone a bit too far, she states that while Min “is a huge believer in the potential of distributed ledger technology,” his primary concerns are focused towards some “deregulatory agenda being pushed by Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.” Questionable Merits at Best Despite refusing to provide any straightforward specifics, Min’s campaign manager pointed towards Brock Pierce as one of Forde’s leading Bitcoin donors. To this, Forde responded that: Pierce, while extremely controversial, has never publicly said he opposes ‘cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.’ Indeed, starting beef of that kind seems quite sensational, but it should at least be backed by certain spot-on facts so that it doesn’t deflate as soon as someone questions it. Can we Please Cut the Cr*p Already? For whatever reason, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, are continuously being associated with all kinds of illicit activity. Yes, Bitcoin is used by criminals, and so are other digital currencies. But it doesn’t even begin to compare to conventional fiat currency in this respect. And that’s a stone cold, research-backed truth. So much so, in fact, that it has been confirmed by official authorities and institutions throughout the entire world. The UK’s National Crime Agency confirmed it, Quebec’s government confirmed it, and even Hong Kong’s Financial Services and Treasury confirmed it, to list a few. In other words, it might be high time for officials, especially those who are in or currently running for office, regardless of where they are, to do a flat-out fact check before refuting an entire community based on, well, nothing.

With fiat currency like US Dollars, you can store them at the bank or in your wallet. It’s pretty straightforward. But with digital currencies, there are a few wrinkles that you need to get your head around, but the idea is similar. Let’s take a look at how cryptocurrency storage works. You store your cryptocurrencies on the blockchain in a “wallet.” This is simply an address on the blockchain. It’s like how the website address tradingheroes.com directs you to my website, on the internet. Each wallet has a public address and a private address. The public address is the address that people send funds to. The private address is the “password” that you use to access and send your funds. Never expose your private key until you are ready to spend your funds, otherwise you will probably lose all the money in your wallet. Here’s an example from a Bitcoin paper wallet at https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/ . Now that you understand the basics of cryptocurrency wallets, let’s look at the different wallet options out there. Here are the different ways that you can store your loot. Online wallet: This is probably the easiest way to store your money. But it is also the least secure. So it’s not a good long term storage solution, but it is fine for buying things and funding your trading accounts. Exchanges like Coinbase also have their own wallets built in.\nMobile wallet: You can download a mobile app like Mycelium at https://wallet.mycelium.com/index.html to store your spending money. It is more secure than an online wallet, but if your phone ever breaks or it gets hacked, everything in your wallet will be gone. Desktop wallet: Similar to a mobile app but just for desktop computers. Hardware device wallet: These are hardware devices at http://amzn.to/2qwtIP7 that are built especially for storing cryptocurrency keys. They are safer than the options above, but they are still susceptible to the things that can damage all electronic devices. Paper wallet: You can also store your private key on paper, like in the picture above. This is the most hacker proof, but it is also the least convenient. If you are going to go this route, be sure to store them in a safe place (like a safety deposit box) and don’t actually use paper. Use something like this at http://amzn.to/2sfPcAj to make sure that your money isn’t lost to something as simple as a spilled beer. Cryptocurrency Tracking Apps. Before I wrap it up, you will probably need an app to track cryptocurrency prices on your phone. So here are a couple of apps that might work for you. Blockfolio at https://blockfolio.com/ . A simple app that allows you to add a watch list and add trades so you can track your portfolio, ala stock trading apps. The most useful thing about this app is that it displays all currencies on your watch list in the currency of your choice. Some apps insist on displaying the value in Bitcoin, which is annoying.\nCoincap at https://coincap.io/ . This app allows you to display currencies by market capitalization, volume and other ranking factors. They also have cool charts. Very useful for seeing what is being actively traded. Also displays prices in your currency of choice. These apps are not for storing or trading currency. They are just to check the markets. What Can Affect the Price of a Cryptocurrency? There are many things that can affect the price of a cryptocurrency…sometimes very quickly. Here is what you need to be aware of when you trade cryptocurrencies. Of course, there is no guarantee that these things will move the market. But based on what we have seen so far. Exchange Listing. This is a big one. When Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase added Litecoin to their already limited list of cryptocurrencies that can be bought, they made it easily accessible to the average person. Their interface is the best I’ve seen so far. It makes it so easy for the non-technical person to buy Litecoin. Soon after the Coinbase launch (marked with the arrow, in the chart below), the price of Litecoin started to skyrocket and it has never looked back. Now, you might be thinking that this could simply be a coincidence. …and it could. But it is very, very likely that exposing Litecoin to Coinbase’s user base helped boost the price.

The man who grabbed Katlego was dressed in black, with a green jacket, Witbank News reports.\nUnfortunately, the vehicle had no number plates.\nKatlego’s parents, Mirriam and Lolo Lekgoane, left immediately after their child was abducted, and went to the Witbank Police Station with the two friends.\nA search followed in and around the area where Katlego went missing after they left the station.\n“We asked the South African Community Crime Watch [SACCW] for help, and they did not think twice to assist us and have been there ever since,” Marite added.\nAt about 6pm on Sunday, the family went back to their house to find a ransom note, demanding 15 Bitcoins. The ransom note started with: “This is a kidnapping. We have your child. Your child will not be harmed if the following demands are met …” The ransom note stating where the Bitcoin should be deposited into\nThe police have urged the public to come out with any information that could lead to the discovery of the 13-year-old boy, and to the arrest of his kidnappers.\n“To be honest, I am hurting. I just want my child back in one piece. Do not do anything wrong to my child,” Marite pleaded to the abductors over national television.\nWith Bitcoin being a new, relatively unknown cryptocurrency Katlego’s father, Lolo sadly concluded: “If only they could communicate with us in any way because I do not even know what Bitcoin is or how the process works for this demand they gave me.”\nNo arrests have been made yet, and police is still investigating this matter.\nFor any information that could help the police contact, Captain Africa Nyathi at 071 352 6007 or call the SAPS Crime Stop number 08600 10111.\nFor more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .

Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 percent to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. It’s down more than 20 percent since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders Colluding? The illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading -- forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nSpoofing Is a Silly Name for Serious Market Rigging: QuickTake\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise -- it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 -- has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nRead More: SEC Tries to Scam ICO Investors to Show Them How Easy It Is\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target The limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss\nPhotographer: David Paul Morris The Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co.

The man who was dressed in black, with a green jacket, grabbed the victim. Unfortunately the vehicle had no number plates.\nALSO READ\nAs parents Mirriam along with her husband, Mr Lolo Lekgoane immediately left for the Witbank Police Station with the two friends. A search followed in and around the area where Katlego went missing after they left the station.\n“We asked the South African Community Crime Watch (SACCW) for help and they did not think twice to assist us and have been there ever since,” Marite added.\nAt about 18:00 on Sunday the family went back to their house to find a ransom note, demanding 15 Bitcoins. The ransom note started with,\n“This is a kidnapping. We have your child. Your child will not be harmed if the following demands are met…”\nThe ransom note stating where the Bitcoin should be deposited into\nThe police urged the public to come out with any information that could lead to the discovery of the 13-year-old boy and to the arrest of his kidnappers.\n“To be honest I am hurting. I just want my child back in one piece. Do not do anything wrong to my child,” Marite pleaded to the abductors over national television.\nWith Bitcoin being a new, unknown cyber currency Katlego’s father, Lolo sadly concluded,\n“If only they could communicate with us in any way because I do not even know what Bitcoin is or how the process works for this demand they gave me.”\nNo arrests have been made yet and police is still investigating this matter.\nFor any information that could help the police contact, Capt.

and cryptocurrency is still unclear, few understand it as a blessing and while others legislate against perceived threats. While regulators and authorities of different nations are enforcing bitcoin and its use, citizens all around struck on a point that whether Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is banned or regulated. Let’s take a closer view on countries that have regulated or ban cryptocurrency China – Banned the ICO ad cryptocurrency\nReports reveal that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has issued a statement to block access to all domestic and foreign cryptocurrency and exchanges. China’s most recent announcement aims to clamp down on all cryptocurrency trading. France – regulations are roaming around\nIn early 2018, French regulators have called tough regulations on cryptocurrencies. During the speech, Bruno Le Maire, Finance minister of France has ordered a former central bank chief to draft and look upon new potential rules on cryptocurrencies that. The new rules would warn potential investors over the “risk of speculation and possible financial manipulation”. Thailand – No ban but banks are restricted\nTo regulate cryptocurrency and prevent criminal activity, the Thai central bank has taken a similar stance to South Korea. It issued a circular which restrict banks and financial institutions to deal with five cryptocurrency activities.\nBy keeping an eye on severing regulations, Mr.Wisit Santiprabop singed the spherical that limits & bans banks from Investing or trading in cryptocurrency, exchanging cryptocurrencies, creating platforms for cryptocurrency trading, allowing clients to use credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, and from advising customers on cryptocurrency investing or trading. South Korea – Ban on anonymous ban account\nDespite the warning from regulators on cryptocurrency investment that lacks guidelines, everyone from housewives to office workers rushed over the crypto market – thus South Korea announced the ban on anonymous bank accounts in cryptocurrency trading from January 30, 2018.\nThe effort by South Korea to stop virtual currencies being used for money laundering outlined yet another system “Real Name” that would require cryptocurrency traders to identify themselves with their real names. Canada sees High Risk of Fraud\nCentral Bank of Canada object cryptocurrencies in two terms – Stephen Poloz, Bank’s head says “they are crypto but they aren’t currencies”\nMoreover, he notes I suppose they are securities technically … There is no intrinsic value for something like bitcoin so it’s not really an asset one can analyze. It’s just essentially speculative or gambling.”\nThe country keeps on adding that around virtual currencies “there is a high risk of fraud”.\nBesides these top five countries, there are other nations walking in the same rally. Countries like Japan, Mexico, Brazil, India, USA and the United Kingdom are not surely announced Bitcoin a ban or illegal rather they are enforcing severe regulations to prevent illicit activities & tax evasion.

Also, Smart Contracts could be used, their implementation in the Bitcoin network is not originally provided. The combination of a Lightning Network and Smart Contracts brings with it entirely new possibilities of scalability to the Bitcoin Ecosystem?\nSince January, Tadge Dryja, one of two authors of the White Paper behind Bitcoins Lightning Network works for the Digital Currency Initiative. The Initiative is part of the comprehensive mit Media Labs. Since then, has worked at the prestigious American University quietly to a refinement of the scaling solution to represent the Lightning Network for Bitcoin. Smart Contracts on the Bitcoin Blockchain\nAs for a long time is speculated to also play Smart Contracts, Blockchain platform Ethereum, a role. Dryja is the Conviction that the Interaction of the Lightning Network and Smart-Contract-elements both in terms of security and Privacy as well as faster and cheaper transactions. For the first Time this possibility has been encoded and is to be tried out in a test run in practice. The Demo will, however, proceed in a purely experimental and no real money involve.\nDryjas idea of a Smart-Contract Version for Bitcoin, however, differs from the common variant on Ethereum. In contrast to Ethereum to the Bitcoin Blockchain provides no platform for Smart Contract developers. Therefore, the Smart Contracts that could run, only a stripped-down variant, the simple If-Then-functions. They are focused on scalability and Privacy, and thus, for Bitcoin purposes more practical. They seize, for Example, comparatively little space on the Blockchain and hinder hardly the Ecosystem. With Oracle’s success\nFor the implementation of Smart Contracts for Bitcoin, the Developer also Oracle. Some of the more complex Smart Contracts require the help of an external data source. Oracle’s pass this data to Smart Contracts, which are then executed based on the data that they receive. For the Demo Tadge Dryja and his Co-Developer Alin Dragos built a Test Oracle. This is to transfer the latest price of US Dollar in Satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoins.\n“We at the DCI (Digital Currency Initiative) really believe in the Lightning Network. Bitcoin does not scale very well. I decided that there must be something Better. It turns out that Lightning is the better solution. It’s the kind of scaling“,\nso Dragos.\nWe may be curious, what is brought forth in the Forschungslabs on WITH everything in the Blockchain. A merging of the Lightning Network and Smart Contracts on the Bitcoin Blockchain is already a promising Start.

Last week, a basset hound named Happy went missing in the US state of North Carolina, and a scammer claiming to have the dog soon demanded hundreds of dollars in bitcoin for his return.\nPatricia Howell, Happy’s owner, found her dog after a day thanks to a tip on a community Facebook page, CBS17 reported . But within minutes of arriving home with her dog, Howell got a text message from someone threatening to “sell it or kill it or whatever” if they didn’t receive $600 (£451) in bitcoin within five days. Once received, the scammer claimed they would leave Happy at a pet store with Howell’s contact info.\nScreenshot: CBS17\n“I knew it was a scam because I had Happy, but it was heartless and cold and it was so mean-spirited,” Howell told CBS17.\nThe person demanding the bitcoin ransom likely got Howell’s number from either a Facebook post about her lost pup or Pawboost, a lost and found site for dogs, where she had posted her contact information. The Granville County Sheriff is reportedly investigating the incident, and said that he’s aware of similar ransom cases. Online extortion using bitcoin is hardly uncommon , but it’s particularly ruthless when it preys on our devotion for our dogs.

While cryptocurrency isn’t really Revolut’s focus point, it’s a good way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\nIf you have a Revolut account, you can now buy and hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Behind the scene, the startup has partnered with Bitstamp to process the transactions. Revolut currently charges a 1.5 percent fee for cryptocurrency transactions. There are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nCompared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. You don’t get a bitcoin address for instance. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you’ll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults . Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time.\nYou can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. For instance, if you pay $3.47 for that delicious ice cream, you’ll save 53 cents in your vault. You can also multiple that amount so that you save multiple times your spare change with each transaction. Many fintech startups also provide this feature.\nYou can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money each day, each week or each month. Interestingly, you get to choose the currency of your vault. So it means that you can decide to buy ethers with spare change and weekly payments for instance.

While cryptocurrency isn’t really Revolut’s focus point, it’s a good way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\nIf you have a Revolut account, you can now buy and hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Behind the scene, the startup has partnered with Bitstamp to process the transactions. Revolut currently charges a 1.5 percent fee for cryptocurrency transactions. There are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nCompared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. You don’t get a bitcoin address for instance. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you’ll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults . Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time.\nYou can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. For instance, if you pay $3.47 for that delicious ice cream, you’ll save 53 cents in your vault. You can also multiple that amount so that you save multiple times your spare change with each transaction. Many fintech startups also provide this feature.\nYou can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money each day, each week or each month. Interestingly, you get to choose the currency of your vault. So it means that you can decide to buy ethers with spare change and weekly payments for instance. It’s a great way to hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nUsers don’t earn interests on vaults. It’s just a way to set some money aside that doesn’t appear in your main Revolut account.

Since there is a fiat currency that has been discussed on certain country as their national currency and also it helps to maintain between demand and supply. If those countries (especially 3rd world country) already poor and someone established Bitcoin, those countries would become more poor cuz Bitcoin can't make the economy better.\nYeah you're right we still have fiat as a legitimate and acceptable currency anywhere, one of the reasons why many people say bitcoin can change the economy because bitcoin is a profitable investment? but that does not mean it can benefit to everyone in a country right? because there is always a risk in bitcoin investment, of course there will be loss they will get\nBut i think investing in bitcoin can be studied to avoid such losses that will make a person even poorer.With your own experience in bitcoin investment,it will make you wiser and skilled in the next rounds.With this,if all people learn to make use of bitcoin properly and learn to gain profit from it,then maybe it will be a good answer for a troubled economy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:37:43.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27609f8526847ecbfb7d310445a201bcbeec63ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAps0_rVMXPah2Iad67sOGm9eunp6uNdrudLDBVnwMnr.76NxQZst2AGypyJAEZ4CiIQ-", "site_full": "mohdarafat.com", "site": "mohdarafat.com", "site_section": "http://mohdarafat.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "mohdarafat.com", "title": "Silver set for upside, Bitcoin flat", "title_full": "Silver set for upside, Bitcoin flat", "published": "2018-05-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/mohdarafat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin.jpg?fit=1280%2C800", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27609f8526847ecbfb7d310445a201bcbeec63ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAps0_rVMXPah2Iad67sOGm9eunp6uNdrudLDBVnwMnr.76NxQZst2AGypyJAEZ4CiIQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "marafat", "published": "2018-05-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Silver set for upside, Bitcoin flat", "text": "Silver set for upside, Bitcoin flat By marafat | May 24, 2018 0 Comment Silver analysis\nComex silver price made low 16.31$ near major support of 16.25$ and bounced back from there.

In April, the Reserve Bank of India formally prohibited the operation of cryptocurrency enterprises to domestic institutions, which has not stopped the creation of new exchanges so far. If the taxation system comes into effect, it would mean a move towards the legality of the industry with a constant lack of iron regulations. If the buyers and sellers are in India, the transaction will be treated as a software delivery and the location of the buyer will be the place of delivery. [...] Transactions outside India will be subject to an integrated GST and will be treated as import or export of goods. IGST will be imposed on cross-border deliveries.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The Double ZigZag corrective structure has hit the projected target at the level of $7,441 and established a bottom for the corrective wave 2/B.

If you got a phone call and the surveyor says “do you own crypto!” a crypto holder will get their dick all frenzied up and then answer the questions, where a regular human that doesn’t buy Chuck E. Cheese virtual tokens will just hang up because it’s “spam calls.” Out of the 2000 surveyed, don’t you think they could have called 5... 10 thousand people before they got enough data to make 2000 respondents? (Question is how they lead up to the question is the premise here that invalidates the study)\nAlso their averages are screwed up to hell, they state that each person who is invested has an average of $3000 invested. Most of America is in debt, so it’s hard to believe that there isn’t a huge standard deviation & outliers to this number. Or it’s just confirmation bias that rich people are more likely to buy crypto, which is an alternative hypothesis. Regardless, if they tapped a bitcoin millionaire, he could have made the numbers skyrocket.\nTL:DR I don’t take surveys seriously. Look at elections, look at anything of meaning.

Insisting that a new store of value emerge fully formed in its long-term steady state is asking too much. In fact, you would expect two things from any store of value as it established itself: A Rapidly Appreciating Price At First, Slowing Over Time : The price of a new store of value would likely start out very low, as few would believe in it. As it became established, prices would rise exponentially. Over time, this price appreciation would slow as it reached a steady state. High-But-Declining Volatility : Similarly, early volatility would be extreme, as its long-term sustainability would be in question. But over time, that volatility would tail off as the asset became more established. That’s exactly what we saw in gold, and Bitcoin is following the same path. Bitcoin’s price rose exponentially in its earliest days, and that growth is slowing over time. Volatility—while still high—has declined markedly, and will likely fall further as derivatives and market-making activity increase. Buy Bitcoin Worldwide Bitcoin Volatility Is Declining Over Time Thus, it is not as bad as bitcoin bashers make us believe: Look out 10 years: As the digital world becomes an ever-larger part of our lives, and the millennial generation moves into its prime age range for saving, it’s not hard to imagine a world where Bitcoin holds 1/10th the value of gold. That would imply a 500% price increase, from current levels of around $8,000 to about $40,000. Could Bitcoin’s value be equal to gold? That would suggest a shade under $400,000. Could it be higher, because Bitcoin has more potential utility? Don’t listen to the folks who say Bitcoin will never be a store of value. It’s actually right on track, following in the footsteps of every other significant store of value that’s come into the world. There’s no guarantee it will stay on that path, but if it does, the opportunities are significant.\nHmm..", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthougan/2018/05/23/what-golds-history-teaches-us-about-bitcoin-as-a-store-of-value/#65df71b6260e"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt hougan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T09:43:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40f28a0f0ced286655d7278634e1fe923574946c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa9rCCghJUmq5i6RFIzz_Py36ddDr4U7VLiZFb7Piql1M6lZHmPrB15ZvmoxflrUzGqaGabBSUjQASel3X8x_4s7_R1J2rTK9z", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Why All Muslims Should Use Bitcoin - Especially in Ramadan", "title_full": "Why All Muslims Should Use Bitcoin - Especially in Ramadan : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-24T09:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40f28a0f0ced286655d7278634e1fe923574946c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa9rCCghJUmq5i6RFIzz_Py36ddDr4U7VLiZFb7Piql1M6lZHmPrB15ZvmoxflrUzGqaGabBSUjQASel3X8x_4s7_R1J2rTK9z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kadhirvelavan", "published": "2018-05-24T09:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why All Muslims Should Use Bitcoin - Especially in Ramadan", "text": "submitted by /u/kadhirvelavan\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptocoremedia.com/muslims-bitcoin-ramadan/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T05:04:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "315e85de82a44ba9b941210cea67dd1ebb498f3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKhtCplNwj6EhAmqK.SVHQ04F3SiK.jXMwl5aS16qrJcLUh4y6Squm6luecYroly9PQxbHA_YFTWM-", "site_full": "www.startup365.fr", "site": "startup365.fr", "site_section": "http://www.startup365.fr/feed", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Startup 365", "title": "#USA Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support", "title_full": "#USA Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support", "published": "2018-05-24T09:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techcrunch/startups/~4/EXSrGQzLwlQ", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "315e85de82a44ba9b941210cea67dd1ebb498f3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKhtCplNwj6EhAmqK.SVHQ04F3SiK.jXMwl5aS16qrJcLUh4y6Squm6luecYroly9PQxbHA_YFTWM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Startup365", "published": "2018-05-24T09:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "#USA Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support", "text": "#USA Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support Posted on by Startup365\n//\nFintech startup Revolut is adding Bitcoin Cash and Ripple to its cryptocurrency feature. While cryptocurrency isn’t really Revolut’s focus point, it’s a good way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\nIf you have a Revolut account, you can now buy and hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Behind the scene, the startup has partnered with Bitstamp to process the transactions. Revolut currently charges a 1.5 percent fee for cryptocurrency transactions. There are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nCompared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. You don’t get a bitcoin address for instance. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you’ll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults . Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time.\nYou can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. For instance, if you pay $3.47 for that delicious ice cream, you’ll save 53 cents in your vault. You can also multiple that amount so that you save multiple times your spare change with each transaction. Many fintech startups also provide this feature.\nYou can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money each day, each week or each month. Interestingly, you get to choose the currency of your vault. So it means that you can decide to buy ethers with spare change and weekly payments for instance. It’s a great way to hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nUsers don’t earn interests on vaults. It’s just a way to set some money aside that doesn’t appear in your main Revolut account. You can decide to close your vault whenever you want.\nfrom Startups – TechCrunch https://ift.tt/2J2ai1b This entry was posted in #USA by Startup365 . Bookmark the permalink .

Ordinarily, the blockchain would resolve this by including only the first transaction in the block, but the attacker was able to reverse transactions since they had majority control of the network.\nConsequently, they were able to deposit funds on exchanges and quickly withdraw them again, after which they reversed the initial transaction so that they could send the coins they had originally deposited to another wallet.\nBitcoin Gold currently ranks as the world’s 26th largest cryptocurrency with an estimated market cap of around $827 million. advertisement ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael grothaus", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin gold network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:49:16.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7266c703de1423ed1819e6f38807cf01e1d159a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaSidVoPOhAXSHHvGqg10BtvLVAhiYMDYjAh5U.E8tBOVEB6EFc2FzgGI4SpnXcZ7AfuA36ByNwSbzuj4UCPjcXZmqrUpVsDIR", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "BCHPLS.io - A free Bitcoin Cash point-of-sale system : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "BCHPLS.io - A free Bitcoin Cash point-of-sale system : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-24T09:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.055, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7266c703de1423ed1819e6f38807cf01e1d159a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaSidVoPOhAXSHHvGqg10BtvLVAhiYMDYjAh5U.E8tBOVEB6EFc2FzgGI4SpnXcZ7AfuA36ByNwSbzuj4UCPjcXZmqrUpVsDIR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "zcc0nonA", "published": "2018-05-24T09:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "BCHPLS.io - A free Bitcoin Cash point-of-sale system : CryptoCurrency", "text": "OP\nWe are pleased to announce the public beta of bchpls.io !

The reason? Lord Sugar is too busy making money from bitcoin trading.\n“He has been investing heavily into the bitcoin market and he believes it will be the next multi-trillion industry,” the article gushes.\n“This led him to invest in and help develop a new ground-breaking programme called Bitcoin Trader.\n“The innovative crypto currency platform has only been out for a few weeks but it's already turning its users into millionaires.”\nIt's tripe, every word.\nLord Sugar is not leaving The Apprentice (Image: BBC) Like so many prominent business leaders, Lord Sugar's name is being used to lure the unwary into investment scams through online adverts linking to fake news sites.\n\"It's infuriating to see my name and face on websites run by charlatans claiming that I back their fraudulent investment schemes,” he told the Mirror this week.\n\"This is now becoming routine for many prominent business people and there seems little that can be done about it because these cowardly crooks hide behind short-lived anonymous overseas websites.\n\"It puts members of the public at risk who may unwittingly think I'm endorsing an investment scheme, and it puts my reputation at risk by linking me to these scams.\n\"These crooks are utterly ruthless, I just hope that people do their homework before parting with any money.\"\nOne of the most abused names is that of Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert, who describes fake Facebook plugs for bitcoin scams as a plague.\n“Sadly we’ve already heard of people who’ve lost over £20,000 saying: 'I only pursued it because I thought it was recommended by Martin',” he's said.\n“The thought of that makes me feel physically sick.\n“I’ve spent my career trying to campaign for financial justice and now these b ds leach off that trust to rob vulnerable people.”\nYet another faked bitcoin investment plug The stars of Dragons Den know about these scams only all too well. Peter Jones has gone online to make clear that he has no association with bitcoin investments.\n“I am really grateful for everyone who has contacted me and left messages on social media and my website making me aware of the unauthorised use or misuse of my name and image,” he's written.\n“I am taking steps to get the unauthorised material removed and taking appropriate action on the individuals and/or companies who have decided to scam people in this way.”\nAnother Dragon, Deborah Meaden responded with suitable frankness when asked on Twitter if bitcoin was worth a punt by saying: “How should I know?”\nDragon Touker Suleyman tweeted in March: “Hate scammers, is there anything to be done?”\nFake: Touker Suleyman Quote: s are fabrications Bill Gates has also found his name hijacked, as has former Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt.\nSir Richard Branson says that his legal team has dealt with hundreds of fake news sites and companies misrepresenting him in the past year alone.\nThese sites often show footage of him speaking favourably about bitcoin and use it out of context to promote their rip-off sites.\n“Some of the most regular and worrying fake stories currently spreading online are false endorsements of bitcoin trading schemes,” he posted on his blog.\n“While I have often commented on the potential benefits of genuine bitcoin developments, I absolutely do not endorse these fake bitcoin stories.”\nAnd it's not just business leaders who are having their names taken in vain, it can happen to any figure in the public eye who's regarded as reliable and trustworthy - such as This Morning present Phillip Schofield.\nA here today, gone tomorrow, website crispo-magz.com claimed he was was investing in some sort of revolutionary trading system.

The mentioned $1,220 level acted as a hurdle for buyers, resulting in more declines. The price declined further, settled below the $1,200 level, and broke the $1,150 support level. The recent downside break below $1,150 has opened the doors for more losses in the near term. \\n\nThe decline was such that the price even broke the last swing low of $1,133. It is now well below $1,150 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like the price is heading towards the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $1,133 low to $1,315 high at $1,090. It means the price may perhaps break the $1,100 support and accelerate declines towards $1,050. If sellers remain in control, the price might test the 1.618 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $1,133 low to $1,315 high. On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly under a lot of bearish pressure below $1,150.

This means that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse. \\n\nThe 100 SMA also seems to have held as dynamic resistance and would likely keep further gains in check in another pullback. The gap between the two moving averages is also widening to reflect strengthening bearish pressure. \\n\nRSI is pointing down to confirm that sellers are in control and could further weigh on bitcoin price.

This is a simple continuation of the falling asset value that we had been seen over the last couple of weeks, and it looks as if my prediction of $8000 will be true will rather soon. If we break down below the $7900 level, the market will more than likely unwind even further, perhaps looking to $7000 initially, followed by $6000. At this point, all upward momentum is all but gone in this market, as the crypto currency markets are starting to go out-of-favor again. Ultimately, I think that if you are a longer-term investor, there are going to be better pricing points available in the future. If we do bounce from here, and $8000 definitely could cause that bounce, I believe that $9000 will be very difficult to break above, and that the $8500 level will probably become the new short-term ceiling. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nIt’s kind of ironic that for the longest time those whoever traded Gold had to listen to Bitcoin traders talk about how gold only moves a few percent, and that Bitcoin was able to move 20% every couple of days. The reason it’s ironic is that Bitcoin is starting to do the exact same thing. Nowhere is this as obvious as it is in the BTC\\/JPY pair, as we have a well-defined range now. It looks as if we are going to test the ¥900,000 level, which of course breaking down below there opens up the door to the ¥700,000 level, an area that the market has tested previously. However, what I would stress is that the return trip higher from the lows this time hasn’t made it to the top. It’s normally assigned that we will break down eventually. I moved below the ¥700,000 level could be coming, but it’s obviously not going to be coming in today. In the short term, I believe that ¥1 million continues offer psychological resistance. \\n\\n\n\\n\nOriginal Source DailyForex provides daily fundamental and technical analysis and signals for those looking to trade based on trends in the currency markets.

Having been ready to provide the next best return on investment, but not all will make it through to the finish line, leave alone make it to the moon. The race to take the next big ICO to the moon is on! \\n\nRecently, four mountaineering enthusiasts embarked on a tremendous challenge to scale the world\\u2019s highest peak, Mount Everest. Standing at 8,848 meters, only 4,833 people have ever made it to the summit, while another 288 have succumbed in the attempt. \\n\nAs part of the project and expedition, the team raised the ASKfm flag and two Ledgers, to which ASKfm tokens (ASKT) are credited. This act makes it possible to honestly state that the ASKT is literally the \\u201chighest token in the world\\u201d, the token \\u201cclosest to the moon\\u201d, and ASKfm can conquer new peaks.\\u2019 \\n\nOut of the four mountaineers in the 2018 expedition, two members: Ira Galai (an \\u00a0honoree in the Ukraine Guinness Book of Records), and Taras Pozdnii (who was writing a diary on his FB page in Russian language) suffered from snow blindness and minor freeze burns at the peak, and have recovered since then. \\n\nThe Highest Token in the World, Literally! \\n\nASKfm has been working on creating a high-loaded blockchain-based Q&A platform. Once completed, the platform will work as an extension to ASKfm’s already existing network. To be successful at tokenizing social interactions, ASKfm will be introducing a new token out of conceptual necessity. These tokens will be made available to the public during the upcoming token sale. In addition, ASKfm is also launching a content at the beginning of the crowdsale wherein the early contributors stand to win the ASKT tokens hidden in the ledger up on the Mount Everest. \\n\nThe most ambitious investors will be contesting for the first Ledger containing 500,000 ASKT (valued at approximately $50k), hidden on the Everest peak. \\n\n\\n\nSlogan: Aiming for New Heights. \\n\nThe mountaineering expedition and its message have a close correlation with ASKfm\\u2019s initiative. The platform, just like the highest point on Earth sets a new bar for cryptocurrencies. Armed with a strong identity and a use case, ASKfm has just proved to the crypto-market that they are worth investing in, even before they get listed on all major exchanges for public trading. They put their token at the top rather than relying on dubious tactics commonly used by a majority of the blockchain projects to raise funds. \\n\nASKfm ICO is shooting for the moon. The ICO will oversee a transfer of 215 million registered users hailing from more than 168 countries, that’s 49 different languages, to the crypto market. This planned migration will make this ICO the single most substantial mass introduction to the future. Playing out a scenario for the well-known \\u2018To the Moon\\u2019 meme in the crypto community; What\\u2019s the closest starting point to reach the moon? That will be Mt. Everest, to be followed by a huge demand that could soon make ASKT\\u2019s value surge upwards. \\n\nEverest is the tallest mountain on Earth. ASKfm is technologically and ideologically superior to every other crypto. When it hits the market, it\\u2019ll take its rightful place at the very top. Higher than the world, they are already making a statement with a successfully tokenized \\u00a0Mt. Everest. \\n\nEverest tokenized. \\n\nThe term \\u201ctokenized Mt. Everest\\u201d is a clickbait, since everyone seemingly claims to tokenize anything. ASKfm, on the other hand, is doing something fun and original with their tokens. They are holding a massive giveaway of their token \\u2013ASKT- that have been on Mt. Everest\\u2019s summit. Well, this is not tokenizing Mt. Everest, but \\u2018Everesting\\u2019 tokens. \\n\nThe ASKfm crowdsale is a promising ICO of 2018. The pace and outcome of this ICO will be rewarding to all its contributors. The pre-sale and main token sale dates remain unconfirmed, but in total, ASKfm plans to sell $100,000,000 worth of tokens. Its private sale is going on with a minimum investment amount of one million dollars. \\n\nThe general cryptocurrency community can currently apply for the whitelist. 1,000,000,000 ASKfm tokens will be on offer during the ICO at an initial price of 0.1USD per 1 ASKT. \\n\nMore information about the ASKfm token sale is available at – https:\\/\\/askfm.io\\/ \\n\nThe post ASKfm Conquers New Peaks: Next Stop, the Moon appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taras pozdnii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ira galai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ico bitcoin", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "icos", "sentiment": "positive"}], "locations": [{"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount everest", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T01:20:09.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 16409, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=15800", "requestsLeft": 504}
