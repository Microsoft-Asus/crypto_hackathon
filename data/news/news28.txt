This helped the Foundation to make over $350,000 from membership dues last year alone as multiple Bitcoin-related startups and paying members believe they’re helping to improve Bitcoin through the Foundation.\nAside from giving voice to individuals and communities which support Bitcoin as a store of value and Bitcoin-based projects more generally, the Bitcoin Foundation has engaged in numerous campaigns, outreach programs, and events in order to further its mission and values. The Foundation’s website suggests that “someone needs to speak with governments, regulators, financial institutions, technologists, the media and everyone else all over the world to protect bitcoin” and in order to advocate for the safe and legal conversion of fiat currency into bitcoin and vice versa, the use of bitcoin as a medium of exchange, and the use of bitcoin as a store of value.\n“The Bitcoin Foundation coordinates the efforts of the members of the Bitcoin community, helping to create awareness of the benefits of Bitcoin, how to use it and its related technology requirements, for technologists, regulators, the media and everyone else globally”, the organization’s web-site reads.\nIn pursuit of these aims, the Foundation has engaged in political lobbying, the organization of conferences and related events, the administration of research grants, the support of bitcoin protocol development and training programs, and general projects to raise awareness. The Foundation details its project priorities as related to different geographical areas in a strategy document available on the organization website. The organization also sponsors speakers at non-Foundation conferences and events through a project known as the “Bitcoin Speakers Bureau.”\nHowever, since its creation in 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation has attracted waves of criticism from community members over everything from lack of transparency and accountability, controversial appointments to the organization’s board, political split in the block size debates, and doing very little to actually fund the core Bitcoin infrastructure.\nIn an exclusive interview with ForkLog, Llew Claasen, Bitcoin Foundation’s executive director and a venture capitalist based in Cape Town, South Africa, responded to that criticism explaining the current state of affairs within the organization, its ongoing activities and future plans.\nForkLog: Mr Claasen, as the Foundation’s executive director, what will be your response to all the criticism the organization has received over the past few years?\nLlew Claasen: First of all, I think it’s unfortunate that Bitcoin Foundation was drawn into acrimonious split that happened between people who were pro block size increase and people were anti block size increase. The Foundation itself has nothing do with this and ultimately it doesn’t control the protocol, doesn’t make protocol decisions, and doesn’t even advice on protocol. It’s just an advocacy platform for people to tell regulators, lawmakers, the media and average people in the street what this technology is about, why it is useful, why you should know about it and why you should understand more about your right to have money that is not under control of the government and some of the challenges with the current financial system. So I think this remains while we exist.\nWe are spending a lot of time continuing to engage with regulators, particularly that there’s a much closer regulatory focus. Also, particularly since Bitcoin only has about 30 percent dominance in the market now – that’s not a bad thing, what it means is that there are many more projects, a lot of people that contribute to the projects they feel their contributions are most valued – the Foundation is now representing their interest as well, representing the industry overall rather than only representing Bitcoin.\nThe reality is that most don’t even know there are other projects; they know there is Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. So I think the story doesn’t change. In terms of the challenges that we had in the not too distant past and the splits it was difficult for people from either camp to publicly support the Foundation because they would be trolled to no end by the other side, which is a really bad thing that happens in the industry but that is a reality.\nSo what happens is that we have switched to a fundraising model where we are reliant on members’ contributions and we’ve got awesome member participation. And the challenge that we do have is that we would love to accelerate some of those programs. We worked on a program at the beginning of this year which is significantly more aggressive in terms of the role that we want to play, and we were working with some big backers to try to get this program funded.\nForkLog: In the recent development of events the Bitcoin Foundation was also tightly involved into Bitlicense opposition movement. Are there any other notable initiatives the organization is taking part in?\nLlew Claasen: Now we are focusing on a couple of other things. Number one is New York State and some stuff that is happening there, and specifically the BitLicense challenges , we are also working against some of the regulation proposal by the Uniform Law Commission at the state level, we are participating on working groups in South Africa and Uganda trying to influence what governments are trying to do to cryptocurrency there. We are also engaging with regulators and lawmakers in Zimbabwe and are doing some other things that are ultimately to the benefit of the whole community but we have no profit incentive, we are just trying to do something meaningful.\nSo that’s kind of where we are. We’d love to raise larger amounts of money for these programs and I think we are making progress, but we would’ve caught up in that mess.\nForkLog: Does Bitcoin Foundation provide any financial support to Bitcoin developers as of today?\nLlew Claasen: No, not at this particular time.\nForkLog: What about yourself, being a venture investor how did you come to the crypto industry?\nLlew Claasen: I was first exposed to Bitcoin in 2012 but I wasn’t involved very actively in the community until we saw something larger. I think it was around 2016 when things changed dramatically and there was this realization that if we are going to create something that would probably be more useful in failed economies we need to focus on developing markets. So with my background as an investor in technology startups, particularly fintech startups, we were looking at solving challenges in developing markets, it was very relevant to the Board and it was something we were looking at when Bruce Fenton decided to step down as an executive director.\nForkLog: On global level, what areas in crypto and fintech space are the most promising at the moment?\nLlew Claasen: I cannot view blockchain technology as I’m sure everybody else does as well as a foundational layer. It’s not a business model in itself; it’s the thing that enables decentralized models. So a combination of blockchain with many other industries is very interesting to me.\nFintech specifically, there’s an example with Dala , the cryptocurrency that was issued in May. The problem that we tried to solve there was price stability since there’s a perception that in many developing markets they either don’t have control over price of their currency or that it is being dictated by more significant trading partners, or there’s abuse and oversupply of these currencies.\nForkLog: In your opinion, how strong will be Bitcoin’s influence in the future?\nLlew Claasen: Bitcoin is something that will always play a very dominant role, but I think right now it is probably more useful to think of it as a reserve currency. It is possible some of that will change in the sense that we’ve got Lightning coming onboard and more and more of these technologies being implemented, but the challenge that we have is whether or not Bitcoin becomes of form of cash or remains a reserve currency. It all really revolves economic incentives, like if I have something that performs the function of a reserve currency, a store of value, then why would I spend it? And even if the technology problem is solved I’m not sure the economic problem will be solved. Nevertheless, even in its current form Bitcoin will provide a lot of value to the whole ecosystem.\nForkLog: A few months ago you predicted that by the end of 2018 Bitcoin will hit the $40,000 mark. With today’s overall decline on the markets, do you still stand by that opinion?\nLlew Claasen : I don’t make price predictions anymore because they always go out of the context. In that particular case I made a prediction with a whole bunch of anchors “if this happens”, “if that happens”. And unfortunately the reason why it’s no longer responsible to do that is because people will see that as a reason to buy on a speculative basis rather than believe in the fundamental value of the technology and its decentralized nature.\nLlew Claasen was interviewed by Andrew Asmakov Похожие материалы", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/aasmakov"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "llew claasen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unfortunate bitcoin foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T12:24:29.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "543b2a50cae7fd12ab855523b2f5d28a88a0cf69", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeQZFUASVd36yWP6ZZQ2fcQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin down, i buy Bitcoin or ethereum", "title_full": "Bitcoin down, i buy Bitcoin or ethereum", "published": "2018-06-06T08:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "543b2a50cae7fd12ab855523b2f5d28a88a0cf69", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeQZFUASVd36yWP6ZZQ2fcQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "thenameisjay", "published": "2018-06-06T08:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin down, i buy Bitcoin or ethereum", "text": "Quote: from: nguyenthenguyen on January 31, 2018, 06:38:48 AM Is Now the Right Time to Invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Should I Stay Away?\nToday's the best day to probably invest in those cryptocurrencies because of how cheap they are now.

Triangle patterns are consolidation formations, signaling shrinking volatility in the near-term but promising a big move on the horizon. Just last week, Bitcoin hit the lower end of the triangle near $7,000. It held and bounced back to $7,500+. The upside of the range is just under $9,000. As long as it stays between these two levels, expect chop. However, if it breaks below $7,000, Bitcoin will head to $4,900. If it breaks above $9,000, Bitcoin will head to $20,000. This is why triangle patterns are so important watch. The resulting move from the breakout/breakdown will be epic.

Just looking for some educated opinions.\n submitted by /u/OPWills\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T02:53:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "adf51dca6a5a64bd46bad8e54ee432684c3ca124", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQutO.ducIV6Rj1CB0oESbU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will bitcoin go under regulation", "title_full": "Will bitcoin go under regulation", "published": "2018-06-06T07:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "adf51dca6a5a64bd46bad8e54ee432684c3ca124", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQutO.ducIV6Rj1CB0oESbU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vending", "published": "2018-06-06T07:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin go under regulation", "text": "bitcoin can not be set by anyone, is individual.I think so that the government is not worried about the existence of bitcoin, the government should cooperate with cryptocurancy with the results of negotiations every government transaction gets a fee of several percent of cryptocurancy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T03:11:01.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96b3dfd6794626292a913ba30b5a1475f3f91b1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.skPefryqZ0ZqBJpq2Hy.v_F15x0Yo9XKNeqwFVnEI7jBrmWm1lDgvrI_nHnZZTkHJg--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "One Thing that Excites Me about the Future of Bitcoin Mining", "title_full": "One Thing that Excites Me about the Future of Bitcoin Mining", "published": "2018-06-06T07:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96b3dfd6794626292a913ba30b5a1475f3f91b1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.skPefryqZ0ZqBJpq2Hy.v_F15x0Yo9XKNeqwFVnEI7jBrmWm1lDgvrI_nHnZZTkHJg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T07:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "One Thing that Excites Me about the Future of Bitcoin Mining", "text": "One Thing that Excites Me about the Future of Bitcoin Mining\n/u/INC0RP0REAL\nAs we know, the amount of power required to mine Bitcoin is high. Mining companies are looking for the optimum places to mine Bitcoin, where electricity is cheap. I believe they will have to come up with innovative ways to cut costs and the most innovate way would be to invest in the use solar, wind, hydro, etc. to cut electrical usage costs in the long run. This could completely change our energy sector! Imagine deserts filled with solar panels with huge mining facilities, windy prairie lands with wind farms, riverside mining with hydro, the list goes on.\nPeople don't seem to be motivated to change our energy solutions because of environmental impact. But once it becomes an economical decision, it's a free for all.

Price needs to break past the neckline around $7,800 to confirm that an uptrend is about to take place. Technical indicators are still reflecting the presence of bearish momentum, so it could be uphill from here. Bitcoin price has formed a classic reversal pattern to signal that the downtrend might be over soon.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to show that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse.\nThe 100 SMA is also holding as dynamic resistance at the moment, so bitcoin price would need to surge past a couple of upside barriers before confirming a rally. The 200 SMA dynamic inflection point might also hold as a ceiling around $8,200. Also, the gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect strengthening bearish momentum.\nRSI is on the move up but appears to be stalling as it closes in on the overbought zone. Turning back down could draw bears in and force bitcoin price to resume the slide. Stochastic has more room to climb so bitcoin price could follow suit and attempt a neckline break.\nThe chart pattern is approximately $900 tall so a breakout could lead to a rally of the same height, taking bitcoin price to $8,600 next.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nThere appear to be no clear catalysts for the latest bounce, with many simply attributing this to a pickup in overall risk appetite. This follows a resolution of the political crisis in Italy and confirmation that the meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-Un will push through next week.\nAt the same time, the dollar is taking some weight on Trump's decision to slap higher tariffs on metal imports from its allies. Bitcoin could be poised to take advantage of risk rallies and dollar weakness from here.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Waiting for Reversal Confirmation appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T07:32:50.083+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07d4f789230eb449b5a356e2812c1df7b4ebc4cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sjM9BnUpIJJOc7_XonHO9eoTqdWPOnWAZgS9wRIRtALPjFKfsT_4M_ULvvNuy.vl8A--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Talking Heads Do an Amazingly Good Job Discussing Bitcoin", "title_full": "Talking Heads Do an Amazingly Good Job Discussing Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-06T07:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07d4f789230eb449b5a356e2812c1df7b4ebc4cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sjM9BnUpIJJOc7_XonHO9eoTqdWPOnWAZgS9wRIRtALPjFKfsT_4M_ULvvNuy.vl8A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T07:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Talking Heads Do an Amazingly Good Job Discussing Bitcoin", "text": "Talking Heads Do an Amazingly Good Job Discussing Bitcoin\n/u/DeadDillers\nsubmitted by /u/DeadDillers\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T07:26:52.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "515cd40623bdc6757b9aba7bfcd360092bee6931", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb3wMVzffzZQvRtnUd4vjyLrN.g.g3XBZFl2qmGcpA3oVdGAoEB_Kkl68gFv2WDuz8hn84YQaehFF8EeVPliWR0gM-", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Super Bitcoin (SBTC) Hits 24-Hour Volume of $888,204.00", "title_full": "Super Bitcoin (SBTC) Hits 24-Hour Volume of $888,204.00", "published": "2018-06-06T07:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2282.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "515cd40623bdc6757b9aba7bfcd360092bee6931", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb3wMVzffzZQvRtnUd4vjyLrN.g.g3XBZFl2qmGcpA3oVdGAoEB_Kkl68gFv2WDuz8hn84YQaehFF8EeVPliWR0gM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2018-06-06T07:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Super Bitcoin (SBTC) Hits 24-Hour Volume of $888,204.00", "text": " 5th, 2018 // No Comments\nSuper Bitcoin (CURRENCY:SBTC) traded 14.1% lower against the U.S. dollar during the 24 hour period ending at 0:00 AM E.T. on June 5th.

Names of Shilpa Shetty, Sunny Leone, Prachi Desai, Aarti Chabria, Sonal Chauhan, Karishma Tanna, Zareen Khan, Neha Dhupia, Huma Qureshi and Nargis Fakhri have surfaced during the probe, reports zeenewsindia.com .

Bharadwaj, who had reportedly flown away, was caught in April by the Pune police from the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi.\nThe Bollywood stars (named above) had reportedly promoted Bharadwaj's company Gainbitcoin in Dubai and Singapore.\nSince bitcoins are not a legal tender in the country and are not recognised as a medium of exchange, the Income Tax Department had reportedly sent notices to bitcoin users who were dealing in bitcoins worth Rs 1 crore or more on a daily basis.

Jim Chanos from Kynikos Associates is another high-profile crypto disbeliever.\nBitcoin is trading a $7,620, off Tuesday’s low registered at $7,355 and unchanged since the beginning of the day. The most popular digital coin reclaimed $7,500 handle, but it still struggles to get back above $7,683, which is 23.6% Fibo of the decline from $11,567 to $6,483.\nMeanwhile, voices of Bitcoin critics are getting louder. Jim Chanos, the founder of New York-based Kynikos Associates, is another high-profile investor skeptical about Bitcoin and digital currencies in general. He believes it is a “libertarian fantasy” and a by-product of a global risk-taking cycle\n“This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy,” Chanos said.\n‘And if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down,’ he added.\nHowever, Bitcoin is not a total outcast in the world of bigwigs. Thus, Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak believes that this digital coin would eventually become a single global currency.\nBitcoin’s technical picture\nFrom the longer-term point of view, Bitcoin is supported by the upside trend line now at $7,188. Once it is broken, the sell-off may be extended towards $7,000 handle, where fresh buying interest is likely to appear. On the upside, a sustainable movement above 23.6% Fibo will bring June 3 high ($7,777) into focus. The ultimate bullish aim is $8,000.

He called bitcoin a “libertarian fantasy” as so many of its supports hail its decentralized and anonymous nature as among its strengths in the currency market. And he said it’s wrong to believe cryptocurrencies would ever replace fiat currencies. “And if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down,” Chanos said, adding that he would rather have food than digital currencies in a worst-case scenario. “For those who believe it’s a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you’re going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it—for what, I have no idea.” RW note: Chanos is correct here except for the part about it being a “libertarian fantasy.” There are libertarians that pray at the virtual Bitcoin altar but they are the confused libertarians, not all libertarians do. And it is seriously delusional to think Bitcoin is an anonymous currency as some libertarians believe. Further, libertarianism, as a philosophy of liberty, has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

In economic terms, something lacking intrinsic value means it has no value of its own. But as the authors noted, “[s]tate monopoly currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Swiss franc, have no intrinsic value either.”\nIf both bitcoins and national currencies have no intrinsic value, then perhaps they are the same sort of financial instrument, or at least cousins. But I think this is wrong. Below I’ve mapped out a taxonomy of financial assets showing how Bitcoin and fiat money are categorized. Bitcoin and fiat money aren’t even cousins; they’re on entirely different branches of the family tree.\nFigure: Classifying Bitcoin and fiat money\nLet’s start with banknotes. Banknotes are a type of perpetual debt that, like deposits or consols, has no maturity date. Debt is different from equity in that its owners have first dibs on the issuer’s income. The return on debt is fixed since debt owners do not get to participate in any of the issuer’s upside — all of the residual profits flow through to equity holders. When things turn sour and the issuing institution goes bankrupt, debt claimants have a prior claim on whatever assets remain.\nBanknotes are a special type of perpetual debt because, unlike consols, they don’t pay interest. Central banks do issue an interest-paying form of perpetual debt: deposits. Unlike the case of banknotes, however, only commercial banks can hold central bank deposits.\nStocks, banknotes, consols, bonds, and deposits are all win-win opportunities. For an owner of any of these instruments to enjoy a return, another owner doesn’t need to lose out. As long as the issuing institution is generating a profit, everyone enjoys a return.\nWin-win games can be contrasted with zero-sum games. In a zero-sum game, the only way to come out ahead is if someone else loses. Derivatives are a good example of a zero-sum game. A futures contract is a bet between two people on the future price of a commodity like corn, one party being obligated to pay the other as the price diverges from what it was when the contract was entered into.\nOn the zero-sum branch is the subcategory of financial games , which includes poker and lotteries. Poker is a zero-sum game because one player’s winning hand is another player’s losing hand. As for lotteries, a lottery number can only be a winner because all other numbers are losers.\nBitcoin is a specific type of financial game, an early-bird game . This group also includes Ponzi games, pyramids, and chain letters. The payout decision for an early-bird game is based on entrance order, with early adopters winning at the expense of late adopters. In the same way that a Ponzi game comes to an end if no new participants appear, if no new buyers of bitcoins ever emerge, then current owners will find that their tokens are worth zero.\nI’m not trying to denigrate Bitcoin by putting it in the category of financial game. As long as they are played in moderation, financial games are a socially valuable form of entertainment, much like movies or sports. Let’s face it, Bitcoin is fun. Day or night, players love checking on its frenetic price. Bitcoin introduces some neat features to the financial-game space. Firstly, everyone in the world can play it (i.e., it is censorship-resistant). Secondly, the task of managing the game has been decentralized. Lastly, Bitcoin’s rules are automated by code and fully auditable.\nUnlike Bitcoin, most financial games are run by a centralized administrator and may be opaque and difficult to audit. In certain scenarios, this setup can be dangerous. Because early-bird games like Ponzis and chain letters have been driven underground by the authorities, the people who administer them lack accountability and will often turn out to be scam artists. As I wrote here , Bitcoin has the virtue of providing early-bird-game players with a relatively transparent and trustworthy alternative.\nWhich gets us to the issue of Bitcoin’s energy consumption. According to David Gerard , Bitcoin currently uses 0.1 percent of world electricity production, soon to be 0.5 percent. That’s a lot. The reason Bitcoin hogs so much electricity is that it decentralizes the task of managing the game to thousands of competing croupiers. Coordinating this multitude of croupiers requires an energy-intensive process — proof of work — which Gerard refers to as an “ugly kludge of a hack.”\nWhile financial games like lotteries and casinos are centralized, I suppose it would be possible to decentralize them in the same way that Bitcoin is decentralized. But this would make them more expensive to run. The only reason for adopting such a costly way to manage a financial game is to evade authorities, say because the lottery or casino is illegal. An illegal game run from a single central server would be easy for the authorities to shut down, but when it is maintained on thousands of independent computers across the globe, the game becomes much more resistant to being shut down. So while a centralized version of Bitcoin would be significantly cheaper to run, it would be an easy target for authorities on the lookout for illegal early-bird games.\nWhat about the motivating principle behind Bitcoin — to function as electronic cash — you may ask? One of the greatest tricks Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, ever played was convincing everyone that his invention was just like a banknote, when it was actually a novel type of zero-sum financial game. Zero-sum games are just too volatile to ever become the basis of a generally accepted medium of exchange. But even if it never gains much currency, that doesn’t mean Bitcoin isn’t without merit. If we owe the person who invented poker a debt of gratitude, maybe we owe Satoshi Nakamoto the same.

Because of that article, I’m now inundated with all manner of questions about what hot cryptocurrency to pick, the best ICO, and how to make money with cryptocurrency, and a bunch of ‘how do I get rich from cryptocurrency’ type questions. In an attempt to deflect the hoard of questions and provide some basic answer to some of the new visitors, I’ve spent the past few days writing a brand new guide to answer all the questions I’m getting. Welcome to The Mega Ultimate Guide to Making Millions with Cryptocurrency ICO’s. This is the very first article I have written myself for my new site CryptoIncome.io at http://cryptoincome.io/ There’s a number of articles on this site, all aimed at new investors and beginners to the cryptocurrency market. However, those were written by my staff, but not me. I figure I myself need to step in here and write a few core articles for you guys to get this site going and provide real value to the public from someone who knows what they are doing in this space. So if you are interested in my own articles here, make sure to check out all articles by Ben Krypto at http://cryptoincome.io/author/benk/.\nIf you have questions and want to discuss no bullshit, no shill cryptocurrency picks with other passionate investors, join the Crypto Income Telegram group at https://t.me/joinchat/GbWHDA-N03C_vyQ9hdscQQ. I like to think this is by far the most comprehensive guide on the topic of making filthy amounts of money with ICO’s. And yes, I can confirm it is indeed possible to make ludicrous money through ICO investing. Why? Because I’ve made millions with ICO’s. So I can confirm it is indeed possible. And I’m going to make millions more. Now, I don’t want to bog this whole article down by showing proof. But if you feel you need to see I’m not bullshitting on my claims, simply check out the article I wrote on AuthorityIncome 6 months ago at http://authorityincome.com/how-i-made-a-million-dollars-with-cryptocurrency/ where I wrote about how I made over a million dollars in just 3 weeks. And yes, I go to great length to show you proof that I’m not bullshitting. Since then it’s been 6 months and the market has gone up 10x and a lot of craziness has happened. So this article is written by someone who’s not just talking the talk but walking the walk. This everything I reasonably know about how to make money with ICO’s. My ICO handbook, as it were. And I’m going to only charge you the fair price of $ 4,999 to become rich. ….actually not, I’m giving it away to you for FREE. Because that’s what I like to do and because I’ve made so much money in crypto that I don’t need any of yours. So why would I do this when I can clearly take your money?\nBecause I can, that’s why. And I hate all the stupid you tube shills and self-made fakers out there trying to tell you guys what shitcoins to buy, right before they’ve loaded up on their coins to dump on their followers. Anyways, enough of that. Let’s talk how to make some money. To make money in the current crypto market, you just need to know one word. It’s called ‘ICO’ (Initial Coin Offering). Remember those words, because right now, that’s going to be your best friend. Mr ICO has been my very generous friend the past 7 months and has been gifting me with millions. And he can be your friend too. THE ICO GAME. ICO’s stand for ‘Initial Coin Offering‘ which is sort of like the cryptocurrency version of an IPO, minus the regulations (for now). ICOs are, at least in current market conditions, are the best way to make money with cryptocurrencies, hands down, feet first. I can’t say if the ICO gold rush will last for more than a few months and span the entire 2018 and beyond, but at least right now the market is red hot for ICO’s. I expect this to change within the next 3 to 6 months, so this guide may not be so relevant when those changes occur, either due to market sentiment, a market correction, or the implementation of regulations ICO across the world. So how can you make ridiculous amounts of money with cryptocurrency? Two ways. 1. Buy strong coins and hold them for months / years or, 2. ICO’s. My strategy has been the #2 option. Why the ICO? Simple.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network https://mypr.co.za/getting-started-with-cryptocurrency-part-6/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn\nCLICK HERE to submit a Video Press Release to MyPR.\n–", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://cryptoincome.io/author/benk/.", "http://mypr.co.za/making-money-from-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-part-1/", "http://authorityincome.com/", "http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn", "https://t.me/joinchat/GbWHDA-N03C_vyQ9hdscQQ.", "http://authorityincome.com/how-i-made-a-million-dollars-with-cryptocurrency/", "https://mypr.co.za/getting-started-with-cryptocurrency-part-6/", "http://cryptoincome.io/", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben krypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T09:36:32.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "602e3c6bffcc52a6635d600e5fdca9a5e5d37455", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQErkeMmdCj0ZRy7ckgpwhU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "I lost 80% of my bitcoins in alts, What can I do now?!", "title_full": "I lost 80% of my bitcoins in alts, What can I do now?!", "published": "2018-06-06T06:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "602e3c6bffcc52a6635d600e5fdca9a5e5d37455", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQErkeMmdCj0ZRy7ckgpwhU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vertinfos", "published": "2018-06-06T06:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "I lost 80% of my bitcoins in alts, What can I do now?!", "text": "I think you can now to cry ) already late something to change, either in long already invest and wait for", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T07:41:36.047+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a42a7f2887ec4d0c9c5e187b1d7820ae51669d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTL5OCwAE6oDnMeednNSmRk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "The reason why we should invest in Bitcoin Or Ethereum ?", "title_full": "The reason why we should invest in Bitcoin Or Ethereum ?", "published": "2018-06-06T06:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a42a7f2887ec4d0c9c5e187b1d7820ae51669d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTL5OCwAE6oDnMeednNSmRk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mr", "published": "2018-06-06T06:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "The reason why we should invest in Bitcoin Or Ethereum ?", "text": "The main reason why we have to invest our money in bitcoin and ethereum is that they are potential.

Bitcoin could be poised to take advantage of risk rallies and dollar weakness from here.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Waiting for Reversal Confirmation appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T09:52:02.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5bfd9d7712286c1f01c97a553848bfd499adb48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqan4DcBl4aC8kzq6G9Pv4OkXjaklS0cVydmvqmcg_m._cLCgAUnCsXKyfZ8J.rvMXI3KNKz6vXKlPymONUMc1zFT2elmd9j7Qs", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoCurrency", "title": "An old Alcoa plant in Upstate New York is going to be converted into one of the world's largest bitcoin mining centers", "title_full": "An old Alcoa plant in Upstate New York is going to be converted into one of the world's largest bitcoin mining centers : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-06T06:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5bfd9d7712286c1f01c97a553848bfd499adb48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqan4DcBl4aC8kzq6G9Pv4OkXjaklS0cVydmvqmcg_m._cLCgAUnCsXKyfZ8J.rvMXI3KNKz6vXKlPymONUMc1zFT2elmd9j7Qs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jam-hay", "published": "2018-06-06T06:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "An old Alcoa plant in Upstate New York is going to be converted into one of the world's largest bitcoin mining centers", "text": "submitted by /u/jam-hay\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/bitcoin-miner-revamps-alcoas-aluminum-factory.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T02:10:49.047+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "365beb72a31a4c6aba983886ddbcc9f4e1b23225", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTvdGYwrwm8bYXgFJSb1rvU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "what is the future of virtual currency like bitcoin ?", "title_full": "what is the future of virtual currency like bitcoin ?", "published": "2018-06-06T06:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.97, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "365beb72a31a4c6aba983886ddbcc9f4e1b23225", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTvdGYwrwm8bYXgFJSb1rvU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Faxmate", "published": "2018-06-06T06:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "what is the future of virtual currency like bitcoin ?", "text": "The future of bitcoin looks promising as of now.

It is also used as an asset and an investment and from that the people who engaged in bitcoin can earn good profit.\nI think the purpose if bitcoin depends on the need of the person. Some consider it as business, some as mode of payment, some used it for privacy purposes and a lot more reasons. Mainly for me, bitcoin is my source of income since its convertion to fiat money is very high and the opportunity to earn bitcoin is not that hard if tiu just spend time like joining forum like this.\nthe best purpose of bitcoin is the mode of payment, they build a blockchain technology that can make every transaction fast. And on what you have said on how a person sees bitcoin is a mode of income and for me that is not a good purpose of bitcoin.\nPrecisely! I also consider bitcoin as a form of exchange where transactions are done electronically, and as a store of value. Bitcoin as the first virtual currency, offers lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a no single network. I believed that is its real purpose, to provide quality living, to make transactions safe, private, and secured.\nBitcoin is fast for payment and it will rise more than this as developing technologies are participating to the growth of our profit, the purpose why I am using bitcoin is that it is best source of payment for me, it is way of buying goods with online payment without wasting time and extra money, it makes profit for me and not only me but it improves the economical state of my whole country.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T03:19:34.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eac5bc5cce84b3d78212cc5a30c2bffcb98fd573", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vy2qVOjKyeGxeHwcFBW0971IAaFe.3JlJkfNnUJax.kArpow_yDM04V9Ud9IvwOJ_95.Oe4p2XRa0aERSWIMRsE8eU7SiTotQ6BpE7phVffhQ--", "site_full": "ledgergazette.com", "site": "ledgergazette.com", "site_section": "http://ledgergazette.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Ledger Gazette", "title": "Bitcoin Scrypt (CRYPTO:BTCS) One Day Volume Tops $636.00", "title_full": "Bitcoin Scrypt (CRYPTO:BTCS) One Day Volume Tops $636.00", "published": "2018-06-06T06:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/205.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eac5bc5cce84b3d78212cc5a30c2bffcb98fd573", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vy2qVOjKyeGxeHwcFBW0971IAaFe.3JlJkfNnUJax.kArpow_yDM04V9Ud9IvwOJ_95.Oe4p2XRa0aERSWIMRsE8eU7SiTotQ6BpE7phVffhQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rob Logan", "published": "2018-06-06T06:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Scrypt (CRYPTO:BTCS) One Day Volume Tops $636.00", "text": "Posted by Rob Logan on Jun 5th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin Scrypt (CURRENCY:BTCS) traded down 6.3% against the US dollar during the 24-hour period ending at 17:00 PM ET on May 21st.

I don't think there's anything he does that I don't already know about.\"The letter is part of a growing scam reported since last November by victims scattered across the country. Some have compared it to the old Ashley Madison scandal when married men using the dating site were threatened with exposure. Others say there appears to be no rhyme, reason or pattern for how the scammers choose their victims or how many perpetrators may be involved.The letter says, \"You don't know me personally and nobody hired me to look into you...It is just your bad luck that I stumbled across your misadventures while working a job around San Francisco. I then put in more time than I probably should have looking into your life.\"It goes on to say that the payment is just to cover all the time he spent investigating Levinson.\"It's disturbing but also funny,'' Nora said. \"The way he calls himself Blackdoor and says I will be humiliated if I find these things out. That's what made me realize they didn't know anything about him and didn't have anything negative about him.\"The letter said \"At this point you may be thinking \"I'll just go to the cops.\" Which is why I have taken steps to ensure this letter cannot be traced back to me. So that won't help, and it won't stop the evidence from destroying your life. \" It then goes on to say he has to pay the $8,150 as a \"confidentiality fee.'' And it must be anonymously paid in bitcoin. It gives instructions - 19 steps in all for buying and transferring the currency. It even gives tips on how to find a reputable bitcoin dealer - get this - \"to avoid getting scammed.\"Levinson said the most disturbing aspect of it was that it came in a real letter, to his home address.\"Someone knows my name and where I live,'' he said. \"That's unsettling.\"\"Not knowing how they got our personal address information or why he was picked out of millions to get this letter is a little disturbing,'' Nora added.The letter threatened to expose his supposed secret to everyone on his street - naming Inverness Drive specifically. In order to neutralize the effects of such a scam, he began reporting it wherever he could.\"I filed a report with the FBI, I told the Postal Service. And I decided to call Michael Finney,'' he said.He and his wife wanted 7 On Your Side to warn viewers that this letter could pop up in anyone's mailbox.\"Nora felt this was so heinous tha tit deserves and needs to get out there and for other people to be aware,'' Levinson said. \"I knew about Michael Finney and all the things he does to help people.\"He said he worries someone out ther will get the letter, and if they do have something to hide, will believe the perpetrators have some evidence to ruin their lives.The FBI has said the scammers don't really have any dirt on their victims, just betting that some of them will believe they do, and will pay up.Don't fall for it, Levinson advised.\"It's important that people know about this and when they get something like this they're not scared,'' he said. \"And don't do anything that involves really sending money because, it's an honest to God scam.\" For more stories, photos, and video on Bitcoin, visit this page .

Crypto market volatility is subsiding.\nCryptocurrency market value has grown by $15B since Tuesday as major coins have recovered from losses incurred at the beginning of the week. The bullish momentum has been slowing down during early Asian hours evidencing that the recovery may be coming to a halt. The total value of all cryptocurrencies settled at $345B from $330B on Tuesday and $470 a month ago; with average daily volume is registered at $16B according to CoinMarketCap.\nBitcoin , the worlds biggest digital currency, is trading at $7,600 handle, off Tuesday’s low at $7,355 level. BTC/USD is mostly unchanged since the start of the day and up over 2% since this time yesterday; Bitcoin’s market value is $130B.\nEthereum is trading at $605, marginally lower on the day. However, on a day-to-day basis, the second largest coin gained over 3%; ETH/USD managed to break above $600 handle, but no follow-through may push it back in $500.00-$600.00. range. Ethereum’s market value stands at $60B, the average daily trading volume is $1.8B.\nRipple climbed marginally above $0.67, off Tuesday’s low at $0.6350, though $0.70 resistance is still out of reach. On daily basis Ripple has gained 3.2% amid overall recovery on crypto markets. XRP’s market value has settled at $26.4B, trading volumes – $369M. XRP/JPY and XRP/KRW are the most active trading pairs with Ripple.\nEOS is a recovery leader so far with 5% growth on daily basis. EOS/USD is changing hands at $14.03 with bullish momentum fading away. EOS market value is registered at $12.5B, trading volume – $1.4B. EOS is most actively traded at Huobi and OKEx against USDT.\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency market volatility has subsided during recent weeks. Thus, 30-day bitcoin volatility index is down 8% since the beginning of 2018, currently trading at 2.77%, which is the lowest level since May 2017.

Businessman Raj Kundra was on Tuesday summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Bitcoin scam. The ED questioned Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, in connection with a money laundering probe related to a Bitcoin transactions case, involving Indian investor Amit Bhardwaj. Kundra's name turned up in the report following alleged links with Bhardwaj. According to media reports, Bhardwaj had started the country's first online marketplace which accepted Bitcoins and had also started Bitcoin mining start-ups. He reportedly lured in investors with promises of hefty returns, assuring the investors of access to the Bitcoin mining system that would let them mine their own Bitcoins. The ED had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. It is alleged that about 8,000 investors lost about Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme. The ED had filed its case based on an FIR by the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier. Reportedly, Bhardwaj was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals. Kundra had allegedly promoted one of Bhardwaj's operations. The businessman was summoned at the ED Mumbai office and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government. There are some instances of the case where Kundra's name crops up and hence, he has been asked to record his statement. In a statement, Raj Kundra said, \"Amit was to buy a team in poker league and had got into a contract with us. I have come as a witness to the same.\" Raj Kundra was previously embroiled in the IPL betting scandal and was banned from all cricket-related activities for life. Kundra filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the ban. Kundra had filed an application under Right To Information (RTI) with the Delhi Police, who in their reply said there's \"no evidence\" of betting charges against him. Last month, the Gujarat branch of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had arrested Kirit Paladiya for stealing Bitcoins from his partner. According to the police authorities, Paladiya stole 176 Bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore from his partner Shailesh Bhatt. Also, Amreli's Superintendent of Police Jagdish Patel, Amreli local Crime Branch inspector Anant Patel and two other constables were arrested for being involved in the case. The central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related Bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments. It is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in Maharashtra. Last year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed the Parliament that there are no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the RBI has not given any licence to any entity or company to operate such currencies. The government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, saying they are like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection.

More importantly, I have evidence of what you have been hiding. I won’t go into specifics here in case your wife intercepts this, but you know what I am talking about.”\nIt threatens to reveal the secrets unless Levinson paid $8,150 in bitcoin. It even included a two-page “how-to” guide for purchasing the digital currency and sending it to the scammer’s bitcoin account.\n“The implication was that I was having an affair but the way it was worded it could cover anything, maybe a gambling problem or drugs or alcohol,” Levinson said.\nHe and his wife, Nora, have been happily married for almost 25 years. Levinson knew he had nothing to hide. Still the menacing words rattled him.\n“It made me glad that I’ve led a good life and that I’ve always been true to Nora,” Levinson said. “But I stopped to think, did I ever do anything that could come back and haunt me? No! I’m OK, I’m OK. You know, I had to reassure myself.”\nHe told Nora about it that very day. At first, she laughed\n“Then when I read the letter I actually got angry because there’s so many threats in it. People are using the U.S. mails to blackmail people.”\nIf someone told her that her husband was having an affair, or had done some other terrible deed, she said she wouldn’t believe it.\nRELATED: Everything you need to know about Bitcoin\n“We have a great relationship,” Nora Levinson said. “We’re very close. We talk about everything. I don’t think there’s anything he does that I don’t already know about.”\nThe letter is part of a growing scam reported since last November by victims scattered across the country. Some have compared it to the old Ashley Madison scandal when married men using the dating site were threatened with exposure. Others say there appears to be no rhyme, reason or pattern for how the scammers choose their victims or how many perpetrators may be involved.\nThe letter says “ You don’t know me personally and nobody hired me to look into you…It is just your bad luck that I stumbled across your misadventures while working a job around San Francisco. I then put in more time than I probably should have looking into your life.”\nIt goes on to say that the payment is just to cover all the time he spent investigating Levinson.\n“It’s disturbing but also funny,” Nora said. “The way he calls himself Blackdoor and says I will be humiliated if I find these things out. That’s what made me realize they didn’t know anything about him and didn’t have anything negative about him.”\nThe letter said “At this point you may be thinking “I’ll just go to the cops.” Which is why I have taken steps to ensure this letter cannot be traced back to me. So that won’t help, and it won’t stop the evidence from destroying your life. “\nIt then goes on to say he has to pay the $8,150 as a “confidentiality fee.” And it must be anonymously paid in bitcoin. It gives instructions – 19 steps in all for buying and transferring the currency. It even gives tips on how to find a reputable bitcoin dealer – get this –“to avoid getting scammed.”\nDaniel says the most disturbing aspect of it was that it came in a real letter, to his home address.\n“Someone knows my name and where I live,” he said. “That’s unsettling.”\n“Not knowing how they got our personal address information or why he was picked out of millions to get this letter is a little disturbing,” Nora added.\nThe letter threatened to expose his supposed secret to everyone on his street – naming Inverness Drive specifically. In order to neutralize the effects of such a scam, he began reporting it wherever he could.\n“I filed a report with the FBI, I told the Postal Service. And I decided to call Michael Finney,” at ABC7, he said.\nHe and his wife wanted 7 On Your Side to warn viewers that this letter could pop up in anyone’s mailbox.\n“Nora felt this was so heinous tha tit deserves and needs to get out there and for other people to be aware,” Levinson said. “I knew about Michael Finney and all the things he does to help people.”\nHe said he worries someone out ther will get the letter, and if they do have something to hide, will believe the perpetrators have some evidence to ruin their lives.\nThe FBI has said the scammers don’t really have any dirt on their victims, just betting that some of them will believe they do, and will pay up.\nLevinson said, don’t fall for it.\n“It’s important that people know about this and when they get something like this they’re not scared,” he said. “And don’t do anything that involves really sending money because, it’s an honest to God scam.”\nFor more stories, photos, and video on Bitcoin, visit this page .\n(Copyright ©2018 KGO-TV.

This is the reason professional investors and software developers are designing trading systems that can help people become successful in this industry. Bitcoin Trader is a brand new investment solution that has entered the scene.\nWith dozens of trading systems flooding the market, it is quite daunting to stand out from the rest. The new ones are having a difficult time to make a mark in the industry and unless they have something unique to offer, they will fail to attract the attention of genuine investors.\nBut Bitcoin Trader is a different deal altogether. The system offers plenty of beneficial characteristics. It has features and elements that traders will surely find useful. Since the time it has been launched, it has attracted massive attention and it has also become one of the most sought-after investment programs.\nThe testimonials and feedback that have been pouring in from the trading community suggest that this trading system has capabilities of producing excellent results. When it was tested, it delivered exceptional performance and the results were desirable as well. Basically, the daily returns that traders will be able to achieve with this tool is extremely good.\nHowever, there are many more features and characteristics that set this trading tool apart from its competition. The sophisticated algorithms implemented into the system took 2 years for complete. The team has worked hard to ensure that its working mechanism is as efficient as possible. In fact, the team has constantly worked on the algorithms until it met their expectations.\nThe team has also worked on some innovative features as such reverse trading and risk control features for few years before they were implemented into the system. Following the completion of the tool, it underwent numerous testing so all of its features could be tried out and any possible bugs could be reported before it went live.\nCurrently, traders from across the globe can sign up for the software and see how it works. The number of licenses given out per day is limited at the moment, but hopefully, it will be lifted once the developers are satisfied with the feedback.\nInitial reports confirm that the results produced by the software are outstanding. Many people who have used it are happy with the outcome they have achieved. Fantastic performance has been witnessed as a result of using the auto-pilot functionalities of the software.\nBitcoin Trader is quite capable of helping its users make the most of the opportunities that are presented by the bitcoin markets. It works for all traders, regardless of the level of trading proficiency they have. The best part is that the software produces positive results no matter what the conditions in the market are. Whether the price is falling or going up, it looks for favourable opportunities to generate a return on the investment made.\nThe developers are delighted with the response they are receiving from the trading community. In a statement released to the media, they have mentioned that they are proud of their achievement and they will continue to upgrade the system to optimize its performance for its users. They have said that they strive to offer the best trading solutions for traders, especially the newcomers in the industry.\nWith the official release of Bitcoin Trader, investors have access to a scam-free and reliable tool. The software integrates with regulated brokers only, giving traders peace of mind and additional security for their funds.\nContact Info:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://top10cryptorobots.com/crypto-robots/bitcoin-trader/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T08:20:14.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d8628ccd673f822963fa95fb8227f1c4ee5ab6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYHFycVDT7qUWKpEQBGmi3icafy73H3tiduVF_tCWzzEV.8whbvpqnGUKSWqn6htfvGoKJx57h1w--", "site_full": "www.phpbbitalia.net", "site": "phpbbitalia.net", "site_section": "https://www.phpbbitalia.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=72", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Off-Topic - phpBB Italia", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans - phpBB Italia", "published": "2018-06-06T05:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d8628ccd673f822963fa95fb8227f1c4ee5ab6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYHFycVDT7qUWKpEQBGmi3icafy73H3tiduVF_tCWzzEV.8whbvpqnGUKSWqn6htfvGoKJx57h1w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Helentuh", "published": "2018-06-06T05:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW revolutional software for solving any CAPTCHA's\n1.

Hoarding might be harmful to your profits, if you do not cash out SOME profit on the ATH. You might end up with a bitcoin worth $100 in year 5.\n Valid point. Although I agree with your thought, I think that it is one sided. I mean, just think about it, you only made last year as an example. If you tried to make an example out of the start of bitcoin then I think that it will not agree with your point. You see, the prices has gone way up than what it was back then. Sure, if a person invests stupidly, then he will surely lose a lot of money. But if he only invests money he can throw away and just continue to put more extra to invest then not touch it, I am pretty sure that it will be worth a fortune if the history of bitcoins continue to
