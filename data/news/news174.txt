Some people certainly think that is the case, whereas others are not necessarily on the same page. Brian Kelly is very bullish on this altcoin right now, but only time will tell if his sentiment is the right one. Brian Kelly is Bullish on BCH\nOver the past few years, we have seen some interesting opinions on various cryptocurrencies. A lot of people think Bitcoin is the only currency that matters, although certain altcoins should not be overlooked. Bitcoin Cash, for example, is making a big impact, even though the opinions on this altcoin are still pretty contentious.\nBrian Kelly, a notorious cryptocurrency investor and speculator, is confident that Bitcoin Cash is going places. More specifically, he considers Bitcoin Cash to be the “must-own” cryptocurrency of the moment, although it is evident that not everyone will see it that way. There are some interesting reasons as to why Kelly is thinking along these lines right now.\nIn his opinion, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain and ecosystem are gaining value pretty quickly. With mining pools now contributing some of their rewards to support the future development of BCH, a lot of interesting things can happen in the future. This development comes on the heels of news that Bitmain is destroying some of the fees it receives by moving BCH to an unspendable address.\nAdditionally, one has to keep in mind that the Bitcoin Cash price hasn’t seen any major setbacks since its launch last year. Although it has spiked to a value which is a lot higher than the current price, one BCH is still valued at $1,225 right now. Given the issues which all cryptocurrency markets have encountered during the first few months of 2018, the Bitcoin Cash price has held its own quite well, all things considered.\nWhether or not the opinion of Brian Kelly will convince more people to invest in BCH remains to be determined. It is evident there is a lot of speculation associated with cryptocurrencies right now, and everything can seem like a good and bad investment at the same time. The markets will have to turn around at some point, but until that happens, the Bitcoin Cash price may not go much higher than it is right now.\nIt is good to see enthusiasts and investors turn bullish on cryptocurrencies once again. So far, the year 2018 hasn’t been all that stellar, but the uptrend is still firmly in place when looking at the bigger picture. While this year may not result in a massive bull run like that of late 2017, the future is not set in stone by any means. If experts like Brian Kelly are to be believed, the best is yet to come.

Designed with by no means earlier than seen options, Tari is positioned to grow to be greater than one other “me-too” protocol that allows token creation.\nSince I’ve gotten into bitcoin, the query in my thoughts has by no means been “will cryptocurrency revolutionize the monetary world?” As I discovered about Bitcoin, the query rapidly turned “Is Bitcoin the iteration of cryptocurrency that may revolutionize the monetary world?” and to this point, it has been. However different cash have carved our vital parts of the community. None of these are as massive and influential as Ethereum.\nIn some methods, Ethereum is objectively superior to Bitcoin. It’s extra versatile and highly effective than Bitcoin. However it hasn’t taken over bitcoin, as a result of bitcoin has its personal benefits. It’s higher at being a retailer and switch of easy worth. It’s easy and safe. So that they turned completely different cash designed to be various things. And so the query modified once more, into two questions.\n“Will Bitcoin be the iteration of cryptocurrency that revolutionizes the monetary world?”and “Will Ethereum be the iteration of cryptocurrency that brings concerning the DApp revolution?”\nThe second is a bit simplistic. Ethereum can do different issues and Bitcoin nonetheless has a job to play in DApps, and will even overtake Ethereum, however that’s the fundamental thought.\nTari goals to be not simply Ethereum’s first actual competitors within the area, however maybe the following evolution of the token financial system.\nTari Co-founder and lead developer Riccardo “Fluffy Pony” Spagni sat down with Oliver Carding and Cameron Carpenter from CoinJournal at Consensus to elucidate his imaginative and prescient for the coin introduced in the present day.\nIf that title sounds acquainted to you, it’s seemingly since you acknowledge Spagni because the lead developer of Monero, the main privacy-focused coin. Tari is constructed on prime of Monero, and like Monero, its most attention-grabbing characteristic, is its privateness instruments.\nThat opinion won’t be common. Spagni talked much more about how necessary the person expertise can be. However there was one specific a part of the interview that made my ears perk up.\nTokens constructed on Tari could have privateness sliders.\n“You’ve obtained extra complicated issues like the extent of privateness. One thing which may occur is an in recreation token or an in-game asset. The issuer won’t need the motion of that belongings to be seen. They won’t need the motion of that token to be seen. As a result of that’s non-public info. So that they’ll go maximal privateness there. However then, you bought somebody who may use the platform to subject a safety token and the SEC may need a mandate that claims, In case you try this, it’s obtained to be traceable. And [with Tari], they will say, this asset has no privateness.\nSo the flexibility to set that privateness slider, depending on what precisely you want to your personal common regulatory burden as a problem. I feel it’s essential, there’s nobody measurement matches all.\nI feel it’s, it’s crucial to supply that degree of performance as extensively as potential in order that the difficulty isn’t constrained. And the truth that we’re constructing this and constructing the proofcase on the similar time and it’s the identical crew constructing each, can also be essential. The proofcase attracts closely on the protocol and it units the calls for. In case you say, as an issuer, I would like to have the ability to do that and the protocol crew can say ‘okay, cool. That may be a piece of performance we didn’t take into consideration, now we’re including that.’ By the point we launch we could have a protocol that is ready to deal with complicated digital belongings but it surely’s executed so in follow as a result of we constructed the platform and we constructed the protocol”\nLet that sink in for a minute. Token creators may, in principle, overlook having to construct layers of both privateness enabling instruments to maintain their customers protected or figuring out instruments to remain in compliance.\nThe 2 examples given by Spagni completely encapsulate the 2 completely different extremes of token issuance. Not the whole lot in a recreation like CryptoKitties must be traceable. In reality, contemplating their progress in worth, it is likely to be greatest if a few of that info had been obscured, for the security of its house owners.\nAny point out of privateness has to return with the necessary rationalization on why that privateness ought to be necessary to individuals not utilizing it to purchase medication or fund terrorism.\nIn case you purchase a real-world collectible with money, there isn’t a publicly out there file of that transaction. Even when you purchase with a bank card, there can be a file someplace, but it surely gained’t be publicly out there. The identical ought to be true with digital collectibles. What’s necessary for everybody concerned to know is “what number of of X are out within the wild” not who owns every one. And letting the world know that you’ve got a group of extraordinarily beneficial CryptoKitties won’t be good to your security.\nHowever transferring previous collectibles, there are causes you’d need much less privateness, even with out the specter of the SEC floating over the whole lot. In a publicly traded firm, traders may discover it helpful to understand how a lot inventory (or on this case, what number of tokens) the board of administrators personal.\nLate final 12 months, Intel revealed that its CPU had some main safety flaws, what would finally be known as the Specter and Meltdown exploits. What’s lesser recognized is that within the months earlier than, Intel’s CEO sold a bunch of Intel stock . Whereas that info did come out within the media due to disclosure legal guidelines on public corporations. With a Tari token that had its privateness settings tuned a sure means, it may have come out earlier and in a verifiable means.\nThe privateness settings aren’t the one characteristic of Tari. With Spagni’s involvement, it isn’t a shock that it might have essentially the most sturdy privateness options of all of the token protocols. That stated, in addition they have introduced collectively a formidable crew. Along with Fluffy Pony, Tari co-founders embody Naveen Jain, who’s constructed a number of profitable corporations within the leisure trade and was an early Monero miner, and Dan Teree the founding father of Ticketfly, which was bought by Pandora for $450 Million.\nAnd their focus is actually on the person expertise. Spagni defined\n“The unlucky factor is that folks with UX expertise typically are engaged on initiatives which are fairly gentle the place it’s simple to summary issues away. The arduous stuff, the protocol degree stuff like lightning, individuals with UX skills aren’t interested in. They’re wonderful builders, and fully horrible at UX. So we’re looking for a technique to do each.”\nThe UX and UI of Tari can be essential to its success. Ethereum took off when it turned considerably simpler to launch your individual Tokens. Nothing else Tari does will matter until the top person has an fulfilling expertise. That goes for the whole lot from shopping for, promoting and looking tokens to creating one from scratch. With Teree’s expertise it’s simple to think about Tari getting used to ticket gross sales or within the reselling market. However nobody goes to make use of it to purchase live performance tickets in the event that they need to open up command-line and enter half a dozen instructions to make sure their tickets are within the seats they need.\nHowever with a severe dedication to the person expertise, the built-in safety of the Monero blockchain and modern privateness settings that transcend what we now have seen within the crypto world, it stands an actual likelihood at turning into the following massive factor.\nSadly, it’s a methods off. The estimated client launch remains to be two years away. And the crew has to ship on its lofty guarantees. Spagni has the expertise within the Crypto market to take him severely. Monero has already taken the privateness crown from its pre-mined CryptoNote predecessor ByteCoin, and now it has turned its sights onto Ethereum with a probably extra characteristic sturdy protocol.\nWill that be sufficient to beat Ethereum’s community impact? Time will inform. Refreshingly, the Tari crew isn’t elevating public cash. It isn’t launching an ICO with foolish reductions and Ponzi-lite referral applications. They’ve raised some non-public cash to jump-start improvement however the remainder of us will simply have to attend and see what they arrive out with.

Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told CNN the incident in the coal-mining city of Witbank was over in minutes and the abductors seemed to make a beeline for Marite. Hackers hold hotel's keys hostage for bitcoin ransom \"It happened very fast and there was no struggle,\" Hlathi told CNN. \"His friends reported that these were full grown men who just went for him and grabbed him into the car and dropped a ransom note. They demanded that his parents should pay a ransom in bitcoins.\" Read More Hlathi said the sum demanded was 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash. A copy of the ransom note was also posted on several social media accounts. The kidnappers warn the parents not to involve the police, saying: \"We have your child. Your child will not be harmed if the following demands are met.\" The note asks the boy's family to pay 1 bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27. The family has yet to pay any of the ransom, Hlathi said. Bitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets. The ransom note also included information about a wallet to which to send the payment.

CME has also said that it is gauging client interest in an ethereum futures product , and its recent launch of an ether price index has laid the groundwork for that development.\nBut while CME and fellow Chicago exchange CBOE have seen as much as $670 million in combined bitcoin futures volume during a single trading session, no major European exchange has listed derivatives products for bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.\nAs CCN reported , regulated UK trading platform Crypto Facilities has launched futures products for bitcoin, ether, and XRP. Pricing data from the exchange’s bitcoin and ether products is included in CME’s bitcoin and ether reference rate indices. However, these products have yet to catch on at larger venues like Deutsche Boerse.\nIn the US, meanwhile, the operators of both the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are holding discussions about listing cryptocurrency products , and the NYSE is rumored to be considering whether to launch a full-fledged cryptocurrency exchange.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tessler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey tessler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stock exchange deutsche boerse advertisement join", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association for financial markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T00:30:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50d5aebf611ed00e4f0d6f4352d705a721fad593", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5jn0ozOVQJjpj9D48aBT7WkcIF3A_q8fr9ND6UUYABuwFx0jfjBNSPw5Vs__PSY0wZ7LaK70WiqPD8hie25tHITsD9M5J8rt5VAtuRqbfIfBGo8yWSaEqMvQJISKZSYA-", "site_full": "www.helenabitcoinmining.com", "site": "helenabitcoinmining.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "India Considers New Tax on Cryptocurrency Trades - Helena Bitcoin Mining", "title_full": "India Considers New Tax on Cryptocurrency Trades - Helena Bitcoin Mining", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.016, "main_image": "http://www.helenabitcoinmining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hbm-fb-profile.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50d5aebf611ed00e4f0d6f4352d705a721fad593", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_5jn0ozOVQJjpj9D48aBT7WkcIF3A_q8fr9ND6UUYABuwFx0jfjBNSPw5Vs__PSY0wZ7LaK70WiqPD8hie25tHITsD9M5J8rt5VAtuRqbfIfBGo8yWSaEqMvQJISKZSYA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sujha Sundararajan", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "India Considers New Tax on Cryptocurrency Trades - Helena Bitcoin Mining", "text": "India Considers New Tax on Cryptocurrency Trades May 23, 2018\nIndia could soon impose goods and services tax (GST) on many digital currency transactions, a report indicates.

With that said, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, have made their way into mainstream politics over the last couple of years. Back in September 2017, Austin Petersen, a Senate candidate in Missouri also began accepting Bitcoin for campaign contributions.\nCryptocurrency and politics is a relatively new phenomenon. Winston Edmonson, a four-time mayoral candidate in the Texas city of Lewisville, proposed the issuance of a municipal cryptocurrency as means of funding the local police force without having to raise taxes. Then there was firebrand Ron Paul putting forward a bill to allow competing currencies. Democratic Deer Fight\nAs reported by multiple outlets, Brian Forde has stated that his campaign has managed to raise upwards of $130,000 in different cryptocurrencies. This clearly shows that Forde is currently a favorite among the world of crypto enthusiasts. Another proof for that is that he’s managed to get more Bitcoin contributions than all of the previous candidates for Congress combined, according to Bloomberg.\nNaturally, this fires up the spark of competition. A rival Democratic candidate of Forde – Dave Min, who’s also a former SEC attorney, launched a TV ad which contained the following line about his rival:\nBrian Forde’s big donors? Bitcoin speculators who oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.\nNow that’s harsh. Pressing Where It Hurts\nNaturally, a strong statement of the kind is to be expected to trigger a serious reaction. As such, one would expect for it to be substantiated with facts, as politics is all about hard facts and decisions based on them, right? Don’t answer that.\nAccording to Axios , Min’s campaign manager failed to provide any reasonable merit for these serious accusations. As a matter of fact, as if she’s realized that the ad might have gone a bit too far, she states that while Min “is a huge believer in the potential of distributed ledger technology,” his primary concerns are focused towards some “deregulatory agenda being pushed by Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.” Questionable Merits at Best\nDespite refusing to provide any straightforward specifics, Min’s campaign manager pointed towards Brock Pierce as one of Forde’s leading Bitcoin donors. To this, Forde responded that:\nPierce, while extremely controversial, has never publicly said he opposes ‘cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.’\nIndeed, starting beef of that kind seems quite sensational, but it should at least be backed by certain spot-on facts so that it doesn’t deflate as soon as someone questions it. Can we Please Cut the Cr*p Already?\nFor whatever reason, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, are continuously being associated with all kinds of illicit activity. Yes, Bitcoin is used by criminals, and so are other digital currencies. But it doesn’t even begin to compare to conventional fiat currency in this respect.\nAnd that’s a stone cold, research-backed truth. So much so, in fact, that it has been confirmed by official authorities and institutions throughout the entire world. The UK’s National Crime Agency confirmed it, Quebec’s government confirmed it, and even Hong Kong’s Financial Services and Treasury confirmed it, to list a few.\nIn other words, it might be high time for officials, especially those who are in or currently running for office, regardless of where they are, to do a flat-out fact check before refuting an entire community based on, well, nothing.\nDo you agree with Dave Min’s position on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ usage for human trafficking and drug deals?

A wave of panic selling seems to have washed across crypto land once again and markets have hemorrhaged $27 billion in 24 hours. Bitcoin has plummeted below the psychological $8k barrier and shed 4.6% on the day trading at $7,930 at the moment. Further losses look inevitable. Altcoins as usual have all collapsed, many losing double figures in the last few hours. Only one is in the green in the top 50 at the time of writing and that coin is Zcash.\nCoinmarketcap is reporting a paltry gain of 2.8% on ZEC but it is a gain nevertheless while all around it have crashed. Zcash is currently trading at $330, up from $319 this time yesterday. On the week there have been no gains as this coin was trading at the same level last Wednesday. The monthly picture shows a gain of 22% for ZEC from $270 this time last month. Since Bitcoin has fallen below $8k ZEC is up 8% at 4166700 satoshis from 3855000 sats this time yesterday. Over the month Zcash has gained 35% on BTC from 3075000 satoshis this time last month.\nThe Gemini Exchange support gave this coin its initial boost on May 14 and trading was made available on the 19 th . According to the blog Zcash has invested in Agoric, which is a Javascript based programming layer. Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Zcash said, “This founding team are pioneers of some of the fundamental science of secure programming and distributed systems.

Market cap for ZEC currently stands at $1.3 billion positioning it at 21 st in the charts.\nOverall crypto markets have plunged 6.4% in the past 24 hours to $353 billion, bearish pressure is still strong so further losses are looking likely.

Mining them is 60 per cent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers. Why, then, is Canaan, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $US2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date? Canaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin. “Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public. The offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment. The Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($US56.7 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand. But the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed. Businesses selling mining rigs there said demand – especially for high-end machines – was limping along. Alvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. “Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district. The change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. Bitcoin prices have fallen 40 per cent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $US1,000 in January last year to more than $US19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $US8,400. To some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment. “Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm. Canaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock. However, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens. Fast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 per cent of their 2017 peak at roughly $US17 million per day. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world’s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain. Cryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator’s apparent approval. Bitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market – a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan’s deal. Although the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $US2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $US500 million and $US1 billion. A lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price.

Photo by Thokozile Mnguni ~\nTHE family of abducted teenage boy Katlego Marite is living in hope that he will be brought back home safely.\nThe 13-year-old teen from Extension 3 in Tasbet Park, Emalahleni in Mpumalanga was kidnapped by three unknown men on Sunday afternoon.\nKatlego was playing with other kids not far from his home, when three men travelling in a golden Toyota Corolla stopped next to them.\nOne of the men, dressed in black with a green jacket, allegedly grabbed Katlego and forced him into the vehicle before driving off.\nKatlego’s friends immediately ran to his mum and told her about the incident.\nMum Merriam Marite (55) said they are struggling to sleep not knowing where their son is in this cold weather.\n“We have been waiting patiently for calls or messages, but nothing has come up. This is really frustrating us. I thought by now the kidnappers would have approached us but there has been no word,” she said.\nMerriam said what worries her is that Katlego was not wearing any shoes when he was abducted and the kidnappers’ demands were not within their reach.\nThe kidnappers are alleged to have left a letter demanding that the family pay a ransom of 15 Bitcoins. One bitcoin currently equals about R102 632,52, which brings the ransom to just over R1,5 million.\nThe note also asked the family not to involve the police.\n“They wanted us to have deposited 15 Bitcoins by Monday, but we have no idea what Bitcoins are or where we can get them.”\nKatlego’s sister, Masego Marite (28), said she was trying to be strong for the sake of her parents.\nPolice spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a case of kidnapping was opened.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Captain Africa Nyathi at 071 352 6007 or call the SAPS CrimeStop at 08600 10111.

The previously established $8,100 support level was unable to hold. Over the past seven days, Bitcoin value plunged by nearly 8%. BTC/USD On Long-Term Bearish Trend\nToday’s freefall is a big indication that Bitcoin could be on a long-term bearish trend. As evidence; the six-month moving average has now moved in favor of the bears and forms a bearish crossover with the 10-month moving average. This kind of bearish crossover hasn’t happened since 2014.\nCurrently, BTC/USD must break above a major resistance level at $8,000 to gain any upward momentum. While its support is now set at $7,500, if the bearish trend continues, that level wouldn’t hold for long. On the down side, a movement towards $7,200 later this week might be possible.\nSource: Tradingview\nBoth the MACD and RSI indicators are reaffirming this long-term bearish trend.

Obtaining this much hashpower is incredibly expensive — even on a smaller network like bitcoin gold — but it can be monetized by using it in tandem with a double spend attack.\nAfter gaining control of the network, the attacker began depositing BTG at cryptocurrency exchanges while also attempting to send those same coins to a wallet under their control. Ordinarily, the blockchain would resolve this by including only the first transaction in the block, but the attacker was able to reverse transactions since they had majority control of the network.\nConsequently, they were able to deposit funds on exchanges and quickly withdraw them again, after which they reversed the initial transaction so that they could send the coins they had originally deposited to another wallet. Source: BTG Explorer\nA bitcoin gold address implicated in the attack has received more than 388,200 BTG since May 16 (mostly from transactions it sent to itself). Assuming all of those transactions were associated with the double spend exploit, the attacker could have stolen as much as $18.6 million worth of funds from exchanges.\nThe last transaction was sent on May 18, but the attacker could theoretically attempt to resume it if they still have access to enough hashpower to gain control of the blockchain.\nBitcoin gold’s developers advised exchanges to address the attack by increasing the number of confirmations required before they credit deposits to customer accounts. Blockchain data indicates that the attacker successfully reversed transactions as far back as 22 blocks, leading developers to advise raising confirmation requirements to 50 blocks.\nAt present, bitcoin gold ranks as the 26th-largest cryptocurrency, with a circulating market cap of $827 million.\nBitcoin gold is at least the third cryptocurrency network hit with a major attack in the past week alone.\nAs CCN reported , a miner manipulated two of privacy coin verge’s five hashing algorithms to maliciously mine more than 35 million XVG — worth ~$1.75 million — in just a few hours. Previously, Japanese cryptocurrency monacoin was hit by an apparent block withholding attack after a miner gained as much as 57 percent of the network’s hashrate.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edward iskra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold network", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T18:54:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4256cfee229b3fe5cbe7b612789a331cb4b34442", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzBi7TOcOsriiJILoy2qf8Y-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

The most grievous part of this proposal is that it may also be a retroactive measure, demanding payments for past actions.\nAlso Read: Economics Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller Examines Bitcoin in Historical Context Crypto Sales Tax\nThe Indian Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs is working on a proposal to impose an 18% tax on cryptocurrencies. The proposal will be considered by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council once it will finalized, “people with direct knowledge of the matter” told Bloomberg .\nAccording to the proposal: “Purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies should be considered as supply of goods, and those facilitating transactions like supply, transfer, storage, accounting, among others, will be treated as services; Value of a cryptocurrency may be determined based on the transaction value in rupees or the equivalent of any freely convertible foreign currency; If buyers and sellers are in India, the transaction would be treated as a supply of software and the buyer’s location will be the place of supply. For transfer and sale, the location of the registered person will be the place of supply. However, for sale to non-registered persons, location of the supplier would be considered as the place of supply. Transactions beyond the Indian territory will be liable for integrated GST, and would be considered as import or export of goods. IGST will be levied on cross-border supplies.”\nFurther according to the proposal, mining will be classified as a supply of service and Indian miners will have to pay taxes on any fees and rewards they make. Additionally, cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers and some miners (those making over Rs 20 lakh) will have to register under the GST. Retroactive Tax\nIndia’s GST came into effect on 1st July 2017, replacing many former indirect taxes levied by the central and state governments as a measure to streamline the tax code. The Indian government is now considering that the tax on crypto will be applied retroactively since the start of the GST system, according to the same anonymous sources cited above. The meaning of this is that people will have to pay for actions they took about a year or so before the new policy, assuming it will be decided on in a couple of months.\nIf this tax proposal will be accepted, the retroactive aspect of it is the most likely to be challenged by traders and exchanges in the courts. Indian crypto businesses have already had to turn to the courts in the matter of the ban on banks from dealing with them, a matter that is now being handled by the country’s supreme court .\nIs a retroactive tax on cryptocurrencies really feasible?

ANON coin was developed to address the demand for a cryptocurrency that provides truly anonymous transactions. A list of participating exchanges is expected by August 15, 2018, and the remainder of the BTCA testnet will take place up to the snapshot on September 9, 2018. ANON will officially be available on September 10, 2018 at a 1:1 ratio to holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and ZClassic (ZCL). As it is a co-fork of BTC and ZCL, one must hold BTC or ZCL prior to the fork to acquire ANON. The maximum amount of ANON will be 31.5 million, with 24 million ANON available when the fork occurs. BTCA intends to set ANON apart from other forks by succeeding where previous forks did not. The team cites lack of anonymous transactions, high transactions fees, and lengthy transaction times as some of the failures their coin will circumvent. The ability to anonymously transact draws many to cryptocurrency. BTC, the most prominent cryptocurrency, does not facilitate anonymous transactions. ANON draws from the privacy protocol of ZCL to provide anonymous transactions by using the same MIT-developed zkSNARKs privacy protocol. The zkSNARKs protocol allows for verifiable transactions without requiring interaction between the prover and verifier. As such, transactions are both secure and completely anonymous. While previous forks, like ZCL, have succeeded in providing anonymous transactions, they have fallen short in other ways that deterred widespread market adoption of the currency. The BTCA team includes several crypto and Fintech veterans who have observed other forks and what the crypto community wants to see. Increased block size and incorporation of masternodes are two features the BTCA team integrated into ANON in response to crypto market demand. Developers increased block size to support faster transaction times. Masternodes provide an opportunity for return on investment for holders of a minimum required amount of a particular coin. Through masternodes, holders of ANON can stake the currency. Staking incentivizes holding the coin for extended periods of time. The BTCA team intends that ANON is accessible and appealing to both those who have never used crypto and existing crypto users. As such, a community presence and transparent development are core principles for BTCA. BTCA has a social media presence, through which they communicate with their public. Videos of the forking process, frequent updates, and Q&A events allow anyone to follow the forking process. The team wants to tell their forking story in such a way that those unfamiliar with crypto are interested and informed, thus overcoming what was a challenge for previous forks in terms of effectively connecting with those new to crypto.

GCOX is known to facilitate celebrities to develop their own coins. UK Relatively Friendly to Crypto, But Taking Cautious Approach\nAs bitcoin is receiving overwhelming recognition, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority has tried it’s best to accommodate the advancement of digital currency while simultaneously setting safeguards for investors.\nMartin Walker, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Management, told the Express newspaper, there are “very good public interest grounds for putting in place the most restrictive regulatory regime possible around cryptocurrencies, banning where necessary and possible,” thus making it a questionable issue.\nAccording to Coin ATM Radar , there are 134 bitcoin/crypto ATMs in the United Kingdom, in the lead compared to many other European countries that are riding the crypto wave; only Austria has more ATMs totaling 165. Cryptocurrency ATMs are considered as an uncomplicated way of purchasing digital assets, with the UK is moving at a much faster pace toward the installation of bitcoin ATMs.\nDo crypto ATMs come handy? How widespread will they be in the near future? Let us know your views in the comments section.

As a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin only exists due to its revolutionary blockchain technology which creates a self-contained giant ledger keeping track of all transactions with 100% accuracy and without a third party. In the cryptocurrency economy, Bitcoin Cash has become a highly sought-after digital currency over the past few months and seems to be gaining support and momentum all the time.\nMany people have used the peer-to-peer trading platform Shapeshift to trade Bitcoin (BTC) for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). In the recent past, the Bitcoin Cash network has managed to accumulate a massive amount of support and infrastructure. Features of Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin Cash has a much larger block size (8MB) than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has a different transaction signature as well as wipeout and replay protection. If the hash rate is low, Bitcoin Cash can quickly adjust the difficulty of its proof-of-work. Bitcoin Cash network fees are cheaper than those of most other blockchain networks. Moreover, the BCH network fees seem to be consistent, and they may remain low when the network upgrades to a 32MB block size. Hence, there will be plenty of room for cheap transactions. There is no need for BCH network users to rely on privacy-invasive techniques like transaction batching. Issues with Bitcoin’s Technology\nCompared to banks and credit card transactions, Bitcoin’s technology is said to be very slow, as it can process only seven transactions each second. Over 150 million transactions are handled by Visa every day, which is roughly equivalent to 1,700 transactions per second.\nBitcoin needs to scale and increase the speed of its transaction verification process, which is considered a central problem. There’s a solution to this problem. Either the amount of data verified in each block should be made smaller, or the blocks of data should be made larger. Transactions would thus be made cheaper and faster, and more transactions would be processed at one time. Differing Transaction fees\nBitcoin’s transaction capacity is limited by its high fees, as a user’s transaction won’t be processed until he or she pays for it to go through. Otherwise, the transaction may get stuck for months, which is nothing short of frustrating for all parties involved.\nIn the case of Bitcoin Cash, this unbearable situation is not present. There’s plenty of space in the blocks, which assures that transaction fees are always low and there’s no chance of users’ digital assets being in limbo for long periods of time.\nBitcoin Cash has a long way to go before overtaking Bitcoin, but it’s well on its way. When and if it ever does, it will likely lose its stigma as a fork and be considered the real Bitcoin. Perhaps one day it might even be referred to as just cash.

Services such as Ripple believe they are the future for services such as SWIFT, however, until Ripple can give people a reason to stop using SWIFT, it seems that the traditional FIAT transfer system will continue to rule.\nAccording to new reports out this week, a bank in Argentina has started to use Bitcoin as an alternative method for cross-border money transfer, over SWIFT, the service used previously.\nBanco Masventas are an Argentina based banking company, though they are by no means the biggest in Argentina or South America, this move towards cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin is very significant indeed. The transfers have used Bitex in order to facilitate the payments, this in turn has allowed customers of Banco Masventas to transfer money in Bitcoin.\nWhat are the benefits to this?\nWell as we know, cryptocurrencies can increase transaction times and can of course hold reduced transaction fees due to differing exchange rates etc. Overall though, Bitcoin is notoriously not the fastest nor the cheapest currency to use, therefore it’s quite interesting that Banco Masventas have gone down this route.\nAccording to José Humerbto Dakak, a shareholder of Banco Masventas:\n“One of the initiatives is to use Bitex as a strategic partner to provide our overseas customers with payment and collection services at the Bitex Exchange.”\nClearly, Banco Masventas recognise that cryptocurrency can have great implications for international money transfer services and solutions. Overall it does seem that with this move, Banco Masventas aim to improve their service to their customers, but also intend to really begin to explore the inherent advantages of blockchain technologies. As I have mentioned, Bitcoin is an interesting choice for this service, although I believe this is simply down to a combination of Bitcoins popularity and of course, a limit to the services provided by Bitex.\nAs a result of this, we might expect the likes of Ripple to start to gain some enhanced attention within Argentina, by both Banco Masventas and other financial service providers, assuming this new system integrating Bitex works well.\nThis is an exciting step towards cryptocurrency adoption and will provide a wealth of customers new opportunities to use Bitcoin, in a practical way, through this, more investment opportunities will appear and overall, the popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Argentina may spike.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is also at its one-month low with $352 billion changing hands.\nIn fact, nearly all of the top 100 assets by market cap are showing 10 to 20 percent declines at press time.

Hanyecz sent his hoarded cryptocurrency to a fellow “bitcoiner,” who then placed the order.\nThe price of bitcoin has spiked just a tad since then. If Hanyecz had kept those 10,000 bitcoins, they’d be worth $82 million or so—an amount Bloomberg has figured out would buy about 6.5 million pizzas.\n“If you stacked the pizza boxes you can get for that many bitcoins today, they’d rise to outer space,” it notes.\nIf you’re going by the slice for those original two pizzas, each portion would be worth about $5 million today.\nHanyecz, now 36, is celebrating this eight-year milestone in “the perfect way,” per Forbes : by cajoling his employer, an online apparel and gear startup, to start accepting bitcoin.\nMore From Newser Cops: Man Excused Self From Table, Drove Car Into Family ‘Something Was Wrong With This Cougar’: Attack Details Released 4 Words on NJ School’s Prom Tickets Cause Problem ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T14:35:35.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2d14c1193e3aff43f916de547b8d6f605613093", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1179vjqJy8MHB.CVmlppFk-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2d14c1193e3aff43f916de547b8d6f605613093", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1179vjqJy8MHB.CVmlppFk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite new users and get 0.3 BTC!

That deal, in which a private company absorbs most of a public one, gives smaller Canadian producers access to capital. For U.S. businesses, it offers an avenue to a fully legal market.\nX\nThere's just one problem: As cannabis and blockchain businesses race for cash in Canada, observers see signs of a thinning supply of public companies, free of legal baggage and liabilities, that could be used easily as vehicles for prospective owners.\n\"The cannabis companies are competing with crypto for those shell companies,\" said Alex Coleman, CEO of cannabis company TILT Holdings, which announced a four-way merger last week.\nMany of Canada's so-called shell companies are mining stocks in name only but are dormant operationally. Some shell companies were swept up and dropped during acquisitions past, and now linger on as stock market leftovers.\nOr, they exist solely to be lapped up via a reverse takeover. Industry players talk about the difficulty of finding so-called \"clean shells,\" or companies not saddled with liability.\nBut amid the rush of blockchain and marijuana companies to scoop them up, the remaining \"clean\" shell companies find themselves with greater influence.\n\"There's certainly been more leverage being put into the hands of some of these shell companies, particularly for U.S. cannabis businesses,\" said Jonathan Sherman, an associate at Cassels Brock, a law firm that advises on the marijuana industry.\nCassels Brock, in a recent report, said frequent use of shell companies for reverse takeovers had led to a \"shortage.\" Demand, it said, has spiked. The available shell companies thus have greater ability to negotiate better, higher-priced deals for themselves.\nThose deals are increasingly important to marijuana companies in the U.S., which still prohibits pot on a federal level.\nU.S.-based marijuana cultivator and retailer MedMen plans to go public in Canada via such a deal. That expansion will be aided by its joint-venture agreement with Canadian pot producer Cronos Group ( CRON ). Green Thumb Industries, based in Chicago, announced plans to go public in Canada via a reverse takeover.\nIBD Newsletters Get exclusive IBD analysis and action news daily. SIGN UP NOW!

Please contact customer service CLOSE Marijuana-RTO Speedwagon To be sure, marijuana companies still have the option of going public via an initial public offering.\nBut more cannabis companies are using reverse takeovers with the hopes of drawing less heat from regulators. However, experts debate whether those deals are faster than traditional IPOs.\nIn an RTO, a private company's shareholders receive enough shares of a public company to become majority owners of the public company. The public company often takes on the name and operations of the private one doing the acquiring.\nBut financial disclosures can get complicated with a reverse takeover, the Cassels Brock report said. Investors generally regard IPOs as being more upfront.\nA marijuana company seeking to go public also has to appease shareholders of the public company it's acquiring. Increasingly, that means the private company's shareholders get a smaller piece of the pie once the deal closes.\n\"Because the shell company generally has existing shareholders which become shareholders of the post-RTO public company, the existing shareholders of the operating company acquiring the shell have their overall stake in the company reduced to accommodate the shareholders of the shell,\" Cam Mingay, a securities lawyer at Cassels Brock, said in an email.\nThe firm says shareholders of the company acquiring the shell have had their ownership into the post-RTO company reduced by as much as 13% in some recent deals. That figure compares to 3% historically, the firm said.\nMining For Marijuana The marijuana industry's scramble to reverse-takeover its way onto Canadian exchanges has resulted in some unlikely tie-ups — particularly with idled mining companies that are still publicly listed.\n\"Resuscitated junior mining companies have inherent value for cannabis investment because they are already publicly listed, and do not have to undergo a full securities commission review or file a prospectus in order to access public money,\" Canna Law Group, a law firm that supports marijuana businesses, said in a blog post in March.\n\"They are perfect vehicles to raise money quickly,\" the post continued. \"As such, many new entrants go public via a reverse takeover and use the old mining company (or oil and gas company) shell as the listing vehicle.\"\n'Very Challenging' Coleman, of TILT Holdings, said it's \"very challenging\" today to find a shell company without a lot of baggage.\nThe four-way merger set to become TILT is made up of three U.S. companies and one in Canada. The one in Canada, Sante Veritas Holdings was formerly known as Marchwell Ventures, once an online marketing company.\nMarchwell changed its name to Sante Veritas Holdings after it agreed to a reverse takeover by a company called Sante Veritas Therapeutics, a move intended to create a marijuana company. The closing of that deal was announced on April 25.\nMarchwell and Sante Veritas Therapeutics first announced that they wanted to combine late last year. But Coleman said finding the right shell company wasn't as difficult in the run-up to the deal.\n\"To find a clean shell company that you could successfully merge into was much easier when Sante Veritas got involved,\" he said.\nShift To IPOs? More Canadian cannabis companies could go public via a more traditional IPO when recreational legalization takes hold this year. But whether IPOs become more popular depends on whether Canada's chartered banks get more involved, Sherman said.\n\"Real IPOs are quite rare in the cannabis space in Canada (or the U.S.),\" Alan Brochstein, a partner at New Cannabis Ventures, a cannabis news and information site focused on the industry, said over email. He said there were more than a dozen Canadian-listed companies focused on the U.S.\nFor U.S. marijuana companies, Sherman said, reverse takeovers will likely remain the preferred route to public trading. But he said they'll have each other to learn from.\n\"There's a structure that's put in place that somebody can look to and follow the same path, for instance, as MedMen is currently doing, and virtually copy the path that that company has already taken,\" Sherman said.\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:\nWill Marijuana Industry Overtake Beer As Legalization Spurs Innovation?\nCould Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?\nThis CEO Calls For 'States' Rights' On Marijuana Industry\nRelated news MedMen Eyes Marijuana Delivery, U.S. Expansion As Sales Jump 760% 2:34 PM ET MedMen wants to offer weed delivery and in-store pickup this year and is \"actively seeking\" ways to expand in the...\n2:34 PM ET MedMen wants to offer weed delivery and in-store pickup this...\nMarijuana Stocks: MedMen, The Apple Store For Weed, Is Now Public Will Marijuana Industry Overtake Beer As Legalization Spurs Innovation?

Argentine Bank Using Bitcoin for Cross-border Transactions CoinNinja | May 23rd, 2018\nA big step has been taken by a bank in Argentina, who has decided to bridge the gap of using Bitcoin to help with their traditional, fiat banking. Banco Masventas will start using Bitcoin as a means for transferring customer payments, across the border. Banco Masventas has struck a partnership with the fellow Argentine company, Bitex , with a goal to lower costs on international transfers for customers.\nBitex is a fintech company, focusing on providing blockchain-based money transmissions via local currency, available between 50 different countries. The company uses Bitcoin as means to transmit the fiat payments internationally, in lieu of the more commonly used SWIFT banking transmissions. SWIFT (Society for Woldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) has taken some heat in recent years; an article cites that cyber criminals are now, “more skilled, well-funded, and determined than ever, and the internet has made even the most obscure systems transparent.” While this is not the given reason for the partnership between Banco Masventas and Bitex, the fact that the use of blockchain adds both decentralized security and lowers cost of transactions are presumably indicating reasons.\nCoindesk has reported that Jose Dakak, Banco Masventas’ principal shareholder, that the decision stemmed from desire to enhance the bank’s digital, smartphone-based services, in addition to lowering the bank’s cost of service. Banco Masventa’s explains on their website :\nAs this service just began yesterday, May 22, no actual cross-border transactions have yet been initiated. However, Bitex’s CMO, Manuel Beaudroit explained further to Coindesk about how the service will work:\n“The customers will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the bank uses Bitex as a provider. For the customer, it’s transparent, they don’t touch, they don’t see the bitcoin. We are a provider for them, and they are not touching bitcoin.”\nBeaudroit also made sure to state that this hybridization of traditional banking and the use of Bitcoin and the blockchain will mark the first time that the two systems will have come together for cross-border payments. While many enjoy the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies because of the potential to eliminate the use of banks, we can’t help but see it a positive that even banks, especially smaller ones like Banco Masventas, are also moving away from the middlemen, in favor of faster, cheaper, secure money transmissions.

This was the first purchase with bitcoins - Archyworldys", "text": "by archyworld May 23, 2018\nThis Tuesday is celebrated eight years of the first purchase made with bitcoins : two pizzas for 10 thousand digital currencies. Today, with that same amount of bitcoins you could buy a row of pizzas that would reach the outer space if they were piled one on top of the other. At the price of this Tuesday, 8 thousand 200 dollars per bitcoin, could be bought around 6.5 million pizzas of $ 12.50 each . If those pizza boxes were stacked, they would reach almost 200 miles (321 kilometers) in height, according to data from Forex Time, a currency broker. Its animated infographic marks the milestones traveled by the boxes – the Burj Khalifa of Dubai, Mount Everest, a passenger plane – and then arrive in space. Bitcoin will not reach the Moon, but it would be close. The developer who made the first purchase, Laszlo Hanyecz, became a legend in the space of cryptocurrencies and beyond. He will forever be known as the man who squandered a number of assets that are now valued at more than $ 82 million, on pizza. Earlier this year, Hanyecz replicated his maneuver using Lightning Network, a technology that runs parallel to the bitcoin blockchain and aims to accelerate transactions. Bitcoin Pizza Day It has become a reminder of how much the price of the currency has soared, even after falling from its record high of almost 20 thousand last year. The most important cryptocurrency was worth only a few cents at the time of the first purchase of pizza.

The U.S. agencies may define digital currency owners as a ‘security risk’ in order to protect foreign and domestic classified information.\nAlso read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards If You Own Bitcoin and Have U.S. Security Clearance Then You Might Have a Problem\nAmerican bureaucrats are deliberating on whether or not they should flag cryptocurrency investors who have special security clearances to classified government information. An individual who owns a cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum, may be considered “risky” in the eyes of the Pentagon. This past February the Defense Security Service (DSS) and the Pentagon revealed they were working on guidelines for reporting cryptocurrency ownership. According to another report published on May 22, the debate is currently being argued and government contractors are already upset about the backlog of other security clearance issues.\nA director for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, Param Vir Singh, believes cryptocurrencies do have security risks.\n“There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,” explained Param Vir Singh this week.\nThink about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well. DSS Recommends Cryptocurrency Owners With Security Clearance Should Report Their Virtual Currency Holdings\nFurther, the columnist Adam Reese recently reviewed an email by a DSS employee named Chad M. Campbell — which indicates that the security specialist recommends individuals who apply for U.S. security clearance need to report their cryptocurrency holdings on the agency’s Standard Form 86 (SF86). Additionally, the reporter received a reply from Defense Security Service Public Affairs which stated:\n“DSS has fielded a number of questions from industry as to whether ownership of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be reported by cleared persons or security clearance applicants,” explains the Defense Department.\nThere is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies. DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry. Additionally, the email [Campbell’s email] was an internal discussion document which was not intended to serve as policy guidance. University of California Researcher: ‘Bitcoin Owners Deserve Suspicion’\nIndividuals and organizations see the security clearance/cryptocurrency discussion as a controversial subject as opinions differ depending on who is discussing the matter. Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists believes holding cryptocurrencies or other behaviors don’t necessarily make a person risky. “I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk — Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk,” Aftergood explains.\nHowever, a researcher at the University of California, Nicholas Weaver, disagrees and thinks digital currency holders should be suspects. “Since Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,” Weaver said this week. It’s also worth noting that some of these DSS and Pentagon officials who firmly believe cryptocurrencies are a ‘security risk’ have no problem with defense contractors who shill centralized blockchains. The DSS is not calling blockchain projects sponsored by Booze Hamilton Allen or the company’s employees suspicious — Nope just bitcoin and public blockchains seem to be a threat at the moment.\nWhat do you think about the DSS and Pentagon’s discussion about bitcoin classification and raising suspicion against cryptocurrency owners?

The last communication his family had received from the kidnappers was a ransom note. According to reports in The Guardian , it read:\n“This is a kidnapping … We demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child’s safe release – non-negotiable.”\nAlso in the note, threats were made against the boy’s life. The first deadline for the payment of the ransom was on Monday evening. According to a police official, the parent’s were understandably distressed by the whole ordeal. He said:\n“They don’t even know what this bitcoin is. They’re devastated and you can see they’re worried and asking themselves: ‘Where’s our son?”\nCCTV footage from a neighbouring property shows the boy being forced into a silver Toyota Corolla which promptly left the scene. Authorities and the boy’s family were alerted by one of his mother’s colleagues. The unnamed co-worker of Miriam Marite had gone in search of the car after seeing the private security footage. After he saw a similar car outside a local bar and reported it police were able to detain three men in connection with the kidnapping.\nLocal media outlet TimesLIVE report that no suspects have been arrested or charged as of yet. According to Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, taking suspects in did not mean that they would be charged. The three were merely being detained for questioning at present.\nThe publication also stated that it was still unknown if the three suspects were continuing to be held by police or if they had simply been questioned and then released.\nThe kidnapping of Katlego Marite isn’t the first example of such a ransom being made in Bitcoin. Last year, we reported on the case of EXMO Exchange employee Pavel Lerner being taken from outside his office in Kiev. He was freed three days later after the million dollars worth of Bitcoin was paid to the kidnappers. There has been no report yet to indicate that those responsible have since been arrested.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down by more than 7% over the last 24 hours, and is actually the best-performing of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies. Six of the top 10 are down by double digits, and only three of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are positive on Wednesday.

Prices and daily changes as of May 23, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. EDT, and prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate.\nWhy are cryptocurrencies plunging? There are a few possible negative catalysts. For example, some of the hype surrounding the well-publicized \"Blockchain Week\" in New York City may have bolstered prices, and now that it's over, we could be seeing lower investor interest.\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst driving down cryptocurrency prices is regulatory fears.\nFears of increased global regulation have been the culprit in several big cryptocurrency sell-offs this year. The South Korean cryptocurrency saga in particular caused quite a bit of volatility.\nThis time, it's closer to home. On Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announced \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which is being led by the North American Securities Administrators Association and has more than 40 states and provinces participating.\nTo be clear, the crackdown is focused on cryptocurrency investment schemes, particularly initial coin offerings, or ICOs. It is not targeting major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) or legitimate businesses such as cryptocurrency exchanges. Even so, it seems to have the market on edge.\nThis comes on the heels of increased cryptocurrency scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), whose chairman has issued strongly worded warnings to cryptocurrency and ICO investors in recent months.\nA good thing? As I've written before, cryptocurrency regulation isn't necessarily a bad thing . Rather, it is the uncertainty surrounding regulation that drives the market crazy.\nRegulation could be a good thing over the long term for cryptocurrencies. A regulated market would likely attract more institutional investors, and I don't think any legitimate cryptocurrency believer thinks that getting rid of scams is a bad thing for the industry. And, the implementation of global cryptocurrency regulation could help provide much-needed stability to the market, which could solve one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption -- volatility.\nIn the meantime, however, it remains to be seen whether the current sell-off is nearing its end or if investor jitters will continue to send cryptocurrencies downward.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/state-regulators-crack-down-on-cryptocurrency-investment-schemes.html", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/23/bitcoin-drops-9-percent-now-back-below-8000.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T05:21:00.067+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "32957658eb7d60fba7a9fa4d4703a82b64d4ca74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf35OlO27O88ebu_8OyZMha33OeMkmKJgnygoNKMDUqdtG_WztVxS55Rh3hoVI53xbHSjJBHGaujDtnXgvPDr59Es-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "120 Million Dollars Per Day Flowing Into Bitcoin , 250 Million for all Crypto : Bitcoin", "title_full": "120 Million Dollars Per Day Flowing Into Bitcoin , 250 Million for all Crypto : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.redditstatic.com/icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32957658eb7d60fba7a9fa4d4703a82b64d4ca74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf35OlO27O88ebu_8OyZMha33OeMkmKJgnygoNKMDUqdtG_WztVxS55Rh3hoVI53xbHSjJBHGaujDtnXgvPDr59Es-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deleted", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "120 Million Dollars Per Day Flowing Into Bitcoin , 250 Million for all Crypto : Bitcoin", "text": "by olesentv\nLocal Bitcoins volume has quadrupled since this time last year. It is presently at about 400 million per month worldwide or about 12-13 million per day. LocalBitcoins purchases should be looked at as especially bullish for the price of Bitcoin because of the premium that buyers are willing to pay to be able to get ahold of BTC. It means that they are almost exclusively hodler's or users of Bitcoin and that type of capital has the lowest turnover. Low turnover matters because every single day about 90 percent of the money coming from local bitcoins is new money that is adding to the demand for coin and is unlikely to sell for a long time. That eventually eats away at supply slowly but surely.\nCoinbase is the retail level of bitcoin purchasing. During December of last year Coinbase had 400 million dollars in trading revenue. So if you put their average fee at about 2 percent of a trade, means about 20 billion dollars in btc. was traded in that one month alone. Since December Coinbase has increased the number of support people by 500 people. The number of new users to the site is approaching 30 million. Which is about 66 percent higher than in December. The ratio of buyers to sellers on Coinbase is 80/20 and the average purchase of a buyer is $428 dollars. What matters to the bull case of bitcoin are people that are buying Bitcoin as an investment and who aren't instantly trading it when the price moves up. If GDAX does 300 million in volume per day and that includes Coinbase volume in that number, than it's fair to say that about 50 million per day is being added to long term positions per day.\nThe exchanges have a lot of new customers around the world. Combined they are doing about 5 billion per day in volume on btc. in total. What percentage of that are new buyers that aren't trading? If that number is 1 percent which I think it's reasonable that's another 50 million per day of investment level longs that are happening.\nBitcoin ATMS are confirmed at 3 million dollars per day new money with 90 percent one way invested. Over 3k ATMS now.\nThe Square cash app just added Bitcoin trading last quarter and that number adds up to about 300k per day and it's only available so far in 5-6 states.\nRobinhood had a waiting list with over 1 million people on it to be able to trade crypto. They have 4 million registered users.\nThere was recently an article that said that OTC demand was coming in at about 100 million dollars per day for large traders. If all OTC demand is taken into consideration it's probably closer to 200 million. I'm including trades between friends, family, and other trusted people. I think that at least 5 percent of that trading would be net long. So that's at least another 10 million per day.\nBitcoin.org wallets are growing at about 15k new wallets per day and about 26 million overall.\nCircle says that it's doing about 2 billion a month in crypto volume.\nIn a growing market the law of large numbers starts to work in bulls favor. Because if it's true for instance that 5 percent buy with intention to hold for x number of years regardless of price the total number of those types of trades increases as the size of the addressable market grows. So traders have to trade above a floor that keeps moving up.\nBears lose when the price decreases because even though new user interest is lower during price lulls the total growth doesn't go away and the amount of coin that buyers can get for every dollar of fiat increases. In a increasing market FOMO kicks in and user registrations sky rocket because of all of the media attention that the price increase generates.\nBears, sellers, and short-sellers are making the new money the \"smart money\" by giving them a deal that is almost certain.\nThink about it differently. Let's say all of a sudden by magic there were 1 billion owners or potential owners of bitcoin. It doesn't matter if they are all about to sell it. What matters is that they are involved in the market. Involvement means that they all want to own the most bitcoin that they can for the best possible price. How much effort they are willing to put into that goal influences the short term price. But the overall amount of involvement in the market is something that they cannot control. They might have very strict conditions about when they are willing to buy bitcoin. But because a certain percentage of people in the market will purchase bitcoin as a store of value for their fiat currency regardless of price, those people in total can cause the overall price to outpace what a picky trader would be willing to pay. When there is limited supply and an increasing number of participants those traders will eventually be forced to accept the conditions or stop trading at all. This dynamic is similar to forex markets. The liquidity of the underlying currency is so high that the value becomes extremely predictable. Even major news cannot harm liquidity if it exists. The liquidity determines the price not the event.\nIf 16-17 million bitcoins had to be divided among a group of 1 billion people because they had made involvement with crypto an economic decision in their life, consumer behavior would be the first layer that would determine the overall value. The first factor would be how much can each of them really own at this exact same price, to determine if the price will be higher when the market reaches 1 billion users. About 160 dollars worth each. But that number doesn't jibe if you have people like the Winklevosses that own 1 percent of all bitcoin. It also doesn't work if the average first purchase of a bitcoin buyer is over 400 dollars. And that's just the first purchase.\nBefore the market cap can reflect the instrinic value of Bitcoin the market growth has to stop. New money has to stop being added to the market. It may be true that based on transaction volume alone that bitcoin \"should\" be worth 10k or whatever number. But there is way more to the use case for Bitcoin than just that one purpose.\nGold has pretty limited uses as well but it's worth 7 trillion dollars because of the size of the market and not necessarily its usefulness.\nBitcoin will reach that same \"irrational\" result as long as new people keep pouring money into the system. Bitcoin at 5-10 trillion is not just likely it's mathematically inevitable at this rate of growth.

BCH/USD could still slip further later in the day, where the downside could take its price toward $950 later this week. On the upside, a retest of the $1,000 level may still be possible.\nAt the moment, Bitcoin Cash is holding a major resistance level around $1,080, while its support is at $960.

Exploiting ‘Invisible’ Features\nIn a series of tweets on May 21st, Rosenfeld added to the “cargo cult” narrative which first appeared at the Consensus 2018 conference last week. Rosenfeld began:\nThe reason ‘Blockchain’ is so susceptible to cargo cult mentality is that the fundamental features that make it what it is are, in a sense, invisible, and inseparable from how the technology works. 1/10 The reason “Blockchain” is so susceptible to cargo cult mentality is that the fundamental features that make it what it is are, in a sense, invisible, and inseparable from how the technology works.\n— Meni Rosenfeld (@MeniRosenfeld) May 21, 2018\nCriticism of products and services claiming to use blockchain has returned to the cryptocurrency industry after Consensus gained criticism from some of Bitcoin’s best-known names.\nStemming from a heated panel featuring a JPMorgan executive and Bitcoin educator Jimmy Song, Song led straight-talking appraisals of the executive’s newly-unveiled blockchain tool, telling the audience he had heard “nothing but buzzwords.”\nOn social media thereafter, as Bitcoinist reported , Bitcoin core developer Johnathan Corgan called time on blockchain becoming a fresh example of “cargo cult engineering” – the belief innovation will generate prosperity by definition. Corgan warned:\nUnrestrained incantation of buzzwords and feel good hype does not a successful business plan make. Consumers Will Suffer Only When It’s Too Late\nMeni’s comments appear to incorporate not only dubious business proposals incorporating blockchain technology without use cases, but also spin-offs of Bitcoin itself, using its blockchain to create a new product, the downsides of which can only be understood with proper knowledge of “how, why, and when blockchains work.”\nWhile not naming specific examples, the allusion appears to be to the controversial Bitcoin Cash hard fork . Meni Rosenfeld continued:\nEven without using any of Bitcoin’s innovation, I can create a system that, to the end user, will appear indistinguishable from Bitcoin – greatly outperform it, in fact.\nIt will allow receiving tokens and sending to anyone, easily and quickly, with little to no fees.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. South African schoolboy Katlego Marite, 13, was snatched by a gang in the eastern province of Mpumalanga on Sunday. The kidnappers are demanding a ransom be paid in bitcoin. Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) A group of South African kidnappers who snatched a 13-year-old boy as he played with friends have demanded a $120,000 ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency, police say. Police say Katlego Marite was taken by three men in a car as he played with two friends near his home in the eastern province of Mpumalanga. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told CNN the incident in the coal-mining city of Witbank was over in minutes and the abductors seemed to make a beeline for Marite. Hackers hold hotel's keys hostage for bitcoin ransom \"It happened very fast and there was no struggle,\" Hlathi told CNN. \"His friends reported that these were full grown men who just went for him and grabbed him into the car and dropped a ransom note. They demanded that his parents should pay a ransom in bitcoins.\" Read More Hlathi said the sum demanded was 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash. A copy of the ransom note was also posted on several social media accounts. The kidnappers warn the parents not to involve the police, saying: \"We have your child. Your child will not be harmed if the following demands are met.\" The note asks the boy's family to pay 1 bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27. The family has yet to pay any of the ransom, Hlathi said. Bitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets. The ransom note also included information about a wallet to which to send the payment. Plz help find Katlego Marite aged 13.He was kidnapped Sunday, around 15h00 in Tasbet Park Ex1,Witbank, Mpumalanga, by a silver/Grey Toyota Corolla around my friends house well known to most as \"Nkandla\". Kindly call 0607388298 — B Suarez 🥂🥂🥂 (@Bonny_suarez) May 22, 2018 Hlathi said the case was puzzling as Marite's parents are not wealthy and do not know what bitcoin currency is. \"They are just in tatters right now,\" he said.
