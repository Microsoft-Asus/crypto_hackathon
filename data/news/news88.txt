It’s only been around for nine years. But we wanted to take a look at just how much investment returns have been moving around if you’ve been in Bitcoin.\nWe took a look at short, medium and the longer term, and yes, it was at $10.00 at one point and it got near $20,000 at one point. Now we’re back down to where we once were, about $7,500 – $8,000. If you got in, say three years ago, back in June of 2015, Bitcoin was around $450 a token. That’s in 3 years. So even with the market moves to the downside over the last couple of months in early of 2018, you still have a $10,000 investment at the time worth $170,000 as of yesterday.\nWe want to then contrast it to the stock market, not because we think they’re comparable in terms of investment or risk or anything else but because other people choose the stock market as a way to invest in anything. Over three years, if you bought the S&P Vanguard ETF, undividend adjusted, just price appreciation, that $10,000 is worth $13,700. That’s pretty good, considering the stock market. We just want to put the context behind the moves we’ve seen.\nIt also calls into question whether or not you’ve held Bitcoin for a long, long time and whether or not you’re still in it. Because if you watch at the highs, that $10,000 at one point was worth 3/4 of a million dollars and it’s now down to $170,000.\nHere are some of the statistics of investments made in Bitcoin today:\nThere’s a total market value is roughly $350 billion. There are about 20 million Bitcoin wallets with a balance greater than $1. Here’s the breakdown of the worlds Bitcoin wealth by dollar and number of wallets: Greater Than 1 USD – 15,505,866 wallets Greater Than 100 USD – 5,169,332 wallets Greater Than 1,000 USD – 2,032,325 wallets Greater Than 10,000 USD – 510,362 wallets Greater Than 100,000 USD – 120,593 wallets Greater Than 1,000,000 USD – 10,919 wallets Greater Than 10,000,000 USD – 1,054 wallets\nBitcoin wallets that are worth $1 million or more own 20% of the entire Bitcoin network. Wallets worth $10 million to $100 million own 38%. And wealthiest individuals that hold $100 million or more own roughly 12% of the worlds Bitcoin wealth.\nPlenty of early Bitcoin investors are holding onto their investment. With plenty of new investors coming into the space each day, Bitcoin is still poised to be a great investment opportunity , especially in comparison to traditional options out there.

Bitcoin is the Napster of Crypto\nAs reported by Techcrunch a four-person panel at the Recode Code Conference including Brad Garinghouse gathered to discuss what the role of regulation around blockchain and cryptocurrency will be and when it will happen. Kathryn Haun, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and board member at Coinbase and HackerOne, took the position that there are parallels between where cryptocurrency is today and the internet in its early stages.\nHuan pointed out that in the early days of the internet there were calls for a single regulator which is happening with crypto now and that if regulations had been developed last year they would already be outdated due to the rise of initial coin offerings (ICO). “ We don’t want regulation to outpace understanding, ” she said.\nIt was Ripple CEO Brad Garinghouse though who grabbed headlines when he described Bitcoin as an idea that has already been passed on by technology. He called Bitcoin transformative and gave it credit for launching the cryptocurrency revolution but that it will probably end up becoming the Napster of cryptocurrency.\n“We may come to find that bitcoin is kind of the Napster of digital assets, this is transformative technology, but Spotify and iTunes and Pandora rule the day because they engaged with regulators to solve a real problem,” Garlinghouse said referring to regulatory problems that countries around the world are still struggling with when it comes to classifying what Bitcoin is. All Cryptocurrency is Bad Currency\nGarlinghouse went on to criticize the utility of Bitcoin as a currency. He pointed out that slow transaction times and high fees make Bitcoin impossible as a replacement for fiat currency. He told the audience,\n“People talk about using bitcoin to buy coffee, The average bitcoin transaction can take as much as 20 minutes. And the transaction cost is going to double the price of your coffee.”\nThese aren’t new opinions for Garlinghouse who in the past has called all cryptocurrency “bad currency” for their lack of utility, using a similar example at the time he said “I don’t call this cryptocurrency… It’s not currency. I can’t go to Starbucks or Amazon and use—”. Garlinghouse concluded by saying that digital currency only has value if they either solve a problem in the business world or improve their utility to solve consumer problems.

Bittrex is working with New York-based Signature Bank, which will hold the dollar-denominated funds, along with other financial firms.\n“It’s been a long path,” Bittrex Chief Executive Officer Bill Shihara said in an interview. “It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.”\nLarger financial institutions, bound to strict government regulations on money laundering and customer verification, have mostly avoided putting their reputations at risk by getting involved with an industry that many still associate with criminal activity. As a result, some virtual-currency marketplaces are “crypto-to-crypto” only, meaning that they allow customers to trade using digital money, not dollars.\nSome banks are coming around. Coinbase, one of the biggest U.S. crypto trading venues, has developed relationships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the U.S., and recently secured a Barclays PLC bank account in the U.K. Noble Bank International, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, took over banking duties for Bitfinex last year after the exchange was dumped by Wells Fargo & Co., three people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.\n“They really do look and pore through the entire business,” Shihara said. “They want to make sure that we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes, that we’ve got the right controls on our finances.

Later the identical day that the Bank of all Montreal declared it had had its security breached by hackers who’d gotten the private information of 50,000 clients. In both instances, it appears that the hackers were the tipsters that allow the banks know more about the crime. In each suggestion, evidence of this hack has been given in the kind of titles with account numbers and dates of arrival and SIN numbers. The motivation, in this scenario, was blackmail since the hackers needed a thousand bucks worth of their electronic money XRP. Country director for Canada in cyber defence company Darktrace David Masson stated the blackhats accountable were likely the exact same in both circumstances. He supposes the hackers used what’s called a “spear phising” attack. Netizens on Twitter reacted to this information by Tweeting which Canadian banks are weak on security, requiring only 5 digit hooks with no particular characters rather than supplying two-layer authentication. As using electronic money grows more widespread all over the planet cases of hackers and cybercriminals targeting week safety points will continue growing. Users of electronic currency may be more safety conscious as a result of technologies involved with trading but there’s been an estimated $1.2 billion discharged in cryptocurrency because 2017. As was shown from the Coincheck hack January when about a half a billion bucks worth of XEM tokens were stolen by the foreign exchange financial institutions don’t have the very best security. Digital wallets utilize authentication, tracking, and data encryption to safeguard private information and therefore are considered by safety specialists even safer than online banking since a mobiles OS utilizes “sandboxing architecture” to isolate programs out of malware. Just as importantly employing an electronic wallet permits the user to produce their own security protocols. By utilizing smartphone built-in safety functions such as fingerprint authentification or routine solving and including two-factor authentification a mobiles chilly pocket function could be more protected than a market in which human error is obviously a variable. Adding common sense techniques such as not using people wifi for monetary transactions and constantly protecting private information online might make the wallet hack evidence.

31/05/18 $LTC Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 31/05/18 $LTC Bitcoin Cash Getting Bullish\nBitcoin Cash slipped by just 0.62% to $982.2 on Wednesday, consolidating Tuesday’s 12.02% recovery.\nIt was a positive start to the day for Bitcoin Cash, rising to an intraday high $1,029 in the early hours, with a relatively range bound morning leaving the day’s first major resistance level at $1,040.43 and the day’s first major support level at $901.53 untested off the back of a start of the day $977 low.\nA mid-day sell-off saw Bitcoin Cash slide to an intraday low $947.6 before recovering to the day’s ending $982.2, setting Bitcoin Cash up for a positive start to the day, while the failure to test key resistance levels and hold well off the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,100 left the bearish trend intact.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was up 2.54% to $1,007.6, recovering from an early $970.3 dip to a morning high $1,016.7 before easing back to current levels.\nWhile the morning low held well above the day’s first major support level at $943.53, the $1,016.7 high came within reach of the first major resistance level at $1,024.93, the upward momentum continuing from Wednesday’s late afternoon recovery.\nFor the day ahead, the bulls will be eying the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,100, though Bitcoin Cash will need to hold on to $1,000 levels through the morning and breakout through the day’s first major resistance level a $1,024.93 to convince side lined investors to jump back in.\nFailing to break through $1,020 to take a run at the day’s second major resistance level at $1,067.67 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,100 could see Bitcoin Cash go into reverse following Wednesday’s mixed day, with the news wires also needing to be considered through the day.\nFor now, Bitcoin Cash looks to have weathered the storm, supported by the positive news out of South Korea, though other jurisdictions have yet to show their cards, which continues to pose a threat to sentiment and current levels.\nGet Into Bitcoin Cash Trading Today Litecoin on the move\nLitecoin slipped by 1.98% on Wednesday, partially reversing Tuesday’s 7.43% gain, to end the day at $117.17.\nFollowing the market trend through much of the day, a range bound morning saw Litecoin’s morning and intraday high $122.86 fall short of the day’s first major resistance level at $124.8, with a start of the day dip to $118.52 seeing Litecoin hold off from testing the day’s first major support level at $112.1 and from striking yet another swing lo.\nA lack of momentum through the morning saw Litecoin slide to an intraday low $115 in the early afternoon, avoiding the day’s first major support level at $112.1 to recover to $117 levels by the day’s end.\nFailing to test the day’s first major resistance level and end the day well short of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $127 reaffirmed the extended bearish trend on the day.\nAt the time of writing, Litecoin was up 1.76% to 119.24, recovering from a start of day $116.49 low to current levels, the morning low holding well above the day’s first major support level at $113.83.\nFor the day ahead, a move through to $120 levels would be needed through the morning to support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $121.69 and maintain the upward momentum, with any breakout from the day’s first major resistance level likely to bring the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $127 into play.\nFailing to move through to $120 levels this morning could see Litecoin pullback to $116 levels to bring the day’s first major support level at $113.83 into play, though we would expect Litecoin to avoid sizeable losses through the day, a hold at $120 levels the target for the Litecoin bulls today.\nBuy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly Ripple bucks the trend\nRipple’s XRP held on to positive territory on Wednesday, rising by 0.04% to $0.60159, following Tuesday’s 9.58% gain.\nA start of the day dip to a morning low $0.59476 held well above the day’s first major support level at $0.5591, before bouncing to a morning high $0.62635 to test the day’s first major resistance level at $0.6271, while continuing to fall well short of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.6434.\nRipple’s XRP followed the broader market through a middle of the day sell-off, sliding to an intraday low $0.58165 before recovering to $0.60 levels by the close, Ripple’s XRP managing to hold above the day’s first major support level through the day, while also falling well short of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.6434 to leave the bearish trend intact.\nAt the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up 0.9% to $0.60725, recovering from an early dip to $0.58917 to a morning high $0.61505 before easing back to $0.60 levels.\nMoves through the early part of the day left the day’s first major support level at $0.5802 and first major resistance level at $0.6244 untested, whilst moves in recent days suggest that a bearish trend reversal may be taking shape.\nFor the day ahead, a move through $0.62 levels and a break out through the day’s first major resistance level at $0.6244 would support a run at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.6434 to begin the bearish trend reversal, though sentiment across the broader market will need to be upbeat to support double digit gains through the day.\nFailing to move through to $0.62 levels could see Ripple’s XRP reverse gains through the afternoon, with any reversal likely to see the day’s first major support level at $0.5802 tested before any recovery through to $0.60 levels by the day’s end.\nWhile the bearish trend remains intact, a slight improvement in sentiment is apparent that could draw side lined investors back in.

The original edition of the draft introduces the same caps for crypto donations as for fiat ones, while limiting anonymous contributions to $20. The move renders the overall picture of individual states’ handling political crypto contributions spottier than ever, as the last few months saw states adopting divergent approaches to the issue.\nAlthough a 2014 advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) remains a major reference point for anyone who seeks to boost their chances for election with digital money, this non-regulatory document is barely fit to serve as a definitive guide into the world of crypto campaign finance.\nThe FEC came up with a set of guidelines in May 2014, responding to an inquiry from a Super PAC named Make Your Laws. This entity, which advocates for replacing representative democracy with a more inclusive form of ‘ liquid democracy ,’ requested clarification on whether it could accept BTC donations to fund political action. At that time, Bitcoin was worth some $400, and altcoins were not even considered as a vehicle for campaign finance. The FEC ruled that Bitcoin could be received by campaigns as ‘in-kind donations’ – a form of contribution that provides goods and services needed for organizations’ operations rather than the money to purchase those goods and services.\nEffectively, this means that campaigns cannot spend received Bitcoin directly, but rather have to ‘liquidate’ it and then deposit the money to their accounts. As far as donation caps are concerned, the commission was split across party lines, with Democrats advocating for a $100 limit, and Republicans standing for the standard federal $2,700 cap. Since the advisory opinion outlines recommendations rather than rules, GOP support for a larger cap had later inspired some politicians to allow themselves to go with the $2,700 limit.\nGiven somewhat inconclusive federal guidelines, many state authorities have been facing similar inquiries ever since the FEC ruling was issued. Building up to the 2018 wave of primaries and elections, these requests have intensified. Oftentimes it is state governments’ ethics bodies that are tasked with deciding whether crypto donations are appropriate and how they should be governed. So far this year, several state commissions have either ruled against cryptocurrency donations or wavered on the issue, so the Colorado initiative, if successful, might become a precedent for other undecided states to consider.\nIn October 2017, a Kansas candidate for office sought guidance on potential use of crypto contributions from the state’s Governmental Ethics Commission. Shortly after, the office had announced that Bitcoin is ‘too secretive and untraceable,’ and could be used by ‘totally unidentifiable lobbyists’ to influence local elections.\nWisconsin Libertarian Party asked the State Ethics Commission in April to clarify whether it deems the use of cryptocurrency political contributions acceptable. The commission held public hearings and concluded that the issue should be decided by the state legislature . The time frame for the state House to rule on the issue is yet to be announced.\nEmmanuel Wilder, a Republican candidate for North Carolina State House, has approached State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement with a similar request in April. In his letter, Wilder acknowledged that traceability concerns exist, but still advocated for giving voters a choice between fiat and crypto donation formats, as well as supporting the ‘new upcoming financial service.’ The request is still under review.\nIn South Carolina, the issue has been decided in a speedier manner, and not in favor of crypto enthusiasts. Britton Wolf, a 23-year-old Republican candidate for District 71 of the South Carolina House of Representatives in June primaries, asked the state House’s ethics committee whether he could use digital currency donations to support his campaign. The officials responded that he could not, since the definition of a campaign contribution, as provided by the state law, does not include cryptocurrency . Heroes of Crypto-Funded Campaigns\nInstitutional politics is a field permeated by inertia and adherence to the status quo, so there is little wonder that cryptocurrency as a vehicle of political finance is still far from mainstream adoption. Politicians who use it are still vastly outnumbered, and for the majority of those who do, crypto donations constitute a minor share of overall funds.\nHowever, certain brands of politicians, such as firebrand libertarians and technology advocates, are already naturally predisposed to be relying on digital currency donations – accepting digital currency contributions has become an integral part of manifesting their ideology. Increasing mass adoption and surging prices are also factors that nudge more establishment actors to be looking towards crypto. Here are some of the most high-profile U.S. politicians on both federal and state levels who are vocal about their embrace of crypto funding. Andrew Hemingway\nA Republican candidate for New Hampshire governor in 2014, Hemingway has been the first ever contender to the office to use cryptocurrency contributions in his campaign. Bitcoin donations amounted to about 20 percent of his overall funds. Hemingway never advanced to the general election, having lost to Walter Havenstein in the Republican primary. Jared Polis\nU.S. Representative Jared Polis, who is arguably the most outspoken supporter of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology on the Capitol Hill, claims the credit of being the first acting Congressman to accept Bitcoin from his supporters. During his successful 2014 re-election campaign, he collected a modest $2,000 worth of crypto donations . In his 2018 bid for Colorado governor, Polis will surely exceed this figure by a significant margin. Dan Elder\nThe libertarian’s 2016 bid for Missouri House of Representatives has the distinction of being the first campaign ever to be funded entirely in Bitcoin . The result of the experiment turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with Elder carrying just over 10 percent of the vote. In 2018, Elder is running for District 79 of the Missouri House of Representatives again. Rand Paul\nA feature of every list of Bitcoin-friendly politicians, Paul became the first presidential candidate to embrace cryptocurrency donations when he announced his bid for the 2016 election. Back in 2015, this caused quite a stir . Greg Abbott\nIn an apparent move to attract younger and tech-savvy voters, then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced in April 2014 that he will accept Bitcoin contributions for his gubernatorial campaign. The strategy seems to have worked, as in January 2015 Abbott was sworn in as Governor of the state. Austin Petersen\nA Republican seeking election to the U.S. Senate from Missouri this year, Petersen’s embrace of cryptocurrency is grounded in his pro-market ideology. His campaign manager called the use of bitcoin a ‘ no-brainer .’ Petersen’s campaign amassed just south of $10,000 and became renowned for having received the largest ever single cryptocurrency contribution of 0.284 Bitcoin ($4,500 at the time) in December 2017. This figure doesn’t quite add up with the FEC guidelines even for fiat contributions, but the donation page on Petersen’s website gives a hint to how this could be legitimized:\n“The maximum amount an individual may contribute is $2,700 per election. Your contribution (up to $2,700) will be designated for the primary election. The next $2,700 will be designated for the general election.” Patrick Nelson\nDemocratic candidate for Congress from New York, Nelson proclaimed that his is a ‘ 21st century campaign ,’ which readily embraces ‘technology like #bitcoin.’ He later faced crypto fundraising issues when BitPay, a service that his campaign used for processing crypto donations, ran into licensing trouble with the state of New York. Brian Forde\nForde is well situated to become a new political crypto star. A Democrat seeking election to the U.S. House to represent the 45th Congressional District of California this year, he had worked as both head of digital currency at MIT Media Lab and a tech adviser for the Obama administration. His embrace of the technology is explicit, and his electoral chances look solid. The crypto community has already acknowledged its unequivocal support of his candidacy by funneling a record-breaking $66,000 worth of crypto to his wallets in August and September of 2017 alone, while the biggest names in the industry pledged their support .\nEven though the weight of cryptocurrency contributions in campaign funds remains modest, the overall upward trend is consistent with the increasing degree of mass adoption. There is little doubt that we will soon see more campaigns funded exclusively by crypto, as well as more successful bids relying at least partly on digital currency contributions. As these processes unfold, the FEC will be compelled to chart clearer rules and grapple with the problem of crypto donations’ limited traceability.\nSource: Cointelegraph.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wayne willia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrencies in campaign finance | crypto breaking news subscribe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal election commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T15:58:01.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34178534d71c9be4054631ce7f8ad52cab1e0751", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcX5PgD6z1VkegnSp6xvlNFFJHAK3EyCqB8sAYGV46pCf2Si2M.OOjfIW3Z7KRoFJ0RgwdULxO23g7O4EoCOPCoA--", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/techanalysis-btc3.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34178534d71c9be4054631ce7f8ad52cab1e0751", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcX5PgD6z1VkegnSp6xvlNFFJHAK3EyCqB8sAYGV46pCf2Si2M.OOjfIW3Z7KRoFJ0RgwdULxO23g7O4EoCOPCoA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New – Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance Best New – Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance By root / May 31, 2018\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price continues to trend lower as it bounced off the top of the channel on the 1-hour time frame. A continuation of the slide could take it down to the Fibonacci extension levels. There are some signs of bearish exhaustion from technical indicators, though.\nBitcoin price looks ready to resume the drop after bouncing off resistance, but there are signs of bearish exhaustion.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. The 200 SMA recently held as dynamic resistance since it lined up with the top of the channel near $7,600.\nA continuation of the drop could send bitcoin price to the 38.2% extension near the swing low of $6,950. Stronger selling pressure could take it to the channel support at $6,750 or the 78.6% extension close to the $6,300 support. The full extension is located near $6,000.\nRSI is pulling up from oversold conditions to show that buyers are getting the upper hand. Similarly, stochastic is heading north from oversold levels so bitcoin price could follow suit. In that case, there’s still a chance for an upside break of the channel top, especially since the gap between the moving averages is narrowing. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price took another hit from negative remarks in the absence of any other industry updates. Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller remarked that bitcoin could be extinct by 2118, citing:\n“The one scenario is that something like what happened after 2013 when bitcoin topped $1,000, and then lost 80 percent of its value. It looked like bitcoin was just fading away.”\nHe did mention that it could continue to exist but maybe under a different name or mechanism as there have been so many forks already. Also, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse mentioned that bitcoin price influence over other altcoins could be over soon.

The latest target of action from the United States SEC is Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services – which has become subject of a court order halting its ICO due to allegedly making fraudulent claims of business relationships with well-known businesses and the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nAn SEC press release states that the commission has “obtained a court order halting an ongoing fraud involving an initial coin offering (ICO) that raised as much as $21 million from investors in and outside the U.S.,” adding that the court also approved an emergency asset freeze and the appointment of a receiver for Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services Inc., the firm behind the alleged scheme.\nThe SEC complaint accuses the company’s president, Michael Alan Stollery, a/k/a Michael Stollaire, of having “lied about business relationships with the Federal Reserve and dozens of well-known firms, including PayPal, Verizon, Boeing, and The Walt Disney Company.”\nRobert Cohen, the Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, stated: “This ICO was based on a social media marketing blitz that allegedly deceived investors with purely fictional claims of business prospects. Having filed multiple cases involving allegedly fraudulent ICOs, we again encourage investors to be especially cautious when considering these as investments.” Israeli Cryptocurrency Regulations Delayed\nThe enactment of Israel’s cryptocurrency regulations, originally scheduled for this Friday, has been delayed until October.\nFollowing last week’s publishing of a draft law pertaining to money laundering that included specific provisions pertaining to virtual currencies, Israel’s finance minister, Moshe, Kahlon, abruptly requested that the law not be passed until the bill is ratified.\n“The existing ordinance for the prohibition of money laundering will lapse with the passing of the new law. The process of installing the new law, which includes public hearings, will take time. Consequently, there will be a period in which there will be no active legal provision concerning this matter, which will lead to a lack of clarity regarding the identification and reporting obligations imposed by the order on [the] prohibition of money laundering,” Mr. Kahlon said.\nManny Rosenfield, the head of the Israeli Bitcoin Association, has described the delay of the law’s passing as a significant setback for the country’s cryptocurrency industry. “The postponement of the law that deals with digital currencies will leave start-ups in the same situation, and will cause a situation in which these companies will have to think twice about whether or not to stay in Israel […] This is a blow that will hamper the efforts of Israel to become a leader in a rapidly developing field of technology,” Mr. Rosenfield said. “It’s Not Illegal for the Public to Trade BTC” – Chinese Academic\nWhilst speaking at The 2018 China International Big Data Industry Expo in Guiyang, Liu Xiaolei, a professor at the Guanghua School of Management of Peking University, argued that bitcoin trading is not currently an illegal activity for Chinese citizens to undertake, despite the China’s prohibition on cryptocurrency exchanges.\nAccording to a rough translation, Liu Xiaolei stated of the legality of China’s citizenry trading bitcoin: “In terms of supervision, the state [has] not [made] such a gesture [so as] to say it is not allowed.” Liu Xiaolei added that “everyone, especially the common people who do not understand this new technology […] should be reminded […] not to follow suit, because it is still a very risky investment.”\nLiu Xiaolei also argued that maintaining a ban on P2P cryptocurrencies is not practically viable.\nWhich jurisdiction do you think has adopted the most appropriate cryptocurrency regulations?

In the early years, bitcoin was ruled by its hard-core proponents, known as bitcoin evangelists, and the lack of notoriety was evident in minimal trading volume and the price; a single bitcoin didn’t trade above $100 until 2013.\nHowever, the second phase has been less of an enigma. “The subsequent ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out,” wrote van der Burgt.\nThat fear, often referred to by the acronym FOMO, saw companies add coin- or blockchain-related terms to their names , hoping to capitalize on the booming interest in the industry. Furthermore, celebrities jumped on the bandwagon, launching or endorsing their own cryptocurrencies. However, as many of these companies have been exposed, these ‘new’ cryptocurrencies have blown by the way side—often with legal ramifications.\nRead: Opinion: That Floyd Mayweather-backed cryptocurrency is another sign of a bursting bubble\nNow, even as price volatility subsides, the hype remains. Van der Burgt argues that the bitcoin bubble is now entering the euphoric stage, one with direct parallels with the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.\n“The euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments,” said van der Burgt. “According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance.”\nRead: Dimon’s many bitcoin moments of regret, in one chart\nWhich brings us to now: the price of the worlds biggest digital currency has lost more than half its value since peaking in December 2017 and van der Burgt believes the market is entering the profit-taking stage, a phase where so-called smart money begins to head for the exits, leaving only one step left before the bubble pops.\n“The subsequent ‘panic’ phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and bitcoin’s price would substantially crash,” wrote van der Burgt.\nHowever, like most bitcoin debates, the argument comes with a caveat.\n“Then again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency,” van der Burgt said.\nFurther reading: These companies jumped on the bitcoin train right before it derailed\nAaron Hankin Aaron Hankin is a MarketWatch reporter in New York who covers cryptocurrency and financial markets.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "http://twitter.com/@ahhankin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyman minsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roubini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T20:41:09.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f23fa427e23b33ebac80ee6fac16c67444ed8ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Z76FDDPLx2.H7FNNu2RN5QuMOej.SiTO_z4WWlF33J7O6AEh4hdcDkLcOSv1um8iO4753VPor4xG1tve2KtnHrrxpF.H93frfbVL.r.2OmxWwBMS_boy.", "site_full": "www.coinfox.info", "site": "coinfox.info", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Roger Ver predicts Ethereum to surpass bitcoin in 2018 | Coinfox", "title_full": "Roger Ver predicts Ethereum to surpass bitcoin in 2018 | Coinfox", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "EE", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "http://www.coinfox.info/images/news/raz_pust_v_zhizni_vsegda_budet_moment_dlja_schastj.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f23fa427e23b33ebac80ee6fac16c67444ed8ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Z76FDDPLx2.H7FNNu2RN5QuMOej.SiTO_z4WWlF33J7O6AEh4hdcDkLcOSv1um8iO4753VPor4xG1tve2KtnHrrxpF.H93frfbVL.r.2OmxWwBMS_boy.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Roger Ver predicts Ethereum to surpass bitcoin in 2018 | Coinfox", "text": "Details Published: 31 May 2018\nEthereum and Bitcoin Cash will develop more rapidly than bitcoin, says cryptomillionaire Roger Ver. And by the end of 2018, bitcoin will loose its status of the most valuable cryptocurrency.\nRoger Ver, well-known for his support of Bitcoin Cash, once again made an attack against the original bitcoin. According to Ver, the bitcoin protocol abounds in flaws, and these defects will eventually lead to decreasing interest in the first cryptocurrency.\nAccording to him, many of the more than 1,600 existing cryptocurrencies were created in order to offer more reliable and efficient solutions than bitcoin.\nEthereum will surpass bitcoin in 2018, and Bitcoin Cash will take center stage in the cryptocurrency system by 2020.\n\"I see it happening, and I believe it's imminent,\" Ver told The Independent . \"Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020.\"\nVer is not the only one who predicts that Ethereum will surpass bitcoin. At the end of 2017, Alexis Ohanian, Internet entrepreneur, investor, and co-founder of Reddit, said that, in 2018m Ethereum could grow to $15,000 in price, and its market capitalization would beat bitcoin. The same assumption was made by Olaf Carlson-Wee, chief executive officer of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Polychain Capital. According to him, \"Ethereum is a much richer, organic developer ecosystem develop very, very quickly.\"\nBut there are opponents of this opinion. Michael Jackson from venture company Mangrove Capital believes that bitcoin will overcome all its problems that the network is currently facing.\n\"There is so much talent in the crypto space, and people are working on solving these scalability problems. I do not see why Bitcoin should not remain in the number one spot. It is still the best known and it is ultimately the reserve currency in the space. \" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis ohanian", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T09:17:41.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aef5bccb07c0d4acbe6167dbdd496aea551b00cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQGcQG3snF5.taQpc7gFcylAbNwmpo.7R1f5yx2YutIh4UIf3aI530B8RDMjHxzzlgDFQ8rxlHCuIS_ubrbdXIr533aRjKxoRhfzZaDPWY6Q--", "site_full": "www.bnn.ca", "site": "bnn.ca", "site_section": "https://www.bnn.ca/news-wire", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "News Wire", "title": "Square Adds $8 Billion in Value With Help From M&A, Bitcoin -", "title_full": "Square Adds $8 Billion in Value With Help From M&A, Bitcoin -", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1085910!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/bc-square-adds-8-billion-in-value-with-help-from-m-a-bitcoin.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 38530, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aef5bccb07c0d4acbe6167dbdd496aea551b00cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQGcQG3snF5.taQpc7gFcylAbNwmpo.7R1f5yx2YutIh4UIf3aI530B8RDMjHxzzlgDFQ8rxlHCuIS_ubrbdXIr533aRjKxoRhfzZaDPWY6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg News", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Square Adds $8 Billion in Value With Help From M&A, Bitcoin -", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Square Inc., which more than doubled in value last year, are still on a roll and show no sign of slowing down.\nThe payments firm’s stock has surged almost 50 percent, adding about $8 billion in market value, since it rolled out Bitcoin trading in November for customers of its Cash App, which lets users transfer money to friends and family. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has repeatedly shared his enthusiasm for digital currencies, saying earlier this month that “the internet deserves a native currency.”\nBut San Francisco-based Square has gained on more than optimism for cryptocurrencies. The shares have rallied 25 percent since the company said in April it was buying website-builder Weebly for $365 million, the firm’s biggest-ever acquisition. The deal is a key step in Square’s strategy to build its online and e-commerce offerings for small and medium-size businesses. It also gives Square another recurring revenue stream and base of new customers.\nDorsey’s crypto fever and appetite for deals have contributed to Square’s surge, but a steady stream of positive earnings surprises has also fueled bullish sentiment. The most recently reported quarter marked the 10th consecutive period that the firm topped analysts’ sales projections.\nSquare’s gross payment volume could reach $409 billion in 2026, or 4.1 percent of total U.S. payment volume, RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin predicted in a May 22 note to clients.\n“Square’s integrated hardware, software and services solutions position the company to benefit from ongoing card acceptance penetration at smaller merchants while gaining share against existing solutions that lag from a technological or efficiency-basis,” wrote Perlin, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Lily Katz in New York at lkatz31@bloomberg.net;Selina Wang in San Francisco at swang533@bloomberg.net\n Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Jillian Ward, Molly Schuetz\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "square inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco-based square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T05:16:35.058+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "400806862eaeac68cb15bf34dc1a96f0b50b984b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf31ez6aHaMlDJ3.g8Z2YO3gZxbHq1jDuHFr.0E6jL4JoEwrWUF_N._XnFLo1zZydzAJZCfHWOKhPoPaHl6ZJlw.0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ultimate Guide to Securing Your Bitcoins - How to NOT Get Hacked 101 : Bitcoin", "title_full": "Ultimate Guide to Securing Your Bitcoins - How to NOT Get Hacked 101 : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.redditmedia.com/gl9upcvJczNpYpxFyPnrULsRvEICYNTpgQYcA98uBEs.jpg?w=320&amp;s=e9ce60297f971af99c67c5eefc143b67", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "400806862eaeac68cb15bf34dc1a96f0b50b984b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf31ez6aHaMlDJ3.g8Z2YO3gZxbHq1jDuHFr.0E6jL4JoEwrWUF_N._XnFLo1zZydzAJZCfHWOKhPoPaHl6ZJlw.0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deleted", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ultimate Guide to Securing Your Bitcoins - How to NOT Get Hacked 101 : Bitcoin", "text": "Community guidelines Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.

Most people ask how to buy cryptocurrency in a safe way. On this occasion I will share information and reviews about the best and most popular exchange sites in the include types of coins / cryptocurrency that can be purchased on the exchange, as well as its payment methods.\nThe first thing to notice when looking for bitcoin exchanges is how secure websites and servers are. Locations usually give an idea of ​​what’s on offer. On this occasion I will review the full range of trading exchange cryptocurrency at binance.com, following binance.com review: Register Binance.com\nOn their site, it says they are capable of processing 1,400,000 orders per second! An impressive number if you consider the number of people who visit their site every day. The company had an initial ICO in July 2017 and after a few months, released their exchange site where their BNB coins can be used to pay for transaction fees. This is a website that has just entered online cryptocurrency trading.\nAvailable Coins for Binance.com TradingBitcoin, Ether, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Ripple, BNB, ARK, AST, BNT, BQX, BTG, CTR, DASH, DNT, ENG, ENJ, EOS, Monero, litecoin, and more! To get a complete list of available coins, please go to their website and create an account.\nEase of use Binance.com. This site is not created for new players in world exchanges. They do not have a guide that says what is where and directs new merchants to the right path! With that said, it would be wise to read more about exchange websites even before trying to trade on Binance.com if you are new to the world of commerce. In addition to the non-user-friendly interface, we’ve noticed that their website has absolutely no lag issues. This means that when we move from one tab to another, it all happens in a flash and you are not forced to wait in an awkward silence to get to the next page. When it comes to ease of use, we give them a good 7/10 experience because everything is going well, the only advantage we have is that we know like graphics and numbers. Register Binance.com\nBinance.com Customer Support. After all exploring with features and how to trade, it is time to see what kind of support they have for their customers. One of the important things in looking at an exchange / trading platform is knowing their customer service. We have emphasized on so many reviews that when it comes to money-handling websites, customer service is essential for its advancement as it bridges the gap between the company and the customer.\nHere, in Binance.com, registered customers can contact them through email support because they do not have a live chat system that is integrated into their website, maybe features to be added in the future. In addition to email support can be achieved through support@binance.zendesk.com they can also be contacted through the QQ group: 344615861. QQ messenger App is widely used in China. They can also be followed through Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, and Wechat accounts.

That’s the message of a Global Times editorial, which praises the digital currency. “There’s an increasing belief that just saying no to Bitcoin won’t be the eventual solution to the cryptocurrency issue,” writes Xiao Xin, author of the editorial. “A more fundamental approach would be to embrace the new technology without putting the country’s financial system at stake.”\nThis approach is a signal that Beijing is getting ready to tighten regulations around the digital currency, as U.S., Japan and Korea have done,rather than ban it altogether.\nAnd that could be bullish for Bitcoin prices, which have been all over in recent months. Regulating Bitcoin is certainly better than an outright ban.\nThe Global Times’ editorial comes months after Beijing banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading, crushing Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies—see table.\nCoin/Investment Trust Change 24H* Bitcoin (BTC) -9.66% Ethereum (ETH) -11.22 Litecoin (LTC) -16.92 BitConnect -7.81 *Friday September 7, 2017\nSource: Coinranking.com\n[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin.]\nThat was just the beginning rather than the end of growing efforts by big governments around the world to turn Bitcoin back into what itonce was—an exotic currency for the tech savvy and romantic radicals, as was discussed in a previous piece here .\nTo be fair Chinese and other governments, big and small, have a couple of good reasons to regulate the process of creating and exchanging cryptocurrencies. Like the protection of the public from market manipulation, and the ensuring of financial stability.\nThat’s something governments have been doing for years with conventional financial products and instruments. Why not with cryptocurrencies?\nBut shutting off ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges altogether, as China did, reaches beyond traditional regulation. It questions the very legitimacy of Bitcoin as a currency.\nWhy? Because it undermines the monopoly of government and the banking system on creating money and credit.\nChina more than any other country wants to have firm control of its banking system, and allocate credit according to a political agenda. This means that a competing currency like Bitcoin would threaten its political system. Why not crush it sooner than later?\nBut crushing Bitcoin could also crush innovation, something China badly needs as it prepares to make the Great Leap Forward from copying foreign technology to developing its own.\nBesides, banning Bitcoin trade in China won’t stop Bitcoin. It will just leave the country behind in the digital currency revolution. As Xiao Xin puts it, “fencing off bitcoin exchanges can’t effectively end Bitcoin trade, and fears of a Bitcoin bubble will leave China behind in the digital currency revolution.”\nAnd the digital revolution is what can help China make the transition from an emerging to a developed country.\nThat’s why Beijing seems to be having second thoughts on banning Bitcoin. I wouldn’t be surprised if the ban is lifted in the near future.\nGallery The Richest Person In Every State 2018 Launch Gallery 51 images", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T12:33:27.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3112624d417eab1ae140bbd3bc822a99134c1d05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWM6Vksfstj8AFg3y3ReEXWFo6UqBd33tS5klUJPmAX2gSSF9OL3YqKazgFyv01aZOo_qJilZdn.xvt4oogoM_4WquAca2bUAVsceshA5E6wjKYu3vTBRW.TOinLpn5ikxgb_lbepAwQ--", "site_full": "cyware.com", "site": "cyware.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["hacking", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Hackers launch 'Double-Spend' attack on Bitcoin Gold to steal over $18 million", "title_full": "Hackers launch 'Double-Spend' attack on Bitcoin Gold to steal over $18 million", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cystory-images.s3.amazonaws.com/iStock_79625683_SMALL.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3112624d417eab1ae140bbd3bc822a99134c1d05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWM6Vksfstj8AFg3y3ReEXWFo6UqBd33tS5klUJPmAX2gSSF9OL3YqKazgFyv01aZOo_qJilZdn.xvt4oogoM_4WquAca2bUAVsceshA5E6wjKYu3vTBRW.TOinLpn5ikxgb_lbepAwQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hackers launch 'Double-Spend' attack on Bitcoin Gold to steal over $18 million", "text": "Hackers launch 'Double-Spend' attack on Bitcoin Gold to steal over $18 million Hackers launch 'Double-Spend' attack on Bitcoin Gold to steal over $18 million Share on Twitter\nBitcoin Gold Cryptocurrency’s infrastructure suffered several “double spend” attacks that saw hackers steal about $18 million worth of BTG coins. According to a post on the Bitcoin Gold forums, the attacks began on Friday (May 18) in which hackers took control of more than half of the Bitcoin Gold’s network hashrate in a 51% attack.\nThis gives the miner temporary control of the blockchain to mess with transactions in multiple ways, including the ability to spend the same amount of coins twice. After taking control of the network, the attacker can deposit large amounts of BTG at cryptocurrency exchange and attempt to send those coins to a wallet under their control as well.\nBitcoin Gold is currently ranked as the world’s 26th largest cryptocurrency with an estimated market cap of about $827 million.\n\"An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use \"51 percent attacks\" to perform \"double spend\" attacks to steal money from exchanges,\" the Bitcoin Gold team said. \"We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits. There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held.\"\nBitcoin Gold said the attacker has been using the 51% and double-spend attack against other cryptocurrency exchange services as well. It also noted that ordinary users, their funds and trades with known partners aren’t at risk in such an attack.\n“The only real danger is to anyone who unknowingly trades directly with the attackers for very large sums on an automated system. In other words, Exchanges,” Bitcoin Gold said . “While this problem isn’t unique to Bitcoin Gold and doesn’t represent a flaw, we consider our Exchanges to be critical partners in our Ecosystem, so in a theoretical sense, attacks on Exchanges are attacks on us all.”\nSo far, a number of exchanges have increased the number of confirmations required to accept large transactions. Still, by the time Bitcoin Gold Network has advised all exchanges to confirm recent BTG transactions and carefully review larger deposits, the attacker will have already stolen a significant amount of funds.\nSo far, the wallet address connected to the Bitcoin Gold 51% attack has received 388,201 BTG, approximately $17.5 million - most of which have already been moved to other addresses.\nEven though the attacker cannot manipulate cryptocurrency from other users’ wallets, or revert other people’s transactions to his own wallet, the attack is still dangerous because it may destabilize an exchange’s backup funds and preventing other users from withdrawing funds from the exchange. It may also lead to an individual exchange going bankrupt.\nBitcoin Gold said it is planning a major upgrade towards the end of June and change their Proof of Work algorithm so BTG cannot be mined on upcoming ASIC hardware. The team says the algorithm change and a new form will help reduce the risk of 51% attacks in the future.\n“We’ve been working at an incredible pace the past days to put the plan and pieces together, and we expect to upgrade our mainnet approximately seven days after the necessary software is up and running on our testnet,” they noted. This upgrade will require some software updates on the part of Exchanges, Wallets, Pools, Explorers… While it would be better to give all our partners more than seven days to test and deploy to avoid disruption, these attacks have already forced disruption on us all, so we feel it’s best to get the upgrade completed as soon as we possibly can.\n“The Community considers these attacks on Exchanges to be attacks on us all, but we and our Community are resilient and remain dedicated to decentralized solutions,” they added. “We know that many are looking to us to lead the way, and it’s our intention to serve as an example to other projects in the community that are dealing with these sorts of malicious attacks from centralized mining power. In the end, decentralization is the answer.” + Aware WRITTEN BY Gabriel Milton I am an enthusiastic cybersecurity personnel.

There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $965 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $960 and $950 support levels to avoid a downside break in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is holding an important support around $950 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past the $1,040 resistance to gain further. Bitcoin Cash Price Support After yesterday’s ride , bitcoin cash price faced sellers near the $1,030-1,040 resistances against the US Dollar. The price started a downside correction and declined below the $1,000 support. It also declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $971 low to $1,031 high. It opened the doors for a larger correction and the price dipped towards the $950 support area. The $940-950 support area acted as a decent buy zone and protected further losses. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $971 low to $1,031 high also prevented declines. BCH price moved back above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, there is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $965 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair remains well supported on the downside around the $950 and $960 levels. Looking at the chart , the price is clearly facing a major hurdle on the upside near $1,040. A break and close above the stated $1,040 resistance is needed for buyers to take control. On the downside, a break and close below $950 will most likely push the price back in the bearish zone.

Many people would assert “Not a lot” given that the former owns most of the latter and its founders were responsible for creating ripple in the first place. Ripple the company has other ideas though, and is on a mission to separate the two ripples – big and small – once and for all.\nAlso read: May Breaks 2018’s Down-Trend in Monthly Total Raised by ICOs The Disambiguation of Ripple and XRP\nFor several months, Ripple has been on a mission to dispel the notion that it is responsible for the XRP currency it issues. Just as Prince once changed himself into a symbol, the project would like to turn its currency into a symbol and keep it that way. This is despite the fact that ‘XRP’ is simply a currency ticker derived from an abbreviation of the word ‘ripple’, just as XMR is an abbreviation of monero. To mark the distinction, a new logo has been proposed that is clean, minimalist and, tellingly, looks nothing like that of Ripple.\nThere’s even a community-run Twitter account for the new XRP symbol and Github which explains: “In order for XRP to be perceived as a ‘currency,’ it needs its own symbol. Just like the dollar sign ‘$,’ XRP needs a universal sign that denotes units of XRP. The current logo being used works great when referencing the company, and it should not be changed, but a character should be created to represent actual units of the digital asset.” The final logo has yet to be decided, but whatever version the community plumps for, it will look very different from the current shared logo of the company and coin. One of the proposed new logos for XRP Why the Rebrand?\nIt has been theorized that the company is seeking to distance itself from its eponymous currency in order to “desecuritize” it. The likelihood of XRP being a security, given the fact that Ripple has a majority holding, is strong . In the event of XRP being classified as such by the SEC it would have a major impact on XRP’s price and its availability on US exchanges. Given the foregoing, it makes sense for the company to emphasize the distinction between the company and XRP. It is likely to encounter significant difficulties, however, in convincing people that this is the case.\nWhen Are We Decentralized Yet creator Jackson Palmer was petitioned to start referring to Ripple’s cryptocurrency as XRP, he issued a strong response: Semantics or Separate Things?\nThe case for why the company and XRP are separate entities, according to the company , revolves around the fact that the XRP ledger is open source, and thus any company can use it for their own purposes. While this is true, third party development has been few and far between, and the vast majority of XRP’s code commits have been performed by staffers. If the company can successfully separate itself from its currency, it is possible that the XRP ledger could become more attractive to companies wishing to utilize it for their own purposes. It seems unlikely, however, that the XRP ledger, for all its efficiencies, will become the Hyperledger of enterprise. Other community proposed logos for XRP\nAs cryptocurrency critic Preston Byrne has pointed out , the notion that “There’s not a direct connection between Ripple the company and XRP”, as stated by the company’s Director of Regulatory Regulations Ryan Zagone, simply doesn’t fly. The connections between the two are written all over the website, and every other third party news source. The Wikipedia page for Ripple (payment protocol) points out that “The network can operate without the Ripple company”, but evidence suggests that it would struggle to function if the company bowed out. For one thing, operating an XRP node requires obtaining permission from one of Ripple.com’s servers.\nWith 55 billion XRP locked in the company vaults, the simplest way for Ripple to rid itself of association with the cryptocurrency would be to burn the bulk of its supply of XRP.

These stories include a new multi-GPU mining motherboard from Taiwan’s Asu; a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin.\nAlso Read: Austrian Financial Market Authority Stops ‘Active Managed Mining’ Operation H370 Mining Master\nAsus (TWSE: 2357), the Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer, has announced a new motherboard that increases density with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The H370 Mining Master greatly replaces its predecessor’s x1 slots with banks of vertical PCIe-over-USB ports that let riser cables plug directly into the motherboard.\nThe company explains that: “Mining is a numbers game; it’s only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. ” The motherboard includes several more mining-enhancing features including a suite of diagnostic features designed to make a rig easier to manage. Chief among them is GPU State Detection, which scans the system at boot and indicates whether each riser port is empty, connected to a functional graphics card, or whether it’s experiencing problems. It will be unveiled at Computex 2018 in Taipei, June 5-9. Real Estate Entrepreneur Buys Bittrade\nSingaporean property entrepreneur Eric Cheng has announced the acquisition of two Japanese companies for S$67 million, giving him a 100% controlling stake in FX Trade Financial and its affiliate Bittrade. Bittrade is one of only sixteen Japanese FSA-regulated cryptocurrency trading platforms. Speaking on the acquisition, Cheng commented: “The cryptocurrency industry is growing exponentially. Against this backdrop, the key to capturing the rising demand is having a well-regulated and licensed outfit. With this Japanese FSA-licensed platform, I will work closely with the regulators to scale this platform globally.” Ripple Loving Bank Hackers\nHackers and ransomware cyber criminals usually prefer privacy coins such as monero, or just BTC to avoid having to explain too much about the crypto markets to their victims. But a new group, possibly from Russia, has been more successful with Ripple’s XRP. According to a report from Canada, an address with about $5 million in XRP is controlled by hackers who recently attacked two banks.\nBank of Montreal (BMO) and Simplii Financial revealed personal information about 90,000 clients of the two banks was being held hostage for $1 million, to be paid in XRP. The hackers, using a Russian email service, explained that the banks’ lack of education security has enabled the situation. “They were giving too much permission to half-authenticated accounts which enabled us to grab all this information,” they said, adding that the system “was not checking if a password was valid until the security questions were input correctly.” $30 Million Gumi Cryptos\nGumi Cryptos is a new $30 million investment fund meant to help crypto ventures crack the Japanese market. It is led by Hironao Kunimitsu, founder and CEO of Tokyo-based mobile gamer publisher Gumi, and Miko Matsumura, founder of U.S.-based exchange Evercoin.\n“We’ll be bringing startups from outside of Japan to the Japanese market,” Matsumura told Gamesbeat . “We like early stage. We invest in equity or tokens. We like financial services. We like game technologies, and we believe there is a strong connection between gaming and crypto.” He added that “Having advised top global cryptocurrency startups alongside some of the best investors in the world, I’ve come to realize that all of them struggle to break into Japan, the largest cryptocurrency market in the world. I’m excited to join Gumi and their well-respected network in Japan.” James Rodriguez Coin\nColombian soccer star James Rodriguez, currently attacking midfielder for Bayern Munich Football Club, has announced he decided to create a new coin for fans to capitalize on his brand. The JR10 token, developed in collaboration with Selfsell, is planned to be used for exchange of match tickets, souvenirs, and exclusive merchandise as well as the opportunities to participate in Rodriguez’s fan club activities.\nPrevious crypto collaborations by soccer stars include Leo Messi promoting an ultra secure mobile phone for paranoid cryptocurrency users.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

This popularity has contributed to a flood of new mining rigs being developed at a record pace. The ever-changing landscape of the mining sector can leave interested parties confused as to the future value of Bitcoin mining hardware and if purchasing this equipment is still a smart move.\nA quick search of mining forums and you can see that these concerns really became an issue in 2013 when CPU (Central Processing Unit) miners were superseded by GPU (Graphic Processing Units) mining rigs and then later eclipsed by ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) models. Manufacturers are reaping huge bounties from these products. Hence, the continued development of more powerful mining equipment. What is Mining?\nMining is the process in which a network computer (node) adds the next block to the blockchain after completing a difficult math equation known as the Proof-of-Work. In the early stages of mining, this could be accomplished with nothing more than your home PC’s CPU. Bitcoin Mining Rig\nIt wasn’t long before miners realized that GPUs were far more efficient at handling the repetitive nature of the Proof-of-Work algorithms and by the end of 2013, GPUs were the mining standard. This had some serious ramifications as it increased both the cost of obtaining mining equipment, as well as the overall difficulty of the mining sector. Increased Difficulty\nPart of the proof-of-work algorithm is a difficulty adjustment. As more computing resources enter the mining pool, the proof-of-work algorithm makes the mining math problem more difficult to solve. In 2016, the mining sector saw an explosion in both the value of cryptocurrencies and the difficulty of mining. Up until this time, the majority of mining was still GPU-based but the introduction of far more efficient ASIC mining rigs quickly made mining BTC an expensive endeavor to begin. GPU Life Expectancy – Bitcoin Mining Hardware\nThe chart below indicates just how quickly GPU Bitcoin mining hardware has suffered since the introduction of ASIC rigs. In 2011, an average GPU miner could expect anywhere from 100-200 BTC for their efforts. Only one year later, these results were reduced to around 30 BTC and by 2013, you would have been lucky to mine 3 BTC using this hardware. This data reveals that by 2014, the number of BTC you could expect to mine using a GPU dropped below 1 BTC; making GPU miners practically obsolete when used alone. Chart Showing GPU Difficulty Over Time Delivery Date of Your Equipment\nDue to the overwhelming demand for BTC mining hardware, there is now a wait associated with purchasing these products. ASIC miners can have waiting periods that can extend for months. It is important to consider difficulty fluctuations during this time. Basically, if you have to wait too long for your mining equipment, it may not be worth it by the time it arrives. Electricity Costs\nElectricity costs should be one of your main concerns when deciding on what type of mining rig to purchase. You may find that you are losing money if you go with a high-powered mining rig in an area where electricity is expensive. Today’s mining equipment is focused on efficiency as older mining rigs are unable to produce a profit in today’s difficult mining ecosystem. Bitcoin Energy Consuption Chart via CNBC Bitcoin Prices\nThe overall price of BTC (or any other mineable crypto) is another determining factor to consider when deciding on purchasing a mining rig that will stand the test of time. When the value of BTC goes up, so does the profitability of mining this crypto. As was stated before, a single GPU miner could produce over 100 BTC in 2011. While the number of coins that a single GPU can mine has reduced, the value of BTC has appreciated nearly 1000% since those days. Future Transaction Fees\nThe reward for mining a block is scheduled to half every 210,000 blocks. This means that around May 2020, BTC mining rewards will drop from 12.5 BTC down to 6.25 BTC. While this seems like it could crush the mining industry, you must consider that there will only ever be 21,000,000 BTC mined and of that 17,048,151 have already been mined. This means you can expect to see some serious price increases as the number of BTC that are available to be mined diminishes in the coming years. ASIC Miners – Things to Consider\nWhile ASIC mining rigs are far more efficient at mining than their GPU counterparts, you should remember that these chips are only able to mine SHA-256 cryptocurrencies and therefore serve no additional purpose once these tasks are completed. This is in stark contrast to GPU chips that can still be utilized for graphically-intense applications such as gaming long after the last BTC has been mined. Should I Invest in Some BTC Mining Hardware or Not?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. If you live in an area that is privy to low, or even free electricity, you may find that your mining hardware’s lifespan outlasts other regions of the world due to your low overhead. Mining is a crucial part of the cryptocommunity and you should expect to see manufacturers continue to produce more powerful mining rigs over the coming years.\nWhat do you guys think?

Ripple CEO Says Yes\nIt’s the last day of May, and Ripple is making it count. XRP is in the green, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is making headlines.\nWhy, though? What did the Ripple CEO say? Is there specific Ripple news causing XRP to be up? Well, luckily, we have the answers to those questions. Ripple News | Ripple CEO Talks Bitcoin\nOn Wednesday, Brad Garlinghouse, the Ripple CEO, stated that while crypto prices have, in the past, been correlated with BTC, that pattern may soon meet its demise. For that to happen, said Mr. Garlinghouse, the markets will have to realize that there are notable differences between these assets.\nHe proceeded to explain that speculation currently dominates the crypto market, and it’s only a matter of time until people fully realize and “understand the different use cases.”\nThis is not the first time the Ripple CEO has talked about Bitcoin. In fact, the last time he spoke about the virtual currency wasn’t too long ago. At Recode’s Code Conference, Garlinghouse called Bitcoin “the Napster of digital assets.” If you don’t remember Napster, this is marginally offensive towards Bitcoin. Napster was a music service that, while changing the rules of virtual music, never succeeded. More Ripple News | May 31, 2018 Ripple Price News\nMeanwhile, XRP is making some noise on the market, finding itself in the green zone. At press time, Ripple (XRP) is selling for $0.61. This puts XRP up 3.66% in the past twenty-four hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Ripple News and Announcements\nThis week, we have seen one piece of Ripple news make waves. Ripple confirmed that Kuwait Finance House joined the RippleNet. This move indicates that the Islami bank supports Ripple’s vision. KFH is the First Bank in Kuwait to Join RippleNet for cross-boarder Instant Payments utilizing blockchain technology\n— Kuwait Finance House (@KFHGroup) May 26, 2018\nKFH is not the only institution that supports Ripple’s vision, either. Actor Ashton Kutcher’s tech investment fund is invested in Ripple and recently donated $4M on behalf of Ripple to the Ellen Wildlife Fund. Wow! What an incredible surprise!! We love you. We thank you. #WeNeedGorillas @aplusk @guyoseary @Ripple pic.twitter.com/JgznXFxWAI\n— Ellen Wildlife Fund (@EDWildlifeFund) May 23, 2018\nWhile presenting the donation, Kutcher praised Ripple, stating that it is an organization that actually cares about making a change, and being involved in different use cases. Which, as we’ve now seen, is what the Ripple CEO believes too. The Ripple News Takeaway\nDo you have any thoughts on the performance of Ripple this week?

The study finds that significant returns are all but guaranteed for those willing to participate in the controversial new form of crowdfunding and early investment, while also noting that such investors are savvy. Massive Returns\nLeonard Kostovetsky and Hugo Benedetti from Boston College’s Carroll School of Management recently published a study of initial coin offerings (ICOs), which confirms what many in the cryptocurrency space already know — namely, that there is a lot of money to be made by participating in the controversial new form of crowdfunding and venture capitalism.\nEven when factoring in failed projects, the average gains in the ICO space are significant, to say the least. The study concluded:\nWe find evidence of significant ICO underpricing, with average returns of 179% from the ICO price to the first day’s opening market price, over a holding period that averages just 16 days. Even after imputing returns of -100% to ICOs that don’t list their tokens within 60 days and adjusting for the returns of the asset class, the representative ICO investor earns 82%. After trading begins, tokens continue to appreciate in price, generating average buy-and-hold abnormal returns of 48% in the first 30 trading days. Doing Their Own Research\nPerhaps most interestingly, the researchers have found that ICO investors, generally speaking, are savvier than some may think.\nThe ICO space is notorious for featuring no shortage of fraudulent projects. A recent review of 1,450 documents for digital coin offerings unveiled 271 indicators of fraudulent tactics — including “plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns and missing or fake executive teams.”\nNevertheless, active investors in ICOs have demonstrated the ability to invest the most funds into the more appropriate projects. The researchers explain:\nOur paper shows that ICOs investors are compensated handsomely for investing in new unproven platforms through unregulated offerings. It suggests that scams, while plentiful in number, are not as important in terms of stolen capital because investors are shrewd enough to spot (and underfund) them.\nStill, investors have reportedly dumped more than $1 billion into fraudulent projects, with $273 million already claimed as losses. ‘Baby with the Bathwater’\nFinally, the report also finds that a lack of regulatory clarity both in the United States and abroad has hampered the rapid growth of ICOs, but warns against a total crackdown or ultra-strict approach. The researchers note:\nRegulatory uncertainty in the United States and around the world has recently slowed the explosive growth in ICOs, but our findings suggest that while regulators should continue to deter fraudulent activities, they need to be careful not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.\nWhat do you think about the massive gains being had in the ICO space? Do you think such a trend will continue?

Will Bitcoin Be Here in a Century?\nSpeaking on CNBC’s ‘ Trading Nation ,’ the Yale professor argued that the cryptocurrency won’t look anything like it does today, and that if it does it’ll go by a different name.\n“There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it’ll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not,” Shiller added.\nWith Bitcoin’s value continuing to fluctuate, Shiller states that one scenario that could take place is similar to what occurred in 2013 when it reached $1,000 only to lose 80 percent of its value. He added: ‘It looked like Bitcoin was just fading away. It’s so hard to predict these things.’\nYet, while he may have a doomsday opinion of the future of Bitcoin, the economist said that he doesn’t mean to be dismissive of the cryptocurrency. Even though he claims that it looks like it’s in a bubble , with the more than 1,350 digital currencies on the market, with a market cap value, he said ‘something good may come out of this.’\nShiller is known for voicing his opinion on the cryptocurrency market. Earlier this month, he was reported as saying that the digital currency industry was copying some of history’s most failed monetary experiments . He also added that no one outside of computer science is able to explain how cryptocurrencies work. In October, he commented on the ‘strange enthusiasm’ for Bitcoin, calling it a ‘ fad .’\nThe professor is not alone in his negative estimations regarding Bitcoin. Legendary investor Warren Buffett to JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon have cast views on the cryptocurrency in the past. In response to Buffett’s ‘rat poison squared’ remarks regarding Bitcoin, cryptocurrency mining firm Genesis Mining tweeted a picture that asked whether Buffett had got it wrong about Bitcoin , after getting it wrong about Google and Amazon.\nIn Shiller’s case, though, even though he may not be as optimistic on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, he hasn’t resorted to baseless name calling when it comes to the cryptocurrency market. For now, whether Bitcoin survives the next 100 years remains to be seen. While it may be struggling with its price at the moment, for now it doesn’t look as though it’s going anywhere anytime soon.

Blockchain, Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency News", "text": "How Blockchain Can Make Us Like Online Advertising Again By Telegram\nThe popularity of online advertising has taken a bit of a hit in recent times.\nPretty consistently, online advertising methods like banner ads, pop-ups, and social media ads rank significantly below offline methods like print ads and radio ads when it comes to consumer trust. Advertisement\nTo illustrate the point even further, we only need to take a look at ad blocker downloads. These have been increasing fairly steadily, about 41% year on year .\nDespite this wave of resistance to online ads, companies remain undeterred, and last year online advertising revenue overtook broadcast and cable for the first time ever.\nThere’s clearly a problem here. People seem to be getting more repulsed by online advertising, reacting with annoyance and distrust, but advertisers don’t seem to be getting the message.\nSomething has to be done to change public perception, and restore internet users’ faith in ads. If not, we’ll be stuck with a situation that benefits nobody.\nTo really get to grips with the problem, we need to take a look at why people are so turned off by online ads, and why companies are so set on using advertising methods that seem to be driving customers away. The Current Issues\nRight now, advertising is controlled largely by third-party tech giants like Facebook and Google. These guys absolutely rule the online ad space, accounting for about 73% of all digital advertising in the U.S. and about 83% of growth in that space.\nWhy do they dominate so much? Well, much of it boils down to personal data.\nWhen we use these services, they are able to collect valuable data about us. That’s information about what we typically search for, our interests and hobbies, the things we tend to buy or fantasize about buying.\nThe platforms then use this information to help advertisers target ads on their platform towards people who will be most likely to respond and buy what they’re selling.\nThe problem is, because advertisers go through a third party, they often end up inaccurately targeting ads. Users end up with irritating and irrelevant ads, and advertisers waste their money.\nA better solution would be to personalize ads more, by building direct working relationships between advertisers and buyers, but the centralized, third-party-dominated model doesn’t allow for that.\nThe result of doing this for so long has been a slow erosion of users’ trust in online ads. Many people now associate ads with deception, intrusiveness, and being impersonal.\nWhat’s more, people are generally unhappy about platforms like Facebook having control over their personal data, which they consider an invasion of privacy.\nIn a recent survey , just over half of the respondents said they didn’t trust Facebook, and only 41% trusted the company to obey laws protecting users’ data privacy.\nSo we’re left with a situation where consumers not only dislike the intrusive and impersonal style of most online ads, but also distrust the model that underpins most online advertising.\nThe solution is to change the model, and move away from third-party monopolies to a system where users have greater control and advertisers can work with their prospects more directly.\nThe ideal tool for this could be blockchain technology . How Blockchain Could Save Online Ads\nBlockchain is great for building decentralized networks; systems that challenge centralization and third-party dominance.\nIn the ad space, blockchain could help shift away from Facebook and Google to a model where advertisers can build more personal and effective relationships with users.\nOne company looking at this approach is BAT . They want to use their Basic Attention Token, which can be exchanged between users, content publishers, and advertisers, to bring more fairness to online advertising. This all takes place within their very own browser, Brave.\nAnother company in the space is KindAds. Unlike BAT, they don’t require users to download a special browser.\nKindAds want to give users more control over their data, taking it away from third-party giants. This way, users will have the power to decide which companies can see and use their personal data, and be rewarded in tokens when they do.\nAdvertisers will once again be able to forge more meaningful, direct relationships with customers. They’ll be able to use more personal and pleasant types of advertising as opposed to impersonal, intrusive banner ads and the like.\nThis way, blockchain can help us move to a much more tolerable model of online advertising, one which users actually enjoy and benefit from. This will help turn the tide and make ads more popular, bringing success to advertisers and their consumers at the same time.\nThis content is from a guest author.

Develop a Bitcoin wallet app from scratch\nThere are times when a developer may opt to create a Bitcoin wallet from scratch without using any existing libraries.\nSuch a decision may be down to specific requirements for the app or the limitations of existing libraries.\nTo code a cryptocurrency wallet app development project from scratch requires significant programming skills, and the developer is likely to stumble onto several issues. We recommend reading this helpful article before the starting the project. It should help first time developers avoid many of these traps.\nA difference in with this approach is that the developer needs to address the following: Synchronization of the blockchain network by installing the required APIs or tools; Creating the Bitcoin wallet app, including all the necessary programming; Develop the program to adjust permissions for outgoing and incoming transactions; Writing, testing, and implementing standard programs for the commonly used transaction process steps, for e.g. checking the wallet balance.\nFirst step – Build a great development team\nSince there are quite a range of diverse skills required, a good development team will need people with the following skills: UX/UI designers, who will build the user interface of the wallet; Mobile and backend developers, to work on the main app as well as the mobile version; QA specialists to thoroughly test the Bitcoin wallet app.\nWe recommend that the development team install a full node of the Bitcoin blockchain for this project.\nWhile other approaches can be used, for e.g. pruned node, full SPV node, or SPV node, using a full node is generally the most recommended one.\nThe development team can do this using Bitcoin Core’s RPC , i.e. ‘remote procedure call’. We recommend using NBitcoin for this. The team should first fully synchronize the node, and the subsequent operations can be done using the RPC commands.\nThe ‘initial blockchain downloading’ (IBD) can take more than a day. After it’s complete, the team should start ‘bitcoind’, i.e. the program that implements the Bitcoin protocol for RPC calls.\nHere is a good guideline to help developers learn the necessary commands to manage the wallet in a full node. Simply click this link and you can read it in full here .\nThis approach has a few distinct advantages, namely the following: This is one of the oldest approaches and has been tested by many Bitcoin developers. While not an everyday occurrence, a fork of the Bitcoin network may happen to generate a lot of debate in the community. Using a full node gives any developer the ability to decide which version of the Bitcoin blockchain they want to use should a folk occur. There is good documentation available.\nThere are also some disadvantages, for e.g.: For someone unfamiliar with the Bitcoin Core, the APIs may appear less user-friendly; IBD is a time-consuming affair, but it’s a must for using a full node; There are limits to the number of transactions the wallet can support; Every wallet addition requires a restart of ‘bitcoind’; Only a limited number of wallets can be created.\nDevelopers can add wallet on top of RPC, or use ‘Bitcoin Knots’, i.e. a Bitcoin Core fork created by another Bitcoin developer named ‘luke-jr’.\nThis point onwards, developments can proceed as they do in any other app development, for e.g. setting a password for the app, or integrate a QR code scanner and push-notifications in the mobile app. The Easy Route: Integrate ready-made payment services, or develop a Bitcoin wallet app?\nWhile we have so far discussed how to develop a Bitcoin wallet app using available libraries or by building one wallet from scratch, it’s pertinent to note that for a small business going down either of these routes may not be necessary.\nThere are ready-made Bitcoin payment solutions that small businesses can just integrate into their app.\nBelow are a few examples: Stripe users in the USA can receive Bitcoin payments in USD, following an API integration. Cryptopay Ltd., a UK-based company, allows a small business owner to add Bitcoin payment option to her website. Shopify, using which a small business owner can create her personal store, allows Bitcoin as a payment method. BitPay , the USA-based payment service provider, allows Bitcoin payments, and have mobile solutions for this as well. BitBay is another service provider that allows Bitcoin payment and has an Android app for this. Australia-based BitPOS has a payment platform that accepts Bitcoin. Coinbase Commerce : This is an excellent suite of services! The small business owner needs to create a Coinbase Commerce account, and it’s free. The entrepreneur can accept Bitcoin payment on her website using simple payment buttons and pages. There is also a cool integration with Shopify, and custom integration with Commerce API is also possible. The integration with Shopify is very useful especially for small business owners using shopping carts on their websites. It’s easy to generate the necessary API keys, and there is good documentation Virtual currency platform Coinify has their ‘ Coinify Merchant ‘, using which merchants can accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency payments on their website. There are easy integration options available for many platforms. The payment process flow is automatic. Coinkite , the maker of crypto security hardware, offers Bitcoin payment options through their merchant tool and point-of-sale (POS) payment terminals. My Final Thoughts\nAs I have said before, building the best possible development team is the key to your project’s success. Be sure to outline all the various skillsets that will be required during the planning phase. With any cryptocurrency wallet, your team is going to need to have blockchain experts at the helm.\nWhile there are many challenges to creating a bitcoin wallet the rewards are enormous for those companies who get it right. While no one knows where the cryptocurrency market will be 10 years from now, what is certain is that a number of the big players like Ripple, Ethereum, and possibly Bitcoin will still need the help of cyptocurrency wallets to allow people to use them.\nGetting your Bitcoin wallet up and running will give you a chance to be a big player in this lucrative market.

So far, consumers and corporations have shown a keen interest in cryptocurrency. It seems that situation may come to change fairly soon. Local sources indicate the government is confiscating any hardware related to cryptocurrency mining. The Bitcoin Situation in Venezuela\nOver the past few years, the financial turmoil in Venezuela has become more apparent. Its national currency is losing value fairly quickly. This has caused many different issues for both corporations and consumers alike. It seems even the issuance of the Petro cryptocurrency may not necessarily improve this situation anytime soon.\nDesperate times often call for desperate measures. In the case of Venezuela, citizens are flocking to cryptocurrency mining. Given the rising value of Bitcoin, mining this currency has become more popular. As a result of the country’s access to cheaper electricity, mining Bitcoins seemingly makes perfect sense.\nAt the same time, this type of activity has also received a lot of negative attention. The Venezuelan government officially subsidizes all electricity in the country. Anyone using this resource to mine Bitcoin has become a target for legal repercussions. Various mining operations have been shut down in the past. It now appears this situation will only grow worse as more time progresses. The Government Intervenes Yet Again\nAccording to local outlet Noticiero Digital , things are not evolving in a positive direction. In fact, the Venezuelan government is confiscating any shipments related to cryptocurrency mining. This applies specifically to hardware being imported from other parts of the world. It is another crackdown on Bitcoin mining, albeit a very aggressive countermeasure.\nCourier services have informed clients this measure has been implemented recently. As such, users are advised not to order any Bitcoin mining hardware outside of Venezuela. That creates a big problem, as buying or selling this equipment in the country itself is difficult, if not impossible.\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen what the reasoning behind this development is. Government spokespeople have not issued any official comment regarding this statement. As such, it remains unclear what the officials hope to achieve by taking this drastic approach. At this stage, it seems any cryptocurrency equipment will be confiscated. In the past, harsh action was taking against ASIC units. The new development puts GPUs, motherboards, and even power supplies at risk of confiscation as well. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Regardless of how innovative, capable, or compelling a product is, it’s valueless if it doesn’t resonate with a market that’s willing to pay for it. That’s why companies are paying big dollars to proliferate their brand through advertising. According to data compiled by Statista , companies will spend $218 billion on advertising in 2018, and that number is expected to increase by almost 20% in the next few years.\nIn a crowded marketplace, getting the message out is a top priority.\nOf course, there is no fixed approach to marketing best practices. They change to reflect the cultural and economic context of the day. For example, while television advertising spent several decades as one of the most effective methods for brand proliferation, that trend has moved toward digital platforms as audiences move in mass to online services.\nWhat’s more, this arrangement is facilitating a resurgence in affiliate marketing, a technique that involves a company promoting its products on other platforms and then paying a commission to that platform if it generates user interest. In a digital-first economy where clicks and cross-platform participation are a regular occurrence, this advertising strategy is proving to be uniquely effective. The Rise of Affiliate Marketing\nThe internet is fertile ground for affiliate marketing, and companies are well aware of its potential. Upwards of 80% of all brands use affiliate marketing as part of the advertising strategy. Google Trends reveals that searches related to affiliate marketing have almost doubled in the past four years as more companies and ad agencies explore its implementation. EMarketer reveals that spending on affiliate marketing increased in each of the last four years, and it’s expected to reach almost $7 billion by 2020.\nIn short, the internet is fostering an environment where affiliate marketing is becoming one of the most effective ways for a company to reach its audience. A Bizarre Hindrance\nStrangely, although affiliate marketing is on the rise and the internet is seemingly a perfect incubator for cross-platform collaboration, its growth is being stifled by the industry’s current management structure.\nAffiliate advertising is managed by a network of middlemen that connect companies and platforms to facilitate ad placements. Not only do the middlemen acquire a cut of the commission paid to the publisher, but they also control the actionable data associated with content marketing.\nFrom the perspective of modern advertising structures, affiliate marketing should be a data-driven, measurable initiative that is continuously in flux. Companies should be able to measure the effectiveness of their ad campaign and to make adjustments to ensure that they are receiving the best bang for their buck. Unfortunately, this data is shrouded in mystery, so companies are paying a premium for results that are less than they could be. Freeing the Marketing\nFortunately, there is a solution. The emergence of the blockchain as an enterprise-ready technology means that companies are able to develop new platforms that more directly connect companies and advertising platforms. At the most basic level, the blockchain creates trust in an otherwise trustless environment, and it deems the middleman unnecessary.\nAttrace is a blockchain-based marketplace where merchants and publishers find one another and engage in a direct relationship. Rather than relying on an agency to locate these publishers, companies can do this themselves, and they will benefit from their efforts.\nThese functions are powered by Attrace’s private blockchain, which ensures that the process is secure, transparent, and highly effective. Their build from scratch initiative accounts for every click and sale. In doing so, Attrace isn’t relying on other platforms for their services. Instead, they are building a place where companies and publishers can most effectively collaborate with one another to drive traffic to publishers and to promote quality products.\nThe blockchain produces perfect records that allow companies to see the effectiveness of their ad campaign. They can monitor clicks, sales, and other metrics to ensure investment is paying off, and they can have confidence in that data’s authenticity.\nMoreover, companies save a significant amount of money in fees and commissions. Many affiliate networks charge 10-25% in commissions, but Attrace limits the expenditure to just 0.5%. Using the blockchain’s smart contracts, these commissions are paid instantaneously, so everyone is operating in real-time.\nWhen affiliate marketing works as it should, customers get the products they want, companies gain the sales they desire, and publishers earn the revenue that they desperately need. It’s a rare win-win-win scenario, and that’s good for everyone involved.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "charts, guides & analysis sponsored", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "statista", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T12:20:34.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21e597c7e5fd9f0f1ea3c4128702f1f86a314515", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9TfxkYagJ22Bj4d7f8Z7L0lkns_.pxcuL.5MJm_EcplUdPg2OxOrd6QRth518phD1HRpo58.a0xCrQ52z4dPGga7CDe8gji1CPzQovpizuSYuU", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Where's the Volume?

Although the initial corrective rally from $7,040 came to an end with a slight drop in the price of bitcoin from $7,500 to $7,300, it is possible that BTC tests a support level at $7,800 in the short-term, eyeing an entrance into the $8,000 region. Volume Spike Required\nOn February 6 and April 12, BTC bounced back from the $6,000 region by recording corrective rallies supported by a sudden spike in buy volumes. On April 12, BTC recorded a buy volume of 30,760 BTC, driving its price up from $6,900 to $8,000 in a single 30-minute candle.\nThe momentum generated from that particular spike in buy volume led BTC to secure mid-term momentum, eventually achieving $9,900 and testing the $10,000 support level.\nIn order for BTC to surpass the $7,800 mark and test the $8,500 short-term support level, a major buy volume spike would have to occur in the next 24 hours and push the price of BTC past $8,000. The initial corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,500 was triggered by a daily buy volume of 10,000 BTC, which is substantially lower than the volume seen in previous corrective rallies.\nBTC has not completely recovered from downward trend initiated on May 6. It has failed to break out of the trend on three instances, with the corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,500 being the latest attempt to establish a strong support level for short to mid-term growth.\nIf BTC continues to demonstrate an increase in volume from the $7,550 mark and successfully breaches $7,900 in the next 24 hours, it would allow the dominant cryptocurrency to establish a bottom at $7,040 and begin a strong short-term rally back to the $8,500 mark and eventually test $10,000 in the upcoming weeks.\nHowever, if BTC falls back to the $7,300 mark and re-enters the $7,200 region, a drop to the lower end of $6,000 is likely, and a short-term decline to $6,800 is inevitable. Market Instability\nThe vast majority of cryptocurrencies in the market including Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and small tokens have been following the price movement of bitcoin over the past two weeks, signifying that the market is currently extremely volatile and unstable.\nCryptocurrencies often begin to demonstrate independent price movements in a bull market as investors gain more confidence in the short-term performance of small digital assets. However, the coordinated movement of cryptocurrencies and tokens show that the cryptocurrency market is still in a recovery phase.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T16:19:44.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f67621e8ef423d0ead1f7454ef32e720bf0ec526", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwDFwhutRcnc9HAd_Wn3.8awfnhajdskUirb4R6QeXV786uw_GyEGMrvKV3BzvpzPBnfA6ELR0BRy1Z4EH4WePk2KK8qF4x2.7l5eml9Frgw--", "site_full": "missblockchain.tech", "site": "missblockchain.tech", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "ASK ALICE: How to think about OTC Bitcoin Deals | MissBlockchain", "title_full": "ASK ALICE: How to think about OTC Bitcoin Deals | MissBlockchain", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://missblockchain.tech/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-6.11.31-PM-282x300.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f67621e8ef423d0ead1f7454ef32e720bf0ec526", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwDFwhutRcnc9HAd_Wn3.8awfnhajdskUirb4R6QeXV786uw_GyEGMrvKV3BzvpzPBnfA6ELR0BRy1Z4EH4WePk2KK8qF4x2.7l5eml9Frgw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alice Hlidkova", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "ASK ALICE: How to think about OTC Bitcoin Deals | MissBlockchain", "text": "\nPosted by Alice Hlidkova | 31 May, 2018 | Uncategorized | 0 |\nAnswer :\n1. Evaluate KYC Process: Make sure you are talking to a real person that has real interest in BTC with real money/coins that have real POF/POC. KYC is only “mandated and legal in the fiat world but unnecessary, nonsensical, detrimental to funding and now ILLEGAL in the pure crypto space,” says Jay Best, token and due diligence strategist based in London, UK.\nHe recommends the following :\n“- Modern coins use functions such as zk-STARKs to protect wallet balances and transactions which renders KYC utterly nonsensical\n– KYC creates a host of severe and unnecessary legal risks such as disclosure of sensitive client data when hacked\n– KYC is an absolute no-go for any serious crypto investor (>90% of ICO funding) and severely reduces funding\n– Under the GDPR, EU Regulation 2016/679, processing of personal data of EU natural persons for unregulated uses such as coins or tokens that do not involve fiat or securities is now ILLEGAL!\nIf you have any competence in this space, you stay safe, stay away from KYC and instead focus on a solid and well structured offering that minimizes legal risks, compliance requirements and costs while maximizing accessibility and funding.”\n2. Think LONG CHAINS: Let the DEAL MAKERS do the talk, have faith that you did your own due diligence and you are working with honest/professional people.\n3. Understand EXPECTATIONS: Be realistic, if you get 5bp on a 10k BTC deal, your share will be close to US$50K, DO NOT EXPECT to get 1% for you.Escrow services like TMF or Noble will get 25 bp, NO, YOU WONT GET GET AS MUCH as them.\n4. Evaluate POF/POC: Use a reliable ESCROW SERVICE, let buyer & seller do their KYC/AML and once they know each other the POF/POC will follow with confidence and trust in each other.

According to a recent interview by CNBC, he believes Bitcoin [BTC] is still an investment and a good buy.\nThe Bitcoin market has fallen immensely in the past weeks. However, Spencer Bogart had given an outline of a bullish act when looked at in long terms.\nHe said:\n“The long-term thesis is very much intact… The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occuring…Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk.”\nHe even went to the extremes of saying that BTC is the only coin investors and traders should buy, as it peaks into the mainstream.\nThe Venture Capitalist partnered at Blockchain Capital said:\n“Every major bank is trying to do something in the space.”\nHe further added:\n“Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive.”\nCurrently, there are negative performances in the cryptocurrency market and it’s continuing on that path. It surged around $19,500 last December and has fallen to more than 50% since the January 2018. Bitcoin is trading at $7471 with an increase of 2.58% in the past 24-hours and has seen a downfall of 9% in the past week, at the time of writing.\nHe is known as the first analyst of Wall Street to cover and analyze Blockchain and Bitcoin Technology. Bogart had recommended the investors to sell the coins – Tron, NEO, and IOTA.\nHe added:\n“A lot of those tokens are overvalued. They could go up significantly, but they also have a significant headwind.”\nHe also suggests investing in alternative coins such as Ripple [XRP], Ethereum [ETH], EOS, and Bitcoin Cash [BTCH], those which he had called neutral. He advised the investors to HODL those coins at the present, stressing on the cons of relative valuation.\nHe further mentioned that he is careful with the coin, Ethereum. He said that it has overhangs due to plenty of ICOs.\nBogart forecasted that BTC will end at least above $10,000 by December 2018, mentioning that the large-cap coin will face turbulence in the market.\nquasim ali, a cryptozoologist on Twitter commented:\n“Bcash is on a losing streak as well. How about we FODL that and HODL btc.”\nRobert Almeida commented:\n“I’m HOFO-DLING.”\nShawn replied:\n“HODL is a term created by whales. If I had simply hoddled Id be where everyone else is. No thanks. I’m not a sheep and that’s why I move my BTC in and out of Fiat. I’ve pulled 10s of thousands in cash out while still buying back in and ending up with more BTC. # ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian stutland sarah rodrigues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain capital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "spencer", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T00:16:51.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfd48144af63b0ff07795ada39d4521f6abf5591", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyGferaxkv8AoXBJg7UYyvo-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfd48144af63b0ff07795ada39d4521f6abf5591", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyGferaxkv8AoXBJg7UYyvo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nWe are going to pay you for each invited user and for friends they will lead.

The mobile app allows users to purchase event tickets easily, transfer them, and get rewarded for bringing friends, sharing events, and more. Blockparty’s native token, BOXX, has gone live within the mobile app and can be both used on tickets and earned via the platform’s reward scheme, the company announced on Wednesday.\nBlockparty aims to improve the ticket purchasing process for concerts, sporting events, and music festivals, by leveraging blockchain technology to address the issues and challenges that have been plaguing the industry including bots, ticket fraud, lengthy event check-in protocols, and predatory secondary market resellers.\n“We want to rid the world of ticket bots and scalpers. We also want people to be able to easily transfer event tickets and safely purchase secondary tickets,” said Shiv Madan, CEO of Blockparty and former COO at a division of Time Inc.’s music brand NME.\n“We’re proud to be able to offer a blockchain platform that can do that, and we are incredibly excited for festival goers, music lovers, sports fans, and all live event attendees alike to experience what we’ve built as we roll out marquee event partnerships over the coming months.” Event details screen, Blockparty app\nBlockparty eliminates the possibility of fraud and counterfeit tickets by using blockchain technology to ensure ticket ownership and attendee identity. The platform utilizes secure, encrypted facial recognition and fingerprint technology to validate tickets at the gate and ensure that only the true owner of a ticket can access it while allowing user identity to remain completely anonymized.\nFor event organizers, ticketing companies, venues, and performers, Blockparty allows them to deliver tickets directly to customers, set prices, rewards, and discounts, as well as earn a share of secondary ticket sales revenues. Furthermore, the platform’s smart contracts eliminate bulk buying by bots and unfair re-pricing on secondary markets.\nThe public launch of the Blockparty mobile app follows the first use of the platform at Elements Lakewood Music Festival over Memorial Day weekend. Each ticket to the event was represented by a non-fungible ERC721 token. Each ticket’s smart contract included data points such as a digital fingerprint to safeguard proof of ownership.\nBlockparty’s founding team is comprised of both blockchain experts and veterans of the entertainment industry including Andy Goldstein, former COO of cryptocurrency payment company Metal Pay, and CTO Rikesh Thapa, founder and former CEO of BitOverflow, a blockchain energy startup.\nAdvisors to the startup include Aaron Chawla who’s been involved in the organization of Coachella, Lollapalooza and the Super Bowl halftime show, as well as Greg Consiglio, former executive vice president of Ticketmaster.

During a recent interview with CNBC, he noted that despite the fact that cryptocurrency prices are highly correlated with Bitcoin, this could end soon. “Bitcoin may end up being the Napster of digital assets. It’s shown what’s possible. But Spotify, iTunes, Pandora engaged the system and regulators, and they ruled the day.”– @bgarlinghouse speaking at #Codecon watch the full interview now. https://t.co/IaclqUntrH\nHe was quoted as saying;\nThere is a very high correlation between the price of XRP and BTC.\nThis fact, according to Garlinghouse, is despite the fact that the two are independent open-sourced technologies. Garlinghouse told CNBC’s Power Lunch on Wednesday that over a period, rational markets will emerge and price behaviors will reflect that.\nHe seemed hopeful that the market would soon behave in a manner that best reflects the solid cryptocurrency projects rather than speculation. The entire market had taken a colossal hit this year with growing concerns on regulations and possible government crackdowns, which are largely said to be the reason why the total market capitalization fell by more than 50% in 2018.\nXRP has lost a significant share of its value prompting critics to label Ripple as the worst performer of 2018. While the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin, and Ethereum had all lost close to 40% of their value each, Ripple lost 74%. In 2017, Ripple started the year valued at less than a penny, but later XRP skyrocketed 35,000%. On January 8th, 2018 XRP hit a high near $3.45 at the time of this writing was trading at 62 cents.\nRipple is currently developing a network that will enable faster global financial payments. On the other hand, XRP is the name to the digital token that will be used by financial institutions in this network to facilitate faster transactions.\nRecently, a London-based broker and international payment provider firm noted that Ripple (XRP) could be a game changer in the financial world following a successful pilot test. Currencies Direct say that it used Ripple’s xRapid technology to send and receive money from banking institutions in the US, Europe, and Mexico, in seconds down from three to five days.\nThis new development was made in the midst of a wave of adoptions with Kuwait’s most prominent Islamic lender announcing that they will be joining Ripple’s network. Kuwait Finance House decided to join RippleNet to lower the cost and increase the speed of cross-border payments, adding to companies like MoneyGram, which are already testing XRP for cross-border payments.\nGarlinghouse also said that he believes that 99% of cryptocurrencies will not survive the next ten years. This prediction, he explains, is because many of the cryptocurrency projects available today fail to solve a problem. Its important to note here that there are more than 1500 cryptocurrencies in circulation today .\nMany of these cryptocurrencies have no proven use cases. They also stand accused of being plots of fleecing investors through the blockchain-based fundraising model, Initial Coin offering. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had warned investors about potential ICO scams and pump and dump schemes.

This is according to Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of the second-biggest altcoin, Ripple . Garlinghouse was speaking during the Recode Code Conference where he was one of the members of a four-person panel discussing cryptocurrencies. Ripple Superior To Bitcoin\nWhile Napster pioneered the digital music distribution industry, it was overtaken by other more technologically advanced platforms such as iTunes, Spotify and Pandora which have gone on to dominate the market and gain much success. These new platforms gained success where Napster didn’t because they were able to work with regulatory authorities to solve real problems, Garlinghouse broke down his argument.\nIn the same way, Bitcoin pioneered the crypto revolution but other more technologically advanced digital currencies are better. Garlinghouse views Bitcoin as unable to function as a replacement for fiat currencies, its original purpose. Using Bitcoin for everyday transactions such as buying coffee is not practical as the transactions take upwards of twenty minutes and the transaction costs amount to ‘twice the price of the coffee.’\nNot surprisingly, Garlinghouse is confident that Ripple is a much better alternative to Bitcoin. Ripple’s blockchain can process transactions in just four seconds, among the fastest execution speeds in the crypto industry. Ripple’s transactions also cost a negligible fraction of the amount transacted, another advantage over Bitcoin whose transactions have become increasingly expensive over time.\nThis isn’t the first time Garlinghouse is tearing into Bitcoin, having referred to Bitcoin as a crypto that has been overtaken by technology on several instances. He has also criticized most cryptocurrencies in the past for their lack of real-world utility. According to Garlinghouse, any cryptocurrency that does not solve a business problem or provide real utility to its users is a bad currency.\nRipple burst onto the scene in 2017 after it became the best performing crypto, rising by over 30,000% to briefly dethrone Ethereum as the most valuable altcoin. However, it has also taken the worst hit among the top 10 cryptos this year as the market experienced a downward spiral. Ripple currently stands behind Bitcoin and Ethereum and currently trades at around $0.65, a great decline from its all-time high when it traded at over $3.8.\nRipple has also faced a lot of criticism by crypto enthusiasts who view it as a centralized crypto, which directly defies Satoshi Nakamoto’s founding principle. While Ripple and its community have come out fiercely denying this, it hasn’t stopped many from holding this view. This has led many to speculate that Ripple will eventually be classified as a security by the SEC when it finally makes its ruling. Ripple is also facing a lawsuit by a crypto trader who accuses the company of selling unregistered securities which is against the law.

That’s what cryptocurrency is becoming. It’s becoming a way to sort of de-risk yourself from credit risk in the banking industry.”\nBecause cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated and allow investors to move their money off the balance sheets of banks and decrease credit risks, Stutland thinks they may be using bitcoin as a safe haven from the stock market despite the volatility of the former to avoid credit risks by putting their money in a more “off-grid” position.\n“Bitcoin is a way to for investors to basically move their money off the balance sheets of banks and into their own wallets,” he added. “Essentially storing their money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency.” Source: CBOE\nWhile bitcoin’s reputation as a volatile cryptocurrency may give the impression that stock traders would shun it in favor of a more stable haven, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton pointed out that these days bitcoin is actually less volatile than the VIX , something that may come as a surprise to many.\n“Just recently the volatility in bitcoin was not as great as the volatility we’ve seen in other securities, such as the VIX product,” said Clayton.\nThe benefits of avoiding credit risk plus the median stability provided by bitcoin compared to the stock market overall may have turned bitcoin into a leading indicator in the stock market.\nIf true, the implications are huge, meaning that the bitcoin price is actually a marker by which traders can predict stock market behavior. As credit risk increases, volatility in the marketplace does as well. Time will tell if the analysis is accurate, but if it is, the stock market is in for a bearish trend over the next few weeks.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian stutland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T03:34:57.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "251ae6533c82677276f1da38eb210caa39a8e481", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTbPjlKUUddo3ge0csqBShhXtNUXeXfCTR6vvCY90nJQ7uSJKjc3OYAdI3oHGbg_zqw2Po_SoP59dGY7lW124.e", "site_full": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "site": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Is Bitcoin (BTC) Out of The Woods Yet? ⋆ Tech Talk", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin (BTC) Out of The Woods Yet? ⋆ Tech Talk", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.196, "main_image": "https://beat.10ztalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Is-Bitcoin-BTC-Out-of-The-Woods-Yet.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "251ae6533c82677276f1da38eb210caa39a8e481", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTbPjlKUUddo3ge0csqBShhXtNUXeXfCTR6vvCY90nJQ7uSJKjc3OYAdI3oHGbg_zqw2Po_SoP59dGY7lW124.e", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin (BTC) Out of The Woods Yet? ⋆ Tech Talk", "text": "OldTwitter\nOn the 4H Chart for Bitcoin ( BTC ), it can be seen that the price could still drop to the support line near a price of $6,900 in order to complete the three bounces pattern and establish a firm ground for the next rally.

A fall to $6,900, if it does occur, might be a slow one, extended all the way to 6 th June, 2018. This would coincide with a popular theory that states that Bitcoin (BTC) prices complete alternating bullish and bearish cycles by the 6 th of every month. This time it will be completion of the short term bearish cycle and should lead to a short term bullish cycle after the 6 th of June, 2018. This could most likely be the beginning of the next bullish phase for Bitcoin (BTC).\nThe big picture continues to remain intact and Bitcoin (BTC) seems to have almost completed a three bounces pattern. Next week will be crucial for Bitcoin (BTC) as it will determine the direction the price will move after completing this pattern. It is possible for Bitcoin (BTC) to trade sideways for a while before finding buyers to begin a new bullish phase. Technical as well as fundamental indicators are all in favor of Bitcoin (BTC) this time but the market sentiment continues to be negative. Renowned Bitcoin (BTC) critic, Peter Brandt recently tweeted about how when a while back he called Bitcoin (BTC) bearish everyone attacked him, but now that he is calling Bitcoin (BTC) bullish, most people are still attacking him! He does have a point though. The majority seldom get it right. It is a zero sum game; somebody has to lose in order for others to win.

The move is designed to increase the amount of institutional capital making its way through the crypto space.\nChief executive officer of Bittrex Bill Shihara says the exchange has been working on this partnership for months. “It’s been a long path,” he commented. “It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex; it’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general, and I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.”\nDue to regulatory uncertainty surrounding virtual currencies, many established financial institutions continue to associate them with money laundering and related criminal activity, and have chosen to avoid them altogether. Last February, for example, customers who tried to purchase digital currency through Citigroup were treated to serious delays and cancelled transactions after the investment firm made the decision to bar users from buying crypto using their debit cards or checking accounts.\nThis decision was later replicated by establishments like Chase and Bank of America, both of which implemented bans preventing customers from purchasing cryptocurrencies on major exchanges. Thus, many virtual currency marketplaces still only allow customers to trade between digital assets, rather than dollar for crypto or vice versa.\nHowever, some banks are beginning to show signs of change in both attitude and business protocol, and have become more welcoming of cryptocurrencies. Popular digital currency exchange Coinbase has recently developed partnerships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the United States. The company has even garnered a Barclays PLC bank account in the United Kingdom .\nNoble Bank International in San Juan, Puerto Rico, also took over banking duties for Bitfinex in 2017 after the exchange’s relationship with Wells Fargo came to a sudden end.\nDiscussing the needs of traditional banks, Shihara went on to say, “They really do look and pour through the entire business. They want to make sure we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes and that we’ve got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything.

Prior, bitcoin had been trading for this amount during the late evening of Tuesday, May 29, only to fall to $7,400 and then $7,300 the following day. While it’s not worth breaking out the champagne just yet, investors are breathing a sigh of relief now that the market is showing small signs of recovery.\nBitcoin has been under serious pressure over the last few days, with new resistance developed at the $7,600 level. One source predicted that the currency could have easily reached a low of approximately $7,040 before any bullish signs showed their heads, but now it appears those signs are emerging sooner than anticipated.\nOne reason for the alleged spike could be the upcoming Russia World Cup. The event is slated to boost the bitcoin price back into the $8,000 range, or possibly even the $9,000 range due to specific financial restriction that may require bitcoin use. The game is currently scheduled to take place in two weeks on June 14, and Russia will face off against Saudi Arabia.\nDigital payments in Russia have become something of an enigma in recent years. U.S. payments giants like Visa and MasterCard have ultimately denied many citizens in the region credit card services due to U.S. sanctions implemented roughly four years ago. At press time, both companies have found ways around these sanctions and account for nearly 90 percent of Russia’s overall transactions, but there’s still plenty of friction.\nThus, many have simply turned to bitcoin and various cryptocurrencies to pay their way to the sporting event. Some hotels in the Russian city of Kaliningrad, which is a host city for many of the tournament’s upcoming games, are accepting bitcoin along with various airlines and travel agents. Bars will also be accepting cryptocurrency payments for customers looking to enjoy celebration drinks.\nIn the long run, bitcoin payments have decreased over the last year due to increases in transaction fees. Overall, the number of payments has fallen by half from 400,000 to 200,000, but there’s still a powerful customer ratio.\nThorsten Koeppl, professor of economics at Queen’s University in Canada, recently commented:\n“The value of bitcoin is partly driven by its potential as a payments tool, and before the fees rose along with the price, there were people using bitcoin for international transfers. This has become more expensive to do now, but the price is still being supported.”\nGranted people continue to use bitcoin as a means of payment and exchange, the price could continue to go up. Despite growing fees and a slow transaction rate, if there is a need (and above all, a demand) for bitcoin, we will continue to see relevant price spikes and bursts in the coin’s value. One of the reasons bitcoin’s price has dropped significantly since December of last year could be its fall in payments usage, and if investors and enthusiasts want to see these numbers change, they’ll look to bitcoin over cash and plastic to take care of their purchase requirements.

Tucker has penned an article to accompany a little-reported research paper that was published last October. The economics writer met with one of the paper’s authors recently to discuss the threat posed to the Bitcoin network by quantum computing. Quantum Computing Poses Little Real Threat to Bitcoin\nAfter meeting with Gavin K. Brennen, a researcher at the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore, Tucker has concluded that quantum computing was not nearly the fatalistic threat that many tout it to be to cryptocurrencies.\nQuantum computers have often been cited as an irrefutable kill switch for Bitcoin. The idea is that quantum machines, capable of processing data hundreds of times faster than the most advanced computers today, could either brute force signatures in little time or solve proof-of-work algorithms fast enough to pose a threat to the security of the Bitcoin network. This would render Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies entirely useless.\nAlthough Brennan et al. don’t entirely refute this notion in their lengthy paper titled ‘ Quantum attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them ,’ they do conclude that the threat is not nearly as fatalistic as many perceive it. In fact, given that quantum computing is still being developed, the authors believe that there is plenty of time to protect networks against it.\nIn the companion article published by the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) on Monday, Tucker praises the cryptocurrency community ’s adeptness at problem solving:\n“If there is a known problem, there are people working on solutions, with tremendous professional awards accruing to the winner.”\nHe states that the adaptivity of a decentralised governance model excels at developing solutions to problems, particularly when the rewards for doing so are as great as they are with Bitcoin.\nIn the AIER article, Tucker summarises the position of the paper’s authors. When addressing the issue of quantum machines dominating proof-of-work, he references the original material:\n“Future improvements to quantum technology allowing gate speeds up to 100GHz could allow quantum computers to solve the PoW about 100 times faster than current technology. However, such a development is unlikely in the next decade, at which point classical hardware may be much faster, and quantum technology might be so widespread that no single quantum enabled agent could dominate the PoW problem.”\nHe then addresses the threat of quantum computer brute forcing signatures. He admits that this threat is ‘more real,’ but is ‘not without solutions.’ These solutions are ‘within reach of programmers today’ and there is still the issue of the ten year head start developers have for creating more robust methods to protect against the perceived threat:\n“Moreover, there are ten years of lead time to get there and adapt them to the protocol.”\nIn concluding his article, Brennan states that he believes the ‘quantum threat to Bitcoin is mostly a red-herring.’ He states that the strong incentive to constantly increase the network’s security, along with the collective minds working on it makes any issues entirely fixable.\nThe closing paragraph of the article is so wonderfully put, you’ll excuse me for including it verbatim:\n“As I listened to the paper, and his proposed solutions, it struck me how precise and intense is the brain trust behind this technology as compared with, for example, the Federal Reserve, the banking system, and existing fiat currency. The problems in the fiat status quo are enormous enough to fill whole libraries (starting with certain obvious problems: no one knows how much money the system produces, or how much crisis risk is present at any time, not even the people charged with managing the system). The problems revealed themselves in 2008. The system has not been repaired in a way that can prevent a repeat of that experience.”\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "uncategorized jeffrey a. t", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin k. brennen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "quantum computing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national university of singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre for quantum technologies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T19:56:27.172+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "83153cf414e1ca0b749e3a690f8e733e58ed8aa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkz76hdVbbXry5oV93jZZCb_KpAys6P4WiBn2rKgfvI_FqNRY6Jfm4Sto65q1Zw6RaadRyNjQygFs-", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Square Adds $8 Billion in Value With Help From M&A, Bitcoin", "title_full": "Square Adds $8 Billion in Value With Help From M&A, Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/twlyXP0FodLIj7h4cJLANw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/367bc2bd9f6494214b20ce395e7ce62c", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "83153cf414e1ca0b749e3a690f8e733e58ed8aa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkz76hdVbbXry5oV93jZZCb_KpAys6P4WiBn2rKgfvI_FqNRY6Jfm4Sto65q1Zw6RaadRyNjQygFs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lily Katz", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Square Adds $8 Billion in Value With Help From M&A, Bitcoin", "text": "Square Adds $8 Billion in Value With Help From M&A, Bitcoin Lily Katz, Selina Wang More Shares of Square Inc., which more than doubled in value last year, are still on a roll and show no sign of slowing down. The payments firm’s stock has surged almost 50 percent, adding about $8 billion in market value, since it rolled out Bitcoin trading in November for customers of its Cash App, which lets users transfer money to friends and family. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has repeatedly shared his enthusiasm for digital currencies, saying earlier this month that “the internet deserves a native currency.” But San Francisco-based Square has gained on more than optimism for cryptocurrencies. The shares have rallied 25 percent since the company said in April it was buying website-builder Weebly for $365 million, the firm’s biggest-ever acquisition. The deal is a key step in Square’s strategy to build its online and e-commerce offerings for small and medium-size businesses. It also gives Square another recurring revenue stream and base of new customers. More from Bloomberg.com: U.S. Allies Hit Back as Trump Revokes Steel Tariff Reprieve The stock closed Thursday at $58.25, a new record high, shortly before the company raised its annual revenue forecast to reflect the impact of the Weebly transaction. Dorsey’s crypto fever and appetite for deals have contributed to Square’s surge, but a steady stream of positive earnings surprises has also fueled bullish sentiment. The most recently reported quarter marked the 10th consecutive period that the firm topped analysts’ sales projections. Square’s gross payment volume could reach $409 billion in 2026, or 4.1 percent of total U.S. payment volume, RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin predicted in a May 22 note to clients. “Square’s integrated hardware, software and services solutions position the company to benefit from ongoing card acceptance penetration at smaller merchants while gaining share against existing solutions that lag from a technological or efficiency-basis,” wrote Perlin, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.

Kathryn Haun, a professor on the Stanford Graduate School of Business and board member at Coinbase and HackerOne, took the place that there are parallels between the place cryptocurrency is in the present day and the web in its early phases. Huan identified that within the early days of the web there have been requires a single regulator which is going on with crypto now and that if rules had been developed final 12 months they’d already be outdated because of the rise of initial coin offerings (ICO). “ We don’t need regulation to outpace understanding, ” she stated. It was Ripple CEO Brad Garinghouse although who grabbed headlines when he described Bitcoin as an concept that has already been handed on by expertise. He known as Bitcoin transformative and gave it credit score for launching the cryptocurrency revolution however that it’ll most likely find yourself changing into the Napster of cryptocurrency. “We may come to find that bitcoin is kind of the Napster of digital assets, this is transformative technology, but Spotify and iTunes and Pandora rule the day because they engaged with regulators to solve a real problem,” Garlinghouse stated referring to regulatory issues that international locations world wide are nonetheless combating relating to classifying what Bitcoin is. All Cryptocurrency is Bad Currency Garlinghouse went on to criticize the utility of Bitcoin as a forex. He identified that gradual transaction occasions and excessive charges make Bitcoin inconceivable as a substitute for fiat forex. He instructed the viewers, “People talk about using bitcoin to buy coffee, The average bitcoin transaction can take as much as 20 minutes. And the transaction cost is going to double the price of your coffee.” These aren’t new opinions for Garlinghouse who up to now has known as all cryptocurrency “bad currency” for his or her lack of utility, utilizing an identical instance on the time he stated “I don’t call this cryptocurrency… It’s not currency. I can’t go to Starbucks or Amazon and use—”. Garlinghouse concluded by saying that digital forex solely has worth in the event that they both resolve an issue within the enterprise world or enhance their utility to unravel shopper issues.

In 2018, altcoins mostly rallied in lockstep with Bitcoin, with rare exceptions. However, the trend may soon turn, as market participants realize the fundamental differences between Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\"There's a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies,\" Garlinghouse said in an interview for CNBC’s Power Lunch.\n\"It's early, over time you'll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that,\" Garlinghouse said.\nGarlinghouse is a believer in the planned obsolescence of Bitcoin - an asset that ushered in the age of decentralized digital coins, but may not survive in the future.\nhttps://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1001963456600436736\nThe price of XRP is formed by a complex interaction of trading against several assets. Bitcoin has a large share of around 30% of all trades, but is almost matched by volumes denominated in Korean Won. Also, XRP has seen a steady inflow of Tethers (USDT), making up more than 20% of volumes. While USDT does not reflect the attitudes of US-based investors, it resembles direct trading against the dollar.\nXRP has seen the greatest appreciation upon mentioning a potential fiat on-ramp through Coinbase. Unfortunately, this avenue is closed for now, and Ripple is relatively difficult to acquire, at least for mainstream US-based investors.\nXRP has fallen to $0.61, but bullish predictions see it rise as high as $10 toward the end of the year, provided there is enough demand. In the bear market of 2018, XRP was one of the worst performing assets, still down about 70% from its peak, with no signs of recovery.\nThe popularity of Ripple is also increasing with more than 20 partnerships signed at the beginning of 2018, pointed out Garlinghouse. Ripple aims to help banks achieve frictionless, cheaper cross-border transactions. However, the usage of actual XRP coins bought on the open market to achieve this is under question.\nGarlinghouse believes the public would move beyond speculation, once they understand the different features and use cases of coins.\n\"It's still a nascent industry, the speculation in the market dominates the trading activity,\" Garlinghouse said. \"I think it's a matter of time until people better understand the different use cases.\"\nThe use case of XRP is unique, and the asset does not have the same blockchain as Bitcoin, instead using a series of servers to verify the distributed ledger every few seconds. This allows for fast, free transactions. But in the real world, usage of XRP coins is limited. × ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brad garlinghouse altcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine masters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:13:01.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40596438571fb3f6c895c08a9a40845e95f9cece", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1U2hBvlyra7YG733AVMKTo-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40596438571fb3f6c895c08a9a40845e95f9cece", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1U2hBvlyra7YG733AVMKTo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nBecome the person, who referred the largest number of new users till the end of June 1, 2019 and we will give you 0.3 BTC.
