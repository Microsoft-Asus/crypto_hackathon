Ask 27-year-old British businessman Jonathan Levin, co-founder and chief executive officer of Chainalysis, one of the hottest companies in the upcoming digital coinage market.\nAt its initial stage in 2014, Chainalysis did everything possible to track back transactions and track suspicious money in the blockchain, mainly for the benefit of US government searches that chased scammers. Now, Levin is working with multibillion-dollar financial institutions and they want to know directly who they are dealing with when they interact with millions of daycare owners every day.\nThis is why a promising new industry has emerged, which aims to maintain confidence in Bitcoin and other currencies, continuously watching the various blockchains in the world. Indicative of this promise was Chainalysis’s announcement last week that it has raised $ 16 million in a round of funding led by Benchmark, the same venture capital in San Francisco, which was betting and won by companies like eBay and Uber.\nBenchmark was closely following the bankruptcy process as early as 2014 when it invested in the bitcoin storage startup, Xapo, and founded a Bitcoin investment fund. Chainalysis’s software began as a program that relied heavily on the human factor to make connections between different Bitcoin accounts and follow the traces of money to reveal the criminals who used digital cash.\nToday, it is mostly automated and capable of making decisions about the risks of individual Bitcoin accounts by examining their transaction history so that businesses involved in crypto-notes can be sure they work with legitimate users and not with users who launder money or other scammers. The company offers the first real-time wallet scan, Levin says. “If you are preparing to receive money, you can quickly decide whether or not to edit it”.\nThere are some small competitors in the market whose tools are trying to do the same, but better, including Neutrino.nu, which was created by the former head of technology of the Hacking Team. The biggest competitor, however, is Elliptic, a UK-based company that raised $ 5 million in finance in 2016. It took another round last year, including San Francisco’s Signal Fire venture capital.\nHowever, Chainanalysis, which won a spot in Forbes’s FinTech 50 list earlier this year, emerges as the leader of the herd. This is thanks to its growing customer base that includes some important US government customers, such as the FBI.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris dunkan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chainalysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan levin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chainalysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T18:18:24.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f5371a7f2d445d12cce5cd81853c01482e977b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdGA2XZgLpCxpGizwwtykzQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will bitcoin Die because of global Regulations?", "title_full": "Will bitcoin Die because of global Regulations?", "published": "2018-05-20T17:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f5371a7f2d445d12cce5cd81853c01482e977b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdGA2XZgLpCxpGizwwtykzQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tokenuss", "published": "2018-05-20T17:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin Die because of global Regulations?", "text": "I think not, since it is currently increasing and becoming the official currency, I believe that it is impossible to do this for many reasons.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T13:23:59.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "212bd5de68473fe226387c46b177061a55187642", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaVCPxuJt_1DzqaQwpNLZEk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Depending your future in bitcoin...", "title_full": "Depending your future in bitcoin...", "published": "2018-05-20T17:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "212bd5de68473fe226387c46b177061a55187642", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaVCPxuJt_1DzqaQwpNLZEk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tokenuss", "published": "2018-05-20T17:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Depending your future in bitcoin...", "text": "They will not end, since this currency is officially registered.

He covers energy markets, mining, pharmaceuticals and some cryptocurrencies. Follow Torjus The predicted increase in energy usage could have a serious environmental impact (Source: Getty) Torjus Roberg\nA study has found that by the end of this year, bitcoin mining could be using as much as half a per cent of the world's global energy usage, making it a significant threat to renewable energy efforts and potentially making it an inefficient investment.\nBitcoin mining, which has received increased interest from both the public and investors over the past few years, is currently estimated to use at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity which is already almost as high as the energy consumption of Ireland.\nHowever, the study found that this figure could potentially triple to 7.67 gigawatts as early as the end of 2018, which puts the consumption to roughly the same amount of energy the entire country of Austria consumes.\nAlex de Vries, the author of the study and blockchain specialist at PwC , concluded: “The bitcoin development community is experimenting with solutions such as the Lightning Network to improve the throughput of the network, which may alleviate the situation. For now, however, Bitcoin has a big problem and it is growing fast.”\nRead more : Visa UK's former chief executive Marc O'Brien joins first crypto bank\nThis could potentially have a harsh impact on environmental policy as the UK, for example, is currently not investing enough in clean energy methods and has hit a 10-year low.\nHowever, several experts have criticised de Vries findings, claiming that there is not enough data collected to make a firm conclusion, but although the number can be disputed, it is still a process that requires a lot of energy.\nThe so-called mining process of bitcoin involves computers with the necessary software to solve complex mathematical problems. When each problem is solved, a new block is added to the blockchain and the miner receives bitcoins as a reward.\nThe reason why the process requires so much energy is because computers need to time stamp transactions in the blockchain, making a ledger of transactions, so that it can be made sure that the same coins are not spent twice.\nBased on de Vries research, if the price of bitcoin goes down and the amount of electricity needed to mine goes up, bitcoin could become an inefficient investment, causing miners to shut down.\nWarren Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, has received a lot of criticism lately from crypto miners for his comments on bitcoin being a non-productive investment, and the crypto mining company Genesis Mining put up a billboard outside Buffett's office.\nThe billboard said: “Warren: you said you were wrong about Google and Amazon . Maybe you're wrong about bitcoin?”\nBuffett called bitcoin “rat poison squared” and he is one of several prominent business figures who has expressed their lack of faith in the digital currency, among them billionaire and investor Bill Gates .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://iptc.org/std/rNews/2011-10-07#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torjus roberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T17:40:05.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fdc50828c2e46b9ca829ba45ea7ef94559cfa0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo0e_6ONJm6lQspOio0wO00QD_eiYkibgY4csHZGn4tW_TqBbbFEcaN3FOAa7U14da1lCkoECFLgDNb7FmzjwX0", "site_full": "thefinance.sg", "site": "thefinance.sg", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/thefinancesg", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "TheFinance.sg", "title": "Bitcoin Weekly: The $40b Consensys Dump", "title_full": "Bitcoin Weekly: The $40b Consensys Dump", "published": "2018-05-20T17:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thefinance.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.nets_560C166E53D46BC953C81D9-5b7387a06011eea55a37931775a0001b2efc6e91.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fdc50828c2e46b9ca829ba45ea7ef94559cfa0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo0e_6ONJm6lQspOio0wO00QD_eiYkibgY4csHZGn4tW_TqBbbFEcaN3FOAa7U14da1lCkoECFLgDNb7FmzjwX0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ProButterfly", "published": "2018-05-20T17:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Weekly: The $40b Consensys Dump", "text": "Posted by ProButterfly | May 20, 2018 | Investing | 0 |\nConsensys 2018 is over.

The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumnus, who turned bitFlyer Inc. into Japans largest Bitcoin exchange, is scooping up traders and bankers from both his old employer and former rivals as he embarks on an ambitious international expansion. Kanos team, which includes a former fixed-income desk head at Barclays Plc and an ex-senior private banker at Credit Suisse Group AG, has doubled to more than 150 people in the past six months and is on pace to top 300 before year-end. While hes far from the only crypto boss to poach talent from Wall Street firms, Kano has been among the most aggressive in taking advantage of recent Japanese regulations that make the finance-to-crypto leap less daunting. The nations virtual currency exchanges are now licensed by Japans securities watchdog, giving the venues an official stamp of approval thats largely absent from countries like the U.S. and Britain. For Kano, that makes Japan the ideal base for an increasingly global operation. My target is to be number one in the world, the former derivatives and convertible bonds trader said in an interview from his office in Midtown Tower, the tony Tokyo skyscraper thats also home to Blackstone Group and Bain & Co. To get there, I need to grow headcount. And those with the best skills come from global banks. Read more about Japans unique crypto exchange regulations here. Kanos four-year-old exchange is already the worlds fourth largest crypto venue by turnover, after BitMex, Binance and OKEx, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from exchanges, Coinhills and Coinmarketcap.com. Transactions on bitFlyer averaged about $2 billion a day during late April and early May, thanks in large part to Bitcoin margin contracts popular with Japanese day-traders. The venues users have tripled in the past year to 2 million. On top of existing locations in Tokyo, San Francisco and Luxembourg, Kano is eyeing new offices in Africa, South America, Australia and other parts of Asia. Hes also expanding beyond crypto trading to businesses that include digital payments and a brokerage-advisory service for investors and startups interested in initial coin offerings. The strategy is similar to that of Mike Novogratz, another Goldman alum who recently started a New York-based crypto merchant bank. Read more: Novogratzs Galaxy Is Said to Lure Kim From Goldman Kano, bitFlyers co-founder and chief executive officer, said former traders and bankers are ideal for crypto firms because they understand how to operate in regulated markets -- a skill set thats becoming more important as governments around the world scrutinize an industry notorious for security lapses and money laundering risks. Last month, bitFlyer tightened its anti-money laundering rules after the Nikkei newspaper reported that users could perform some limited functions without fully completing customer verification. Crypto companies need finance guys to fill roles across the board: business development, sales, account management, operations, and compliance just to name a few, said Razin Ashraf, head of Tokyo-based recruiting firm Divine Solutions Japan. Of course, technology matters too. Kanos hiring spree also includes coders, who can make $100,000 at bitFlyer with a high school -- or even middle school -- education if theyve got a track record of success at hackathons or coding tournaments. Kano, 42, said bitFlyers ideal finance recruits fall into one of two groups: experienced bankers in their 40s tired of corporate bureaucracy, or younger associates in their 20s whove become disillusioned with the industry and are hungry for a taste of startup life. Japan is facing long-term headwinds including negative interest rates, which is driving headcount lower at finance firms, said Yoshiharu Akahane, who oversees fintech research at Tokyo-based NTT Data Corp. That coincides with our huge crypto boom, which is much stronger than in the rest of the world, and explains why more people may jump to the crypto industry. Kano cant promise to beat the banks on salaries, but he said there are plenty of people at bitFlyer who earn more than $200,000 a year. Stock options are also a major draw. All of bitFlyers full-time employees receive them and can cash out without having to wait for the companys planned initial public offering, Kano said, declining to elaborate on a timeframe for an IPO. At what other startup can the secretary become a millionaire? That upside potential could help bitFlyer compete for talent even as Wall Street firms tiptoe into the crypto space themselves. Goldman is preparing to open a Bitcoin-trading business, while Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the owner of New York Stock Exchange, is said to be working on a platform that would let investors bet on the cryptocurrency. In Japan, financial companies including SBI Holdings Inc. and Monex Group Inc. are making big investments in crypto businesses. While Kano declined to discuss details of bitFlyers finances, disclosures from one of its rivals suggest crypto exchanges in Japan are comfortably profitable. Coincheck Inc., the venue that lost client assets to hackers in January, reported an estimated $490 million in operating profit in the 10 months before the theft (the exchange was later bought by Monex). Theres no guarantee that the boom times will last. Average daily turnover at global crypto exchanges fell to $9.1 billion in April from $17 billion in December as prices for most major tokens sank more than 50 percent from their highs, according to CryptoCompare. In another sign of waning interest, Google searches for Bitcoin and crypto have dropped by more than 70 percent since late last year. That said, Bitcoin is still up more than 1,800 percent on a two-year horizon -- trading around $9,270 on Thursday -- and the flood of ICOs shows little sign of stopping despite growing regulatory scrutiny. For Wall Street types who watched the go-go years of 2005-2007 give way to the global crisis and a more utility-like role for banks in the aftermath, the excitement surrounding cryptocurrencies is proving tough to resist. I just didnt see a future in traditional finance, said Daisuke Murayama, the 35-year-old former Barclays trader who took a pay cut to join bitFlyer in February. Its never coming back.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yuzo kano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs group inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit suisse group ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitflyer inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barclays plc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T21:10:16.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48ddd2fd7d3ec38152446d2b61de0dc9b3ca3052", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLYIjJBeew90FMSPNXIBXeo-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-20T17:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48ddd2fd7d3ec38152446d2b61de0dc9b3ca3052", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLYIjJBeew90FMSPNXIBXeo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-20T17:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 20, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Magazine's Week in Review: Blockchain's Big Gathering Nasdaq In his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as \"rat poison.\" Venture capitalists Fred ...

sceptics, and it makes me think again… what made me so excited about cryptocurrency and blockchain?\nIt started when lived in Dubai and I needed to transfer money back home for the regular stuff - like paying mortgage, insurances and so on. Initially it seemed fairly cheap and okay, I soon found out that these transfers are expensive and slow. The cost explode when you need to convert your currency from origin to destination fiat - that is where banks make their profits.\nLet's say I want to transfer 10.000 EUR worth of AED to Europe. According to my bank I have to transfer 44,663 AED, but when you look at the EUR/AED rate of exchange I am actually sending 10,312 EUR. That is a cost of 3.12% - and it took more that a week to get confirmed!\nI thought: there must be a smarter and cheaper way... and yes, cryptocurrency is the answer. Now I transfer my money within a day and against no cost - bypassing the SWIFT banking system and fiat converting scams.\nhttps://i.redd.it/8f9ihz5q7zy01.png\nSo here is my personal use-case, and don't tell me there is no use-case anymore!\nSWIFT CRYPTO COST 3.12% < 1 USD SPEED 1 WEEK < 1 DAY FEELING SCAMMED JOYFUL One thing about the value; the value is based on trust, supply (mining) and demand - and you can lookup the value on any exchange.

$25k Price by Year End bitcoin , crypto , crypto news , news #bitcoin #invest #money\nTom Lee has admitted that his Consensus BTC rally prediction ‘did not happen,’ still expects Bitcoin to reach $25,000 by year end. Co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Thomas Lee has admitted that his prediction of a Bitcoin rally after the Consensus conference was wrong. Lee has claimed that the crypto market still “faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions,” Bloomberg reports May 18 Having accurately predicted the growth of crypto markets after the US tax day in April, Tom Lee made another Bitcoin prediction on May 7, saying that the cryptocurrency will rally during and after the Consensus conference takes place in New York May 14-16. “We expect BTC and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus,” Fundstrat’s co-founder stated back in the beginning of the month. In a report to his clients Friday, Tom Lee explained his forecast was based on such factors as the crypto community coming together in a “centralized place,” as well as the “growth in attendance.” These factors were expected to have a positive effect on cryptocurrency prices and “strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction.” In his tweet May 18, Tom Lee confirmed the fact the crypto markets have instead lost up to 10 percent during Consensus, although the conference counted 8,700 participants, which is “more than a tripling of attendance in the prior year.” CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 rally did not happen, very disappointing. What we needed was a trifecta of progress: (i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed), but we got progress on (i) and (ii). Full text below pic.twitter.com/XcqNhgYgK7 — Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 18, 2018 Tom Lee suggested that the crypto industry needs a “trifecta of progress” in the form of institutional tools, support from banks , and regulatory clarity. “Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions… But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions.” According to Bloomberg, Fundstrat still expects Bitcoin’s price to go as high as $25,000 by the end of this year. Earlier this month, Tom Lee himself predicted Bitcoin to be worth $36,000 by the end of 2019, “based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple.” ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/mining-will-propel-bitcoin-price-to-36k-in-2019-says-latest-fundstrat-research", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-18/crypto-bull-tom-lee-owns-up-after-bitcoin-prediction-goes-awry", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/taxes", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/banks", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-markets-see-more-gains-in-the-wake-of-americas-tax-day", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tom-lee", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Consensus2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-regulation", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-fails-to-accomplish-predicted-rally-following-nyc-crypto-conference", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-price", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-07/bitcoin-to-rally-on-consensus-conference-fundstrat-analyst-says", "https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/997499507083538435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "consensus btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T17:08:44.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "219636f24d1a21be3b000902a2ba8aa99ab7743f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSYqD94ApRUpZATdcbHocshNdm3D2qxgrLkPG2fyhBPbTbPSeM7JWUBRQJmwm5PhpFw--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Opinion: The Bubble is Not Bitcoin", "title_full": "Opinion: The Bubble is Not Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-20T16:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "219636f24d1a21be3b000902a2ba8aa99ab7743f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSYqD94ApRUpZATdcbHocshNdm3D2qxgrLkPG2fyhBPbTbPSeM7JWUBRQJmwm5PhpFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-20T16:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Opinion: The Bubble is Not Bitcoin", "text": "Opinion: The Bubble is Not Bitcoin\nPedro Febrero\nAlthough the market is positive overall, at the time of writing, the sentiment is quite negative.

The change will allow a greater number of transactions to be processed with inexpensive and consistent transaction fees. Also, Seminole County in Florida will accept tax payments in both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) thanks to a partnership with Bitpay.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Warren Warned by Billboards, Coinbase Tempted by Banking Bitcoin Cash Upgrades Blockchain Protocol\nThe Bitcoin Cash network has smoothly and successfully upgraded the blockchain protocol this Tuesday by extending the block size from 8MB to 32MB. The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356.\nThe change represents one of the largest block size increases in blockchain history. The upgrade also includes an increased default data-carrier-size, from 80-bytes to 220-bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes, which could add the ability to code colored coins and binary contracts.\nThe fourfold block size increase will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent and inexpensive transaction fees. It also gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit and paves a path for mass adoption . The block size limits are currently set by the miner, and developers are able to set the capacity so that blocks cannot get full in the immediate future. This means that the fees will remain low for quite some time and also reliable, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as in the last quarter of 2017. Bitpay Enables BCH and BTC for Tax Payments in Florida County\nUS-based crypto payment processor Bitpay has announced a formal agreement with Florida’s Seminole County Tax Collector, Joel M. Greenberg. Both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) can be used for tax payments starting this summer. County residents will be able to pay in crypto for driver licenses, ID cards, and even property taxes.\n“We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service, and we should expect the same from our government,” Greenberg said. He added that the aim of his tenure in office is to make customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st. One way to achieve that, the official says, is to add cryptocurrency to the available payment options. China Ranks Almost 30 Cryptos, Finds Over 400 Fake Coins\nThe government of China, one of the first to ban cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, has come out with official crypto rankings . The Chinese Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) will be judging leading digital coins according to three major criteria – innovation, technology, and application – although details about the applied methodology are yet to be shared. A total of 28 cryptocurrencies and their respective blockchains have been ranked. Of the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum was ranked first, followed by Bitcoin Core (BTC) at number 13, Ripple is 17th, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – 25th. The Chinese top five include Ether, Steem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo.\nAnother sign of growing attention to cryptocurrencies in China is the publication of a report on fake coins by a government-backed industry organization. The National Committee of Experts on the Internet Financial Security Technology (IFCERT) has identified 421 fake cryptocurrencies. The organization pointed out that 60% of these cryptos are deployed overseas. IFCERT also outlined some major red flags of the fake coins. According to the Committee, they often adopt “pyramid-based” business models and claim high returns. The cryptos have no real code – they either do not have a blockchain or cannot generate blocks for one. These coins are not traded on legitimate exchanges, the report also notes. US Government Launches Scam Crypto Site\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created and published its own version of an initial coin offering (ICO) scam website. “Combining the two most growth-oriented segments of the digital economy, blockchain technology and travel, Howeycoin is the newest and only coin offering that captures the magic of coin trading profits and the excitement and guaranteed returns of the travel industry,” the mock SEC website claims. It promises partnerships in all segments of the travel industry and “earning coins you can trade for profit.”\n“The rapid growth of the ‘ICO’ market, and its widespread promotion as a new investment opportunity, has provided fertile ground for bad actors to take advantage of our Main Street investors. We embrace new technologies, but we also want investors to see what fraud looks like, so we built this educational site with many of the classic warning signs of fraud,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton explained . He also noted that distributed ledger technology can add efficiency to the capital raising process, but promoters and issuers need to make sure they follow the securities laws. “I encourage investors to do their diligence and ask questions,” Clayton said. EU Adopts Rules to Reduce Anonymity for Crypto Users\nThis week, the European Union moved closer to its goal to minimize anonymous crypto transactions. The EU Council adopted a directive, which updates the European anti-money laundering legislation. The new rules come with requirements for crypto platforms to introduce know-your-customer procedures. The amendments were adopted at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, following an agreement with the European Parliament form December. In April this year, MEPs voted to support the deal to “bring cryptocurrencies under closer regulation.”\nThe main changes involve addressing the “risks linked to virtual currencies” by taking steps to reduce anonymity for both crypto traders and crypto-related transactions. Providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies, as well as custodian wallet providers, will be obliged to identify suspicious activities. The directive states that authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies through these platforms, and the national financial intelligence units should have access to information allowing them to associate crypto addresses with the their owners. South Korean Regulators Widen Investigation of Crypto Exchanges\nThe government in Seoul is widening its probe on cryptocurrency exchanges focusing on the use of corporate accounts for crypto transactions, which the regulators say can lead to money laundering. The practice should have been discontinued when authorities introduced the real-name system at the end of January. However, only 30% of all crypto accounts have been converted into real-name ones so far. South Korea’s top financial regulators are now teaming up with prosecutors to widen the investigation.\nThe six banks that can issue real-name accounts have chosen to only service the country’s largest crypto exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. Nonetheless, not all accounts at these exchanges have been converted into real-name ones. In addition, all small and medium-sized exchanges continue to use corporate accounts for crypto transactions. The regulators warn that the use of corporate accounts can lead to fraud . The announcement of the widening probe follows the launch of an investigation on the largest South Korean crypto exchange, Upbit .\nWhat are your thoughts on the top stories we’ve covered this week?

And if that happens, bitcoin would be gobbling up 0.5 percent of the world’s electricity, about as much as the Netherlands.\n\"That’s a troubling trajectory, especially for a world that should be working overtime to root out energy waste and fight climate change. By late next year, bitcoin could be consuming more electricity than all the world’s solar panels currently produce — about 1.8 percent of global electricity, according to a simple extrapolation of the study’s predictions. That would effectively erase decades of progress on renewable energy....\n\"Beyond its tentative success ... bitcoin has an increasingly real-world cost. The process of 'mining' for coins requires a globally distributed computer network racing to solve math problems — and also helps keep any individual transaction confidential and tamper-proof. That, in turn, requires an ever-escalating arms race of computing power — and electricity use — which, at the moment, has no end in sight. A single bitcoin transaction is so energy intensive that it could power the average U.S. household for a month.\n\"A fluctuating bitcoin price, along with increases in computer efficiency, has slowed the cryptocurrency’s energy footprint growth rate to 'just' 20 percent per month so far in this year. If that keeps up, bitcoin would consume all the world’s electricity by January 2021.\n\"That simply won’t happen — government regulators would surely come to their senses by then — but it is a sign of bitcoin’s disastrous growth rate....\n\"It’s a telling social phenomenon of late capitalism that we are willing to construct elaborate computer networks to conduct secure transactions with each other — and in the process torpedoing our hopes at a clean energy future.\"\nRead more: https://grist.org/article/bitcoins-energy-use-got-studied-and-you-libertarian-nerds-look-even-worse-than-usual/\n'via Blog this'\nAlso read: Bitcoin and climate change (II) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric holthaus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T16:37:26.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dca5608b18abcfa793fad59e81473724bf59ac19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY1SZqimAnpc3CAJxz6.eFu2PJOFOMlEoCxUM_5_0W9tanr0EiXVnvaHbpzqCvinGkw--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: Smooth Bitcoin Cash Upgrade, BCH and BTC Tax Payments in Florida", "title_full": "This Week in Bitcoin: Smooth Bitcoin Cash Upgrade, BCH and BTC Tax Payments in Florida", "published": "2018-05-20T16:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dca5608b18abcfa793fad59e81473724bf59ac19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY1SZqimAnpc3CAJxz6.eFu2PJOFOMlEoCxUM_5_0W9tanr0EiXVnvaHbpzqCvinGkw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-20T16:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: Smooth Bitcoin Cash Upgrade, BCH and BTC Tax Payments in Florida", "text": "A notable week for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – the network successfully upgraded the blockchain protocol by extending the block size to 32MB. The change will allow a greater number of transactions to be processed with inexpensive and consistent transaction fees. Also, Seminole County in Florida will accept tax payments in both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) thanks to a partnership with Bitpay.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Warren Warned by Billboards, Coinbase Tempted by Banking\nBitcoin Cash Upgrades Blockchain Protocol The Bitcoin Cash network has smoothly and successfully upgraded the blockchain protocol this Tuesday by extending the block size from 8MB to 32MB. The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356.\nThe change represents one of the largest block size increases in blockchain history. The upgrade also includes an increased default data-carrier-size, from 80-bytes to 220-bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes, which could add the ability to code colored coins and binary contracts.\nThe fourfold block size increase will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent and inexpensive transaction fees. It also gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit and paves a path for mass adoption . The block size limits are currently set by the miner, and developers are able to set the capacity so that blocks cannot get full in the immediate future. This means that the fees will remain low for quite some time and also reliable, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as in the last quarter of 2017.\nBitpay Enables BCH and BTC for Tax Payments in Florida County US-based crypto payment processor Bitpay has announced a formal agreement with Florida's Seminole County Tax Collector, Joel M. Greenberg. Both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) can be used for tax payments starting this summer. County residents will be able to pay in crypto for driver licenses, ID cards, and even property taxes.\n\"We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service, and we should expect the same from our government,\" Greenberg said. He added that the aim of his tenure in office is to make customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st. One way to achieve that, the official says, is to add cryptocurrency to the available payment options.\nChina Ranks Almost 30 Cryptos, Finds Over 400 Fake Coins The government of China, one of the first to ban cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, has come out with official crypto rankings . The Chinese Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) will be judging leading digital coins according to three major criteria – innovation, technology, and application – although details about the applied methodology are yet to be shared. A total of 28 cryptocurrencies and their respective blockchains have been ranked. Of the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum was ranked first, followed by Bitcoin Core (BTC) at number 13, Ripple is 17th, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – 25th. The Chinese top five include Ether, Steem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo.\nAnother sign of growing attention to cryptocurrencies in China is the publication of a report on fake coins by a government-backed industry organization. The National Committee of Experts on the Internet Financial Security Technology (IFCERT) has identified 421 fake cryptocurrencies. The organization pointed out that 60% of these cryptos are deployed overseas. IFCERT also outlined some major red flags of the fake coins. According to the Committee, they often adopt \"pyramid-based\" business models and claim high returns. The cryptos have no real code – they either do not have a blockchain or cannot generate blocks for one. These coins are not traded on legitimate exchanges, the report also notes.\nUS Government Launches Scam Crypto Site The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created and published its own version of an initial coin offering (ICO) scam website. \"Combining the two most growth-oriented segments of the digital economy, blockchain technology and travel, Howeycoin is the newest and only coin offering that captures the magic of coin trading profits and the excitement and guaranteed returns of the travel industry,\" the mock SEC website claims. It promises partnerships in all segments of the travel industry and \"earning coins you can trade for profit.\"\n\"The rapid growth of the 'ICO' market, and its widespread promotion as a new investment opportunity, has provided fertile ground for bad actors to take advantage of our Main Street investors. We embrace new technologies, but we also want investors to see what fraud looks like, so we built this educational site with many of the classic warning signs of fraud,\" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton explained . He also noted that distributed ledger technology can add efficiency to the capital raising process, but promoters and issuers need to make sure they follow the securities laws. \"I encourage investors to do their diligence and ask questions,\" Clayton said.\nEU Adopts Rules to Reduce Anonymity for Crypto Users This week, the European Union moved closer to its goal to minimize anonymous crypto transactions. The EU Council adopted a directive, which updates the European anti-money laundering legislation. The new rules come with requirements for crypto platforms to introduce know-your-customer procedures. The amendments were adopted at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, following an agreement with the European Parliament form December. In April this year, MEPs voted to support the deal to \"bring cryptocurrencies under closer regulation.\"\nThe main changes involve addressing the \"risks linked to virtual currencies\" by taking steps to reduce anonymity for both crypto traders and crypto-related transactions. Providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies, as well as custodian wallet providers, will be obliged to identify suspicious activities. The directive states that authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies through these platforms, and the national financial intelligence units should have access to information allowing them to associate crypto addresses with the their owners.\nSouth Korean Regulators Widen Investigation of Crypto Exchanges The government in Seoul is widening its probe on cryptocurrency exchanges focusing on the use of corporate accounts for crypto transactions, which the regulators say can lead to money laundering. The practice should have been discontinued when authorities introduced the real-name system at the end of January. However, only 30% of all crypto accounts have been converted into real-name ones so far. South Korea's top financial regulators are now teaming up with prosecutors to widen the investigation.\nThe six banks that can issue real-name accounts have chosen to only service the country's largest crypto exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. Nonetheless, not all accounts at these exchanges have been converted into real-name ones. In addition, all small and medium-sized exchanges continue to use corporate accounts for crypto transactions. The regulators warn that the use of corporate accounts can lead to fraud . The announcement of the widening probe follows the launch of an investigation on the largest South Korean crypto exchange, Upbit .\nWhat are your thoughts on the top stories we've covered this week?

This depiction implies that users transacting in bitcoin can completely do so anonymously that their identities will never be exposed. However, that isn’t fundamentally the way it is. Although bitcoin provides better privacy when compared with traditional-payment connecting a 3 rd -party intermediary for example a credit-card provider, it’s nevertheless not as anonymous as a cash transaction. A person’s identity could potentially be exposed in bitcoin transactions in fact, there are many ways.\nA general idea of the Blockchain\nBitcoin isn’t anonymous. As we explain below, it really is pseudonymous an important distinction. It can also be a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency that is digital having no third-party intermediary for instance, a charge card issuer, vendor processor or bank that is involved to verify a transaction between a customer and vendor. Since there is no party that is third there must be another way to confirm a transaction between two users and avoid the double-spending problem i.e., a means of guarantee that an individual does maybe spend bitcoin they have formerly transferred.\nThis is where the Blockchain, the undoubtedly revolutionary aspect of cryptocurrencies such as for instance bitcoin, is necessary. A Blockchain is just a public, distributed ledger, by which every transaction is documented. A Blockchain ledger is distributed across a group of computers thousands of them, each with its own copy of the Blockchain transactions unlike traditional payment systems in which the ledger is maintained by a single third party.\nEach block of deals in a Blockchain is complete by users within the peer-to-peer network, known as miners, who compete to resolve a complex problem that is computational. 1st successful miner to validate the deal broadcasts it to the network that then checks the results. Once checked, the new deals are added as a new block to the Blockchain. The miner who first successfully verified this transaction gets rewarded by the network with newly created bitcoins in the case of bitcoin. At the time of 2016, the reward was reduced from 25 to 12.5 bitcoins, and it is expected that the reward will be further reduced to 6.25 bitcoins in 2021 July.\nTracing Bitcoins Back to Individuals\nEncryption might make the impression that these transactions are visible however unmatchable to specific individuals. However, bitcoin isn’t as untraceable as encryption may indicate. Tying an encrypted transaction to a real person may be it’s not really a risk that is remote. There are numerous ways this could occur.\nUsers who count on a bitcoin trading exchange such as Bitfinex and Binance or Kraken to switch money for bitcoin have to divulge their information that is personal to exchange to produce a free account. The information collected by the trade varies, however normally includes, at a minimum, a user’s first and name that is last and, possibly, a phone number. The trade may additionally collect a user’s ip. If these exchanges had been subject to a data protection breach, a user’s personal information could be exposed. In addition, some exchanges that are centralized to manage users’ bitcoin funds and users’ private keys on their behalf.\nYou can find additionally wallet that is on line providers that control users’ wallets on their behalf. A wallet is really a software program that stores an accumulation of a public that is user’s personal key pairs. The storage space of personal tips makes these central exchanges, and online wallet providers, prime targets for crooks because, as discussed above, you aren’t access to a user’s personal key should be able to develop a bitcoin transaction that is valid. A hacker who accesses a user’s private key can send all of that user’s bitcoins to him or herself, or even to any intermediary of their choosing.\nSummary\nAlthough bitcoin is a decentralized and unregulated payment method, users should recognize that this does not mean that their bitcoin transactions are private and hidden from scrutiny.

The change will allow a greater number of transactions to be processed with inexpensive and consistent transaction fees. Also, Seminole County in Florida will accept tax payments in both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) thanks to a partnership with Bitpay.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Warren Warned by Billboards, Coinbase Tempted by Banking Bitcoin Cash Upgrades Blockchain Protocol\nThe Bitcoin Cash network has smoothly and successfully upgraded the blockchain protocol this Tuesday by extending the block size from 8MB to 32MB. The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356.\nThe change represents one of the largest block size increases in blockchain history. The upgrade also includes an increased default data-carrier-size, from 80-bytes to 220-bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes, which could add the ability to code colored coins and binary contracts.\nThe fourfold block size increase will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent and inexpensive transaction fees. It also gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit and paves a path for mass adoption . The block size limits are currently set by the miner, and developers are able to set the capacity so that blocks cannot get full in the immediate future. This means that the fees will remain low for quite some time and also reliable, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as in the last quarter of 2017. Bitpay Enables BCH and BTC for Tax Payments in Florida County\nUS-based crypto payment processor Bitpay has announced a formal agreement with Florida’s Seminole County Tax Collector, Joel M. Greenberg. Both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) can be used for tax payments starting this summer. County residents will be able to pay in crypto for driver licenses, ID cards, and even property taxes.\n“We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service, and we should expect the same from our government,” Greenberg said. He added that the aim of his tenure in office is to make customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st. One way to achieve that, the official says, is to add cryptocurrency to the available payment options. China Ranks Almost 30 Cryptos, Finds Over 400 Fake Coins\nThe government of China, one of the first to ban cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, has come out with official crypto rankings . The Chinese Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) will be judging leading digital coins according to three major criteria – innovation, technology, and application – although details about the applied methodology are yet to be shared. A total of 28 cryptocurrencies and their respective blockchains have been ranked. Of the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum was ranked first, followed by Bitcoin Core (BTC) at number 13, Ripple is 17th, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – 25th. The Chinese top five include Ether, Steem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo.\nAnother sign of growing attention to cryptocurrencies in China is the publication of a report on fake coins by a government-backed industry organization. The National Committee of Experts on the Internet Financial Security Technology (IFCERT) has identified 421 fake cryptocurrencies. The organization pointed out that 60% of these cryptos are deployed overseas. IFCERT also outlined some major red flags of the fake coins. According to the Committee, they often adopt “pyramid-based” business models and claim high returns. The cryptos have no real code – they either do not have a blockchain or cannot generate blocks for one. These coins are not traded on legitimate exchanges, the report also notes. US Government Launches Scam Crypto Site\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created and published its own version of an initial coin offering (ICO) scam website. “Combining the two most growth-oriented segments of the digital economy, blockchain technology and travel, Howeycoin is the newest and only coin offering that captures the magic of coin trading profits and the excitement and guaranteed returns of the travel industry,” the mock SEC website claims. It promises partnerships in all segments of the travel industry and “earning coins you can trade for profit.”\n“The rapid growth of the ‘ICO’ market, and its widespread promotion as a new investment opportunity, has provided fertile ground for bad actors to take advantage of our Main Street investors. We embrace new technologies, but we also want investors to see what fraud looks like, so we built this educational site with many of the classic warning signs of fraud,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton explained . He also noted that distributed ledger technology can add efficiency to the capital raising process, but promoters and issuers need to make sure they follow the securities laws. “I encourage investors to do their diligence and ask questions,” Clayton said. EU Adopts Rules to Reduce Anonymity for Crypto Users\nThis week, the European Union moved closer to its goal to minimize anonymous crypto transactions. The EU Council adopted a directive, which updates the European anti-money laundering legislation. The new rules come with requirements for crypto platforms to introduce know-your-customer procedures. The amendments were adopted at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, following an agreement with the European Parliament form December. In April this year, MEPs voted to support the deal to “bring cryptocurrencies under closer regulation.”\nThe main changes involve addressing the “risks linked to virtual currencies” by taking steps to reduce anonymity for both crypto traders and crypto-related transactions. Providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies, as well as custodian wallet providers, will be obliged to identify suspicious activities. The directive states that authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies through these platforms, and the national financial intelligence units should have access to information allowing them to associate crypto addresses with the their owners. South Korean Regulators Widen Investigation of Crypto Exchanges\nThe government in Seoul is widening its probe on cryptocurrency exchanges focusing on the use of corporate accounts for crypto transactions, which the regulators say can lead to money laundering. The practice should have been discontinued when authorities introduced the real-name system at the end of January. However, only 30% of all crypto accounts have been converted into real-name ones so far. South Korea’s top financial regulators are now teaming up with prosecutors to widen the investigation.\nThe six banks that can issue real-name accounts have chosen to only service the country’s largest crypto exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. Nonetheless, not all accounts at these exchanges have been converted into real-name ones. In addition, all small and medium-sized exchanges continue to use corporate accounts for crypto transactions. The regulators warn that the use of corporate accounts can lead to fraud . The announcement of the widening probe follows the launch of an investigation on the largest South Korean crypto exchange, Upbit .\nWhat are your thoughts on the top stories we’ve covered this week?

Lee has claimed that the crypto market still “faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions,” Bloomberg reports May 18 Having accurately predicted the growth of crypto markets after the US tax day in April, Tom Lee made another Bitcoin prediction on May 7, saying that the cryptocurrency will rally during and after the Consensus conference takes place in New York May 14-16. “We expect BTC and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus,” Fundstrat’s co-founder stated back in the beginning of the month. In a report to his clients Friday, Tom Lee explained his forecast was based on such factors as the crypto community coming together in a “centralized place,” as well as the “growth in attendance.” These factors were expected to have a positive effect on cryptocurrency prices and “strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction.” In his tweet May 18, Tom Lee confirmed the fact the crypto markets have instead lost up to 10 percent during Consensus, although the conference counted 8,700 participants, which is “more than a tripling of attendance in the prior year.” CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 rally did not happen, very disappointing. What we needed was a trifecta of progress: (i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed), but we got progress on (i) and (ii). Full text below pic.twitter.com/XcqNhgYgK7\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 18, 2018 Tom Lee suggested that the crypto industry needs a “trifecta of progress” in the form of institutional tools, support from banks , and regulatory clarity. “Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions… But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions.” According to Bloomberg, Fundstrat still expects Bitcoin’s price to go as high as $25,000 by the end of this year. Earlier this month, Tom Lee himself predicted Bitcoin to be worth $36,000 by the end of 2019, “based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple.”\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/mining-will-propel-bitcoin-price-to-36k-in-2019-says-latest-fundstrat-research", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-18/crypto-bull-tom-lee-owns-up-after-bitcoin-prediction-goes-awry", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/taxes", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/banks", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-markets-see-more-gains-in-the-wake-of-americas-tax-day", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tom-lee", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Consensus2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-regulation", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa", "https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/997499507083538435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-fails-to-accomplish-predicted-rally-following-nyc-crypto-conference", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-price", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-07/bitcoin-to-rally-on-consensus-conference-fundstrat-analyst-says", "https://t.co/XcqNhgYgK7"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "year end fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T18:46:11.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efef4318435ffd07b71f23967bf5169395901f24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWc.JrPSmK6Q1hnGDHIoCzc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin plays a vital role in the economy", "title_full": "Bitcoin plays a vital role in the economy", "published": "2018-05-20T15:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efef4318435ffd07b71f23967bf5169395901f24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWc.JrPSmK6Q1hnGDHIoCzc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nadbucs", "published": "2018-05-20T15:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin plays a vital role in the economy", "text": "Bitcoin can definitely turn around the economy but just like others in order to to reach their goal it will require hard word determination and knowledge.

The change will allow a greater number of transactions to be processed with inexpensive and consistent transaction fees. Also, Seminole County in Florida will accept tax payments in both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) thanks to a partnership with Bitpay.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Warren Warned by Billboards, Coinbase Tempted by Banking Bitcoin Cash Upgrades Blockchain Protocol\nThe Bitcoin Cash network has smoothly and successfully upgraded the blockchain protocol this Tuesday by extending the block size from 8MB to 32MB. The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356.\nThe change represents one of the largest block size increases in blockchain history. The upgrade also includes an increased default data-carrier-size, from 80-bytes to 220-bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes, which could add the ability to code colored coins and binary contracts.\nThe fourfold block size increase will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent and inexpensive transaction fees. It also gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit and paves a path for mass adoption . The block size limits are currently set by the miner, and developers are able to set the capacity so that blocks cannot get full in the immediate future. This means that the fees will remain low for quite some time and also reliable, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as in the last quarter of 2017. Bitpay Enables BCH and BTC for Tax Payments in Florida County\nUS-based crypto payment processor Bitpay has announced a formal agreement with Florida’s Seminole County Tax Collector, Joel M. Greenberg. Both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) can be used for tax payments starting this summer. County residents will be able to pay in crypto for driver licenses, ID cards, and even property taxes.\n“We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service, and we should expect the same from our government,” Greenberg said. He added that the aim of his tenure in office is to make customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st. One way to achieve that, the official says, is to add cryptocurrency to the available payment options. China Ranks Almost 30 Cryptos, Finds Over 400 Fake Coins\nThe government of China, one of the first to ban cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, has come out with official crypto rankings . The Chinese Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) will be judging leading digital coins according to three major criteria – innovation, technology, and application – although details about the applied methodology are yet to be shared. A total of 28 cryptocurrencies and their respective blockchains have been ranked. Of the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum was ranked first, followed by Bitcoin Core (BTC) at number 13, Ripple is 17th, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – 25th. The Chinese top five include Ether, Steem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo.\nAnother sign of growing attention to cryptocurrencies in China is the publication of a report on fake coins by a government-backed industry organization. The National Committee of Experts on the Internet Financial Security Technology (IFCERT) has identified 421 fake cryptocurrencies. The organization pointed out that 60% of these cryptos are deployed overseas. IFCERT also outlined some major red flags of the fake coins. According to the Committee, they often adopt “pyramid-based” business models and claim high returns. The cryptos have no real code – they either do not have a blockchain or cannot generate blocks for one. These coins are not traded on legitimate exchanges, the report also notes. US Government Launches Scam Crypto Site\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created and published its own version of an initial coin offering (ICO) scam website. “Combining the two most growth-oriented segments of the digital economy, blockchain technology and travel, Howeycoin is the newest and only coin offering that captures the magic of coin trading profits and the excitement and guaranteed returns of the travel industry,” the mock SEC website claims. It promises partnerships in all segments of the travel industry and “earning coins you can trade for profit.”\n“The rapid growth of the ‘ICO’ market, and its widespread promotion as a new investment opportunity, has provided fertile ground for bad actors to take advantage of our Main Street investors. We embrace new technologies, but we also want investors to see what fraud looks like, so we built this educational site with many of the classic warning signs of fraud,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton explained . He also noted that distributed ledger technology can add efficiency to the capital raising process, but promoters and issuers need to make sure they follow the securities laws. “I encourage investors to do their diligence and ask questions,” Clayton said. EU Adopts Rules to Reduce Anonymity for Crypto Users\nThis week, the European Union moved closer to its goal to minimize anonymous crypto transactions. The EU Council adopted a directive, which updates the European anti-money laundering legislation. The new rules come with requirements for crypto platforms to introduce know-your-customer procedures. The amendments were adopted at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, following an agreement with the European Parliament form December. In April this year, MEPs voted to support the deal to “bring cryptocurrencies under closer regulation.”\nThe main changes involve addressing the “risks linked to virtual currencies” by taking steps to reduce anonymity for both crypto traders and crypto-related transactions. Providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies, as well as custodian wallet providers, will be obliged to identify suspicious activities. The directive states that authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies through these platforms, and the national financial intelligence units should have access to information allowing them to associate crypto addresses with the their owners. South Korean Regulators Widen Investigation of Crypto Exchanges\nThe government in Seoul is widening its probe on cryptocurrency exchanges focusing on the use of corporate accounts for crypto transactions, which the regulators say can lead to money laundering. The practice should have been discontinued when authorities introduced the real-name system at the end of January. However, only 30% of all crypto accounts have been converted into real-name ones so far. South Korea’s top financial regulators are now teaming up with prosecutors to widen the investigation.\nThe six banks that can issue real-name accounts have chosen to only service the country’s largest crypto exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. Nonetheless, not all accounts at these exchanges have been converted into real-name ones. In addition, all small and medium-sized exchanges continue to use corporate accounts for crypto transactions. The regulators warn that the use of corporate accounts can lead to fraud . The announcement of the widening probe follows the launch of an investigation on the largest South Korean crypto exchange, Upbit .\nWhat are your thoughts on the top stories we’ve covered this week?

The directive states that authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies through these platforms, and the national financial intelligence units should have access to information allowing them to associate crypto addresses with the their owners.\nSouth Korean Regulators Widen Investigation of Crypto Exchanges The government in Seoul is widening its probe on cryptocurrency exchanges focusing on the use of corporate accounts for crypto transactions, which the regulators say can lead to money laundering. The practice should have been discontinued when authorities introduced the real-name system at the end of January. However, only 30% of all crypto accounts have been converted into real-name ones so far. South Korea’s top financial regulators are now teaming up with prosecutors to widen the investigation.\nThe six banks that can issue real-name accounts have chosen to only service the country’s largest crypto exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. Nonetheless, not all accounts at these exchanges have been converted into real-name ones. In addition, all small and medium-sized exchanges continue to use corporate accounts for crypto transactions. The regulators warn that the use of corporate accounts can lead to fraud . The announcement of the widening probe follows the launch of an investigation on the largest South Korean crypto exchange, Upbit .\nWhat are your thoughts on the top stories we’ve covered this week?

In an interview with CNBC , the analyst offered explanations for why the conference didn’t spark an increase in crypto prices. What Went Wrong Going into Consensus, most of the talk featured the expectation that crypto prices will soar during and after the summit. Based on the pattern of the last three years, experts hinged their bet on a big crypto rally . Alas, Consensus came and went without any price increase. In fact, the opposite happened. Prices dropped, and the total crypto market cap tanked by $40 billion during the conference in New York City. The Bitcoin price declined by 3 percent by the end of the conference. Lee began by admitting that perhaps he and other experts were overly optimistic due to the expected large turnout at Consensus . He also said that after months of uncertainty, the gathering of many crypto enthusiasts was seen as a precursor to the reinvigoration of confidence in the market. During the interview, Lee identified the lack of clarity on regulatory discussions and muted custodial announcements at Consensus as part of the reasons why the conference didn’t produce the expected results. Lack of Regulatory Clarity ' @Fundstrat 's Tom Lee gives #bitcoin mea culpa after #Consensus2018 failed to lift crypto prices pic.twitter.com/FC67PrA3G0 — CNBC's Fast Money (@CNBCFastMoney) May 18, 2018 Lee pointed out that there was a lack of clarity on the crypto regulatory front. According to him, the conversion on government cryptocurrency regulations didn’t move forward during Consensus . The Fundstrat analyst did state that the issue of regulatory clarity was one that required a nuanced approach. According to him, crypto enthusiasts have certain expectations about the matter. However, many weren’t expecting an exact regulatory outcome, but the lack of any movement on the topic was disappointing, to say the least. CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 rally did not happen, very disappointing. What we needed was a trifecta of progress: (i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed), but we got progress on (i) and (ii). Full text below pic.twitter.com/XcqNhgYgK7 — Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 18, 2018 Muted Institutional Custodial Announcement Another highly anticipated topic during Consensus was the emergence of institutional custodial tools for crypto. Lee said there were a couple of positive announcements, most notably by Nomura . However, he maintained that a lot more needed to be done on the institutional front. According to him, even if investment managers buy into Bitcoin , a lot of internal evangelization is required to take things up a notch. Positive Signs Despite the lack of a Bitcoin price rally, Lee maintains that there were some positives. Speaking during the interview, he said: I think Consensus was a huge success. It is a great conference to bring a lot of people together from around the world. The quality of the people that were there was amazing. Lee also noted that the impending CME futures contract for Ethereum was most likely to end the security-utility debate for the number two crypto. When asked about his $25k end-of-year Bitcoin price prediction, Lee stuck to his guns saying: Bitcoin doesn’t have to go up every day to move from $8,000 to $25,000. The ten best days account for all the return of bitcoin in a year. If you didn’t own bitcoin for ten days each year, you lost 25 percent each year. Speaking on Fundstrat’s proprietary misery index , Lee said the Bitcoin misery is now at 30 percent after having dropped to 18 percent in April. Do you agree with Lee’s explanation for why Consensus failed to instigate the Bitcoin price rally? Will Bitcoin prices reach $25K by the end of 2018 given the present state of things?

In fact, the market reversed and is now trading at a monthly low! As usual, investors are wondering where the market will go from here. Market Overview Contrary to popular expectation, Bitcoin failed to rally 69 – 130% after the Consensus conference in New York ended this week. In fact, it pulled back nearly 5% as the cryptocurrency market capitalization sank to $389 billion and it appears that the downtrend is set to continue for the short term. Fortunately, things still bode well for crypto as: Goldman Sachs is developing a dollar pegged cryptocurrency ( USDCoin ) through Circle which will finally provide an alternative stablecoin to Tether. As Consensus wrapped up, the CFTC and SEC directors shared their view that they have no desire to stand in the path of blockchain development. A platform for institutional investment in cryptocurrencies is gradually concretizing which further supports claims that institutional investors will boost cryptocurrency prices in the future. Keeping this in mind, at present there is still more tangibly good news than bad news in the crypto-hemisphere and volatility is nothing new to cryptocurrency investors… though all of the moonshot valuations and promises of tripling market caps may have led us to forget this. Daily Chart After a nearly 5% drop, BTC briefly touched a monthly low at $7,925 on Bitfinex. As shown on the daily chart, this is a nearly 50% retracement of the pre-April rally low of $6,425. On 18th May BTC had continued a pattern of lower highs and lower lows and the daily chart shows BTC below the 100 and 200-day MA and at the time of writing the RSI sits below the 50 indicating that bears have the advantage. 4HR Chart There is a smidgen of positive news for the short term as around midday Saturday the 5 and 10-day MA changed direction and BTC is close to exiting the recently developed downward channel. On the other hand, both the 20 and 50-day MA are sloping downwards and BTC needs to cross the 50-day MA at $8,400. At the time of writing BTC still trades below the 50-day MA suggesting short term continuance of the bearish trend. If BTC is unable to recover or hold above $8,000, there are long term supports at $7,800 and $7,600 but how likely these are to hold is questionable as $7,784 is at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement. A close below $8,000 means that a reversal favorable to the bears is in place and the ensuing sell off could drop prices to $7,000 or lower. Vision BTC is close to crossing the 50-day MA at $8,400 and a close above the 50 would set BTC outside the recently developed downward trendline. Failure to recover could lead BTC to touch the $7,784 support at the 61.8 percent retracement. Traders are advised to watch from the sidelines as most technical indicators show bears having the advantage. Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

Now, the PRC is the first country to come out with official government crypto rankings. Its China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) used three filters through which coins would be judged: innovation, technology, application. Rather surprisingly to some enthusiasts, bitcoin core (BTC) didn’t even crack the top ten, while bitcoin cash (BCH) almost didn’t make the list at all. Also read: Alec Baldwin’s Lambo Movie Backed by Crypto Tech China Lists Ethereum as Best in Crypto Class In what is either widely being referred to as a case of communist schizophrenia or a passive nod to the inevitable financial future, the PRC’s CCID released its first set of cryptocurrency rankings. China, of course, outright banned crypto in all its various forms, and the broader market was thought to have plummeted for a time as a result. That it is now publishing coin rankings is confusing to many observers. CN Ledger, a popular Twitter handle, was the first to expose the rankings to the outside world. Its author, Eric Zhao, explained how “most old-school experts haven’t followed the crypto space long enough to grasp some of the traits of tech and community that can’t be found elsewhere.” Indeed, this year found Weiss Ratings’ inaugural list of their rankings, as these pages reported. It too was very controversial. “The eagerly-anticipated report rates 74 of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, scoring them from A to D,” we wrote. “Such was the level of interest in the report, the company’s website was knocked offline as interest peaked on Wednesday morning. Weiss Ratings include some controversial scores for currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum that are sure to spark debate.” Then, as now, BTC ranked lower than Ethereum. Weiss spent a great deal of time defending their decision. Mr. Zhao hoped the CCID effort signals a kind of new opening. “I believe at least it’s a sign that the officials are starting to treat crypto projects more like a neutral endeavour towards better technology and innovations, rather than just challenging the power and authority of banks and government,” he stressed. BTC Listed 13 of 28 Just a week ago, the PRC ministry surprised enthusiasts with a press release announcing its Global Public Chain Assessment Index . “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide for government, enterprise and research institute,” news.Bitcoin.com quoted the government notice as stating. The Center for Information Industry Development used three main criteria in scoring cryptocurrencies, though scant information exists about methodology. Application, innovation, technology were used to place 28 total cryptos and their respective blockchains (which the rankings, at least at first glance, weigh heavily). Of the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum ranked first, followed by bitcoin core (BTC) at number 13, ripple in the 17th spot, and bitcoin cash (BCH) lagging well behind them all at the lowly number 25 of 28. For the CCID, however, the top five cryptos to their liking include ether, steem, lisk, neo, komodo. For those who worry about such rankings, PRC appears to, again, value blockchains over currencies – a common refrain heard in the Western corporate world. If, alternatively, one were to assess various cryptocurrencies according to their efficacy as mediums of exchange, BCH and BTC would likely rank quite high, and could be considered a most obvious threat to a regime bent on control. Whatever the case, cracks do happen inside the communist stronghold: quite a few crypto tech related patents are owned by China, its central bank has openly mused about state-backed crypto, and, of course, its burgeoning video game industry is very bullish on tokens and distributed ledgers. And just announced , “The most popular stock trading app in China, Straight Flush (同花顺), now adds support for showing the price of Crypto-Currencies.” Did you think China’s rankings will have any real impact?

But the question remains, do these billionaire heavyweights know what they’re talking about? Gates insisted that Bitcoin was a ‘greater fool’ investment, as well as “one of the crazier, speculative things” he had ever seen, and then doubling down by saying he would “short it if there was an easy way to do it.” The funny thing is that at the end of last year, shorting Bitcoin through derivatives was made possible. It’s surprising that someone like Gates doesn’t currently know what he can or cannot do in the Bitcoin investment landscape. For his part, Buffett bashed Bitcoin by stating that “when you’re buying nonproductive assets, all you’re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more because they’re even more excited about another next person coming along.” The Oracle of Omaha said the same thing about commodities several years ago. It’s true that it remains difficult to accurately predict commodity prices over time due to the challenges of maintaining consistent profit margins in a fluctuating market, but by no means is an investor not able to turn a profit with a properly timed investment, which is the case with Bitcoin or any other investment. Munger jumped in by saying Bitcoin was “worthless artificial gold,” and that it reminded him of “Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting: the pursuit of uneatable by the unspeakable.” All the Bitcoin bashing didn’t go unnoticed, causing the digital asset’s value to slip all the way down to $9,300. It’s true that these three billionaires are the best of the best and deserve to have their opinions heard, but this story has been played out over and over again. Why is it that older successful men who are already dominating their respective industries continue to trash-talk Bitcoin? To be honest, I would not expect anything less. Bitcoin is a threat to the way we currently do things. It’s disrupting both the technology and financial industries, and those who have made a fortune in these sectors have nothing to gain from the digital currency and everything to lose. Does a highly profitable centralized software company like Microsoft want a decentralized currency to come along? Of course not! The super-rich have nothing to gain from Bitcoin succeeding. There’s only so much wealth that can exist in the world, and if Bitcoin continues to advance on fiat currencies like the dollar, then those holding most of their wealth in dollars will possess less overall value. I would put people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Charlie Munger at the top of this list. And let’s not forget about other Bitcoin haters like JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon or BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who called Bitcoin a fraud. The fact is that these individuals have achieved success at the highest level, and they continue to badmouth Bitcoin because it offers no benefit to their current ventures and only threatens their wealth and business enterprises. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T13:41:59.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "632c77e4d0ca357a334eccbc0b8947f902e37606", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jeUNb.T6kja1lG7YmP.dGYnLJYyktSwaolwr9whmo4LaHkKXvdUlYcB2bt3JpJXS0vz10X6PFGGMaeRkxbt.tZZXhstDkYCZKnRtVm_Ey9GFi2kk2olClj77P.4Kf0g5W", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: Smooth Bitcoin Cash Upgrade, BCH and BTC Tax Payments in Florida", "title_full": "This Week in Bitcoin: Smooth Bitcoin Cash Upgrade, BCH and BTC Tax Payments in Florida", "published": "2018-05-20T15:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_785518696_1600-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "632c77e4d0ca357a334eccbc0b8947f902e37606", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jeUNb.T6kja1lG7YmP.dGYnLJYyktSwaolwr9whmo4LaHkKXvdUlYcB2bt3JpJXS0vz10X6PFGGMaeRkxbt.tZZXhstDkYCZKnRtVm_Ey9GFi2kk2olClj77P.4Kf0g5W", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin.com", "published": "2018-05-20T15:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: Smooth Bitcoin Cash Upgrade, BCH and BTC Tax Payments in Florida", "text": "This Week in Bitcoin: Smooth Bitcoin Cash Upgrade, BCH and BTC Tax Payments in Florida May 20, 2018 542\nA notable week for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – the network successfully upgraded the blockchain protocol by extending the block size to 32MB. The change will allow a greater number of transactions to be processed with inexpensive and consistent transaction fees. Also, Seminole County in Florida will accept tax payments in both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) thanks to a partnership with Bitpay.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Warren Warned by Billboards, Coinbase Tempted by Banking Bitcoin Cash Upgrades Blockchain Protocol\nThe Bitcoin Cash network has smoothly and successfully upgraded the blockchain protocol this Tuesday by extending the block size from 8MB to 32MB. The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356.\nThe change represents one of the largest block size increases in blockchain history. The upgrade also includes an increased default data-carrier-size, from 80-bytes to 220-bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes, which could add the ability to code colored coins and binary contracts.\nThe fourfold block size increase will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent and inexpensive transaction fees. It also gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit and paves a path for mass adoption . The block size limits are currently set by the miner, and developers are able to set the capacity so that blocks cannot get full in the immediate future. This means that the fees will remain low for quite some time and also reliable, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as in the last quarter of 2017. Bitpay Enables BCH and BTC for Tax Payments in Florida County\nUS-based crypto payment processor Bitpay has announced a formal agreement with Florida’s Seminole County Tax Collector, Joel M. Greenberg. Both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) can be used for tax payments starting this summer. County residents will be able to pay in crypto for driver licenses, ID cards, and even property taxes.\n“We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service, and we should expect the same from our government,” Greenberg said. He added that the aim of his tenure in office is to make customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st. One way to achieve that, the official says, is to add cryptocurrency to the available payment options. China Ranks Almost 30 Cryptos, Finds Over 400 Fake Coins\nThe government of China, one of the first to ban cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, has come out with official crypto rankings . The Chinese Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) will be judging leading digital coins according to three major criteria – innovation, technology, and application – although details about the applied methodology are yet to be shared. A total of 28 cryptocurrencies and their respective blockchains have been ranked. Of the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum was ranked first, followed by Bitcoin Core (BTC) at number 13, Ripple is 17th, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – 25th. The Chinese top five include Ether, Steem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo.\nAnother sign of growing attention to cryptocurrencies in China is the publication of a report on fake coins by a government-backed industry organization. The National Committee of Experts on the Internet Financial Security Technology (IFCERT) has identified 421 fake cryptocurrencies. The organization pointed out that 60% of these cryptos are deployed overseas. IFCERT also outlined some major red flags of the fake coins. According to the Committee, they often adopt “pyramid-based” business models and claim high returns. The cryptos have no real code – they either do not have a blockchain or cannot generate blocks for one. These coins are not traded on legitimate exchanges, the report also notes. US Government Launches Scam Crypto Site\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created and published its own version of an initial coin offering (ICO) scam website. “Combining the two most growth-oriented segments of the digital economy, blockchain technology and travel, Howeycoin is the newest and only coin offering that captures the magic of coin trading profits and the excitement and guaranteed returns of the travel industry,” the mock SEC website claims. It promises partnerships in all segments of the travel industry and “earning coins you can trade for profit.”\n“The rapid growth of the ‘ICO’ market, and its widespread promotion as a new investment opportunity, has provided fertile ground for bad actors to take advantage of our Main Street investors. We embrace new technologies, but we also want investors to see what fraud looks like, so we built this educational site with many of the classic warning signs of fraud,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton explained . He also noted that distributed ledger technology can add efficiency to the capital raising process, but promoters and issuers need to make sure they follow the securities laws. “I encourage investors to do their diligence and ask questions,” Clayton said. EU Adopts Rules to Reduce Anonymity for Crypto Users\nThis week, the European Union moved closer to its goal to minimize anonymous crypto transactions. The EU Council adopted a directive, which updates the European anti-money laundering legislation. The new rules come with requirements for crypto platforms to introduce know-your-customer procedures. The amendments were adopted at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, following an agreement with the European Parliament form December. In April this year, MEPs voted to support the deal to “bring cryptocurrencies under closer regulation.”\nThe main changes involve addressing the “risks linked to virtual currencies” by taking steps to reduce anonymity for both crypto traders and crypto-related transactions. Providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies, as well as custodian wallet providers, will be obliged to identify suspicious activities. The directive states that authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies through these platforms, and the national financial intelligence units should have access to information allowing them to associate crypto addresses with the their owners. South Korean Regulators Widen Investigation of Crypto Exchanges\nThe government in Seoul is widening its probe on cryptocurrency exchanges focusing on the use of corporate accounts for crypto transactions, which the regulators say can lead to money laundering. The practice should have been discontinued when authorities introduced the real-name system at the end of January. However, only 30% of all crypto accounts have been converted into real-name ones so far. South Korea’s top financial regulators are now teaming up with prosecutors to widen the investigation.\nThe six banks that can issue real-name accounts have chosen to only service the country’s largest crypto exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. Nonetheless, not all accounts at these exchanges have been converted into real-name ones. In addition, all small and medium-sized exchanges continue to use corporate accounts for crypto transactions. The regulators warn that the use of corporate accounts can lead to fraud . The announcement of the widening probe follows the launch of an investigation on the largest South Korean crypto exchange, Upbit .\nWhat are your thoughts on the top stories we’ve covered this week?

The billionaire investor has consistently espoused the rhetoric that Bitcoin has no value. Recently, a crypto miner has taken to publicly calling out the Berkshire Hathaway chief for his negative comments. Warren Buffett Doesn’t Know It All As far as Genesis Mining co-founder Marco Krohn is concerned, Warren Buffett is not an authority on Bitcoin. In fact, he doesn’t even know it all when it comes to investing. Despite a stellar investment career, the “Oracle of Omaha” hasn’t always called it correctly. By his own admission, Buffett regrets not immediately seeing the potential in Google and Amazon. He even only reluctantly invested in Apple after first dismissing the company’s stock for many years. With all of this in mind, Krohn is trying to show the public that Buffett’s rhetoric should be taken with a grain of salt. In a tweet on May 16, Krohn showed photos of billboards reminding Buffett of his past investment mistakes. The sign reads: Warren: You said you were wrong about Google and Amazon. Maybe you’re wrong about Bitcoin. What makes the campaign even more profound is that the billboard is right outside Buffett’s office in Omaha. It is a not too subtle diss to an individual who has spread much vitriol and FUD about Bitcoin. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO recently called the digital currency “ rat poison .” Many in the cryptocurrency community have disagreed with Buffett with some even going as far as saying that he doesn’t know anything about bitcoin. Some new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! :) #GenesisMining #Bitcoin #BitcoinAwareness pic.twitter.com/MxuKLwRS8L — Marco Krohn (@mkrohn5) May 16, 2018 Genesis Mining Crypto Awareness Campaign The Buffett-bashing billboard is part of a larger Bitcoin awareness campaign organized by the mining giant. The company, which also owns one of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in Iceland, is known for such public rebukes of crypto critics. During the just concluded Consensus conference in New York, the company organized a mock protest under the aegis of “Bankers Against Blockchain.” The rally was to enlighten people on what could become a reality in a few years’ time. The parody demonstration also aimed digs at people like Jamie Dimon and the Bitcoin bubble brigade. The company has also come down hard on negative journalistic sentiments, especially those platforms fond of posting Bitcoin obituary articles. Apart from going up against critics, the campaign also strives to educate people about the practical applications of Bitcoin, especially in remittance. Part of the campaign’s mantra is that it shouldn’t cost money to send money. Thus. They regularly tell people that they can send money for free using Bitcoin rather than via remittance platforms like Western Union who charge high fees. Should crypto critics be given a taste of their own medicine? Do you agree that Warren Buffett knows nothing about bitcoin and blockchain technology?

According to local media , the state is currently considering a draft proposal concerning crypto donations for political campaigns. Colorado is Joining the Trend Wayne Williams, the Colorado Secretary of State, submitted the proposal earlier in the week. According to the details of the draft, Bitcoin donations would comply with the same rules as cash donations. Due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the value of such donations are determined at the time of the contribution. Wayne Williams, Colorado Secretary of State Commenting on the move, Suzanne Staiert, the Deputy Secretary of State, said: The FEC is doing it now, so we are just going along for the ride. With the move under consideration, the state government welcomes comments from the general public. Interested persons can contact the office of the Colorado Secretary of State on or before May 23rd. Bitcoin in Politics Donations are an integral part of the American political landscape and sometimes play a profound role in shaping policy developments. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies indeed play a significant role in the political campaign fundraising arena. Since the Federal Election Commission approved cryptocurrency contributions to campaign financing in 2014, its use has increased considerably. The FEC’s decision categorized such contributions as “in-kind donations.” New Hampshire was the first to jump on the trend back in 2014 when Republican Andrew Hemingway became the first U.S. politician to accept Bitcoin contributions. Rand Paul also accepted crypto donations during his 2016 presidential bid. To date, the largest reported crypto donation to a political campaign is the 0.284 BTC ($4,500) received by Austin Petersen from Missouri. Presently, Congressional hopeful Patrick Nelson from New York is accepting Bitcoin donations to his campaign via Bitpay. There are those who oppose the adoption of crypto contributions in campaign fundraising. Issues arising from anonymity and the risk of “dirty money” being funneled into politics are top of the list of objections against the trend. The lack of full transparency in crypto transactions seems for some to be at odds with the philosophy of political donations in America. There is also the problem of volatility which makes cryptos an enormous accounting headache. Even Staiert agrees, saying: It’s going to be an accounting problem, potentially, for campaigns who want to use it. Does the anonymous nature of crypto transactions pose a problem when used for political donations? Do you think Bitcoin political donations should be legalized? Let us know in the comments below.

The price started a downside move and traded below the $1,350 and $1,280 support levels. There was even a break below the $1,200 pivot level, which opened the doors for more losses. It traded close to the $1,120 support level and a low was formed at $1,131. \\n\nLater, the price started an upside correction and moved above the $1,120 resistance. It also moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,506 high to $1,131 low. However, there are many barriers on the upside near $1,300. An initial hurdle is near $1,128, which was a support earlier and it may now prevent gains .
