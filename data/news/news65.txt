Ethereum (ETH) advocates, citing block explorer Etherscan, claim ETH passed bitcoin core (BTC) by reaching 35 million unique addresses, a doubling in something like five months, averaging reportedly 100K a day. The last available figures for BTC addresses had them at roughly 25 million as of spring this year. ETH enthusiasts are insisting this is a positive step in the march to eventually snatching the number one coin spot.\nAlso read: India Rejects Venezuelan Crypto Despite 30% Discount Flippening Close or Just Hopeful Hype?\nHopeful hype is starting again in pockets of the crypto ecosystem, especially among Vitalik Buterin fans and ETH followers. It’s due to their long held belief the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency by market capitalization must eventually replace bitcoin core (BTC) at the top in what’s been dubbed the flippening. Hype is arguably the best word at the moment, if only because of that pesky market capitalization: as of publication , BTC has nearly three times the market cap of ETH, and 24 trading volume seems to follow a similar ratio.\nWhat is causing a restirring of such flippening just might be a relatively recent milestone. According to Etherscan, ETH has pulled out ahead of BTC in unique addresses, gaining at the rate of one hundred thousand per day. The number floating around is rather eye popping: 35 million uniques.\nBTC stopped marking the number earlier this year for a variety of reasons, so ETH followers’ celebrations are based mostly on supposition, inference. The last figures available for BTC had unique addresses around 24 million. Still, the leap passed BTC also includes active addresses , perhaps a more profound metric when attempting to make the ETH flippening case: ETH has over 500K, BTC about 25K less. BTC Might Have Only Itself to Blame\nAddresses do not equate to actual users, however. One ETH user can hold many addresses, and in the case of ETH smart contracts are also being smuggled in the numbers. Yet, wallets for the respective cryptos can be telling when placed against the above stats. Ethereum wallet address are reused as a matter of course, while bitcoin core wallet address are frequently particular to each transaction. By every rational theory, BTC should far outstrip ETH in at least this category. As explained, that’s not the case. Caveats include how the 100K per day number is actually quite a fall off from as soon as the beginning of this year when ETH was clocking 300K per day at times. The Crypto Winter sapped much of those records, and truth is only on-chain activity is being measured (to the exclusion of exchanges, for example). In terms of raw transaction numbers, ETH is crushing BTC, 800K to 200K.\nFor BTC enthusiasts, however, who insist including the counting of ETH smart contracts to be gilding the lily, cooking the books or whatever, are probably on the weak side of that argument. After all, as bitcoin cash (BCH) is beginning to show, increasing block size would allow for such use cases to have taken place, something the bitcoin core community has stubbornly refused to concede. Add to it gaffs in transaction fees and times, mempool congestion, plaguing BTC at the height of its price and corresponding media coverage only compounded block size issues. Should the flippening happen, the BTC community would have itself to blame.\nDo you think anything like the flippening is happening?

Jeffreys Bay, South Africa : ChainEX is the only digital asset exchange that provides a platform for South Africans to buy, sell or trade over 30 different digital assets using the South African rand as the default fiat-buying currency for some.\nChainEX’s director, Otto Lessing said their mission is to provide a world-class platform that is secure, user-friendly and reliable with a well-tested, highly scalable matching engine to benefit not only South African but also international users – supporting trading in more than 200 countries.\nChainEX is playing its part in meeting the world’s ever-increasing appetite for cryptocurrencies, said Lessing.\nThe increased interest in cryptocurrencies comes as no surprise as more and more people are looking to get involved in this exciting opportunity.\nChainEX’s future plans include expanding its asset base by introducing more digital asset currencies to its trading platform and implementing scaling fees from the 18 th of June , thereby providing its users with an even better experience and more exposure to cryptocurrencies.\nAbout ChainEX\nChainEX was founded early in 2018, but the dream of creating a digital asset exchange existed long before then. In 2015, one of our executive team members was introduced to cryptocurrencies after eavesdropping on a conversation between two people over breakfast. Curiosity got the better of him, and after reading up on what he heard and researching the subject further, he decided he had to get involved. He didn’t know the details yet, but he knew he had to do something.\nEager to share his excitement about this newly discovered technology, he spoke to some of his friends (now shareholders) and spurred on by passion and excitement, with a vague idea of what they wanted to achieve, the journey to ChainEX began.\nThen, with one random conversation, the team met a new friend, who also happened to be a systems architect. ChainEX had a new friend, who had an overseas investment partner and wanted to launch a digital asset exchange. The difference, however, was that they KNEW how to do it! The rest, as they say, is history.\nThe ChainEX journey may sound like a story that only happens by chance, once in a lifetime or only to a select few. But ChainEX doesn’t believe in chance, coincidence or that success is only reserved for some.\nThe team believes in purpose and that if you make up your mind and follow your dreams wholeheartedly, believing that anything is possible, the rest will follow.\nVisit the Website: https://chainex.io", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "otto lessing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lessing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffreys bay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T23:28:00.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d141adcd24f72fe90b2bd7c77f692ecbfafa6eda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3zBPpdaXGu1QlfwHaA4QlgKcv8ECL6EwBUMBYkHn0ofgk0LjPhojIho-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Invest wisely in Bitcoin", "title_full": "Invest wisely in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-02T13:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.redditstatic.com/icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d141adcd24f72fe90b2bd7c77f692ecbfafa6eda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3zBPpdaXGu1QlfwHaA4QlgKcv8ECL6EwBUMBYkHn0ofgk0LjPhojIho-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-02T13:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Invest wisely in Bitcoin", "text": "Community guidelines Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.

Bitcoin will continue to struggle in general, as there is a lot of concern around the world. The Japanese yen is considered to be a safety currency, so if geopolitical concerns pick up again, it’s likely that we will continue to see this market struggle. I think that the market has shown itself to have plenty of support at the ¥700,000 level, so it’s not a huge surprise that we would find buyers just above it. If we can break below the ¥700,000 level, this market will come on wound. Otherwise, we could go as high as ¥1 million in the short term, but I think it would be just that, short-term move based upon the fact that we have been making lower highs for some time.

Bitcoin will continue to struggle in general, as there is a lot of concern around the world. The Japanese yen is considered to be a safety currency, so if geopolitical concerns pick up again, it’s likely that we will continue to see this market struggle. I think that the market has shown itself to have plenty of support at the ¥700,000 level, so it’s not a huge surprise that we would find buyers just above it. If we can break below the ¥700,000 level, this market will come on wound. Otherwise, we could go as high as ¥1 million in the short term, but I think it would be just that, short-term move based upon the fact that we have been making lower highs for some time. I anticipate that this will be a very noisy market.\nBTC/USD Video 04.06.18 Buy & Sell Bitcoin Instantly\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: US dollar has volatile week against Canadian dollar Crude oil markets initially try to rally during the week but fails Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 02/06/18 Gold markets hold support during the week Bitcoin markets very jittery during the week Bitcoin Ready to Make a Move as the Bulls Move in", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-cash-litecoin-ripple-daily-analysis-02-06-18-506617", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-markets-hold-support-week-506582", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-markets-jittery-week-506607&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-markets-jittery-week-506607", "http://fxempire.engine.adglare.net/?348638767", "http://fxempire.engine.adglare.net/?348638767&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/btc-usd/overview&quot;", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCVrnSQIrpw?feature=oembed", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/btc-usd/overview", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/crude-oil-markets-initially-try-rally-week-fails-506588", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/us-dollar-volatile-week-canadian-dollar-506576", "https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/bitcoin-ready-make-move-bulls-move-506686"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T14:05:19.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "622338902d12ac31baed2c4676515637ae0923c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1rcyHHfC9DXbGQMs_o2t3a7", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Flippening?

Ethereum (ETH) advocates are citing block explorer Etherscan claim to passed 35 million unique addresses, a doubling in something like five months, averaging reportedly 100K a day. The last available figures for bitcoin core (BTC) addresses had them at roughly 25 million as of spring this year. ETH enthusiasts are insisting this is a positive step in the march to eventually snatch the number one coin by market capitalization spot.\nAlso read: India Rejects Venezuelan Crypto Despite 30% Discount\nFlippening Close or Just Hopeful Hype? Hopeful hype is starting again in pockets of the crypto ecosystem, especially among Vitalik Buterin fans and ETH followers. It's due to their long held belief the world's second most popular cryptocurrency by market capitalization must eventually replace bitcoin core (BTC) at the top in what's been dubbed the flippening. Hype is arguably the best word at the moment, if only because of that pesky market capitalization: as of publication , BTC has nearly three times the market cap of ETH, and 24 trading volume seems to follow a similar ratio.\nWhat is causing a restirring of such flippening just might be a relatively recent milestone. According to Etherscan, ETH has pulled out ahead of BTC in unique addresses, gaining something in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand per day. The number floating around is rather eye popping: 35 million uniques.\nBTC stopped marking the number earlier this year for a variety of reasons, so ETH followers' celebrations are based mostly on supposition, inference. The last figures available for BTC had unique addresses around 24 million. Still, the leap passed BTC also includes active addresses , perhaps a more profound metric when attempting to make the ETH flippening case: ETH has over 500K, BTC about 25K less.\nBTC Might Have Only Itself to Blame Addresses do not equate to actual users, however. One ETH user can hold many addresses, and in the case of ETH smart contracts are also being smuggled in the numbers. Yet, wallets for the respective cryptos can be telling when placed against the above stats. Ethereum wallet address are reused as a matter of course, while bitcoin core wallet address are frequently particular to each transaction. By every rational theory, BTC should far outstrip ETH in at least this category. As explained, that's not the case.\nCaveats include how the 100K per day number is actually quite a fall off from as soon as the beginning of this year when ETH was clocking 300K per day at times. The Crypto Winter sapped much of those records, and truth is only on-chain activity is being measured (to the exclusion of exchanges, for example). In terms of raw transaction numbers, ETH is crushing BTC, 800K to 200K.\nFor BTC enthusiasts, however, who insist including the counting of ETH smart contracts to be gilding the lily, cooking the books or whatever, are probably on the weak side of that argument. After all, as bitcoin cash (BCH) is beginning to show, increasing block size would allow for such use cases to have taken place, something the bitcoin core community has stubbornly refused to concede. Add to it gaffs in transaction fees and times, mempool congestion, plaguing BTC at the height of its price and corresponding media coverage only compounded block size issues. Should the flippening happen, the BTC community would have itself to blame.\nDo you think anything like the flippening is happening?

The firm will directly allow customers to trade digital currencies using US dollars. Bank approves the agreement\nThe Bloomberg reported that, a Seattle based crypto exchange firm, Bittrex Inc allows user to swap around 200 different digital coins accepting in fiat currency. However, this approach intend more of institutional capital to make its way through crypto industry. Bill Shihara, CEO of Bittrex speaks about the approved agreement with Signature Bank:\n“It’s been a long path… It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It is about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance”.\nEven though, Shihara indicates that crypto assets are emerging into mainstream but many larger institutions still treat cryptocurrency with prudence. However, many have avoided putting their reputations at risk by getting involved with an industry that associated with illegal activities. Due to this, several exchanges allows only ‘crypto-to-crypto’ trade using digital fund, not dollars.\nMoreover, there are many crypto exchanges that have found support for banks. For instance, Coinbase has developed relationships with several bank including, Metropolitan Bank, Cross River Bank and Silvergate Bank in the U.S.\nAdditionally, most popular cryptocurrency exchanges recently managed to secure a Barclays PLC bank account in UK. Bill Shihara also spoke about the company’s process to ensure the deal:\n“They really do look and pore through the entire business… and they want to make sure that we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes, that we’ve got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts”.\nAt present, Bittrex’s crypto fiat trading service has already been launched on Thursday. It will only be available for Bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD customers in Montana, New York and Washington California. Further, the company stated that gradually it will mount its offering to retails investors as well. What do you have to say about Bittrex crypto fiat trading services?

This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be traded on the following cryptocurrency exchanges: BitMEX, Coinrail, BitForex, C2CX, GOPAX, Luno, Bitstamp, BtcTrade.im, BTCBOX, fex, Bitbank, Bibox, Kucoin, OOOBTC, Paribu, Zaif, BTCC, Upbit, Iquant, Cobinhood, Trade By Trade, GDAX, Lbank, B2BX, CoinTiger, Coinhub, YoBit, OTCBTC, Korbit, Bitinka, EXX, ZB.COM, TOPBTC, Sistemkoin, OKEx, Bitfinex, Ethfinex, Coinroom, Poloniex, RightBTC, CEX.IO, CoinsBank, OEX, Quoine, Fatbtc, Binance, Bittrex, WEX, Coinone, Bit-Z, Negocie Coins, CoinBene, Livecoin, Gemini, Bithumb, xBTCe, CoinEx Market, Omicrex, CoinEgg, BCEX, Octaex, DragonEX, Tidex, LakeBTC, Exmo, Huobi, Fisco, Simex, Coinsuper, Neraex, Gate.io, BitBay, itBit, Exrates, Hotbit, bitFlyer, Kraken, HitBTC and IDAX.

According to Etherscan, ETH has pulled out ahead of BTC in unique addresses, gaining something in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand per day. The number floating around is rather eye popping: 35 million uniques.\nBTC stopped marking the number earlier this year for a variety of reasons, so ETH followers’ celebrations are based mostly on supposition, inference. The last figures available for BTC had unique addresses around 24 million.

The Crypto Winter sapped much of those records, and truth is only on-chain activity is being measured (to the exclusion of exchanges, for example). In terms of raw transaction numbers, ETH is crushing BTC, 800K to 200K.\nFor BTC enthusiasts, however, who insist including the counting of ETH smart contracts to be gilding the lily, cooking the books or whatever, are probably on the weak side of that argument. After all, as bitcoin cash (BCH) is beginning to show, increasing block size would allow for such use cases to have taken place, something the bitcoin core community has stubbornly refused to concede.

İşte Müslüman Dünyasının Bitcoine Bakışı", "text": "İslam dünyası dışında yaşayan insanlar için Bitcoinin helal veya haram olup olmaması pek de bir sorun teşkil etmezken, durum İslam coğrafyasına gelindiğinde ise değişiyor. Özellikle de 1.6 milyar kişinin inandığı bir dinin bu konuda ne diyeceğinin bilinmesi, birçok yatırımcı için çok çok büyük bir öneme sahip.\nNisan ayının ortasında, Bitcoinin şeriat kurallarına uygun olup olmadığı yönünde bir toplantı düzenlenmiş ve Müslüman şeriat hukukçusu Muhammad Abu Bakar, sürece ilişkin değerlendirme raporu yayınlamıştı. Abu Bakar, o dönemde yaptığı açıklamasında Bitcoinin islama aykırılık teşkil etmediğini ve rahatlıkla helal olarka nitelendirilebileceğini belirtti.\nAncak Abu Bakarın ifade ettiği şey, Bitcoinin çeşitli fonksiyonlarını kapsıyordu. Örneğin, Müslümanlar eğer Bitcoini bir şeyi satın almak için kullanırsa bu Bitcoinin helalliğine bir şey getirmiyor ancak eğer bunun bir yatırım aracı olarak görülmesi ve trade yapılması konusunda net bir söylem yok. Abu Bakar o dönem konuyla ilgili yapıtğı açıklamasında: Kripto paraları bir ödeme metodu olarak kullanmak daha tercih edilesi bir şey çünkü geleneksel piyasalara göre avantajları olduğu açık. Ancak yatırım amaçlı alınmasını ise tavsiye etmiyorum. derken bu durum biraz da olsa kaos yarattı.\nOlayın aslında özü, Bitcoinin ve diğer kripto paraların ödeme amaçlı kullanılmasında dinen bir sakınca yok ancak; yatırım amaçlı kullanılmaları konusunda helal ya da haram olacağı muallakta.\nRaporun ardından Londrada faaliyet gösteren bir camii, Ramazan ayı boyunca zekat olarak Bitcoin kabul edileceğini açıklamış ve bu haber basında geniş yankı uyandırmıştı.\nAbu Bakarın yayınladığı raporun kısa bir süre sonrasında Bitcoin fiyatı bin dolarlık bir artış göstermiş; bazı otoriteler bu artışı helal sinyali alan Müslüman yatırımcının piyasaya girmesine baplamıştı. Ancak bu fikre katılmayan kişi sayısı da gayet fazlaydı.\nExante isimli bir analiz firmasının uzmanı Sean Rakhimov da, helal sinyalinden sonra Bitcoin fiyatının artmasının tesadüf olduğunu düşünen ekipten. Konuyla ilgili yaptığı açıklamasında Bitcoin ve altın arasındaki korelasyona dikkat çeken Rakhimov, şunları söyledi:\n2016da altının helal olduğu yönünde haberler piyasada yer aldı. 2018e gelindiğinde ise aynısı Bitcoin için gerçekleşti. O dönem altın için de insanlar müslümanlar altın alacak ve fiyat artacak diyordu ancak hiç de öyle olmadı. O sebeple helal açıklamasından sonra Bitcoin artışının tesadüf olduğunu düşünüyorum. Elbette ki insanlar böylesi bağlantılar kurup spekülasyonlar yapmayı çok severler ancak bence arada hiçbir korelasyon yok.\nRakhimov sözlerine 2016 senesinde yaşanan petrol fiyatlarındaki düşüş ile devam ederken, şu ifadeleri kullandı:\nPetrol fiyatları Ocak 2016da neredeyse 28 dolarlara kadar gerilemişti. Şimdilerde ise 80 dolar. 28 dolar demek, geçimini petrolden sağlayan birçok Müslüman ülkenin yatırım yapmasını ya da para biriktirmesini zorlaştırmak demek. Ayrıca altın herkes tarafından bilinen bir yatırım aracı ve sıklıkla kullanılan bir şey iken, Bitcoin için bunu söyleyemeyiz. İnsanların büyük bir kısmı halen Bitcoinin nasıl işlediği konusunda net bir fikre sahip değil. Büyük bir kısım insan için Bitcoin halen gizemli bir ürün.\nAbu Bakarın Bitcoine helal yakıştırmasını yapması; tüm İslam camiasında ise karşılık bulan bir değerlendirme olmadı. Örneğin ülkemizde, Diyanet İşlerinden yapılan açıklamada Bitcoin gibi diğer kripto paraları alıp satmanın, spekülatif doğası gereği nedeniyle haram olduğu yönünde bir telkinde bulunuldu. Bu paraların gerek yasa dışı kullanım alanları olması gerekse de muhasebesinin tutulması nedeniyle yatırımcılar, Bitcoine karşı uyarıldı.\nKarşı çıkan tarafın bir diğer önemli argümanı da Bitcoin alıp satıcılığının tefeciliğe girdiğini iddia etmeleri. Bitcoinin ciddi volalitesi olduğunu belirten bazı din alimleri, bu sebeple Bitcoin alıp satmanın şeriat kuralları gereğince, kumar sınıfına gireceğini iddia ediyor.\nPro Pakistani isimli bir dergide editörlük yapan Haamiz Ahmed, konuyla ilgili şunları söyledi:\nBir Bitcoini dolar karşılığında sattığınız esnada fiyat 100 dolar düşerse, satış yaparken zarar etmiş olursunuz. Aslında bu durum kumarda da vardır.\nAncak bu ifadeler ile birlikte Ahmed aynı zamanda Bitcoinin fiyat iniş çıkışlarının daha tahmin edilebilir olduğunu belirterek bu durumun da Bitcoin ticaretini kumara daha az benzettiği fikrini savunuyor.\nNew Yorkda faaliyet gösteren Bitcoin Centerın kurucu ortağı Hamdan Azhar ise, yaptığı açıklamada olaya farklı bir perspektiften bakarak bazı İslam ülkelerinin ve Müslümanların çoktan bu işe yatırım yaptığını belirtiyor. Hamdan Azhar, sözlerine şu cümlelerle devam ediyor:\nElbette her zaman bu işe erkenden uyanan ve yatırım yapanlar oldular. Karachiden Kuala Lumpura birçok ülkede insanlar Bitcoin ile çok önceden haşır neşir olmaya başladılar. Biz de Amerikada insanlara kripto paralar ve Blockchain ile ilgili ders anlatıyoruz ve kendimiz de ticaret yapıyoruz. Bitcoinin helal olduğu yönündeki son ifadeler, eğer bana soracak olursanız sektöre bambaşka bir kapı açacak.\nBu arada, Azhar argümanını bir adım ileri taşıyarak, kripto paraların İslam toplumu için itibari paradan çok daha değerli bir enstürman olabileceğini ifade ediyor. Kripto paraların özellikleri sebebiyle dine, itibari paralardan daha uygun olabileceğini belirten Azhar, şunları söylüyor:\nFaiz ve borçlanma ile yürüyen geleneksel ekonomi sisteminden açıkçası birçok Müslüman rahatsız. Bitcoin, teknolojisi ve özellikleri ile Müslümanlar için çok daha iyi bir ürün. Birçok Müslüman, İslam kurallarına uyduğu takdirde, Bitcoin gibi finansal devrim yapacak araçlara zaten hep sıcak bakmıştır.\nZekat vermenin İslamın beş şartından birisi olduğunu da belirten Azhar, zekatın da kripto paralar ile yapılacak olmasının bazı Müslümanları daha mutlu edebileceğini iddia ediyor. Azhara göre, itibari paralara takılı kalmak yerine, insanlar kripto paralar ile zekat ödemeyi tercih ediyor ve bunu daha anlamlı buluor.\nİslam Ülkelerinde Blockchainin Durumu\nBitcoinin fiyatı en azından şu an için sektöre aktığı iddia edilen Müslüman yatırımcının katkısından pek etkilenmemiş gibi duruyor ancak; Bitcoine helal diyen raporların daha fazla çıkması demek; bu sektöre İslami coğrafyalardan paranın akmaya devam edeceği anlamına da geliyor.\nBu konuyu gündemine alan Müslüman bir girişim de var. Al Jazeeranın haberine göre Malezya merkezli One Gram, altın destekli bir kripto parayı piyasaya yakın bir süre içinde çıkarmayı planlıyor. Şirketin planı, Müslüman insanlara kripto paraların dini inançla ters düşmediğini ve kripto paraların kullanılabilir olduğunu anlatmaya çalışmak.\nOne Gram şirketinin kurucu ortaklarından birisi olan Ibrahim Mohammed şirketin ana amacını şu ifadelerle açıklıyor:\nAltın, paranın farklı bir formda karşımıza çıkabileceğini biz Müslümanlara gösteren ilk şeydi diyebiliriz. Artık bunu bir de dijital dünyaya taşımak ve insanlara kanıtlı örnekler ile bunu anlatarak, Bitcoinin dine uygunluğunu kanıtlamak istiyoruz. Bunu başarmak en büyük amacımız.\nDubai merkezli bir kripto para girişimi olan Habibi Coin de aynı One Gram gibi aynı yolun yolcusu olan bir başka şirket. Şirketin web sitesinde, kripto paranın şu şekilde dizayn edildiği yazıyor:\nŞeriat uyumlu, faizi ve borcu düşüren, ürünlerin devalüasyonunu engelleyen ve İslam coğrafyası için yeni bir para transfer metodu olan bir para.\nYazar Davy Barkera göre, Bitcoin ve Blockchain, yeni dönemde İslam ekonomisinde sanılandan çok çok daha büyük bir rol oynama potansiyeline sahip. Barker, şu ifadeleri kullanıyor:\nEn en iyi senaryoda bile kağıt para İslami kurallara tabii tutulduğunda 6 kıstas üzerinden 2 geçer puan gibi bir not alır. Kripto paralarda ise bu sayı 4 ya da 5 olabilir. O yüzden kağıt paraya haram demeyen hiçbir Müslüman, Bitcoine haram diyemez. Hatta bana kalırsa, Müslümanlar dine daha az uyumlu olan kağıt parayı terk edip, Bitcoine bakmalılar çünkü bence o dine daha uygun bir para birimi.\nHaber linki : https://koinbulteni.com/helal-mi-haram-mi-iste-musluman-dunyasinin-bitcoine-bakisi-19520.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://koinbulteni.com/helal-mi-haram-mi-iste-musluman-dunyasinin-bitcoine-bakisi-19520.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T18:26:59.095+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e7ce35c31dd7f5fb5eef1745dc7d6cc37daaff0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSqNuCiWPP_kFHbfXWpTWnVc4_XUsjbqfk.7IESSu_kbraf0SL64NDqhBET66USVWy6p2Q2WmbjzQyfOlHNu30JsTzfEYPfHf60mscWqShQMP3D6T2rhExzlwH90v1GFDo4dv2r.EIv55AFDIlTGSna0Kg20yFnpTwjBZ7fOIHWhQ--", "site_full": "justbitcoinnews.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://justbitcoinnews.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin – JUST BITCOIN NEWS", "title": "Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin", "title_full": "Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-02T11:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e7ce35c31dd7f5fb5eef1745dc7d6cc37daaff0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSqNuCiWPP_kFHbfXWpTWnVc4_XUsjbqfk.7IESSu_kbraf0SL64NDqhBET66USVWy6p2Q2WmbjzQyfOlHNu30JsTzfEYPfHf60mscWqShQMP3D6T2rhExzlwH90v1GFDo4dv2r.EIv55AFDIlTGSna0Kg20yFnpTwjBZ7fOIHWhQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JUST BITCOIN NEWS", "published": "2018-06-02T11:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin", "text": "This week news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the adult film star Brenna Sparks about how she’s been relentlessly promoting cryptocurrencies to her co-workers and peers throughout the sex industry.

I think blockchain related stocks in general are likely much better mid to longterm investments than the coins. RIOT is certainly speculative and is quite rich at these levels, but I'd be very careful about actually shorting it for any length of time. It is quite volatile, and is known to spike up very high in very short time periods. These small cap stocks can occasionally continue going up to quite irrational levels for longer time periods than expected. And although a stock can only lose 100% of its value, it can in theory go up infinitely. Put options on it are relatively cheap right now and are safer IMO. I tend to use actual short positions rather carefully - either very short term (usually intra-day) on more volatile securities, or else sticking to shorting (for any length of time) the larger, less volatile companies that have (likely temporarily) gotten ahead of themselves. Personally, just because I may sell completely out of a holding doesn't mean I will then short it. The security may stall out or continue going up after I sell out. And I often only sell a portion of a position - I may keep half or less of a long position on, and may scale out (or down) gradually.

At the current time, Bitcoin price trend still dominates the market trend.\nHowever, Bitcoin leading position seems to be doubtable as Altcoins have recorded a stronger rise recently and the market is less affected by Bitcoin. Instead of following the general price trend of bitcoin, many cryptocurrencies also start to follow their own trajectory.\nThis week, the altcoin works much better than both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The added value of the ERC20 tokens and the increasing demand for small cryptocurrencies of investors in the global market has proved that Crypto investors are more confident in betting their money on this market.\nSaxo Investment Bank from Danish, with its aim to focus on online trading and investment, has announced in a recent report that the capital inflows from organizations to the Crypto market will lead to a rise in prices for most of these currencies.\nIt is true, among other crypto coins bitcoin became strong in the market was the first crypto currency that introduced to the market in 2009 and after that only altcoin which suddenly increase in the market.

Indeed, the current price of Bitcoin, for example, has slumped, and now the coin trades at $7,436.\nMorehead sees this as an opportunity for investors and gives his own tip: “Buy a currency once it breaks its 230-day moving average, wait a year and sell.” “Without even thinking about it,” Morehead said, “you make an average of 239 percent.” He elaborated pointing out that Bitcoin is the best illustration in this case, as it is a coin to which it “happened about five times in the last six years.” He also commented on the fact that SEC has launched an investigation against malpractices on the crypto market. However, he believes that this fact should not be the investors’ top concern: “Many institutions are essentially buying the rumor and selling the fact.\nGetting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we’re hearing about come online, they’ll already have their positions.” Morehead is not the only big shot in the crypto industry who is sure that now is the time to buy more Bitcoin. Spencer Bogart, CEO of Blockchain Capital, also thinks it is a good idea to acquire more coins appealing to the fact that Bitcoin is slowly being institutionalized.\nHe even adds that he believes BTC will be trading at $10,000 by the end of the year. John McAfee, CEO of MGT Capital Investments Inc, has also recently reaffirmed that he still believes that Bitcoin price will reach $15,000 in June while also claiming that he never said that Bitcoin will be trading at $78 000 by the end of 2018.\nEven though he very well did. An independent research boutique, Fundstrat Global Advisors, has a more modest prediction for Bitcoin — $36,000 by the end of 2019.
