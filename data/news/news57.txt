In the first days after Bitcoin was created, the concept of the cryptocurrency was just catching on. However, that didn’t happen overnight as the Bitcoin price didn’t trade above $100 until after five years.\nHe described the next phase as the ‘boom’ phase, adding that;\nThe subsequent ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.\nIn this boom stage, fear of missing out (FOMO) will see companies looking to capitalize on the growing industry and getting more involved with cryptos and the blockchain technology. He suggested that in some cases, the companies just add the word blockchain to their name as they look to draw more interest from investors.\nThe next step is the coming in of celebrities like Steven Seagal and Floyd Mayweather, who wanted to get a piece of the cryptocurrency action by endorsing some newly formed digital currencies. Unfortunately, these companies that have been endorsed by celebrities do not offer valid projects and have been exposed as frauds, leading to their shut down.\nVan der Burgt continued by arguing that the supposed Bitcoin bubble entered the ‘euphoric’ stage, which he believes is similar to the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. He wrote that;\nThe euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments. According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance.\nAfter the price of Bitcoin fell by more than 60% of its all-time high, van der Burgt suggested that the market is now entering the ‘profit-taking’ stage, a phase where so-called smart money begins to leave the market, leaving only one step left before the bubble pops. He added that;\nThe subsequent ‘panic’ phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and bitcoin’s price would substantially crash.\nHowever, van der Burgt admitted that he could be wrong with his analysis as most experts in the cryptocurrency world think, with the Bitcoin price expected to keep rising in value till it becomes very strong. He wrote that;\nThen again, maybe Bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency.\nEven though the rise of Bitcoin in some ways can be compared to a bubble, it is impossible to know if it is. One thing that people who attack Bitcoin fail to understand is that cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology, Blockchain have a lot of real-world applications, with van der Burgt admitting that Bitcoin could become a “new global currency”.

Robert Sluymer, Managing Director and Technical Strategist at Fundstrat seems to be joining the company’s growing group of cryptocurrency bulls. Promising Signs for Bitcoin?\nOn CNBC’s “Futures Now” segment , Sluymer stated:\n“We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here.”\nSluymer also noted that he has a three-phase technical analysis process that allows him to try to predict future price movements of cryptocurrencies. The first phase, which is the deceleration or bottoming out of momentum indicators, may be just starting.\nSluymer pointed out that the first phase seems to be in effect when he said:\n“While it is premature to conclude the correction is over, there was a positive technical development this week suggesting the first stage of a three-stage bottoming process is developing. Short-term momentum indicators are beginning to bottom.”\nFor the past week, Bitcoin has been hovering around the low to mid $7000s, in a low volatility state, as shown by the bottom most indicator in the chart below.\nVolatility has become a key characteristic often attributed with the price of cryptocurrencies and seeing a slowdown in volatility might leave some market players in a confused state. I personally would attribute this decrease in relative volatility to the increased institutional involvement in the industry.\nHowever, take volatility with a grain of salt in this case, as volatility levels we are currently residing at were seen just before the crypto boom of 2017.\nBut some have begun to believe that this is a promising sign, as they believe that Bitcoin is consolidating before the eventual retesting of ATHs. $6500 Triple Bottom. Is it Possible?\nHowever, Bitcoin is still over $1000 away from 2018’s low, which amounted to around $6500 back in early April. The low in April was actually a double-bottom, with Bitcoin reaching similar price levels back in February after December’s $20,000 Bitcoin. This has led some analysts who are more critical of Bitcoin’s price, to think that a triple-bottom could occur in the future. However, even if Bitcoin was to revisit those prices levels, past indicators show that there is a large amount of support at $6500.\nDespite fears of a triple-bottom at $6500, the relative strength indicator (RSI) has been trending upwards (as seen by the chart above), finding a bottom of around 30 earlier this week. This RSI indicator, which is still located in the ‘oversold’ zone, may show that Bitcoin is prepared for upwards price action.\nOver the course of this year’s price drops to $6500, RSI indicators often went as low as 30, with run-ups in price and positive indicators quickly following the aforementioned price drops. If historical values and patterns are of any merit, as they often are, this means that we could see a rapid Bitcoin run-up in the near future.\nHowever, Sluymer believes that before that Bitcoin breaking past $7800 will have to be a precursor to the run-up which many have been waiting for.\nDespite the potential for Bitcoin’s short-term success, Sluymer believes that the largest cryptocurrency may lose some dominance as some players like EOS and Tron (TRX) may outperform Bitcoin in the near future. He also mentioned that other cryptocurrencies residing in the top-40, such as IOTA, 0x, and WaltonChain have shown that they may also begin to encroach on Bitcoin’s 38% market share.\nBut Sluymer made it clear that he is still adamant about his belief that Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, will begin to see some upward price action very shortly.\nHe put it best when he said:\n“If you’re short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.”\nCharts from Tradingview.com\nImage from Shutterstock FundStrat Analyst: Bitcoin at the Bottom, Recovery Very Soon was last modified: June 3rd, 2018 by nickchong ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/bitcoin-finds-a-bottom-after-plunging-from-highs-technician.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "recovery very soon fundstrat", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T14:09:30.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e197d892109720cb50aa938274fe36780ae8142", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1qkXYRPElgS8tuB9ePVej9P", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "FundStrat Analyst: Bitcoin at the Bottom, Recovery Very Soon", "title_full": "FundStrat Analyst: Bitcoin at the Bottom, Recovery Very Soon", "published": "2018-06-03T13:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e197d892109720cb50aa938274fe36780ae8142", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1qkXYRPElgS8tuB9ePVej9P", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-03T13:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "FundStrat Analyst: Bitcoin at the Bottom, Recovery Very Soon", "text": "14 hours ago FundStrat Analyst: Bitcoin at the Bottom, Recovery Very Soon Fundstrat s co-founder, Tom Lee, has long been known as a Bitcoin Bull in the cryptocurrency community.

London is the natural home for the growing cryptocurrency industry. Wyoming is mostly known for cowboys and ranches. It is the second least densely populated American state after Alaska and its only major attraction is Yellowstone National Park. It has lowish corporate taxes, and light regulation, which means that it is sometimes used to shelter money, but otherwise it doesn’t have much of a tradition as a finance centre. That might be about to change, however. In May, the state formally passed into law legislation that will make it one of the world’s most attractive crypto-centres. It has created a new legal class of asset known as a “utility token”. This means that bitcoins or other forms of electronic money don’t have to be categorised as either a commodity or a security, and don’t have to be regulated like them either. Blockchain transactions will be excluded from state securities law, and dealing in the currencies will be exempt from trading and property taxes. The result? The state is already attracting tech start-ups, and so it may well be able to diversify its economy out of ranching, mining and tourism. Welcome to Crypto Valley Zug, one of the cantons in Switzerland, is doing something similar. It has already formed the Crypto Valley Association to market itself to cryptocurrency fans and has became the first government in the world to accept bitcoin for paying taxes. It has already established guidelines for accounting in cryptos. Last year 35 initial coin offerings, as new crypto launches are known, were staged in Zug alone, and plenty of established companies have set up a base there. London is missing a trick here. Neither Wyoming nor Zug are exactly major financial centres, nor do they have much in the way of a banking, legal or technology infrastructure to allow new companies to scale up quickly. Neither are they among the world’s most exciting places to live. On any measure you care to think of, London beats all of them by a wide margin. Yet the city doesn’t yet have any pro-active crypto legislation. Apart from the occasional dire warning about a bubble, very little has been done to bring digital currencies into the open and create a secure legal basis for trading in them. That’s a mistake. We should be making this country an attractive base for cryptocurrency start-ups. Wyoming has already provided a pretty good template. Why not make the industry tax-exempt while it is still a fast-growing one and then impose some levies later on if they seem necessary? And why not make taxes payable in bitcoin at the same time, as the Swiss have done – that would send out a powerful signal that the British government welcomed cryptos and wanted them to flourish. A wild ride awaits There are, obviously enough, risks. Bitcoin and its rivals have been on a wild roller-coaster ride over the last year, with the price soaring to close on $20,000 a coin and then losing almost two-thirds of its value. Plenty of hucksters and hustlers have moved into the space, and there are a lot of dodgy get-rich-quick schemes. Investors need to be protected from them. Underneath all of that, however, it is also increasingly obvious that there is a real industry and potentially an important one. Bitcoin may well have settled down now, at around $7,000 to $8,000 a coin, which could well be its natural price. Amazon and many dotcom shares were in a bubble two decades ago, but that didn’t mean there weren’t real businesses underneath the hype. The same is probably true of digital currencies as well. After the initial bubble, the hucksters move onto the next craze and the serious work begins. With its history of financial innovation, London is the natural home for crypto-currency trading and start-ups. We have the depth of talent, the infrastructure and one of the world’s most trusted legal systems. It is crazy to let places such as Zug or Wyoming outsmart us. The British government should be passing legislation as soon as possible to compete – and before somewhere else beats us to it.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins.

News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

bullish moves above the $7,000 level against the US Dollar. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,610 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now facing another important barrier near the $7,700 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Bitcoin price is trading nicely above the $7,400 pivot against the US Dollar. BTC/USD could accelerate gains once it breaks the $7,700 and $8,000 barriers.\nBitcoin Price Decline After a major decline, bitcoin price formed a decent support above the $7,000 handle against the US Dollar. The price started an upside move and traded above the $7,200 and $7,400 resistance levels. There was also a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,057 low. Moreover, there was a close above $7,500 barrier, which is a positive sign.\nDuring the upside, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,610 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is now trading above the $7,550 pivot level and it looks set for more gains in the near term. On the upside, the $7,700 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours) is a key hurdle for buyers . Above $7,700, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,057 low is positioned at $7,830 to prevent gains.\nLooking at the chart , the price has to break the $7,700 and $7,830 resistance levels to trade further higher. On the flip side, if there is a downside correction, the broken resistances at $7,500 and $7,400 are likely to act as supports.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly gaining pace in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently just around the 60 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,400\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,830\nThe post Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis: BTC/USD Could Accelerate Gains appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T10:55:36.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37d1dd2317c7fd9de8ce3d702eda2f967bc472ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRPfuL_N1WTD9OBL4P0VyxpXZ53YZFUFAFmald4Kt0PLiYmyS7A6VPwxtXcfoiOR2XiVMdyKwd1hMcgV0V0QR5kIV53t3xtGnD44fwVqezNYQ--", "site_full": "grindedgear.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://grindedgear.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "What grinds my gears", "title": "Bitcoin, domain names, and other surprise valuables", "title_full": "Bitcoin, domain names, and other surprise valuables", "published": "2018-06-03T10:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37d1dd2317c7fd9de8ce3d702eda2f967bc472ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRPfuL_N1WTD9OBL4P0VyxpXZ53YZFUFAFmald4Kt0PLiYmyS7A6VPwxtXcfoiOR2XiVMdyKwd1hMcgV0V0QR5kIV53t3xtGnD44fwVqezNYQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Warp (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-03T10:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, domain names, and other surprise valuables", "text": "Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that, in retrospect, is actually a relatively recent invention. It was invented and implemented in 2009.\nBack then it started with the idea that 1 bitcoin had the value of 1 US dollar.\nMost people back then didn't think much of it. What a funny idea and experiment, but surely it will never become a thing. And, in fact, during its first years the value of the bitcoin dropped quite dramatically, going at one point as low as 30 cents per bitcoin.\nWho could have predicted that it would become such a phenomenon? People who bought a few bitcoins back in 2009 for the equivalent amount of dollars, have become millionaires. If you had spent $100 back in 2009 to buy bitcoin, and sold them for USD at their height some time in the late 2017's, you would be a millionaire now. The value of 1 bitcoin was well over $10000. Even right now the value is over $6000. (I don't know if any person or institution would be willing to just outright hand you literal cash for that much bitcoin, but failing anything else, at the very least you could buy valuable property and then sell that for actual US dollars. At a loss, of course, but still.)\nAnother example of something rather simple and innocuous-sounding that almost nobody predicted would become so valuable, are internet domain names.\nBack in the 80's and largely in the 90's, nobody predicted how astonishingly huge part of society the internet would become. And they predicted even less how valuable domain names would become.\nIn the 80's and largely in the 90's, domain names (at least those in the .com top-level domain) were handed for free to whoever thought to claim them. Pretty much no matter who you were, if you were to claim a particular domain name, pretty much no matter what it was, you would get it, free of charge. If you wanted \"thisismywebsite.com\" as your domain name, they would give it to you, if nobody else had taken it. Just like that. No questions asked, free of charge.\nNeedless to say, many people who just claimed domain names back in the early 90's for fun, or just because they could, have sometimes become millionaires by selling those domain names to big corporations in the late 2000's. For example the domain name \"hotel.com\" (which was taken some time in the 90's, for completely free) was sold for $11 million in 2011. Likewise \"beer.com\" was sold for $7 million in 2004.\nDomain names, especially those using generic words, or somehow related to products or product names, have become extraordinarily valuable. Corporations will often pay millions for them.

As I explained via a Sopranos reference , asking if there’s manipulation going on in cryptocurrencies is like asking if there’s prostitution going on at the Bada Bing! . That is, of course there’s manipulation in that market. But the larger issue is that the whole damn thing is suspect. Going after Bitcoin spoofers is like arresting hookers at the Bing . You’re missing the forest for the trees.\nI joke a lot about the absurdity inherent in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and proponents of the market don’t do themselves any favors by doing shit that reinforces stereotypes (see here and here , for instance). But in all seriousness, there is virtually no chance these “assets” survive in their current form. That doesn’t mean the concept of cryptocurrencies and/or the theoretical underpinnings of the market are going away, but it does mean that if you’re betting on, say, Bitcoin in its current form to rally unimpeded to infinity on the way to supplanting traditional currencies printed by developed market central banks, you are a moron. Plain and simple. It ain’t gonna happen.\nOne person who agrees is Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller (and really I don’t even know why I bother because citing mainstream economists in an effort to convince cryptocurrency acolytes they’re wrong is an exercise in futility by definition), who earlier this week chatted with CNBC about what the future is likely to look like for Bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://dealbreaker.com/2018/05/justice-department-suspects-criminals-have-infiltrated-otherwise-completely-above-board-cryptocurrency-market/", "https://dealbreaker.com/", "https://dealbreaker.com/2018/02/crypto-obsessed-hipsters-plan-crypto-based-utopian-community-are-as-awful-as-they-seem/", "https://dealbreaker.com/2018/01/the-crypto-craze-will-end-in-a-bloody-endless-nerd-civil-war/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bada_Bing"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "heisenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert shiller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T13:22:36.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7d1903cbfd469d5f89698767e6a7c4d4a592dbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqajNDu34.R53V7L4f_rv8.OQYYiz8BHK7AyJaKpl0aQ2fj2x9mkZjGv71ux6IP6m7KUZMmv9BuqNs-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "The Dirty, Nasty History of Bitcoin : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "The Dirty, Nasty History of Bitcoin : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-03T10:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 21, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d7d1903cbfd469d5f89698767e6a7c4d4a592dbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqajNDu34.R53V7L4f_rv8.OQYYiz8BHK7AyJaKpl0aQ2fj2x9mkZjGv71ux6IP6m7KUZMmv9BuqNs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "normal_rc", "published": "2018-06-03T10:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Dirty, Nasty History of Bitcoin : CryptoCurrency", "text": "From 2009-2015, Bitcoin BTC was run by programmers like Satoshi Nakamoto, Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, and promoted by people like Roger Ver.

In the spirit of openness & freedom, Gavin & Mike naively made the mistake of letting too many bad actors (like Blockstream) gain access to the Bitcoin BTC project.\nThe Blockstream side had more money, and they had Theymos (who controls the #1 & #2 Bitcoin communities - rBitcoin & BitcoinTalk.org). As a result, they were able to push enough of the community into believing that small blocks were the way to go.\nAs Gavin & Mike were being pushed out, they tried to create the first \"big block\" fork of Bitcoin, called Bitcoin XT. The Blockstream / Bitcoin Core side hired a botnet operator to DDoS Bitcoin XT to death in its infancy.\nFrom Mike Hearn:\n\"..After Blockstream successfully took over Bitcoin Core and expelled anyone who opposed them, Gavin and I forked Bitcoin Core to create Bitcoin XT, the first alternative node implementation to gain any serious usage.

BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N. 75 7.77 and high of 90. What’s Behind Germany’s Economic Growth?\nGermany is the biggest economy and Europe. Globally, the nation comes next to the US and Japan. It includes in its trading lists companies like BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N.. Playing an important role in this compelling feat is the German Stock Exchange, particularly its main trading index, the Deutsche Aktien Xchange (DAX) 30. Getting to Know the German Stock Exchange\nBefore taking a look at DAX 30 through the years, it is first important to understand the German Stock Exchange.\nIt is undeniable that the German Stock Exchange is among the most influential stock exchanges in the world. It has eight components including the FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse or the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Börse Stuttgart or the Stuttgart Stock Exchange, the Börse Berlin-Bremen, the BÖAG Börsen AG, and the Hamburger Börse or the Hamburg Stock Exchange.\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange, facilitating the trade in Frankfurt, is the biggest component of the German Stock Exchange. About 80% of the total market capitalization in Germany is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\nIt is followed by the Stuttgart Stock Exchange, which lists most of the financial companies in Germany.\nThe Börse Berlin-Bremen, facilitating the trade in Berlin-Charlottenburg, is one of the newest stock exchanges in the world. It was founded in 2003 after the Berlin Stock Exchange and the Börse Bremen had merged.\nMeanwhile, the BÖAG Börsen AG, facilitating the trade ik Hamburg and Hanover, was founded in 1999 after the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange had consolidated. It allowed BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N. to become in the main focus of investors.\nOn the other hand, the Hamburg Stock Exchange is one of the oldest stock exchanges in the world, having been founded in 1558. DAX 30, Europe’s Finest\nThe DAX 30 is Germany’s benchmark equity market index. It tracks the performance of the best 30 German blue chip stocks on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange as far as market capitalization is concerned. This means that the DAX 30 is a strong indicator of how well the German economy performs and how confident investors are in the German trading environment. Being in DAX means for BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N. stay in business.\nThe main currency on the DAX 30 is euro. Its movement is in increments of 0.50. To trade on the DAX 30, the minimum trade size required is one index while the margin requirement is commonly 2%.\nSince December 31, 1987, the DAX 30 had a base value of 1,000. Equity prices are computed using XETRA, a system that has been calculating indices since June 18, 1999. XETRA had begun calculating indices every one second in January 2006.\nThe DAX 30 had its longest bullish period between 2003 and 2007, which lasted for exactly 1,587 days. It had attained its peak level during the said period at €8,105.69. After the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, it fell to an all-time low of €3,580 in 2009.\nNonetheless, the DAX 30 eventually recouped from the repercussions of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. During one of its best years, the DAX 30 had recorded its all-time high of €8,736 on September 19, 2013.\nGermany is surely one of the most interesting markets in the world today. Consequently, investing in DAX 30 is highly recommended for retail investors.

Those who invest these past few months are suffering a lot of loaaes and they are losing hope that bitcoin will continue to drastically decrease in value. Do you have guys some advice for me? It will be really appreciated and I will be eternal grateful.\nJust hold your bitcoins and never do panic selling. The price of bitcoin will increase three months from now and I assure you that. And the bubble part, yes because as you can see there are whales in the bitcoin community and they are so powerful that they can almost put bitcoin in a devaluation process.

A spate of recent regulatory filings to launch an exchange traded fund (ETF) to track bitcoin futures appears to be the answer. Facebook targets 30,000 accounts in crackdown on fake news in France 2018-06-03 06:42:03 Facebook has cracked down on 30,000 accounts found to be spreading fake news stories or spam in France ahead of the country's pivotal presidential election.\nFacebook (FB, Tech30) said the move was part of its efforts to fight spam, misinformation and other deceptive content.\n\"Our prio How Soon Can We Expect a Bitcoin ETF?\nNow that the Chicago Board of Options Exchange has launched its bitcoin futures exchange and the world didn’t end what’s next for the digital currency? A spate of recent regulatory filings to launch an exchange traded fund (ETF) to track bitcoin futures appears to be the answer.\nActually, if such an ETF does get approval, it will follow Monday’s launch of a second regulated bitcoin exchange by CME Group. And it would trail well-behind a Sweden-based exchange traded note (ETN), XBT Provider, that trades on the Nordic Nasdaq. ETNs are unsecured debt securities (essentially bonds) issued by financial institutions that promise to pay investors a return on a benchmark index before the ETN matures. Some also provide current distributions to investors. If the issuer should go bankrupt, investors could lose their entire investment.\nXBT Provider tracks the movement of both bitcoin and ethereum digital currencies. The fund avoids market risk by always holding bitcoin equivalent to the value of the issued ETNs.\nTwo firms have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the past few days to create bitcoin ETFs: the VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF, and the REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. All three had filed with the SEC earlier this year but withdrew their applications before the agency could reject them.\nThe SEC and other regulators objected to the earlier applications on the grounds that there was no futures-based index by which to measure the value of the underlying asset. The arrival of the CBOE and the coming launch of the CME exchange may remove that hurdle, but others remain.\nChief among them, at least in the SEC’s mind, is the suitability of bitcoin as an asset. SEC Chair Jay Clayton issued a warning to retail investors earlier this week regarding cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs):\nInvestors should understand that to date [December 11, 2017] no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC. The SEC also has not to date approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies. If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary. As with any other type of potential investment, if a promoter guarantees returns, if an opportunity sounds too good to be true, or if you are pressured to act quickly, please exercise extreme caution and be aware of the risk that your investment may be lost.\nThe launch of futures exchanges for bitcoin is not likely immediately to clear the way for ETF issuances. But they’re coming, perhaps as soon as the first half of next year.\nClayton’s full statement is available here.\nBitcoin traded down about 3.3% on the CBOE in the noon hour Wednesday at $17,430. Volume was very light at just 757 transactions.\n24/7 Wall St. Will CME-Listed Bitcoin Futures Make Cryptocurrencies More Legitimate?

Decoding Cryptocurrency we understand crypto is something hidden and currency is really a medium of exchange. It’s a questionnaire of currency found in the block chain created and stored. That is completed through security practices to be able to get a grip on the development and evidence of the currency transacted. Touch cash was the very first cryptocurrency which came into ico review .\nCryptocurrency is really a part of the means of a digital database working in the virtual world. The personality of the true person here cannot be determined. Also, there’s number centralized power which governs the trading of cryptocurrency. That currency is equal to difficult gold maintained by people and the worth of that will be supposed to be finding increased by leaps and bounds. The electric system set by Satoshi is just a decentralized one wherever only the miners have the best to produce changes by confirming the transactions initiated. They are the only human feel suppliers in the system.\nForgery of the cryptocurrency is not possible as the complete program is based on difficult core z/n and cryptographic puzzles. Only those people who can handle fixing these puzzles could make improvements to the database that will be close to impossible. The purchase when proved becomes part of the database or the block cycle which can not be reversed then.\nCryptocurrency is only digital money that is developed with assistance from coding technique. It is based on peer-to-peer control system. Let’s now understand how it’s possible to be benefitted by trading in this market.\nCan’t be solved or cast: Though lots of people can rebut this that the transactions done are irreversible, but a very important thing about cryptocurrencies is that when the transaction is confirmed. A new block gets put into the stop cycle and then your transaction can’t be forged. You feel the master of that block.\nOn the web transactions: That not just makes it suited to anyone sitting in virtually any part of the earth to transact, but inaddition it helps the rate with which transaction gets processed. As compared to realtime where you need third events to come in to the image to purchase house or silver or have a loan, You simply require a computer and a prospective buyer or vendor in case there is cryptocurrency. This notion is straightforward, swift and filled with the prospects of ROI.\nThe charge is reduced per transaction: There’s reduced or no price taken by the miners through the transactions as that is taken care of by the network.\nAccessibility: The concept is indeed realistic that most these people who have use of smartphones and notebooks may accessibility the cryptocurrency industry and business inside it anytime anywhere. That supply causes it to be a lot more lucrative.

The pair is now facing another important barrier near the $7,700 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).\nBitcoin price is trading nicely above the $7,400 pivot against the US Dollar.

The price started an upside move and traded above the $7,200 and $7,400 resistance levels. There was also a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,057 low. Moreover, there was a close above $7,500 barrier, which is a positive sign.\nDuring the upside, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,610 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC\\/USD pair.

On the upside, the $7,700 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours) is a key hurdle for buyers . Above $7,700, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,057 low is positioned at $7,830 to prevent gains.\nLooking at the chart , the price has to break the $7,700 and $7,830 resistance levels to trade further higher. On the flip side, if there is a downside correction, the broken resistances at $7,500 and $7,400 are likely to act as supports.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is slowly gaining pace in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is currently just around the 60 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $7,400\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $7,830\nThe post Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis: BTC\\/USD Could Accelerate Gains ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T13:42:48.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0348616cce58bfa3401e9bf23d99c5805906981f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2NsCvlotPnSJM1RmF6ux5o-", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "http://rss.forexfactory.net/forums/all.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FF All Forums", "title": "LaVoltage replies to: Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile", "title_full": "LaVoltage replies to: Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile", "published": "2018-06-03T09:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/ff_fb_logo.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0348616cce58bfa3401e9bf23d99c5805906981f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2NsCvlotPnSJM1RmF6ux5o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-03T09:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "LaVoltage replies to: Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile", "text": "| Joined Mar 2018 | Status: Member | 134 Posts its all about ranges market is always doing one of two things. either rotating or expanding. know what its doing now and you know what to expect BITCOIN is now expanding the range. will ofcourse during the course of expanding will also rotate back to POC.

By Dark Orange Bitcoin Sign Built as an Array of Transactions in Blockchain Conceptual 3d Illustration Background (Photo Credit: www.shutterstock.com)\nAlarm bells over suspicious cryptocurrency investment schemes are increasingly being investigated by the Hawks.\nThis has emerged in the wake of the Hawks’ investigation into an alleged R1 billion cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme run by BTC Global, according to a report in the City Press.\n“There are others,” said Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi told City Press.\nHe said they were “under inquiry” and could not be named at this stage.\nAmong the red flags is the offer of financial reward for recruiting new members, or larger payouts for larger numbers of investors in the pool.\nMulaudzi said the BTC Global scheme had affected about 28 000 South Africans from all walks of life.\nHe said many had lost over R100 000 when the scheme crashed in early February, although “some got lucky” and pulled their money out in time.\nLuke Buckland, founder of a private cryptocurrency investment partnership called Cryptocats, told City Press that Bitcoin was great for running a Ponzi scheme. This was because it had global reach, coupled with the promise of riches through technology and was advertised via social media.\n“It’s a perfect storm,” said Buckland.

SA Reserve Bank to Formulate Policy to Govern Cryptocurrencies\nSARB is planning to formulate policy frameworks in response to these emerging innovations such as private cryptocurrencies.\nThe Bank said in a statement earlier this year that it will undertake various initiatives aimed at assisting in the formulation of appropriate policy frameworks for the possible regulation of FinTech. Cryptojacking concept, computer hacker and Bitcoin cryptocurrency. igorstevanovic / Shutterstock.com\nThis review will address regulatory issues such as clearing and settlement risks, exchange control impacts, monetary policy and financial stability, and other matters such as cybersecurity considerations.\nThrough collaboration with the other regulatory bodies, matters such as tax implications, consumer and investor protection, and money laundering activities will also be addressed, said the bank.\nThe SARB expects to complete the review in the second half of 2018.\nThe Bank added that the second aim of the policy framework is to investigate and decide on the applicability of innovation facilitators for the SARB.\n‘Innovation facilitators’ is a collective term for innovation hubs, regulatory sandboxes and accelerators.

inflating house prices and stocks prices? why do they need to? will all confidence collapse if they stop?\nBitcoin has all the characteristics needed combined to hold the most value and increasing more than any other financial-asset option coming from the manipulated fiat central-banking debt-system. (more than stocks, more than houses, more than gold).\nIf fiat/credit supply stopped growing, then house prices, stock prices, financial assets would crash significantly in value.\nGovernments and laws are controlled by the central banks. Bitcoin is an anti-establishment revolution that has already solidified itself worldwide.\nBitcoin cannot be controlled. It cannot be banned. It cannot be made illegal. And conversely it cannot be legalized. It just simply is. And people can always use it.\nThose trying to undermine and manipulate bitcoin stem from the central bank system around the world;\n-the central banks dictate policy to all the operating big banks around the world and have essentially tried their best to ban bitcoin related transactions for more than four years straight, ever since 2013, and have failed at stopping bitcoin's growth, adoption, and popularity\n-the central banks fund efforts to undermine bitcoin, providing plenty of capital and liquidity to private companies and venture backed groups such as Digital Currency Group (they own Coinbase, GDAX, Kraken, Bitpay, and media outlet Coindesk) and also Roger Ver/Bitmain to undermine and break the bitcoin protocol and/or manipulate trade\nAbove are just small examples.\nFirst, educate yourself and then others. Please checkout the link to the bitcointalk post in my signature titled: How to teach Bitcoin to a 7 year old.\nBitcoin is a secure, decentralized, trustless and open system which cannot be banned nor controlled.\n Too bad all altcoins are relatively worthless!\nBitcoin's blockchain is the only unique one to provide the most security in a decentralized, global, incentivized fashion.\nPopularity of Bitcoin will begin to explode with lightning in the next year.\nBitcoin's lightning network is emerging where fees will be tiny and cross-chain atomic swaps for decentralized exchange.\nAll other \"blockchains\" are more private worthless databases, my old nokia phone can do worthless databases. Other blockchains are simply scams.\nBitcoin's price will be at the very least more than 4 times (400%) of todays price in 5 years.\nBitcoin is ultimate store of value and its popularity has strengthened over time and maximizes value compared to any other altcoin...\nWhy are altcoins relatively worthless compared to bitcoin?:\nIf it can be shutdown, and have assets frozen by a bank or government, there would be no value\nIf it wasn't secure, there would be no value.\nIf it wasn't immutable, there would be no value.\nIf it wasn't globally distributed, there would be no value.\nIf it wasn't so strong, open-source decentralized and unstoppable, there would be no value.\nIf it wasn't so scarce, there would be no value.\nIf it was easy to spam transactions, there would be no value\nIf it required a central 3rd party to function, there would be no value\nIf it was stopped after all major banks on Earth banned in 2013 to today, there would be no value. (say \"bitcoin\" when transacting and watch the block of the transaction. simple fix=never mention \"bitcoin\").\nIf it didn't have the history of 8+ years (and still no hacker can exploit bitcoin blockchain), there would be no value\nBitcoin is on the verge of lightning network release rendering altcoins as only backup plan options if not dead.\nIf it was exactly like fiat and only did transactions, there would be no value.\nBitcoin's value is worth hundreds of billions USD today. Altcoins however are scams, weak, pyramid schemes not offering these values.\nFor global fiat (US Dollars, Indian Rupees, Chinese Yuan, etc), the fiat bubble system broke a couple of decades ago.\nFiat around the world is forced to inflate issuance as its heavily infested, burdened and broken with (the following whether good or bad):\n-inflating fiat to keep house-prices from collapsing\n-inflating fiat to keep stock market rising\n-financing conflicts, bombs, missiles/aircraft/embassies, and \"aid\"\n-frivolous legal costs (systemic resources wasted on legal threats, settlements, lawsuits bogging down system)\n-regulatory burden on fiat banks & system (incredibly costly, lots of labor for each $1 in circulation)\n-backstopping insurance frauds\n-costs of auditors and budgetors and accountants checking the same thing over in governments and businesses (& still suspect)\n-big insurance loss-events\n-unemployment & other welfare costs\n-stabilize regions after natural disasters\n-keeping monopolies with internet access and information centralized and search engine crawlers centralized\n-officially sponsored \"money laundering\"\n-backstopping credit chargebacks\n-state-sponsored corruption and unofficial corruption (governments and gangs, banks and conartists)\n-retirement obligations (debasement in value to keep up with payments from government or other retirement-obligations)\n-fake credit (goods being transacted with credit-loss, replaced by inflation of monetary base rather than bringing perpetrators & source to justice)\n-using enforcement labor to freeze accounts and assets and take away your money\nBitcoin, systemically, is free from these limitations and burdens.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T07:15:28.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c61627945c4352c6df232d3915a83e9412311bef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIBSUJyMMxNrQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?
