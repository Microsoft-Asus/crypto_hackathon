Bitcoin Cash price declined at a robust pace in the last two weeks despite its anticipated hard fork event. The fourth largest coin traded below $1,200 today for the first time this month. BCH coin had hit a three-months-high of $1,800 on May 6. Source Image: coinmarketcap.com\nBCH bulls failed to capitalize on the awaited hard fork event on May 15. The Bitcoin Cash network is now officially upgraded to 32 MB from its previous 8MB, and its developers have also introduced several other enticing developments in the last couple of months. Bulls Expect BCH to Replace BTC\nBig influencers such as Roger Ver, expect Bitcoin Cash to replace Bitcoin (BTC) as the leading coin in the cryptocurrency market.\nThe Bitcoin expert stated : “The economic path that bitcoin cash is on is the one that led to bitcoin’s original success,” Ver said. “I’m incredibly bullish on bitcoin cash for the same reasons I was bullish on bitcoin back in 2011.” CNBC’s Poll: The Majority Think Differently Source Image: twitter.com\nThe latest CNBC poll, however, shows that investors are more confident in putting their money in Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is dominating the market, and the majority of investors think it will remain to do so.\nThe poll results are quite depressing for BCH bulls. They were expecting the immediate rally in Bitcoin Cash price amid the infrastructure upgrade – which has improved its transacting time and fee compared to many other dominating networks including Bitcoin.\nA Twitter user says : “ Damn I’m disappointed with BCH, I was really hoping that it would take the 3rd spot in the crypto-rankings .”\nFeatured Image: Depositphotos/© denisismagilov", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://screenshots.firefox.com/uvm9zeNATG4dt6VV/twitter.com", "https://cryptocurrencynews.com/daily-news/bitcoin-cash-news/bitcoin-cash-biggest-loser/", "https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-cash-bch-fails-show-potential-after-fork/", "https://screenshots.firefox.com/zSA04q44tZLj6lDF/coinmarketcap.com"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "siraj sarwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T00:07:58.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4bd5d4fa3f16f9b8c53f5fea0e9fa6b5f8f8aff3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeusSBoMCyfIAXcmA3uCY5Q-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Best wallet for bitcoin?", "title_full": "Best wallet for bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-18T23:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4bd5d4fa3f16f9b8c53f5fea0e9fa6b5f8f8aff3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeusSBoMCyfIAXcmA3uCY5Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andika23", "published": "2018-05-18T23:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best wallet for bitcoin?", "text": "u can use offline wallet or coinbase or coinpayments.coinbase fee is so cheap but offline wallet is very good and do not share ur private key to others", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:58:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ccdf45be874582ead6094ae5da90b08110e3dbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSR4lkStkTUfDC5cPkwCJB_GJQKmY92WB7HJEVHCrE8Pdz1fJNY8R51hSEvtN8_MK8-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Struggling for Recovery", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Struggling for Recovery", "published": "2018-05-18T23:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ccdf45be874582ead6094ae5da90b08110e3dbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSR4lkStkTUfDC5cPkwCJB_GJQKmY92WB7HJEVHCrE8Pdz1fJNY8R51hSEvtN8_MK8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T23:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Struggling for Recovery", "text": "Bitcoin Cash has stopped going down by Friday May 18 and is now trading around $1,205.10. Lately, it has not managed to reach $1,350 and has fallen against the USD, which can be clearly seen on D1, said Dmitriy Gurkovskiy, Chief Analyst at RoboForex.\nBCH has also fallen below the trend line at $1,250 that acts as a dividing line between the bulls and the bears. As of now, the digital coin has run enough correction, but still may face issues when trying to recover and break out $1,240 or $1,250.\nMeanwhile, the fight between the sellers and scarce buyers has become more tense lately. However, the buyers are not quite lucky, as after BCH headed down below $1,340, the bears got active and the selloff grew stronger.\nIn fact, the downward wave was so strong that Bitcoin Cash nearly reached $1,150, although it stopped at $1,156. On H1, the bearish trend is very clear, with its upper line at $1,250.\nThis way, $1,150 is the key support now, while the resistance is at $1,250. The MACD is getting lower on D1, and while still in the positive, is issuing a sell signal. The Stochastic is also getting down and signals a sell.\nThere is not much fundamental info for BCH, but still there is some. On May 15, a hard fork occurred at block 530356, but this had been announced before, and thus did not stress the market at all, as everyone who wanted to update the client software did it with no major issues. Hard forks are occurring more frequently lately, while the developers are trying to anticipate it and prevent the market players from accumulating large volumes, especially with ASIC miners in place that enable mining more with less energy consumption.\nWhat is now important for Bitcoin Cash is the block size growing from 8MB to 32MB, which will reduce the transaction cost and downtime. Besides, OP_Codes that have been deactivated before are now again included into the cryptocurrency.\nAuthor:\nDisclaimer\nAny forecasts contained herein are based on the authors’ particular opinion.

The operation of the BTC Mining\nAs soon as a Node finds a Hash, it transfers the Block on which he worked, to the Rest of the network. The other Nodes in the network, then press your acceptance by, you start to generate the next Block to the Blockchain, using the hash of the accepted block. The producer or Miner of the block receives currently a block reward of 12.5 BTC.\nThe more computing power one has in relation to the entire network, the greater the proportion of distributed Rewards. In order to keep the block time of 10 minutes, the difficulty of the Hash calculations constantly. Satoshi Nakamoto, the alleged inventor of bitcoin, likening the process of creation of new Coins with gold mines, only the Bitcoin computing power and electricity consumed. Figures from the study\nThe power consumption required for the Mining, due to the considerable increase in quantity over the last few years to a often apprehended and controversial topic. For example, it was reported in mid-February that the crypto-Mining would consume in Iceland to 2018 more energy than the households in the country.\nIn order to quantify the actual amounts of power consumption Alex de Vries has outlined in the study different methods that are currently used in the determination of the current and future electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network, and notes that (freely translated):\nthe attempt to measure the power consumption of the Bitcoin mining machines, today still represents a challenge.\nDe Vries uses Bitmains Antminers as his main example to show how much energy each machine consumes in their lifetime.\nThe following table shows the estimated lifetime cost for a Antminer S9 under different cost of living and cost of production of US $ 500 (under the assumption that electricity costs 5 cents per kilowatt-hour): Machine", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sciencedirect", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T23:58:21.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "441cf14bc372d32612d9466e9de9129665f2945f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRe4DGh4oFxA5X8GonOziVB0egMMLDJksQ1t81TDT0z5dGKW1436LXZ3HYL6f9QR49dn5QP9qgy4w--", "site_full": "plus.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://plus.google.com/s/Alibaba", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Search Results - Google+", "title": "Alibaba Founder, Jack Ma, Calls Bitcoin (BTC) a Bubble - The Bitcoin (BTC) bu...", "title_full": "Alibaba Founder, Jack Ma, Calls Bitcoin (BTC) a Bubble - The Bitcoin (BTC) bu...", "published": "2018-05-18T23:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.051, "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/OBBqFl_tsRAm_mMd-cejcBZ_SkAhPiJ8rxEt38TqFU3U7la8McBHy242Ia9FCt_kl_w0r03VDzF7JgVBYneq_qWuhfOFrMcPftMN-vQD_-IB5CZ1LcBQxfQhUQLFooZTMaEvMlmblA9RsKDYWvShm67ALA=w530-h353-p", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "441cf14bc372d32612d9466e9de9129665f2945f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRe4DGh4oFxA5X8GonOziVB0egMMLDJksQ1t81TDT0z5dGKW1436LXZ3HYL6f9QR49dn5QP9qgy4w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "plus.google.com", "published": "2018-05-18T23:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Alibaba Founder, Jack Ma, Calls Bitcoin (BTC) a Bubble - The Bitcoin (BTC) bu...", "text": "Alibaba Founder, Jack Ma, Calls Bitcoin (BTC) a Bubble - The Bitcoin (BTC) bubble theory has resurfaced again, as the founder of world’s largest e-commerce platform, Alibaba, just announced his views of the world’s first digital token.

Well, they are cryptocurrencies, based on the blockchain. So what makes Bitcoin and Etherium so different, if they are based on the same system?\nBitcoin\nBitcoin is often defined as the digital gold and that is for a reason. It had been one of the first cryptocurrencies to appear and this makes it such a popular coin nowadays. It can be defined as the dollar of the blockchain, as it is only a payment method. It can not be described as an innovative and mind-blowing technology, although it is very useful itself, it is just your money, held in a digital form. Bitcoin can be used for multiple purposes, one of them is inviting in ICOs (Initial Coin Offering). Once you support an ICO, they give you their tokens, which can be compared to stocks, which grow with the company, although are dependent on the price of Bitcoin and the market in general. Some other purposes are investing and basic payments, which are getting more and more popular nowadays.\nEtherium\nEtherium, on the other hand, is defined as the digital petroleum. It had been launched at the beginning of the crypto market development, and many people see it overtaking Bitcoin in future due to its flexibility. Of course, it is priced lower than Bitcoin as it had entered the market way later, but that does not deny its usefulness when it comes to innovations. Shortly speaking, where Bitcoin is just a currency, Etherium is a platform for other applications to host and grow at. It is so open-minded as a platform, that you could build anything on it, starting from 3D printing to traveling network management. And that is the quality that allowed Etherium to enter the big market: it occupies a different area rather than Bitcoin, therefore serves for different purposes.\nConclusion\nFor me, as an investor, Etherium poses a bigger personal interest than Bitcoin, but it is pretty clear that at least for the next year bitcoin will be the leading currency in the crypto market. That is also because most of the people nowadays are familiar with Bitcoin, but have heard nothing of Etherium. But if you are looking for a long term investment, Etherium might be your solution.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T11:18:19.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93a1b90ae2b15bdc2afb72fbbab4807a2b2c4db2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbF8tJGQnAlO0_toK2X_jEo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=74.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Legal", "title": "Is bitcoin illegal in India", "title_full": "Is bitcoin illegal in India", "published": "2018-05-18T23:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93a1b90ae2b15bdc2afb72fbbab4807a2b2c4db2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbF8tJGQnAlO0_toK2X_jEo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "salixo", "published": "2018-05-18T23:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is bitcoin illegal in India", "text": "Hello folk, I am a bit confused if cryptos are legal or illegal in India.\nAs bank has stopped providing services to crypto-exchanges.

As noted in our last discussion, a break back into the TR would be considered a period of evaluation and an inability to maintain support within the TR would likely lead to a continuation of the downtrend:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Downtrend Continuation\nAfter establishing the Major Sign of Weakness (SOW), the market made a feeble rally and ultimately formed a Last Point of Supply (LPSY) at the bottom of the TR. The LPSY is the point where supply begins to overwhelm the market and long positions begin to close as the demand dries up. Shortly after the rejection of the TR, the market established a new low. However, this low was pushed on fairly low volume. The price action and volume are shaping out a reversal pattern called a Falling Wedge (FW):\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Falling Wedge\nIf the price manages to break out of this FW it will have a modest $1,000 move upward. The measured move would have us retesting the lower $9,000s once again. However, if we fail to gain enough momentum upward, we would likely test the macro 61% Fibonacci retracement values:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 3-Day Candles, Macro Fib Retracements\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Macro 61% Closer View\nIf we manage to test the 61%, this will again be a zone of evaluation as we wait to see how the market reacts to such strong, macro support.\nSummary: After a short-lived rally, bitcoin established a LPSY in the $8,800s before continuing to make new lows.\nCurrently, the market is pushing new lows but on diminishing volume.\nThe current price action is forming a Falling Wedge which, if it breaks upwards, would have a price target in the low $9,000s.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The problem is that these so called \"Gen 3\" blockchcains (EOS and ADA) both have systems incredibly similar to centralized finance, notably inflation. The inflation factor is the antithesis of what Bitcoin was created to prevent and in my opinion the original goal of blockchain seems to be lost with projects like EOS and ADA.\nWhich makes me wonder, could we have the technology of a payment and smart contract/dApp platform like ETH, EOS or ADA, combined with the limited, non-inflationary maximum supply principle of Bitcoin?\nBecause it seems to me that in order to have world-wide scalable \"smart\" blockchains that can be used practically for free, that inflation is necessary to compensate as a reward to miners/nodes. The one project to attempt to counter this is IOTA, but it's a centralized project, not decentralized.\nSatoshi Nakamoto created decentralization with limited reducing inflation capped at 21 million, and is an immortal genius in our minds for doing so. Now how will we add scalability to the equation whilst keeping this principle, without introducing centralization or uncapped inflation? This seems like the next \"hard problem\".

As mentioned in our last discussion, a break back in the TR will be considered a period of evaluation and an inability to keep support inside the TR would probably result in a continuation of the downtrend: Figure 1: BTC USD, Hour Candles, Downtrend ContinuationAfter launching the Major indication of Weakness, the market made a weak rally and finally formed a final point of Supply in the bottom of the TR. The LPSY is the stage where distribution begins to conquer the current market and long positions start to close as the demand dries up.\nSoon after the rejection of the TR, the marketplace established a brand new low. Nevertheless, this reduced was pushed fairly low volume. The price action and volume are shaping a reversal pattern known as a Falling Wedge :Figure 2: BTC USD, Hour Candles, Falling Wedge. If the cost manage to break out of the FW it may have a small $1, 000 move upwards.

But, most of the revelations are limited to anecdotal evidence or weakly researched primary reports, with future predictions based on such data. To combat the epistemic crisis, a recent peer-reviewed research paper breaks the unresearched monotony, and the evaluated results are nothing short of shocking.\nPower Your Home or Transact a Bitcoin? On May 16, 2018, financial analyst and blockchain evangelist Alex de Vries published \"Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem\" on Joule , a research publication, to apprise the world of Bitcoin's troubling energy usage.\nUtilizing complex monetary models, de Vries combined his calculations with average power costs and publically available bitcoin-mining data. His primary aim was to release a foundational study for the world's organizations and individuals on which to base their Bitcoin studies.\nAs per de Vries, the lowest prerequisite wattage to run a mining rig in 2018 is 2.55 gigawatts, which equals the overall power demand of the world's 118th largest nation, Ireland. Likewise, the researcher states that this sum is equivalent to half a percent of the world's aggregate power use.\n( Source : Pinterest )\nIf Bitcoin mining goes on at the same rate, the report predicts its energy usage could measure up to that of the whole of Austria by the end of 2018, utilizing 7.7 gigawatts. Moreover, every Bitcoin transaction uses enough energy to power a home in the Netherlands for a month.\nCan Bitcoin Cause Global Warming? The enormous expenses related to Bitcoin mining, a procedure that performs complex computations per second, has been a critical subject for years. The expansion in the system's size is directly proportional to its maintaining expenses, and can perhaps use five percent of the world's energy at its peak. De Vries notes:\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines.\"\nTo ascertain his predictions, de Vries extrapolated the present data, accounting for factors such as inflation and the rise in energy and hardware costs, to the point of equilibrium – which would occur after all blocks are mined, and the system operates solely on transaction fees.\nWhile critics note that the results could be slightly deceiving, the study is based on publicly available data. It is possible that mining organizations like Bitmain haven't revealed the extent of their operations, and the conclusions could thus vary.

You’ll never be able to buy your coffee with Bitcoin!”“Bitcoin is a fraud!” - Jamie Dimon, President of JP Morgan...The media “experts” were virtually unanimous in their condemnation of the world’s first independent virtual currency.And yes, the bubble popped in December of 2017, and the value of Bitcoin fell to $6,800.But in the months that followed, the commentary, and more importantly, the actions of certain institutions, started to change…The bubble put the eyes of the world onto the crypto space, and it forced really smart people to do their homework for the very first time.The result?Everything has changed.The CFTC gave the thumbs up on Bitcoin, which gave the CME, the largest futures exchange in the world, the ability to offer trading contracts on Bitcoin futures. And ICE, the parent company that owns the New York Stock Exchange is now building out a new exchange dedicated to Bitcoin and crypto trading... \"scam!\", to watching some of the smartest people in the world spend hundreds of millions of dollars to create a global trading infrastructure for crypto.So here’s what it’s important to understand from all of this…Most detractors of anything new, will always point to the existing flaws of that product or service, as the reason why it will eventually fail.But what people like Buffett neglect to recognize, is that improvements and innovations will be made.The technology today will not remain the same.It’s like looking at Ford’s Model-T, and saying that it will never replace the horse, because it’s too expensive and unreliable.Or looking back at the very first cell-phone, and declaring that it will only be used by the rich because it’s so expensive.And as for Bitcoin, yes the critics are correct… Bitcoin cannot support the volume of transactions per minute that would be required for mass adoption and use today… YET.But it will be able to soon with innovations like the Lighting Network…Bitcoin is Gen 1 technology. It’s the Atari of the crypto world.Ethereum and some of the more advanced platforms coming online like EOS, Cardano, or Aion, are Generation 2 applications.But the most exciting, and revolutionary technology in this space… The 3rd generation applications like Basis, are already in development.One of the most exciting innovations in development, will be the ability to “tokenize” virtually any asset, and turn it into a trade-able security.What does that mean?Well to keep things really simple, it means that at some point in the next few years, you will be able to buy, and trade just about anything of value…Houses, cars, art, diamonds, music, movies, your small business, real estate, companies, etc…The equity in these assets is represented by tokens. The more tokens you own, the more equity you own.Yes, it’s exactly like owning stock in a company, but here’s what’s so revolutionary…As of right now, it’s incredibly difficult and expensive to list a company on a stock exchange and offer shares.Well what if that changed?What if you and I could tokenize and offer fractional ownership in just about anything, and what if acquiring those equity tokens were as simple as buying them on an app?Let’s say that you decided to buy a gas station that's down the street from you. That gas station is currently valued at $1,000,000, and it produces $100,000 in net profit per year.Now what if you wanted to give people the ability to buy equity in your gas station by offering 1 million equity tokens?You could offer those tokens on any crypto exchange for $1.00 each, and people could purchase them with a single click.If I decide to buy 10% of those tokens, I now own 10% of your gas station. When it’s time to distribute profits from the company, those profits are automatically distributed out to the wallets of all token holders proportionately.I could do the same for my business here at SelfMadeMan.com.Instead of raising capital through the traditional routes, I could offer security/equity tokens, and people around world could buy them and receive a dividend.Want to own a piece of the Mona Lisa? You’ll be able to.Assuming the value of the painting goes up, so will the value of your equity tokens, which you can then sell as you please.This tokenization process means we can create a marketplace for ANYTHING of value, and it can make the transfer of ownership of that equity, instant, efficient, and virtually effortless.This break-through is just one more way that crypto-assets will change the world, and it’s coming…Polymath is being built to provide a decentralized protocol for trading securities tokens.And TrustToken is another solution in the works. It will allow you to put objects of value into a Trust, and then distribute tokens from that trust via smart contracts.Will there be bumps in the road? Yes.But just as the brick phone has turned into the smartphone, or as the Atari has become the XBox, innovation and improvements in this space will continue.And as for Jamie Dimon and JP Morgan…Ya, they’re on the bus now as well.So where are we in the growth of this new industry?Is it too late to invest?Have you missed the boat?We’ll take a look at the charts tomorrow, and I’ll share my thoughts on that topic…\" WARNING:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T17:55:59.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f946b2aa0c9031216db586057aaf26bd76c61960", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3zgxEGByiXXT9GywqFT44sL2vriBFl8i7JuBE6S16BB8TNEQegEVQYib8gbHa81fLg--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "title_full": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "published": "2018-05-18T22:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f946b2aa0c9031216db586057aaf26bd76c61960", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__3zgxEGByiXXT9GywqFT44sL2vriBFl8i7JuBE6S16BB8TNEQegEVQYib8gbHa81fLg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T22:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "text": "Home » bitcoin news » crypto coin » crypto news » Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash innovation shines", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T01:58:47.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbfefeccf096bf7b29e01411eec6505bacc291ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa_IUMRhCm_FfTopYxiSfr7Lfu0b6ksaDmWxWT3dC7_eqQrRTmkNxP3cNHBptS8eWJputIy9oWBw4A--", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Poised for $9,000s Amid Weak Lows", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Poised for $9,000s Amid Weak Lows", "published": "2018-05-18T22:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BitcoinPrice3.width-800-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bbfefeccf096bf7b29e01411eec6505bacc291ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa_IUMRhCm_FfTopYxiSfr7Lfu0b6ksaDmWxWT3dC7_eqQrRTmkNxP3cNHBptS8eWJputIy9oWBw4A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Magazine", "published": "2018-05-18T22:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Poised for $9,000s Amid Weak Lows", "text": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Poised for $9,000s Amid Weak Lows May 18, 2018 208\nA short-lived rally gave eager bulls false hope as the the market attempted to break back into the trading range (TR) outlined in last week’s BTC Market Analysis .

One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.\nWell, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it’s not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking.\nA few of the crypto aficionados tell their followers that gold can’t be a monetary asset because there are millions of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away in the Grand Canyon. While this may sound like quite an interesting conspiracy, there is no sound evidence to back it up. To believe in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. However, with the logic being in short supply currently, I am not surprised that many believe in these fairy tales.\nOne of these ex-precious metals, now a highly qualified cryptoanalyst, suggested in a recent video that the “Gold is owned by the Bankers” so why would you want to own gold? Unfortunately, this is a false statement. While the Central banks own a lot of gold, it’s a lot less than what the private investors and jewelry owners hold. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for the largest stocks of above ground gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), followed by 40,000 mt of private investment, 32,600 mt of Central bank holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial usage and other:\nOf the total 190,000 mt of the world above ground gold stocks, jewelry consists of 48%, private investment 21%, Central bank 17%, and Industrial and other at 14% (Source: World Gold Council – Total above-ground stocks 2017) So, if we realize that nearly half of all above-ground gold stocks are in the form of jewelry, and then another 21% is owned by private investors, Central banks DO NOT own most of the gold. Even if we compare private investment to Official holdings, private investors own more gold than Central banks.\nNow, to the incorrect theory that there are millions of tons of gold in the world, can someone please tell me where all this additional gold came from?? If we understand that the increase in gold mine production paralleled the rise in silver and copper production, how could there be 10-20 times more gold than copper and silver???\nFirst, most of the gold ever mined was produced after 1900:\nAccording to the best data, we can get our hands on, 91% of all gold mined since 1493 was produced after 1900. Limited records of gold produced before 1493 suggest that wasn’t more than 10,000-15,000 mt.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://srsroccoreport.com/why-gold-is-the-king-monetary-asset-not-bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve st. angelo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T23:27:20.037+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66488d3fba2fe630af3c0d862210f902f8b8389e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j151ZfdryYEbJ_8kT4I_46YzkGYHndN9_Ug7n7Hlg4smI7R_u4Qu.4gVXEvgFKNkoL3GAXbkugE3i8YRyQJpKlj.msBuHP0MDnpN8NQSfVYA-", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "title_full": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "published": "2018-05-18T22:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Coingeek1-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66488d3fba2fe630af3c0d862210f902f8b8389e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j151ZfdryYEbJ_8kT4I_46YzkGYHndN9_Ug7n7Hlg4smI7R_u4Qu.4gVXEvgFKNkoL3GAXbkugE3i8YRyQJpKlj.msBuHP0MDnpN8NQSfVYA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin.com", "published": "2018-05-18T22:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "text": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong May 18, 2018 200\nOn May 18, 2018, the blockchain firm Coingeek hosted its inaugural Coingeek Conference held this year in Hong Kong. The event was filled with movers and shakers from the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ecosystem, alongside hundreds of BCH supporters looking to change the way the world’s money works.\nAlso Read: 5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins Coingeek Conference 2018: Spreading the Word of Bitcoin Cash Adoption in Hong Kong\nCoingeek wrapped up its Bitcoin Cash-focused conference that aimed at spreading the message of the many benefits BCH has to offer. The event was held in Hong Kong, at the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel, and had a wide variety of industry innovators from company’s like Purse.io, Bitmain, Yours, Centbee, Handcash, Nchain, Lokad, Bitcoin.com, and more. Moreover, attendees listened to keynote presentations from Ryan X Charles , Jihan Wu, Dr. Craig Wright, Roger Ver , Joannes Vermorel, Vin Armani, Steven Bower, and Jimmy Nguyen among many special guests. Lorien Gamaroff CEO of Centbee discusses better wallets and payment solutions. What consumers and merchants need for a Bitcoin Cash world. Bitcoin Cash Powering Online Commerce\nThe event kicked off with Nchain’s Jimmy Nguyen who discussed the latest Nchain BCH-focused endeavor called ‘Bcommerce.’ Nguyen’s talk called ‘A Bcomm World: How Bitcoin Cash will Power the future of ‘Bcommerce,’ got the crowd fired up over how BCH proponents plan to spread mass adoption. The concept of Bcommerce aims to provide a global payment system on-chain, with low commission fees, and fast transactions. Nguyen details how the firm is researching and developing on-chain techniques for Bitcoin Cash, security improvements, better user interfaces and APIs, and most of all merchant adoption. Compared to Swift — It is Wonderful to Use Cryptocurrencies as a Payment Method\nAfter Nguyen’s speech on Bcommerce, the Coingeek crowd was greeted by the CEO of Bitmain Technologies Jihan Wu. Mr. Wu’s presentation called “The Future of Crypto Economy and Bitcoin Cash,” described how proponents can further bolster BCH adoption. Mr. Wu also discussed the subject of initial coin offerings (ICOs) likely in part because BCH may have the ability to produce colored coins soon. Mr. Wu detailed to the attendees that ICO’s have become a “buzzword” and some for the wrong reasons. Bitmain Technologies CEO Jihan Wu talks about the future of the crypto economy and Bitcoin Cash.\nFurthermore, Mr. Wu said many ICOs are misleading and the cryptocurrency industry should “work closely with regulators instead of working closely with lawyers.” Moreover, Mr. Wu joined a panel with Bitcoin.com’s Roger Ver, and Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright and explained how a giant tech company like Bitmain found significant flaws with the Swift banking system. As far as customers using digital assets for payments Mr. Wu thinks it is great and far more efficient than Swift.\n“It is very wonderful to use cryptocurrencies as a payment method — Basically our customers go to the banks and say they want to wire $1 million dollars to Bitmain and they can say no — You need to give them a reason, you need to give them a contract, and this and that,” explains Mr. Wu.\nBut with Bitcoin Cash you can wire the money as you wish as long as you control the private key — And the money arrives instantly and we can ship out the next day. Bitcoin ABC’s Amaury Sechet: Working to Increase Scaling Further\nFollowing the discussion with Mr. Wu, the Coingeek crowd was greeted by the Lead developer of Bitcoin ABC, Amaury Sechet , who detailed his technical vision for a global payment system. Sechet explains how Bitcoin Cash is continuing towards the original roadmap that Satoshi Nakamoto laid out in his original white paper . Bitcoin ABC’s lead developer, Amaury Sechet discusses continued BCH scaling.\nThe developer continues by explaining how BCH can already handle Paypal scale volumes, and for cheap network fees. After the BCH developers completed a successful upgrade just a few days prior, Sechet reveals to the Coingeek audience that they are “working to increase scaling further.” Bitcoin Cash follows the roadmap laid out in the original whitepaper. Purse is Launching a New Bitcoin Cash Implementation Called ‘Bcash’\nAttendees at the inaugural Coingeek conference also heard from Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright who talked about new ways to sell and trade goods with BCH in a presentation titled ‘Bitcoin’s Atomic Age.’ Participants heard from Centbee’s CEO Lorien Gamaroff and the exciting BCH wallet they are working on. Joannes Vermorel the founder of Lokad told the crowd about how proponents can overcome eCommerce hurdles with Bitcoin Cash. Purse.io announces native BCH support.\nAdditionally, Coingeek attendees heard a panel on BCH use cases from industry leaders such as Alex Gut of Handcash , Vin Armani of Cointext , Angela Holowaychuk of Ncrypt , and Steven Bower from Purse.io . Purse.io also announced a new BCH implementation called ‘bcash.’\nBower told the crowd about a new Bitcoin Cash client that will be released shortly called ‘Bcash’ that’s similar to implementations like the ABC, BU, or XT clients. Alongside this, the crowd was pleased to hear Purse.io is using BCH for native support. Overall the spirit was high in Hong Kong at the 2018 Coingeek event, and everyone who attended was quite optimistic after the successful fork a few days ago.\nDid you attend the Coingeek Conference 2018?

How much, exactly? A new paper from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimates the Bitcoin network consumes roughly as much electricity as the entire country of Ireland. But some experts are questioning his methodology. De Vries estimates that Bitcoin miners consume “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” He argues we can reasonably assume his 2.55 gigawatts calculation is correct because we know the current total computing power of the Bitcoin network, which is 30 million trillion SHA-256 hashes per second as of May 2018. With that number, de Vries calculates the least amount of electricity all that computing would consume by assuming that every miner is using the most energy-efficient computer hardware available. (Mining, by the way, is the process by which computers generate and add coins to a blockchain ledger. You can read more about it here .) However, not all mining operations are perfectly efficient, considering miners use a wide variety of hardware, and each mining “rig” can differ greatly in its electricity consumption. It’s because of this and the speculative economic models de Vries uses in his paper that have caused some to question the accuracy of the upper bound of his estimates. In his paper, de Vries assumes that electricity costs account for 60 percent of the total cost of mining Bitcoin, and that the average cost of electricity around the world is 5 cents per KWh. Cryptocurrency mining rig. Public domain “The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,” Jonathan Koomey, a Stanford University research fellow who pioneered studies of electricity usage from IT equipment, told NBC News . “There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.” The main problem in calculating the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network is the lack of data. Simply none exist, and no participant on the decentralized blockchain is obligated to share any. This makes any calculations on the total amount of electricity consumed by the Bitcoin network necessarily speculative. “The only people with good data on this are the miners, so you need that data to understand the electricity consumption,” Christian Catalina, an assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, told NBC News . “The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices.” De Vries says he hopes his paper serves as a foundation for further research. It’s worth noting that not all cryptocurrencies require as much energy as Bitcoin . Ethereum, for example, is moving toward a new method for how consensus is reached on the blockchain called proof-of-stake. It would be significantly more energy-efficient than Bitcoin mining, and could eventually give it an edge on cryptocurrency’s flagship coin. brian-behlendorf-how-the-blockchain-revolution-will-end-corruption", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/study-claims-bitcoin-uses-much-energy-ireland-not-so-fast-n875211", "https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T22:26:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a9b060bc64106e0da5ce6e5ccdc2d81d2ce3bb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUFRkW9jnH5Z2nwI9cFB6dc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Reputation of Bitcoin in the Philippines.", "title_full": "Reputation of Bitcoin in the Philippines.", "published": "2018-05-18T22:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.075, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a9b060bc64106e0da5ce6e5ccdc2d81d2ce3bb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUFRkW9jnH5Z2nwI9cFB6dc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "maxim4eg123", "published": "2018-05-18T22:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Reputation of Bitcoin in the Philippines.", "text": "This will have a huge impact on the growth and development of Bitcoin in the Philippines.

Koomey told NBC News :\nFor two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing. My concern is that we simply don't have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he's coming to.\nDe Vries' conclusions in question estimate that the Bitcoin network consumes \"at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.\" Furthermore, the researcher claims:\nEconomic models tell us that Bitcoin's electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.\nHowever, according to experts such as Koomey, de Vries' and others' underlying assumptions are problematic — particularly in regards to the manner in which they calculate the value of energy and the price paid for said energy. Explained Koomey:\nThe worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air. There may be some basis for them, but it's a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It's odd that someone would.\nBitcoin mining is a notoriously private enterprise , with a lot of current and future mining operations taking place in remote areas. As such, it's not exactly cut and dry how much miners pay for energy, especially considering many operations are set up specifically to reduce said costs — such as mining in caves, energy-rich areas, or low-cost countries.\nDe Vries research also neglects to consider how miners often use special mining equipment crafted specifically to maximize efficiency. Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management who researches cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology , told NBC News:\nThe only people with good data on this are the miners, so you do need that data to understand the electricity consumption. The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices.\nKoomey added:\nThe equipment they're using is customized to their use. This is not the standard servers that are being sold. These are machines that are assembled using other components. That makes it more difficult. It's a custom design and those kind of servers are not tracked as well.\nWe should try to get the numbers right […]\nSo, what are the correct numbers? According to Jan Čapek, CEO and co-founder of Braiins Systems and operator of massive Bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool, his company uses a lot less energy than critics imply — and turns a pretty penny in the process.\nNotes Čapek, the total cost, at current difficulty, to mine one bitcoin comes to less than $1937 using recent HW @ 5c/kWh, which is far less energy consumed than most naysayers would like you to believe.\nLet's have some numbers for todays panel in NYC. I have updated the \"1 BTC mining cost estimates and total network power gists\" with current difficulty. It comes to less than USD 1937 for 1 BTC using some recent HW @ 5c/kWh https://t.co/ykBj4wNPgq\n— Jan Čapek (@janbraiins) May 18, 2018\nIt's worth noting that even de Vries himself admits the flaws in his research's design. The researcher stated:\nWe've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.\nDo you think the energy costs associated with global Bitcoin mining are overblown?

I run a small crypto consulting business specializing in mining. I'm not even talking about the near impossible task of calculating your tax liability unless you use just one exchange - just good old fashioned bookkeeping is pretty much impossible if you have any inclination towards accepting raw crypto in your business..\nThe only accounting software that even supports BTC as a currency directly to begin with is Quickbooks Online - and they round everything to two decimal places. Which essentially rounds every transaction to the nearest $100, and transactions below $50 round down to $0 - so it refuses to accept/import them. Which makes that functionality completely useless.\nSo of course I can manually enter the dollar value of the bitcoin when I receive it - which is multiple times a day in small amounts due to mining. And then when if you want to directly spend it....just forget about it. Its not worth it. You'll never be able to keep your books straight ever again, because you have to value the amount spent in USD, not BTC.\nLiterally the only viable option if I want to keep my books straight is to not accept crypto through anything but a payment processor that will immediately convert it to fiat. And that's not what anyone here wants, right?\nSeriously I can't overemphasize how much of a barrier to adoption this is to business. Its not just about paying the right amount of tax - it makes it impossible to understand the financial state and health of your business when half of your income and assets can't be included in accounting software.\nAnd at the end of the day this is nothing more than a computer science problem - its just an impossible burden for a human being. Anyone who writes a plugin to effectively integrate Bitcoin into QBO is my hero forever.\nOk, rant over....but seriously you guys, this is like a ridiculously huge probl em for adoption. You can do everything in the world to convince people to spend it, but it doesnt matter if business reality effectively forces businesses not to accept it. If you wondered why 10 years later so few businesses still accept it directly, if at all....this is why.\nsubmitted by /u/Darius510\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quickbooks online", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T22:08:32.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f615d4515a8725bb28fe6136a9a42bbcd61a325", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBKJwXfCzihM2Mrwed7hnAScY3KQZHbgsM2smZCsk0pD__zU8Ic5PxV0jdeNRlWzMy3NKX8TwmsDGSHn1KBfGgOSg--", "site_full": "anynote.co", "site": "anynote.co", "site_section": "https://anynote.co/rss/?id=1", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Latest Blogs", "title": "Feds Start To Crack Down On Fraud As Bitcoin Soars", "title_full": "Feds Start To Crack Down On Fraud As Bitcoin Soars", "published": "2018-05-18T22:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f615d4515a8725bb28fe6136a9a42bbcd61a325", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBKJwXfCzihM2Mrwed7hnAScY3KQZHbgsM2smZCsk0pD__zU8Ic5PxV0jdeNRlWzMy3NKX8TwmsDGSHn1KBfGgOSg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kitty Crummer", "published": "2018-05-18T22:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Feds Start To Crack Down On Fraud As Bitcoin Soars", "text": "by Kitty Crummer on 15 minutes ago 3 views Some financial technology sectors see the potential in cryptocurrencies and offer a number of of the main ones as investment choices. That spike helped introduce both fanatics and skilled buyers to ICOs. If these corporations conduct an IPO, they usually entice funds from traders in the identical jurisdiction because the stock change, and see their shares. Traders concerned about investing in or buying and selling an ICO can go to the web site to open an account. Now we have an app that allows you to handle your on-line funds by sending and receiving funds with the convenience of easy QR code scanning however it goes into utterly new realms by offering the user a cryptocurrency mining experience, without the technical information or specialist hardware https://ico.echat.io/ that is required for Bitcoin or Ethereum mining. Buying and selling Rewards: Accumulate buy cryptocurrency COIN rewards with each commerce on the Coinvest platform. As with all excessive-return investments, buying cryptocurrency is dangerous, and ICOs are riskier nonetheless. To learn more information regarding buy cryptocurrency visit the web page. AION tokens might be used to create new blockchains, monetize inter-chain bridges, and ico.echat.io secure the general network. Its latest announcement in a collection of moves and bulletins that have accelerated its development trajectory, is an preliminary coin providing, or ICO, with the purpose of elevating $500 million. These firms buy cryptocurrency embrace First Bitcoin Capital Corp., CIAO Group, Strategic International and Sunshine Capital. The share to assist the token relies in the marketplace and the required requirements for financial prices for the supporting and development of the platform and may range from 5% to 30%. Greater than $3 billion has been raised through ICOs so far this 12 months, in accordance with CoinSchedule The choices typically mix aspects of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum with crowdfunding; whether or not and when they should be regulated as securities is still being debated Generally the tokens which can be issued correspond to a product—one digital unit would possibly confer the best to ship e-mail on a brand new system, for instance. I imagine these two might help buy cryptocurrency deliver the GV undertaking resources to develop the marketing and education infrastructure required to grow previous cryptocurrency and into mainstream adoption. I wish Overstock's blockchain project was somewhat higher at constructing consensus. It's just a solution to fund a regular business with a daily stock offering (or securitization, or whatever), solely \"tokenized.\" \"Tokenized\" signifies that the inventory within the enterprise trades on a blockchain as an alternative of on a regular stock alternate.Googling\" for Bitcoin Hack or Ethereum Hack will discover you dozens of stories of stolen cryptocurrencies. They want to make mechanisms for secure, safe, and seamless investment of cryptocurrencies and likewise to empower any individual to create a personalised index for crypto assets in one platform alone utilizing one wallet. Yes, many of those online operations are merely trying to create digital currencies that function an alternative choice to bitcoin. The one technique to full a transaction on the platform is to have Brickblock Tokens. In closing: You might be able to generate profits by investing in ICOs. In his teaser was Hutchinson speaking about an altcoin with the facility to offer to cryptoworld nice advantages, a software for everyday use,( worldwide acceptation ) and even exchange the dollar in time, that can solely be an prize stable coin, just like the CORIAN coin, in any other case there,s solely trading with coins left. Actuality might not hit, of course, or it it won't hit anytime soon, I do not know — lots of the pundits persist in predicting that the subsequent debt ceiling showdown will drive the costs of cryptocurrencies higher, as arguably happened throughout the first bitcoin surge just a few years again, however that is clutching at a rational cause for things that have already elevated by 1000's of percent, in some cases, for no real motive. That is one cause why Filecoin restricted its report-setting $250 million ICO to buyers prepared to undergo SEC accreditation. The Coinvest DAPP goals to decentralize all control involved in a cryptocurrency trade, and if they succeed, they would be the first ones to attain this in actuality. An ICO, or initial coin offering, is type of like an preliminary public offering, but with a crypto twist and without the regulatory hoops to jump through, although this may very well be changing in a big manner (more on that in a bit). And after a long and thorough investigation the SEC has lastly concluded that the ICO is no different from an IPO and the platforms enabling trading of such coins are not any different from our ages previous inventory exchanges. The Coinvest token sale for COIN tokens is going down all through December 2017. The takeaway from this in my view is Overstock will proceed to be a growth story over the subsequent 18 months or so, and if it may possibly successfully place itself as a frontrunner in the business, it should provide quite a few income streams that might propel to much larger levels than even the more optimistic traders are thinking at this time. But he said regulatory scrutiny is rising, on the identical time that the market is rising and Bitcoin's value is hovering sky-high. Nonetheless the ICO side provides one other device to the stock promoters: With a successful IPO, they can truly create worth\" for the company as a result of any ICO proceeds are principally free cash\" for the corporate. Properly, a venture may be nothing however a coin, a tiny iteration on Bitcoin, like Vertcoin , which bills itself as Bitcoin upgraded.\" That is precisely what it is, principally Bitcoin that's ASIC resistant, which means it is harder for mining to turn out to be centralized. First, the owner of a Binary token has the correct to transform tokens into binary widespread stocks. The constructions to help ICOs succeed and thrive within the mainstream are nonetheless evolving—just like the Argon Group, which longtime Wall Streeter Stan Miroshnik based to help oversee ICOs. Unsold tokens can be distributed between all who purchased not less than any amount of token whereas ICO. But she advises that ICOs are sometimes solely successful for the very small variety of companies that have blockchain know-how at their coronary heart.\" ICOs commonly fail when that's missing or when the advertising and message are poor, she warned.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://linjawistud.com/index.php/en/component/k2/itemlist/user/855897", "https://ico.echat.io/", "http://doctorliga.ru/node/56573"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kitty crummer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T22:22:46.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6362f5b85077323f07c0a8a8efdd4cfd56c968c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcPoLDRGGE79CitlOyjaKndPGAZFb9zaD_YZtTF689bwuiHAOQnyYS0gw2DC4VPFA0xUhgw3rv0B_tmDbz2yhDHYMp.5baDdG_8rfCH8eBMBFWkzKycQYSnBRBoP0WRB2A0gJH3ZWfjVyEW4Z7yPYTMLk7iBzk.Vo-", "site_full": "heisenbergreport.com", "site": "heisenbergreport.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/dealbreaker/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Dealbreaker", "title": "Bitcoin ‘Guru’ Tom Lee Admits He Was Wrong On Consensus Rally, Blames ‘Unnatural’ Behavior", "title_full": "Bitcoin ‘Guru’ Tom Lee Admits He Was Wrong On Consensus Rally, Blames ‘Unnatural’ Behavior", "published": "2018-05-18T22:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/heisenbergreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin.png?fit=1200%2C594&amp;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6362f5b85077323f07c0a8a8efdd4cfd56c968c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcPoLDRGGE79CitlOyjaKndPGAZFb9zaD_YZtTF689bwuiHAOQnyYS0gw2DC4VPFA0xUhgw3rv0B_tmDbz2yhDHYMp.5baDdG_8rfCH8eBMBFWkzKycQYSnBRBoP0WRB2A0gJH3ZWfjVyEW4Z7yPYTMLk7iBzk.Vo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thornton McEnery", "published": "2018-05-18T22:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin ‘Guru’ Tom Lee Admits He Was Wrong On Consensus Rally, Blames ‘Unnatural’ Behavior", "text": "Guess who’s back?\nIt’s Fundstrat’s Thomas Lee!\nYou might recall that last week, the Bitcoin “guru” suggested that everyone’s favorite cryptocurrency (down a not-at-all-cool 60% from the absurd December peak) was set to rally this week because, well, because people were getting together to talk about cryptocurrencies.\nAnd aside from putting a gaggle of nerds sporting “‘Buy The Dip’ t-shirts” on an actual cruise ship for a jaunt through the Malacca Strait on the way to a private beach party set to “Bitcoin-themed rap music” and featuring John McAfee, what better way to rekindle the HODL spirit than to convene a conference in New York complete with ostensibly serious speakers (in order to lend some legitimacy to something that is inherently illegitimate), rented Lambos , and a Ripple-sponsored party headlined by Snoop?\nWell blame it on how disenchanted people tend to get when an asset they bought on a credit card plunges by half in the space of 90 days or, if you’re Thomas Lee, blame it on people being insane, but Bitcoin did not in fact benefit from the expected “Consensus rally.” Instead, this made-up piece of shit fell by some 6% on the week, as pieces of shit are wont to do:\nSo what happened? Well, as alluded to above, Thomas Lee thinks that folks didn’t fully appreciate the extent to which Consensus served as a helpful “sanity check” on crypto detractors. To wit, from a Friday note:\nGiven conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction . And coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided crypto-currency prices.\nGot that? This is your fault for not doing what’s “natural”, which is obviously to pile into a make-believe asset that isn’t backed by anything, has no underlying rate of return, is not regulated and isn’t, in any real sense, a real thing, simply because people got together and talked about it.\nAlas, no one’s “conviction” was thusly “strengthened”, perhaps underscoring the fact (because that’s what it is, a fact), that Bitcoin and all of its progeny will only find real support once they converge on their intrinsic value of zero.

ever. Thanks to skyrocketing prices and rollercoaster dips, everyone and their dog are interested in learning how to buy and sell Bitcoin . As the most popular form of cryptocurrency ( and the blockchain technology that powers it), Bitcoin is now widely accepted around the world and has a growing number of applications . But before you can get into any of that, you need to first know where to go to purchase and store it.\nThere are a few steps you need to take to make your first purchase, but if you’re ready and willing to follow along, we’ll teach you how to buy Bitcoin in no time. Quick tips\nAlthough each step does take some consideration, these are the main points you need to think over when it comes to making your first Bitcoin purchase: Install an offline Bitcoin wallet and setup a strong password to protect it. Set up an account on Coinbase (and GDAX if you want additional control). Choose your preferred payment method. Buy some Bitcoin! Step 1: Find a good Bitcoin wallet\nDigital “wallets” are used to store Bitcoin until you are ready to spend them or exchange them for another currency. Wallets range in terms of features, platforms they can be used on, and security, so it’s important to choose one that works for you.\nTo get you started, your best bet is to use the wallet that’s automatically provided to you on our recommended exchange, Coinbase. However, it’s also a good idea to set up a wallet that’s not linked to an exchange as that way if the exchange ever goes down or becomes rammed with traffic, you still have ready access to your Bitcoin.\nHere are our recommended options:\nExodus An all-in-one offline application with support for a number of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Exodus is free to use, has built in shape-shift trading and some simple graphing tools to help you visualise your cryptocurrency portfolio.\nMycelium is a popular mobile wallet known for being compatible with more advanced tech, like Trezor hardware wallets (for maximum security) and Tor.\nFor a look at a few other of our favorite wallets, here’s a more in-depth guide to the best Bitcoin wallets .\nNote: Although an online wallet is fine for your first Bitcoin purchase, if you find yourself with a lot of valuable cryptocurrency because of trading or an upswing in value, make sure to store it in an offline “cold storage” wallet for maximum protection. Step 2: Choose the right Bitcoin trader\nThe best place to make your first Bitcoin purchase is on an exchange. There are a whole lot of exchanges out there, with varying performance. Some are less trustworthy than others and some can be quite limited, so it’s important to pick the right exchange to start with. We recommend using Coinbase , though there’s no harm in checking out the competition using a Bitcoin exchange comparison site .\nSigning up for a Coinbase account is easy, though you will need to provide some form of identification. That may involve sending a copy of your photo ID and potentially also sending a live image of your face using a webcam. These rules are important to follow as they allow the site(s) to comply with ‘know-your-customer’ regulations.\nAlthough Coinbase alone will allow you to buy and sell Bitcoin, it’s also worth signing up to its linked exchange platform, GDAX , which will give you greater control over your purchases.\nIf you would rather take a more direct route in buying Bitcoin, you can opt to use a peer to peer service, such as LocalBitcoin or BitQuick . They offer a wider array of payment options and let you purchase Bitcoin directly from a seller without the exchange middle man. That said, make sure to be safe if you plan to do a trade for cash in person. Step 3: Select your payment method\nExchanges accept a variety of payment options based on what they are willing to use. This is sort of a sore point for many exchanges, since some payment methods have been used to scam sellers for a quick buck in the past. Coinbase allows both bank account and credit or debit card transfers for payments and one payment solution must be linked to your account before you can make the trade. Paypal is not supported by Coinbase and with good reason .\nNote: Bitcoin ATMs allow you to exchange Bitcoin in compatible wallets for cash. These ATMs are available in a limited number of cities , but do provide an alternative to withdrawing money using an exchange. Again, most exchanges and online wallets will not deal directly with cash. Step 4: Buy some Bitcoin and store them in your wallet\nYou will notice that exchanges provide you with information on how many (or how much of a) Bitcoin you can buy for specific sums of money. However, due to its volatile nature, Bitcoin prices can vary dramatically by exchange and from moment to moment — especially lately . That means that even if you have a lot of money to burn, you’ll probably be buying a fraction of a Bitcoin. There’s nothing wrong with that and for most people is the route they’ll go down as few but the wealthy can afford more than that.\nTo make your first trade, input the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy in the provided field and click the buy button. On Coinbase or GDAX, this will be a basic “market” buy order, which will purchase Bitcoin at the best market rate. Alternatively, you can place a “limit” order, which lets you set a price you’re willing to pay for a certain amount and a trade will only happen if that amount shows up at that price.\nOnce you’re made your purchase, your new Bitcoin will be stored in your Coinbase wallet. You should then seek out the option to transfer these funds to the address of the Bitcoin wallet you have created that’s off the exchange. You will have to pay a small fee to do so, but that is part and parcel of Bitcoin transfers. Fortunately, the fees for such trades are far from their peak.\nImportant note: Bitcoin transfers can be a bit sporadic. Unlike other currency trades, when you buy Bitcoin funds. the transaction needs to be recorded in the blockchain and affirmed. This can take time, especially during busy trading hours. It’s not uncommon for a trade to take an hour or two to complete, so you may not want to immediately leap over to your account and start moving funds around. Step 5: Get ready to use it\nWhether you plan to ultimately sell your Bitcoin (hopefully at a profit) or use it to purchase something, be ready to do so at a moment’s notice. The way Bitcoin value fluctuates it’s important to have your end-game planned out early on. Be prepared by setting up a seller account now, or figure out how to buy what you want with it before you actually plan to.

Image Speakers at the conference covered topics ranging from government regulations to advances in privacy and what kind of lawyer you need if you work with blockchain technology.
