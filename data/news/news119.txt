Using Facebook Messenger, the attacker sends a message seeming to come from one of the victim’s contacts. The message will have the victim’s name, a random emoji, and, in it’s basic form, the word, ‘video’. There is a link on which the victim is supposed to click.\nRecently, these messages have been upgraded to make it appear that the link goes to YouTube.\nThe lack of any well-formed sentence leads one to suspect the attackers are either of foreign origin or are seeking victims in numerous countries.\nStage 2: YouTube\nIf you click on the YouTube link above, the newer versions of FacexWorm will direct you to a fake, but superficially believable, YouTube page. But to view the video you were sent on Messenger, you are told you must install a codec, as seen in the example below.\nAlthough the URL has nothing to do with YouTube, the victim may overlook this because of the similarity of the page to an actual YouTube page. If the victim agrees to add the extension, the malware will, through a series of communications with the C&C (Command and Control) server, gain control of the victim’s original Facebook website and send similar messages to the victim’s contacts, propagating the infection.\nStage 3: Chrome Browser\nAs of this writing, the extension that the victim adds in the scenario above only works in Google’s Chrome browser. The malware injects code into a normal Chrome extension. In fact, new code is added with every new web page that the victim opens. The code is programmed to recognize if particular login pages are opened and will send the login information to the C&C server.\nFacexWorm’s main function is to gather cryptocurreny. It is programmed to contact the C&C if the victim either visits one of 52 cryptocurrency sites or even writes the word of a particular cryptocurrency. Such actions will trigger the browser to go to a fake web page that matches the cryptocurrency that the victim has shown an interest in. Once at the scam web page, the victim will be asked to send a certain amount of cryptocurrency to the attacker’s wallet to prove they are a valid user. They are informed that the currency will be returned once it is validated. Of course, the money will never be seen again.\nFacexWorm will also inject code in web pages in order to allow for cryptocurrency mining which will benefit the attacker. The mining is programmed to take no more than 20% of the infected computer’s CPU’s power which will slow down browsing but will not make it so obvious that the victim becomes suspicious.\nIf the victim actually does perform a transaction in one of the attacker’s targeted cryptocurrencies, the attacker replaces the recipient’s address with their own and, thereby, pockets the currency. According to the Trend Micro report , these are the targeted trading platforms: Poloniex, HitBTC, Bitfinex, Ethfinex, and Binance, and the wallet Blockchain.info. These are the targeted currencies for this stage of victimization: Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dash (DASH), ETH, Ethereum Classic (ETC), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Zcash (ZEC), and Monero (XMR).\nFacexWorm attackers can make money if they refer victims to particular cryptocurrency sites. They do this by redirecting a cryptocurrency web page request from the victim through the attacker’s site, making it appear that the attackers were the ones who referred the victim. Thus, if the victim registers an account, the attackers make a little money from having referred them. These are the sites that the attackers receive fees from: Binance, DigitalOcean, FreeBitco.in, FreeDoge.co.in, and HashFlare.\nHere is a diagram from the Trend Micro report that summarizes how FacexWorm propagates.\nCircumventing FacexWorm\nIf you are worried that a cryptocurrency web page is a fake, simply refresh the page and it will go to the real page. Make sure to check the URL. Refreshing the page works because the malware has code that prevents redirection to the same page within a certain time frame.\nIf the victim becomes suspicious, (possibly because they sense that their browsing is slower than usual) and tries to open the extension management menu in the Chrome browser, the malware will close the tab before any action can be taken.\nThe weak point in the attacker’s propagation is actually in the initial Facebook Messenger attack. Facebook algorithms can readily identify such simple links as malicious and they routinely remove them. Chrome has also been removing extensions containing the malicious code. Installing new updates is important to mitigate any FacexWorm attacks. The sad truth is that these removals only teach the attackers more about hiding their code.\nIt appears that this entire, somewhat sophisticated, malware exploit is still in the development stage. It is currently affecting computers in Asia and parts of Europe. In fact, the attackers may just be testing it out to see where the weak spots are. I would expect them to develop more techniques to bypass detection as time goes by because the FacexWorm package contains too many good exploits to simply toss aside. It should, when the time is right, begin to show up in the U.S. and that’s something you can bet on.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T09:07:40.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bc0e33ddfba53bc2a370bd76e537bbd6578f9f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvJ3O9yvbyD5ZBQsutbHgt8nQOtK.7ikfrTsefwa5UJ2yVMEuEH.lKqB_rwb.UBPRdqRDvvXYLkA--", "site_full": "99bitcoins.com", "site": "99bitcoins.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin News Summary - May 28, 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin News Summary - May 28, 2018", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://99bitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-05-at-5.36.31.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74436, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bc0e33ddfba53bc2a370bd76e537bbd6578f9f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvJ3O9yvbyD5ZBQsutbHgt8nQOtK.7ikfrTsefwa5UJ2yVMEuEH.lKqB_rwb.UBPRdqRDvvXYLkA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ofir Beigel", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin News Summary - May 28, 2018", "text": "Here’s what happened this week in Bitcoin in 99 seconds.\nDespite continuing mainstream adoption and technical improvement, Bitcoin spent the latter half of the week in the mid-$7,000 range, having failed to hold the $8,000 level.\nArgentina’s Banco Masventas revealed that it would be exiting the SWIFT payment system in favor of Bitcoin. SWIFT is used for sending wire transfers between banks but the system, designed in 1973, is showing its age.\nThe Marshall Islands, home to some 53,000 citizens, became the first nation in history to officially adopt a cryptocurrency as their national currency. The new currency, called the Sovereign (ticker symbol SOV), is now legal tender in the Marshall Islands and must, therefore, be accepted for payment, business taxation, and banking purposes.\nThe Polish Finance Ministry announced the reversal of its recent ruling on cryptocurrency taxation. Trading in crypto will no longer be heavily taxed.\nThe US Justice Department is launching a criminal probe into Bitcoin price manipulation. It is alleged that certain traders are using questionable practices, such as “spoofing” or placing large, fake orders, to drive exchange prices.\nFinally, both Bitcoin Gold and Verge have recently suffered different types of 51% attacks compromising the security of their respective networks. Quite a few million dollars were stolen throughout these attacks. This serves as a warning about the vulnerability of coins with a relatively weak community of miners.\nThat’s what happened this week in Bitcoin. See you next week.

I doubt we’ll see that this time around,” he continued, comparing historical price patterns. “I think we’ll see this center section cut out. Next up cycle will take less time. Q3/Q4 2018 (in my opinion).”\nBitcoin, meanwhile, continues to improve on its status as a “currency,” commentators noting that fees this week are at their lowest in seven years, even beating rival altcoin Bitcoin Cash, which developers tout as a “lower-fee alternative” to Bitcoin.

People coming from all over the world speaking languages of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space. He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi (a blockchain company) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper.

Cryptocurrency Trading Addicts Offered Treatment in Scotland\nThe trading of virtual currencies can induce behavioral addiction the same way online gambling does, according to experts that helped create the first course to treat the problem using techniques found in gambling addiction programmes.\nCryptocurrency traders can become obsessive to the point of following minute-by-minute fluctuations in prices. Chris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, finds many similarities between gambling and the cryptocurrency trading world.\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation .”\nThe gambling therapist may have inadvertently confused the terms ‘classic bubble’ with ‘volatility.’ The definition of a ‘speculative bubble’ refers to the trading of an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset’s intrinsic value. Volatility is measured by the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, which seems to be what Burn’s was referring to.\nTherapist Tony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, will lead some of the treatments at the rehabilitation center to help introduce a life structure for addicts.\n“Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem. I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realize that they’re not alone.”\nIt is unknown how many people in the world trade cryptocurrencies and how many of them day trade to the extent of being regarded as addicts. High-risk trading usually gives a kick and rush, especially for people with an innate psychological tendency toward compulsion and addiction. The nucleus accumbens is the pleasure center of the human brain and also responds to the thrill of trading. Featured image from Shutterstock.

A Tellingly Quiet Disagreement?\nMeanwhile, a similar report on the lack of consensus in Bitcoin Cash post-fork focused on the lack of publicity it received.\nBitcoin core developer Kalle Alm noted that 16-17% of nodes were not following the new chain May 16, adding “everyone would explode” if a similar phenomenon occurred on the Bitcoin network, whose nodes are running at 100 percent with the consensus rules.\n“You can tell BCH is not bitcoin by looking at how not everyone is losing their shit all over the place,” he wrote.\nImagine if 20% of BTC nodes failed consensus? Everyone would explode. And there would be forks as miners are not just one dude running a farm.\nBitcoinVPC creator grubles had gone further, describing the hard fork as “an epic screw up for a network marketed as a store of value and a medium of exchange.”\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin Cash nodes’ inability to form consensus?

Regulatory pressure and mass sell-offs have been two key factors that have conspired to keep cryptos in the red. However, at times like these when investor confidence seems to be wavering here are 3 reasons why the future is bright for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nMore businesses are adopting the underlying crypto technology\nThe underlying technology that cryptocurrencies run on is starting to get lots of attention from major fortune 500 companies. A recent report published by Outlier ventures, a UK based venture firm indicates that over 280 companies are conducting intensive research into the Blockchain technology a list that includes companies like Amazon, Western Union, IBM, and Boeing.\nThis participation from major organizations will greatly enhance the reputation of the blockchain technology and legitimize its use across multiple industries.\nRegulation of ICOs\nICOs have both been a blessing and a curse for cryptocurrencies. They have raised awareness on cryptocurrencies while at the same time they have offered fraudsters a platform to steal from unsuspecting investors. A recent survey showed that 20% of all existing ICOs are scams and this indicates the need for regulation. As the SEC and other regulators try to figure out how they will best do this, it will encourage the participation of venture capital and institutional investors and accelerate the growth of cryptocurrencies.\nMore adoption\nThe rate of Bitcoin adoption is growing tremendously and available data from BitInfoCharts shows that the number of available Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets have dramatically increased. Also, Finder recently conducted a Survey that revealed over 16.3 million Americans own some cryptocurrencies. This figure is roughly over 8% of total American population.\nAnother survey that was conducted by Lendingblock in March 2018 discovered that 55% of the participants believed crypto purchases will be available in retail stores within the next seven years. One major block to mainstream adoption is the separating of crypto and Fiat currencies however upcoming independent crypto debit cards promise to solve this problem making it possible for real-world cryptocurrency purchases.\nDo you agree with these 3 reasons why future is bright for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

But what interests traders the most is if the recent developments have changed anything in the current outlook. And we provide you with our answer to this question. One our readers have known for some time now.\nThe media seem to have noticed that Bitcoin has depreciated. More Bitcoin-oriented outlets might even focus on market-specific events such as technical developments. In an article on CoinDesk, we read :\nBitcoin risks closing below the 50-week moving average (MA) – an important long-term support not breached for over two-and-a-half years.\nWith the bears already on the offensive following the recent sell-off, prices are likely to suffer if bitcoin closes on Sunday below the key support, currently seen at $7,611. More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency has not traded below the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended.\nAs of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,449 on Bitfinex, having dropped below the 50-week MA on May 23.\nWe generally do not disagree with the idea that the move belong the 50-week moving average might be a bearish indication. Taking a long-term point of view, the move below the moving average based on weekly closes might be a herald of more declines to come in the next few months.\nAnd we did see a move below this level and it seems to be confirmed. Does this mean that we only have declines in the cards? Not necessarily. No move in the market is certain unless it has already occurred. So, the move down is not certain but, for the long term, the move below the moving average might be an important event.\nWhere our emphasis would go, however, is that the long-term moving average is one of the indicators that might be worth to monitor. It’s not the all-important yardstick but rather a gauge that should be looked at in conjunction with the analysis of other indicators. And we do just that.\nDouble Retracements\nOn BitStamp, we have seen a continued move down from the $10,000 level. This move down has now lasted roughly three weeks. The most recent development in the depreciation is the move down below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level based on the previous rally from around $6,500 to around $10,000. Bitcoin went down below this level last Wednesday (May 23) and, even more importantly, has stayed below this level for almost a week now and this suggests that the indication here is bearish as far as the short term is concerned.\nAt the moment of writing, the currency is closing on the 78.6% retracement, a level possibly less important than the previous one, but a bearish indication nonetheless.\nIf we take a look at other retracement levels, the ones based on the February rally, the implications are virtually unchanged. Bitcoin went below the 61.8% retracement and it’s at the 78.6% retracement. A move below this level would be bearish again. The fact that the retracement levels based on two time frames coincide and have almost identical indications suggests that any bearish indication here might be stronger that if it had been based on one set of retracements.\nArray of Support Levels\nOn the long-term Bitfinex chart, we see a development which we have described in our alerts for some time now. Bitcoin went below the 78.6% retracement level and has remained below this level for some time now. The move seems to be confirmed. The 78.6% level is not an extremely important one, but the breakdown below this level contributes to the bearish outlook, in our opinion.\nRight now, the currency is declining in line with the long-term bearish trend. The next support level is around $6,500 but it’s not an extremely strong one. Actually, we have several support levels in the $5,500-6,500. From this area, the $5,500-6,000 looks like a stronger support. If we were to narrow this down some more, $6,000 might be a trigger for the next very important move.\nSo, based on the indications we’re seeing right now, Bitcoin could potentially go down to $6,000 and if we see a move below this level, and particularly below $5,500, the decline might accelerate markedly and our current hypothetical profits might grow even further. A counter-trend rally might occur around $6,000 but any pullback could be very volatile , so it might not be easy or even possible to exit hypothetical positions and reenter them at higher prices. Consequently, it might be worth to sit out any weak correction if it occurs. Nothing of this is automatic and our approach might change as the situation unfolds. Stay tuned!\nSumming up, the decline continues and might become even deeper.\nIf you have enjoyed the above analysis and would like to receive free follow-ups, we encourage you to sign up for our daily newsletter – it’s free and if you don’t like it, you can unsubscribe with just 2 clicks.

The devised treatment program is therefore closer to existing methods for treating gambling addictions, rather than to substance abuse programs.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was quoted by the Evening Standard as saying:\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center’s new treatments. Marini told the Standard that “introducing life structure is key,” adding:\n“I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they’re not alone.” Castle Craig said that there are currently no figures for the number of ‘crypto addicts,’ but “around 13 mln” people worldwide are trading in the system.\nLast year, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his home as collateral for a $325,000 equity loan, in pursuit of making a mid-term profit on the cryptocurrency. Crypto community members, evidently viewing his investment mindset as equivalent to gambling , remarked that the move was “almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.”\nFrom another perspective, there has been some discussion in the UK as to whether declaring your crypto trading to be gambling could help to avoid taxes with the British tax authority HMRC, which generally deems crypto profits as subject either to income or capital gains tax laws.

Now commuters riding the Prague Metro can purchase digital assets at various locations spread out across the fifth busiest metro system in Europe.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space General Bytes Installs Ten Bitcoin ATMs Across the Prague Metro\nThe Czech Republic-based firm General Bytes has revealed the installation of ten new cryptocurrency ATMs spread out across the Prague Metro. The subway gets more than 1.6 million people in daily foot traffic and is one of the busiest metro systems in Europe. The General Bytes machines are located at Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nádraží. Moreover, General Bytes provides a detailed map and description of each location on the website. A map of the ten Prague Metro machines manufactured by General Bytes.\nThe new machines will likely get some use in the region as Prague is considered a booming cryptocurrency hub, as the area is filled with quite a lot of crypto-enthusiasts. For instance, the area is home to the Crypto Anarchy Institute, Paralelní Polis , and a few cryptocurrency businesses including the ATM manufacturer General Bytes. General Bytes Has Manufactured 27% of the World’s Bitcoin ATMs\nThe Czech government is relatively friendly towards cryptocurrencies and politicians haven’t regulated virtual currencies or defined them as a currency or commodity like other nation states. However, the subject is being discussed among tax officials and the Czech National Bank wrote a paper last year called “Don’t be Afraid of Bitcoin.” Last year the well known online retailer, Alza, added cryptocurrency payments and installed two Bitcoin ATMs in the company’s showroom. Just three days ago one of the largest energy suppliers in the Czech Republic, Pražská Plynárenská, announced it was accepting BTC for payments. Czech Republic map of cryptocurrency ATMs.\nWith the ten new machines, the Czech Republic will now have a total of 46 Cryptocurrency ATMs and 27 of those devices are located in Prague. A large majority of the cryptocurrency automated tellers in the region are manufactured by General Bytes. On the General Bytes site where they announce the newly added Prague Metro machines there’s also a video explaining how to use the BATM 2 automated tellers. According to Coinatmradar out of the 3,122 cryptocurrency ATMs, General Bytes now has 858 worldwide.\nWhat do you think about General Bytes installing ten cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague Metro?

Merten Says Bitcoin will go to $50,000 in 2018\nNicholas Merten, whose dedicated Youtube channel ‘data dash’ has nearly 300,000 followers, is an entrepreneur and investor in the crypto space with a wide-reaching influence who occupies a position somewhere between John McAfee and Tom Lee. When he tweets his opinions and predictions to his over 34,000 followers he can cause a change in trends.\nHis latest prediction that has Bitcoin at more than double it’s 2017 high by the end of the year relies on some major failings in the fiat market. In his Tweet Merten lists four factors he believes will push the price of Bitcoin up to highs never before seen. My predictions for 2018: #Bitcoin will be $50K by the EOY. Why?\n– Interest rates will continue to rise– Deutsche Bank will go under by the 2018– Equities and housing prices will take a massive hit– With trillions of $'s that need to exit, the SEC will create a Bitcoin ETF\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nMerten is a known crypto evangelist but even a few of his followers questioned his reasoning in the tweet. A follower who uses the handle Sammy Tommy pointed out that interest rates have no correlation with cryptocurrency prices and that though Deutsche Bank is restructuring, there is no way a bank of that size is going under by the end of the year.\nWhen another follower asked for his prediction on the year-end crypto market cap Merten wrote that in his model it should go to $1 trillion. Among market predictors, Merten seems to occupy the middle ground between the antics of John McAfee who trades on his image of being a maverick in any space he occupies (Merten also shows himself on Twitter with guns) and the Tom Lees and Brian Kellys who bring a more traditional buttoned-down aspect to market predictions when they appear on shows like CNCB’s Fast Money . Bulls Predicting Prices from $15,000 – $100,000\nNo matter if they are talking about the collapse of fiat banks or soberly discussing their charts and graphs all of these bulls are calling for a big number for Bitcoin in the fourth quarter. Despite Bitcoin falling below $8,000 again over the last week, Tom Lee sticks by his year-end prediction of $25,000 which relies on regulation clarity to open up the floodgates of institutional money.\nOddly John Mcafee , who has promised to eat his own manhood live if Bitcoin doesn’t reach $1 million in 2020, is calling for Bitcoin to reach $15,000 by June which he says will be on track to meet his million dollar prediction according to his magic algorithms.\nThough $50,000 is at the high end of the prediction spectrum it’s only half of the high point, CEO of China’s first Bitcoin exchange, Bobby Lee, called for when he said Bitcoin will end the year at a $100,000 double that and reach a million which would mean Lambos for all and save John Mcafee from a very awkward meal.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicholas merten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merten says bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:35:30.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ffe57d709ed31187cf165778da30483496c67c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf0Gpg0sNNkGmmPdygXVtZVb0sAbQRoIi6ia08EqdctIx26sDO5O9pd3X2axLqi16Ef_c96LD0ys3soSBRaeNBjkz3dmzH_IAI6se6yVZCt4ZVNwOoWukGCYcnikCI.01tQ--", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Vertex to Launch Its Meetup Competition Sponsoring 25 Bitcoin Meetups around the World!", "title_full": "Vertex to Launch Its Meetup Competition Sponsoring 25 Bitcoin Meetups around the World!", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vertex.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ffe57d709ed31187cf165778da30483496c67c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf0Gpg0sNNkGmmPdygXVtZVb0sAbQRoIi6ia08EqdctIx26sDO5O9pd3X2axLqi16Ef_c96LD0ys3soSBRaeNBjkz3dmzH_IAI6se6yVZCt4ZVNwOoWukGCYcnikCI.01tQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vertex to Launch Its Meetup Competition Sponsoring 25 Bitcoin Meetups around the World!", "text": "Vertex to Launch Its Meetup Competition Sponsoring 25 Bitcoin Meetups around the World!

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.\nBitcoin meetups are probably the most iconic social activity that cryptocurrency enthusiasts engage in – apart from epic Twitter and Reddit battles. These gatherings of like-minded enthusiasts bring thousands of people together around the world. Their power to attract people transcends borders so much that enthusiasts actually look for these meetups when they fly abroad. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency fans in many cases would rather check the local crypto scene out than go into a museum or go on a guided tour of the city they are traveling to. Vertex knows this, and as a project that is deeply rooted in this sense of camaraderie and community that transcends borders, it decided to launch it very own Bitcoin meetup competition: the Battle of the Meetups! Battle of the Meetups Sponsored by Vertex\nThe Battle of the Meetups is simple. Vertex will go through all the Bitcoin meetups registered on meetup.com and will proceed to do the following: Select 25 meetups to sponsor. Sponsor those meetups throughout a period of 5 months. Give the selected meetups a list of criteria that Vertex will use to select the top 2 meetups over this period. Proceed to give the two winners an amazing prize. Criteria to Participate in the Battle of the Meetups\nThe criteria that Vertex established to determine the winner in this Battle of the Meetups is also quite simple. There are 4 vectors along which meetups can score points every time they meet. At the end, a final tally will determine the 2 winners. The following is the point system: The meetup that accumulates the most Facebook likes since the start of the Battle of the Meetups until the end, will be awarded 3 points. The meetup with the second most likes will get 2 points and the meetup that comes in third will accumulate 1 point. Vertex retweets after every meetup will yield 3 points for the meetup that retweets the most, 2 points for the runner-up and 1 point for third place. The meetup that brings Vertex the most Telegram introductions will get 3 points, with the second place getting 2 points and the third place getting 1 point. Attendance will allow meetups to compete on how many people they attract each time. Meetups that attract 600 participants or more, will get 3 points each time. Those that gather 400 participants at least will be rewarded with 2 points and those that bring more than 200 participants will gather 1 point. The Prize!\nAfter accumulating all these points over a period of 5 months, the Meetup organizers who win will be able to join Vertex at the Vegas Blockchain Conference in October. The winners will be announced at the Berlin Blockshow. The competition starts on June 11 th and it will come to a close by the end of October 2018. Can my Meetup Participate in the Battle of the Meetups?\nTo see if your meetup qualifies for the Battle of the Meetups, just make sure it complies with the following: It has 500 members. At least 30 members attended the last meetup. There is at least one meetup every 2 months.\nTo register, just send an email to [email protected] Let the Battle of the Meetups begin!\nFood and Drinks are Always Welcome, but what is Vertex exactly?\nVertex is a platform that invests in ICOs. It does so at an early stage, bringing the principles of disciplined investment, funds and a proven methodology to select the strongest projects to the cryptocurrency space. The platform is headed by a team of seasoned investors that have managed multi-billion dollar companies and investments around the world.

Malicious miners undermine the coin\nAccording to CCN , the attacker then made deposits at various cryptocurrencies, traded the coins for bitcoin or other currencies, and withdrew the funds.\nTo cover their tracks, the coin miners used overwhelming computer power to force the rest of the network to accept the falsified coins and cause funds to disappear from exchange-controlled wallets.\nThe method used by the malicious miners is known as a ‘51 per cent attack’ whereby the attacker gains control of the majority of the network’s total computing power.\nWith this power, the attacker then can reverse their own transactions, effectively spending the same coins twice and undermining the entire transparent nature of the blockchain.\nThe resulting attack strikes at the whole point of cryptocurrencies in terms of transparency and authenticity, making it hard to keep track of transactions.\nA recent Symantec report pointed to the rise of cryptojacking and bitcoin mining by hackers who are stealing vital computer resources to mine for crypto gold.\nThe 23rd volume of the Symantec annual threat report revealed that in 2017 alone, detections of coin mining increased 44,000pc in the UK, the fifth-highest number of such detections worldwide.\nWith a low barrier of entry – only requiring a few lines of code to operate – cyber-criminals are harnessing stolen processing power and cloud CPU usage from consumers and enterprises to mine cryptocurrency.\nCoin miners can slow devices, overheat batteries and, in some cases, render devices unusable. For enterprise organisations, coin miners can put corporate networks at risk of shutdown as well as inflate cloud CPU usage, adding cost.\n“Attackers could be co-opting your phone, computer or IoT device to use them for profit,” said Darren Thomson, CTO and EMEA VP at Symantec, at the time.\n“People need to expand their defences or they will pay the price for someone else using their device.”\nUpdated, 1.55pm, 28 May 2018: This article was updated to clarify that $20m was stolen from various cryptocurrencies, not exchanges. The cryptocurrencies included Bitcoin Gold, Verge and Monacoin, not bitcoin itself. Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist.

Now commuters riding the Prague Metro can purchase digital assets at various locations spread out across the fifth busiest metro system in Europe.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space\nGeneral Bytes Installs Ten Bitcoin ATMs Across the Prague Metro\nThe Czech Republic-based firm General Bytes has revealed the installation of ten new cryptocurrency ATMs spread out across the Prague Metro. The subway gets more than 1.6 million people in daily foot traffic and is one of the busiest metro systems in Europe. The General Bytes machines are located at Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nádraží. Moreover, General Bytes provides a detailed map and description of each location on the website.\nA map of the ten Prague Metro machines manufactured by General Bytes.\nThe new machines will likely get some use in the region as Prague is considered a booming cryptocurrency hub, as the area is filled with quite a lot of crypto-enthusiasts. For instance, the area is home to the Crypto Anarchy Institute, Paralelní Polis, and a few cryptocurrency businesses including the ATM manufacturer General Bytes.\nGeneral Bytes Has Manufactured 27% of the World’s Bitcoin ATMs\nThe Czech government is relatively friendly towards cryptocurrencies and politicians haven’t regulated virtual currencies or defined them as a currency or commodity like other nation states. However, the subject is being discussed among tax officials and the Czech National Bank wrote a paper last year called “Don’t be Afraid of Bitcoin.” Last year the well known online retailer, Alza, added cryptocurrency payments and installed two Bitcoin ATMs in the company’s showroom. Just three days ago one of the largest energy suppliers in the Czech Republic, Pražská Plynárenská, announced it was accepting BTC for payments.\nCzech Republic map of cryptocurrency ATMs.\nWith the ten new machines, the Czech Republic will now have a total of 46 Cryptocurrency ATMs and 27 of those devices are located in Prague. A large majority of the cryptocurrency automated tellers in the region are manufactured by General Bytes. On the General Bytes site where they announce the newly added Prague Metro machines there’s also a video explaining how to use the BATM 2 automated tellers.

Each week we select the 3 news items that matter and explain why and link to one expert opinion . News Item 1: European Parliament Passes a Resolution to Support Distributed Ledger Technologies And Blockchains Decrypted: On May 16th, The European Parliament Committee on Research, Industry and Energy, passed a resolution for DLTs and Blockchain. Greek S&D member Eva Kaili wrote the resolution, which had overwhelming support, with 56 votes in favor and only three against.\nEva said “We aspire to make EU the leading player in the field of blockchain.” The EU has an important role to play in cultivating blockchain technology. Eva Kaili: “We aspire to make EU the leading player in the field of blockchain,\" @EvaKaili https://t.co/JwfrpLa8vV pic.twitter.com/JVRqBkbRtd\n— EU Blockchain (@EUBlockchain) May 22, 2018 The EU has sent out a huge endorsement on the potential of blockchain and the benefits it can provide to the lives of its citizens.\nIn addition to outlining how Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) can deliver improvements to the economy, the document spelled out a policy to increase DLT adoption across Europe, and called on the European Commission to propose a framework for Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), saying “ they have a strong potential in funding innovation and accelerate technology transfer ”. Our take: For centuries, Europe was the epicenter of innovation in science and technology. In the last century we saw a shift, with technological innovation coming primarily from the United States. Silicon Valley has been the center of high-tech innovation over the last 40 years. While other regions have tried to copy its success, they have not been successful. In recent years, with the growth of entrepreneurship, the emergence of global competition and technologies like blockchain and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), the landscape is changing rapidly.\nAmong the many technologies that are driving digital innovation, blockchain has the potential to be truly transformative for financial services, markets and economies.\nEuropean innovators and entrepreneurs are already offering blockchain-based solutions. Major players from traditional sectors, like banks, insurances, stock exchanges, logistics or companies are engaged in pilot projects. Many member states have announced initiatives to reinforce the use of blockchain technology.\nWhile each member country is sovereign, the European Union is responsible for maintaining the economic stability of the region which is largely dependent on the value and stability of the Euro. To this end, the EU seems to be paying a lot of attention to the cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. The EU’s recent resolution, to support distributed ledger technology, signals Europe’s decisiveness to take a leadership role in most revolutionary financial and technological innovations of the last decade. Blockchain is a game changer and Europe wants to be at the forefront of its development.\nFor the first time in many years, the EU is ahead of its competitors both in the US and in Asia. The EU is in desperate need of fast, small victories, and this resolution will help bring about an important one for Europe.\nCompetitive economies depend on the availability and free movement of people, products and services. Data is the fuel that drives the movement of these assets. With this resolution, the EU wants to establish the right environment. It wants to enable a single digital market on blockchain and ensure that the European economy remains globally competitive, bringing benefits to both businesses and consumers. News Item 2: IBM Will Marry Its New Verifier To The Blockchain, Transforming Diamonds, Olive Oil And Insurance Decrypted: IBM Research introduced Crypto Anchor Verifier, a new technology that uses artificial intelligence and optical imaging to verify the identity and authenticity of objects. Crypto Anchor Verifier can identify the authenticity of forged goods such as fine wine, diamonds and medicine, as well as analyze water quality and detect bacteria, such as E.coli.\nIBM’s Crypto Anchor Verifier uses your phone’s camera and blockchain technology, to verify an item’s authenticity. Our take: Fraud costs the global economy more than $600 billion a year. In some countries, nearly 70% of certain life-saving drugs are counterfeit. Complex supply chains, with of dozens of suppliers in multiple countries, make it difficult to prevent tampering with everything from paper currency to consumer electronics. Blockchain brings trust, efficiency and transparency into supply chains. Unfortunately it’s not possible to put physical goods on blockchain. The next best thing is to use computer vision to capture an object’s appearance, create a unique digital signature and store that on blockchain.\nThe new technology is based on the idea that things we use and eat have their own unique optical patterns, which differentiate them from each other. Within the next five years, cryptographic anchors, such as ink dots or tiny computers smaller than a grain of salt, will be embedded in everyday objects and devices. They will be used in combination with blockchain, to ensure an object’s authenticity.\nCrypto anchors are tamper-proof digital fingerprints that are embedded into products, or parts of products, and linked to the blockchain. Crypto anchors can authenticate a product’s origin and contents, ensuring it matches the record stored in the blockchain. The solution captures the optical signature from an original, uncompromised item and records it on the blockchain. This signature can be used to verify the item, throughout the supply chain, and ensure that it hasn’t been tampered with. This technology can pave the way for solutions to manage food safety, authenticity of manufactured components, genetically modified products, identification of counterfeit objects and provenance of luxury goods.\nIBM is already working with GIA, the inventor of the famous 4Cs of diamond quality (Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat Weight). GIA is testing the Verifier software for diamond grading, by capturing and creating 3D model images of diamonds, analyzing their characteristics and predicting their clarity grade. GIA hopes to integrate this solution with blockchain, to ensure transparency and verifiability of the gems, throughout their journey from manufacturer to consumer.\nImagine using the Verifier technology on your cell phone, to confirm the grade of a diamond you bought or to make sure the your diamond is returned to you, after you sent it to be cleaned.\nThe opportunities for the Crypto Anchor Verifier are limitless and offer a viable way to protect and validate all kinds of physical products. Combined with the blockchain, it brings new levels of trust to the products we use and consume.\nNews Item 3: Bitcoin Gold Hit by Double Spend Attack, Exchanges Lose Millions Decrypted: Last week, Bitcoin Gold was attacked by malicious hackers, using a double spend attack. They managed to get away with over $18 million worth of BTG (Bitcoin Gold) coins. The hackers were able to get temporary control over the Bitcoin Gold network, by scooping up 51% of the total hash power. Once they had control of the network, they started depositing Bitcoin Gold (BTG) into crypto exchanges and from there sending these deposits to a wallet they owned. Because the hackers held the majority of the Bitcoin Gold network, they were able to reverse the transactions, actions that normally would have been blocked by the blockchain, and get the coins into their own wallet from the exchanges.\nIn a recent post , Bitcoin Gold says the first attack occurred on May 16, but it has stopped now. The Bitcoin Gold team advised:\n“An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use “51% attacks” to perform “double spend” attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.” Our take: One of the largest and most controversial Bitcoin forks was the Bitcoin Gold fork, that took place on October 2017 at block 491,407. Cryptocurrency forks are nothing new. In fact cryptocurrency forks take place on a regular basis and lately it seems like we have a new one every week.\nHard forks take place for a number of reasons, which include improvements to the code, developer conflict or different goals. Bitcoin Gold’s goal was to “make Bitcoin decentralized again.”\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, several key issues can affect any blockchain network. The 51% attack is perhaps one of the worst scenario for developers to deal with. It effectively means someone controls the majority of the blockchain’s processing power. Transactions, payments, and day-to-day operations can be severely affected.\nThe BTG hack is not the first time smaller cryptocurrencies have been affected by attacks like this. Recently, several altcoins suffered 51% attacks, including Verge and Monacoin .\nThese incidents have lead many to say smaller networks are vulnerable, because of Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm. While this recent hack is of great concern, its not the only one issue with BTG. Ever since its release, there have been numerous concerns and technical issues. Despite hard forking original Bitcoin, BTG has not inherited the robustness of Bitcoin.\nAfter the hack, the BTG team revealed that it plans on making the Bitcoin Gold blockchain “dramatically safer from a 51% attack” . The team says that a major upgrade that was planned for the end of June, is now being pushed to take place as soon as possible, in order to eradicate the use of ASIC hardware to mine BTG.\nTo be clear, the hacker hasn’t been stealing money from users, but from the exchanges. While users have not lost money, the attacks are dangerous because they might destabilize an exchange’s backup funds, or may lead to its insolvency and prevent users from withdrawing funds Right now, users are not losing money, but if the attacks were to continue, some exchanges could go bankrupt and in turn users would lose their money.\nToday, Bitcoin Gold is the 27th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $750 million and trading around $44.

Stories of legacy accounts getting locked have flooded social media and cryptocurrency forums over the last week. The company now tries to reassure these clients their funds are safe and explain the matter is required by law.\n“As soon as you submit this information, we will take steps to verify it and re-enable trading and transactions for your account. Please rest assured that your funds remain safe and accounted for while you complete this process – you can verify your holdings on the Balances page of your account throughout. Like all registered money services businesses, Poloniex is committed to compliance with all applicable law requiring identification and verification of its customers.”\nThe company also claims to have taken steps to increase the speed of the process. “We are happy to report that in the past 3 months we’ve seen a 33% increase in customers who are instantly verified, a 77% increase in customers who successfully pass our verification process, and an 85% decrease in customer waiting time for verification.” 24 Crypto Ventures Under FCA Investigation\nTraders that are used to how things were before regulators started focusing on crypto platforms are understandably angry about the new hoops they have to jump to, but there is no doubt that the companies are under scrutiny and pressure to do so from regulators.\nThe UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is currently investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone related to companies operating in this field, according to FT. Responding to a freedom of information request from accountancy and consulting firm Moore Stephens, the FCA said on Friday that the purpose of the investigation is to determine whether these crypto companies might “be carrying on regulated activities that require FCA authorization”. ICO Marketing Tragedy\nAsk.fm, an Irish company with its base of operations in Latvia and Ukraine, has sponsored four cryptocurrency enthusiasts to climb Mount Everest and place a wallet at the summit as part of its ICO marketing campaign. Lama Babu Sherpa, one of the Nepalese natives who helped the climbers, has reportedly been missing since May 14 th and is now presumed dead, according to AFP.\nThe team responded on Saturday: “We are now aware that one of the Sherpas who assisted our group amongst others, went missing during the descent. We wish to clarify conflicting media reports by stating that at the time of this statement being made we have not had any response from the relevant officials confirming the status of the missing Sherpa, and we are not therefore in a position to confirm if he is safe or otherwise. It would be insensitive to make such assumptions and we await, and urge the media to await, confirmation from the relevant authorities. There is no doubt that climbing Everest is challenging and dangerous…The last official update we received was that the condition and location of the missing Sherpa was unknown and it was not our place to make public statements which could have resulted in false information being circulated.” Crypto Champion\nAnd lastly, some happy news. Rory MacDonald, the current Bellator MMA Welterweight World Champion, has shared a clip of himself training in a BCH shirt showing support for bitcoin cash to his hundreds of thousands of followers on social media.\n— Rory MacDonald (@rory_macdonald) May 27, 2018\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

He explained :\nEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive.\nNevertheless, the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been hurting this month. After reaching highs of roughly $ 20,000 late last year, Bitcoin has fallen more than 50 percent in 2018 — and worries remain that the hemorrhaging is far from over. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $ 7,220.00, with some analysts fearing prices below $ 6,000 are likely on their way.\nStill, Bogart remains bullish on Bitcoin. He told CNBC:\nBut when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing. Could bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely. Altcoins Are ‘Over-Promising and Under-Delivering’\nBogart’s bullish sentiment does not extend to altcoins, however. He told CNBC that the majority of cryptocurrencies available to trade are “over-promising and under-delivering,” adding:\nMeanwhile, you have a few [cryptocurrencies] that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\nThe venture capitalist also told CNBC that he recommends selling fan favorites Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), IOTA, (MIOTA), and NEO (NEO). “A lot of those tokens are overvalued,” Bogart explained. “They could be go [sic] up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.”\nThe partner at Blockchain Capital is also cautious in regards to Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and dominant launchpad for initial coin offerings (ICOs). Bogart explained that the sheer amount of ICOs built on top of Ethereum is cause for concern, particularly if those ICOs don’t succeed.\nOn the other hand, Bogart recommends holding the other major players like Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and EOS (EOS) under current market conditions.\nDo you share Bogart’s belief that Bitcoin is still a strong buy? Do you think investors should be unloading their altcoins, or do you think such a move would be foolish at this point?

Such is the case for Bitcoin Cash, a major Cryptocurrency that has taken almost a 10% dip in its value over the past week. This comes as a surprise to many, as Bitcoin Cash got featured on a news segment on CNBC recently, which was expected to improve Bitcoin Cash’s position. Currently, Bitcoin Cash is placed in rank 4, according to coin market cap, with a market cap of $17,850,964,631 USD at the time of writing with a circulating supply of 17143125 BCH tokens. Currently, Bitcoin Cash has declined further with a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.160 (taken from the data feed of Kraken). As of 23/05/2018, Bitcoin Cash is valued at $1.040.10 following two massive dips from a high of $1,301.55 on 21st May to $1,233.70 USD on May 22nd. As mentioned before, this comes as a surprise to many, as the global cryptocurrency market fared much better comparatively, losing only 5.7% of its value compared to Bitcoin Cash’s 10%. Analysts are still not convinced about the exact factors responsible for this. Bitcoin Cash in the News Last Week Many High profile Crypto-personalities have shown their distrust towards Bitcoin Cash following its erratic behavior. Co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, Charles Hayter has called it “all standard noise”, while Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA called it one of the most controversial coins in the crypto space, second to Ripple. Marshal Swatt of Swatt Exchange, however, has predicted that the decline of Bitcoin Cash may be attributed to the recent Bitcoin Cash miners meet, where a proposal for rewarding developers have been discussed. Many other market influencers have also been discouraging traders and adding to the negative sentiment around the coin, which caused even further decline. CNBC’s Bitcoin Cash Feature On 22nd May, cryptocurrencies were once again featured on CNBC’s Fast Money, with Bitcoin Cash being the focus this week. Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC was asked to give a detailed analysis of why he has a bullish stance on Bitcoin Cash. Kelly described to his audiences what he called “catalyst factors” which are the main driving force behind a digital asset. Among the factors he mentioned was the aforementioned mining community meet, citing that this latest development would a value booster. In an unexpected turn of events, however, the segment generated a lot of negative sentiment inside the crypto-community, with many accusing CNBC of “shilling” the currency and suspected collaboration. Many analysts think that the negative backlash from this segment further negatively affected Bitcoin Cash’s value over the weekend. Final Thoughts Like with most cryptocurrencies , nothing can be predicted with certainty about future price movements. As Mr. Kelly put it, it all boils down to how the market behaves. Indeed past trends have indicated a similar fate for Bitcoin Cash. Experts noted that the situation is very similar to the incredible highs experienced by most cryptocurrencies in late 2017, followed by a massive price slump at the beginning of the year. In spite of the hurdles faced by Bitcoin Cash at the moment, it is to be noted that Bitcoin Cash has succeeded in the past where many other digital currencies failed. Bitcoin Cash is probably one of the handful of Bitcoin forks that have gained widespread attention and usage. This can be evidenced by Bitcoin Cash’s performance since its launch back in August 2017. According to coin market cap, Bitcoin Cash has held its position in the top ten cryptocurrencies despite price slumps and market movements. Thus, even though situations look bleak presently, the coin is expected to once again rise in value and regain some of its former glory. For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram!

A mosque in Britain's capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n\"For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,\" said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n\"For the donor, it's just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity.

(Photo by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nA Scottish hospital is treating people who are addicted to trading cryptocurrencies in the UK’s first ever ‘crypto clinic’.\nThe Evening Standard reported that Castle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, has created a course of residential treatment for those it deems to be crypto addicts.\nExperts told the Evening Standard that crypto trading can become a form of behavioural addiction, with traders obsessively glued to “minute-by-minute” market fluctuations.\nThe devised treatment program is therefore closer to existing methods for treating gambling addictions, rather than to substance abuse programs.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was quoted as saying:\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center’s new treatments. Marini told the Evening Standard that “introducing life structure is key”.\n“I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in.”\n“The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they’re not alone.”\nCastle Craig said that there are currently no figures for the number of “crypto addicts” seeking treatment.\nLast year, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his home as collateral for a $325,000 equity loan, in pursuit of making a mid-term profit on the cryptocurrency.\nCrypto community members, evidently viewing his investment mindset as equivalent to gambling, remarked that the move was “almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances”.\nFrom another perspective, there has been some discussion in the UK as to whether declaring your crypto trading to be gambling could help to avoid taxes with the British tax authority HMRC, which generally deems crypto profits as subject either to income or capital gains tax laws.\nHere’s more from Marini:\nThis post first appeared at CoinTelegraph, the authority on global cryptocurrency markets.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Core Becomes a Thing When Bitcoin Cash was first hard-forked back in November 2017, it resulted in two coins: Bitcoin Cash and the short-lived ‘ Bitcoin Clashic .’ The latter being the legacy, albeit tongue-n-cheek, chain that did manage to mine a few blocks at the time. But the chain didn’t wither away. A few developers have been quietly maintaining it and have managed to rebrand it to Bitcoin Core – yes, the exact same name as Bitcoin’s (BTC) most popular software client implementation used by over 94% of all Bitcoin users. Confused yet? Hold on, it gets even weirder. On its official website , BTCC is described as a “fork of Bitcoin” and too claims to be “Satoshi’s vision” just like Bitcoin Cash. The description reads: Bitcoin Core (BTCC) is open source, peer-to-peer electronic cash. Bitcoin Core is a fork from Bitcoin $BTC, Bitcoin Core $BTCC was nourished through a labor of love, in preparation for this mission. Bitcoin Core ($BTCC) is an upgrade of Bitcoin Clashic. The true vision of Bitcoin Core is to compliment Bitcoin, and run along side it, by acting as an express lane for core values, speed and privacy. Unlike Bitcoin Clashic, however, the Bitcoin Core currency might have legs. It is already being traded on the Crypto Bridge and Bisq exchanges at a volatile price of about $10 USD. According to the website, the coin will be listed on mcap.info and coinmarketwatch.com, and is supported by a software wallet and comes with a block explorer as well. The open-source code of Bitcoin Core can be found on GitHub. Tit-for-Tat Trolling The Bitcoin Clashic developers and the Bitcoin community responsible for the revival of Clashic appear to have fully embraced the term, often used by one of the biggest Bitcoin Cash supporters, Roger Ver, who deliberately refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as Bitcoin Core while maintaining that Bitcoin Cash is ‘Bitcoin.’In fact, the deliberate misnaming of Bitcoin Cash as ‘BCash’ and Bitcoin as ‘Bitcoin Core’ has been the go-to tactic of both communities ever since the acrimonious Bitcoin (BTC) hard fork that occurred on August 1st, 2017 gave birth to Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Bitcoin Cash’s Roger Ver frequently refers to Bitcoin (BTC) as ‘Bitcoin Core’ because he believes that Bitcoin Cash — which he refers to as the ‘real’ Bitcoin — follows the ‘true vision’ of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.“Roger Ver and CNBC’s Fast Money seem to be one of our best advocates,” a person who wished to remain anonymous told Bitcoinist.Meanwhile, the online shopping platform Purse.io released ‘bcash’ just last week emphasizing that it is not a cryptocurrency but a software implementation for Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Now it appears that the developers behind BTCC have done the exact opposite, launching a cryptocurrency under the name of Bitcoin Core to differentiate it from Bitcoin’s Bitcoin Core software client.The reasoning is likely that Bitcoin Cash proponents would no longer be able to deliberately misname their arch nemesis, i.e. Bitcoin (BTC) as Core, since BTCC is now a real thing, and a completely different cryptocurrency.Is the launch of BTCC merely trolling or can it become a legit cryptocurrency?

A mosque in Britain's capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin. The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n\"For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,\" said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n\"For the donor, it's just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque's perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,\" Musial said.\nEgypt's Grand Mufti, the nation's top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque's decision.\n\"Bitcoin is like any other currency. It's ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,\" Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results.

However, Anthony Lusardi, developer and director of ETC Cooperative, a community development and marketing body for the protocol, argues this is yet another point on which the ethereum and ethereum classic communities disagree.\nAs such, he sought to frame the impending removal of the code as another way the ethereum classic project is attempting to differentiate since the 2017 split.\n“Proof-of-work seems to be the most decentralized approach currently to achieving consensus from what the majority of the community feels,” Lusardi said in an interview.\nHe told CoinDesk:\n“There’s a lot of new algorithms being proposed like proof-of-stake, delegated proof-of-stake and byzantine fault tolerance, and within our community we’re not convinced that these newer versions of consensus are any more decentralized and we’re somewhat afraid that they may be more centralized than say proof-of-work.”\nEthereum classic’s decision to uphold its proof-of-work system was not made in haste. In fact, discussions started in 2016 after the collapse of the smart contract-based funding project The DAO , which triggered the original splintering of the ethereum and ethereum classic blockchains.\nIn January 2017, the ETC community moved to fork their blockchain to delay the bomb to allow for more deliberation time.\n“We didn’t know if we were going to move to proof-of-stake or stay with proof-of-work and there were a lot of discussions. We realized we didn’t have enough time,” Igor Artamonov, CTO of the ethereum classic development team, told CoinDesk.\nBy now, however, proof-of-stake systems have been better explored, Lusardi said.\nHe contends that proof-of-work systems better resist centralization because mining requires continuous infrastructural investment in hardware. Conversely, once a participant achieves an “economic majority” in a proof-of-stake system, he said, “there doesn’t seem to be much to ever stop them from having it.”\nEthereum classic developer Cody Burns agrees. “The entire premise is that you would put normal money into the system to buy a stake in it, and banks and large institutions have unfair amounts of capital compared to normal participants,” he said.\n“We would have spent the last four or five years just reinventing the modern financial system that we have now. Same actors, same players,” he added. Mass destruction? Unlikely\nHard forks have proven contentious in the past due to the potential for networks to split if miners fail to update their software or if some users decide to keep the network going with old code. But, Lusardi, Artamonov and Burns all said they don’t anticipate the upcoming fork to spark any controversy or technical difficulties.\nThe majority of nodes and miners have already updated their software, which was released three months ago, they said.\nMajor ethereum classic developer and tech company IOHK has also followed suit. It released its node client Mantis V1.1 three weeks ago with hard fork integration so its users had sufficient time to update, IOHK’s ethereum classic community manager, Kevin Lord, told CoinDesk.\n“There have been extensive announcements, discussions and careful review of the proposal,” he said, adding that the company will “be keeping a watchful eye on the network.”\nHowever, the developers noted that exchanges could be potentially unaware of the fork, but suggested the risk was small. Nonetheless, Lord said he recommends that users maintain control of their private keys and do not store their tokens on exchanges.\nThe developers anticipate that the fork will benefit the community, and not only by eliminating the mining difficulties caused by the bomb. The fork is also expected to reduce the amount of time it takes to create a block.\n“Right now we’re on 26 minute block times on average, so this will take us back down to 14,” Burns predicted.\nSome users may be disappointed with the fork, however, because the network upgrade will not result in an airdrop or the creation of a new coin unlike other types of hard forks.\nAll in all, the disabling of the bomb will likely pass without much notice, the developers told CoinDesk.\n“We tend to not have very contentious forks,” Lusardi said.\nBomb image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

VeChain (VEN), Zcash (ZEC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are three altcoins one could consider. These three coins provide an opportunity to take advantage of the downtrend. It’s however, not easy to just go out and buy the coins. Here are the things you would have to consider before you buy any of them.\nVeChain (VEN)\nVeChain (VEN) like many other cryptocurrencies has been in a decline over the last few days. Its price has dropped by 25% in the last 7 days, currently trading at $3.25. Considering that VEN was valued at over $5.00 a couple of weeks ago, it’s important to note that this value could rise in the future if the market turns bullish.\nWhat should you know?\nVeChain will launch its mainnet on June 30th. When that is done, there will be a dual token platform utilizing VET and THOR. When the mainnet launches holders of VEN, will qualify for an allocation of 100 VET. The more VEN, the more VET tokens you get. However, nothing much will change in terms of price value.\nIf the token split goes as planned, more companies could end up building dApps on the VeChain platform. Staking VET coins will earn users daily rewards as well as drive more adoption. If you buy VEN, then you’d do well to hold VET tokens. The tokens will be important for enterprises that want to use the platform to deploy future dApps or Smart contracts.\nThere’s a lot of hype building around VeChain and the future looks bright.\nZcash (ZEC)\nZcash (ZEC) is a cryptocurrency platform that emphasizes the privacy of transactions and the protection of user identity. To reach this goal, the crypto maintains integrates a number of features that enable its users to make anonymous transactions.\nWhat should you know before you buy ZEC?\nThe all-time high price of ZEC was $955 reached on January 07, 2018, which means the current price of $249 against the USD is a far cry. It experiences very volatile price movements, as shown recently when it rose by almost 50%. It nevertheless has lost that as the decline across the market continues. Though not encouraging, it also means that the coin has the potential to rally to greater heights.\nAnother thing to consider is where to buy or sell the crypto. ZEC is currently available for trading on a number of major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Bithumb, Huobi, Upbit, HitBTC and many others. Its main volume is on the BCEX platform though. Most importantly, ZEC is now traded on Gemini, its first licensed exchange.\nZEC can also be used as a payment currency, especially vendors interested in anonymity like VPN. However, it faces stiff competition from other privacy coins like Dash, Monero, and Verge.\nIt’s important to know that the zk-SNARKS protocol is still under development and testing and thus the platform could be vulnerable.\nBitcoin (BCH)\nAs far as cryptocurrencies go, Bitcoin (BCH) is among a handful that had a great Q1 in 2018. It gained in value to cement its place as a top-four currency. However, its price has also seen huge price fluctuations, dropping from a high of $1838 in early May. The current $932 to the dollar is nearly 50% drop.\nWhat else should you consider?\nOne factor to consider is where you are likely to spend the coins. There’s a growing list of vendors and merchants accepting Bitcoin Cash. This initiative will likely make BCH demand increase long-term, a factor that could play towards a price increase.\nBitcoin Cash is also widely available on various exchanges including LBX and the possibility of getting on Gemini soon.\nIt is important for an investor to remember that BCH is a fork of Bitcoin. While BTC has remained the most popular, Bitcoin Cash has been mired in some unpopular events. Furthermore, note that BCH wants to replace BTC by improving upon its weaknesses. However, there’s a concern that the tussle to replace Bitcoin (BTC) may not bear any fruit and thus the coin could fade into oblivion in the future.

Merten Says Bitcoin will go to $50,000 in 2018\nNicholas Merten, whose dedicated Youtube channel ‘data dash’ has nearly 300,000 followers, is an entrepreneur and investor in the crypto space with a wide-reaching influence who occupies a position somewhere between John McAfee and Tom Lee. When he tweets his opinions and predictions to his over 34,000 followers he can cause a change in trends.\nHis latest prediction that has Bitcoin at more than double it’s 2017 high by the end of the year relies on some major failings in the fiat market. In his Tweet Merten lists four factors he believes will push the price of Bitcoin up to highs never before seen. My predictions for 2018: #Bitcoin will be $50K by the EOY. Why?\n– Interest rates will continue to rise– Deutsche Bank will go under by the 2018– Equities and housing prices will take a massive hit– With trillions of $'s that need to exit, the SEC will create a Bitcoin ETF\n— Nicholas Merten (@Nicholas_Merten) May 27, 2018\nMerten is a known crypto evangelist but even a few of his followers questioned his reasoning in the tweet. A follower who uses the handle Sammy Tommy pointed out that interest rates have no correlation with cryptocurrency prices and that though Deutsche Bank is restructuring, there is no way a bank of that size is going under by the end of the year.\nWhen another follower asked for his prediction on the year-end crypto market cap Merten wrote that in his model it should go to $1 trillion. Among market predictors, Merten seems to occupy the middle ground between the antics of John McAfee who trades on his image of being a maverick in any space he occupies (Merten also shows himself on Twitter with guns) and the Tom Lees and Brian Kellys who bring a more traditional buttoned-down aspect to market predictions when they appear on shows like CNCB’s Fast Money . Bulls Predicting Prices from $15,000 – $100,000\nNo matter if they are talking about the collapse of fiat banks or soberly discussing their charts and graphs all of these bulls are calling for a big number for Bitcoin in the fourth quarter. Despite Bitcoin falling below $8,000 again over the last week, Tom Lee sticks by his year-end prediction of $25,000 which relies on regulation clarity to open up the floodgates of institutional money.\nOddly John Mcafee , who has promised to eat his own manhood live if Bitcoin doesn’t reach $1 million in 2020, is calling for Bitcoin to reach $15,000 by June which he says will be on track to meet his million dollar prediction according to his magic algorithms.\nThough $50,000 is at the high end of the prediction spectrum it’s only half of the high point, CEO of China’s first Bitcoin exchange, Bobby Lee, called for when he said Bitcoin will end the year at a $100,000 double that and reach a million which would mean Lambos for all and save John Mcafee from a very awkward meal.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mcmahon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nicholas merten", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "deutsche bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merten says bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:59:17.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "90f5be08ce7d5c1a7ebdb081420fde41edb0e2f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfQ3L2V2tVAN8s62wQPZTcjYnJQrdB4qXkUc2HV2I_k4KBaDtV3pvLEXDfRH4VZjkOg--", "site_full": "www.coininsider.com", "site": "coininsider.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Wall Street VC Spencer Bogart: Sell your Altcoins, go for Bitcoin", "title_full": "Wall Street VC Spencer Bogart: Sell your Altcoins, go for Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "https://www.coininsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Spencer-Bogart-1200x630.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "90f5be08ce7d5c1a7ebdb081420fde41edb0e2f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfQ3L2V2tVAN8s62wQPZTcjYnJQrdB4qXkUc2HV2I_k4KBaDtV3pvLEXDfRH4VZjkOg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rebecca Leighton", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Street VC Spencer Bogart: Sell your Altcoins, go for Bitcoin", "text": "Read: What?

Either they’re going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk ”, adding that a “ deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive “. Over and above his positive view on Bitcoin, he thinks that (comparatively) altcoins are not worth investing in. He believes that the other projects are “ over-promising and under-delivering.” He suggested that traders should sell the smaller tokens such as Cardano , TRON , IOTA , and NEO , claiming that the “ tokens are overvalued ” and that they “ could be go up significantly, but they also have significant headwind .”\nAs a partner at Blockchain Capital, a leading VC firm, and is reportedly the first expert from Wall Street to analyze blockchain, Bogart holds a deal of authority on bitcoin and blockchain knowledge and his words hold weight.

The Non-Mining Node Debate Heats Up - Bitcoin News", "text": "4 Three Powerful Misconceptions That Bolster Non-Mining Node Nonsense The Ongoing Debate Over the Importance of Non-Mining Nodes\nNodes. A lot of people from within the BTC and BCH camps are talking about cryptocurrency enthusiasts who swear by the importance of non-mining nodes and the discussion has leaked into other digital asset communities as well. Non-mining nodes are basically a complete record of the blockchain and some people also believe non-mining nodes enforce a cryptocurrency’s protocol rules, while others believe these groups are mere spectators.\nMining nodes are also considered nodes but they possess the ability to process blocks and mint new coins. Just today on the Reddit forum r/bitcoin, users argued about the fundamental difference between mining nodes and non-mining nodes. The debate showed the glaring difference of opinion between both sides of this argument.\n“Nodes do play a very important part to the system — They enforce the rules. Each person who runs a node has a ruleset they wish to follow — If enough nodes all agree to these rules they come to a consensus,” explains one commenter on the Reddit post.\nIf a miner or a pool decides to break these rules of consensus within 100 blocks they will lose the mining reward. Nodes can also ban other nodes for not following the consensus too. Nodes Do Nothing But Decide for Themselves Whether the Rules Are Observed\nHowever, immediately after the person’s comment, another user disagreed with the statement.\n“Can an ASICs mine or generate blocks without a node?” asked the user who disagrees that non-mining nodes actually enforce rules. “No! Can a non-mining-node generate blocks? No! Who writes the chain further, if not the mining nodes? Certainly not the non-mining node — Which power decides which blocks are valid? Which power builds the other valid blocks?” the commenter continues, asking:\nThe nodes do nothing but decide for themselves whether the rules are observed. If they are not met, they split off from the network and wait for valid blocks that will never come because there are no miners to generate the blocks. Or you have a mining node, then you try to generate the next valid block by yourself. Pool nodes are of course very important, but they have mining power behind them — Your raspberry pi doesn’t have any power at all. ‘Second-Class Bitcoin Citizens’\nThe conversation got interesting about a month ago when BTC developer Jameson Lopp tweeted a controversial statement about fully validating non-mining nodes.\n“If you don’t run a fully validating node, you’re a second-class Bitcoin citizen. If you don’t hold your own private keys, you’re a third class Bitcoin citizen,” Lopp stated on March 31, 2018 . Jameson Lopp defending the ‘second-class Bitcoin citizen’ position on Twitter.\nThe tweet didn’t go over so well as it sparked a vitriolic debate about the perceived importance of non-mining nodes. One Twitter user responded to Lopp’s tweet, writing “Why bring the bs hierarchical social scale to Bitcoin? This has to be one of the most pretentious statements I’ve heard in the Bitcoin community.” But Lopp answered back by saying:\nIt’s not so much about social scale as it is about self-sovereignty. Three Powerful Misconceptions That Bolster Non-Mining Node Nonsense\nOn April 29, 2018, on the We Are All Satoshi network hosted by the founder of the Pirate Party, Rick Falkvinge, the host debunked the concept that cryptocurrency investors who don’t run fully validating nodes are second class, and called the statement “nonsense.” In fact, Falkvinge explained that non-mining nodes are merely “direct spectators” who can only watch the rules, not enforce them. Falkvinge says nodes that are originally described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper were “mining nodes.” The Pirate Party founder says that people who promote the belief that non-mining nodes are rule enforcers are being nonsensical and usually bolster “three powerful misconceptions — users without nodes are second class, nodes have network power, and nodes decentralize the network. Rick Falkvinge discusses the three powerful misconceptions involved with the non-mining node discussions.\n“Users without nodes are second-class citizens — No they are not, 99.999 percent of users will not be running nodes and in fact, that’s completely fine, and required for mass scale adoption,” Falkvinge explains in his video ‘ Rick Reacts: The Nonsense about Bitcoin Nodes’ video . “Nodes have network power — No that’s nonsense they don’t. The network will proceed regardless of the presence or nonpresence of certain non-mining nodes — They have no influence whatsoever.”\nNodes decentralize the network — Well yes if your talking about Bangladesh goat farmers capable of renting a server, capable of gigabyte sized blocks, then you might get some decentralization. But this is used as a battering ram for hammering home the point somebody must be able to run a full node on a shitty Comcast connection — which is just atrocious — these three statements are all false narratives.\nThe non-mining node debate has become a very contentious conversation among cryptocurrency advocates and the argument is discussed regularly on forums and social media these days. The non-mining node discussion is now at the heart of the ongoing scaling debate that seems to never end.\nWhat do you think about the debate regarding non-mining nodes?

Now commuters riding the Prague Metro can purchase digital assets at various locations spread out across the fifth busiest metro system in Europe.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space General Bytes Installs Ten Bitcoin ATMs Across the Prague Metro\nThe Czech Republic-based firm General Bytes has revealed the installation of ten new cryptocurrency ATMs spread out across the Prague Metro. The subway gets more than 1.6 million people in daily foot traffic and is one of the busiest metro systems in Europe. The General Bytes machines are located at Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nádraží. Moreover, General Bytes provides a detailed map and description of each location on the website. A map of the ten Prague Metro machines manufactured by General Bytes.\nThe new machines will likely get some use in the region as Prague is considered a booming cryptocurrency hub, as the area is filled with quite a lot of crypto-enthusiasts. For instance, the area is home to the Crypto Anarchy Institute, Paralelní Polis , and a few cryptocurrency businesses including the ATM manufacturer General Bytes. General Bytes Has Manufactured 27% of the World’s Bitcoin ATMs\nThe Czech government is relatively friendly towards cryptocurrencies and politicians haven’t regulated virtual currencies or defined them as a currency or commodity like other nation states. However, the subject is being discussed among tax officials and the Czech National Bank wrote a paper last year called “Don’t be Afraid of Bitcoin.” Last year the well known online retailer, Alza, added cryptocurrency payments and installed two Bitcoin ATMs in the company’s showroom. Just three days ago one of the largest energy suppliers in the Czech Republic, Pražská Plynárenská, announced it was accepting BTC for payments. Czech Republic map of cryptocurrency ATMs.\nWith the ten new machines, the Czech Republic will now have a total of 46 Cryptocurrency ATMs and 27 of those devices are located in Prague. A large majority of the cryptocurrency automated tellers in the region are manufactured by General Bytes. On the General Bytes site where they announce the newly added Prague Metro machines there’s also a video explaining how to use the BATM 2 automated tellers. According to Coinatmradar out of the 3,122 cryptocurrency ATMs, General Bytes now has 858 worldwide.\nWhat do you think about General Bytes installing ten cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague Metro?

Spencer added that the price of Bitcoin will exceed “at least” $10,000 before the end of this year.\nAs the interview intro stated, Bitcoin has been in the negative for about 3 weeks, its “longest running streak of losses since September 2017.” Notwithstanding, Spencer Bogart made a bullish prediction for the long term. He stated that:\n“The long-term thesis is very much intact… The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occurring…Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk.”\nSpencer proposed that a number of altcoins are possible “overvalued” and “have a significant headwind.” He emphasized the dangers inherent in relative valuation of altcoins.

London Mosque Now Accepts Bitcoin The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said. Updated: May 28, 2018, 9:25 PM IST Photo for representation (image: Reuters) LONDON: Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramzan? A mosque in Britain's capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin. The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said. \"For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,\" said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology. \"For the donor, it's just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque's perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,\" Musial said. Egypt's Grand Mufti, the nation's top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque's decision. \"Bitcoin is like any other currency. It's ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,\" Adeyemi told Reuters. The mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300). Muslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.

Though there have been no negative fundamentals regarding the bitcoin and crypto market, the bearish pressure seemed to be never ending this time. After breaching the $8,000 area below, the bearish pressure is currently going to absorb all the bullish momentum it gained since it bounced off the $6,500 area back in April. As of the current scenario, there is not much hope for a deeper pullback in bitcoin according to the current market structure formation; the price is expected to be quite impulsive with the bearish gains in the way towards $6,500. After bouncing off from $6,500, we might see a certain bullish intervention in the process but it will need a daily candle with certain bearish rejection. As the price remains below the $8,000 area with a daily close, further bearish pressure is expected.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

People coming from all over the world speaking languages of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space. He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi (a blockchain company) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point. He had a very eyes-opening understanding of the crypto currency. Huge applauses came like waves after his speech. We wish Liao Wang and his Atoshi blockchain a big success on the world’s stage.

In its announcement , the exchange underlined better liquidity, enabling small bid-offer spreads and faster confirmation deposits and withdrawals as features of the new upgraded trading platform made available to users worldwide.\nAt launch, the new exchange will support bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) and their trading pairs. The exchange will address the needs of its user base to add other crypto tokens to its trading platform, the aforementioned release added. Users will see zero trading fees for the first three months following the launch of the new exchange.\nClaiming to offer a new ‘cutting-edge’ system to enable faster, seamless trading, BTCC said of its revamped platform:\nIn terms of technical developments, our exchange will utilize a multi-tier, multi-clustered system with an optimized, high-speed memory trading engine.\nThe new exchange will also be optimized to include offline cold storage to better safeguard customers’ digital assets, it claimed. In contrast, storing user funds in online ‘hot wallets’ have resulted in some infamous cryptocurrency hacks such as the recent $530 million theft of NEM tokens from Japanese exchange Coincheck.\n“We take security very seriously and are proud of the fact that we have never been compromised,” the exchange added.\nBTCC, formerly BTC China, was the world’s first cryptocurrency exchange to take shape in 2011. A crackdown by Chinese authorities on the domestic cryptocurrency sector following an ICO ban last year meant the exchange shuttered its doors in China on September 30, 2017.\nOne of China’s original ‘big three’ exchanges, BTCC soon moved its base of operations to Hong Kong and London before earning a reprieve after its acquisition by a Hong Kong blockchain investment fund in January 2018.\n“[The] acquisition is an incredible milestone for BTCC that validates all of our hard work over the past few years,” founder and CEO Bobby Lee said at the time. “I’m very excited about the resources this gives BTCC to move faster and aggressively grow our businesses in 2018 and beyond,” he added, stating the company would shift focus to offering services to the international market.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

The bears continue to control the market as the cryptocurrency arena has thus far lost over $150 billion from its May high.\nRecently, it was announced that the U.S. Justice Department was opening an investigation into the manipulation of cryptocurrency prices and illicit activities. Peter Tchir – a cryptocurrency analyst and Forbes contributor – says he would be very surprised if it turns out that cryptocurrency prices aren’t being manipulated, and feels that bitcoin’s price swings couldn’t occur unless someone was pulling the strings.\nTchir says there are no solid or established rules in the world of cryptocurrency, and points out a few direct factors that ultimately back his theory.\n“There are allegedly several very large holders of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” he explains. “The concentration of wealth gives them the incentive to push prices higher. In the stock market, anyone holding a large proportion of the outstanding security is subject to additional rules and scrutiny, but no such protections exist for cryptocurrency. The person telling you about how great it is may be very incentivized to see the price go higher. Whether this falls under the definition of manipulation that is being investigated, assume it occurs and assume it distorts price.”\nTchir also points out that traders have either heard of or witnessed manipulation in other markets – from LIBOR to FX – and says that cryptocurrency miners have far too much power, and are motivated to see prices rise, thereby raking in higher profits.\n“Miners earn bitcoins for what they do, so it is logical for them to want higher prices at any given time for the same amount of computing work,” he explains. “That is particularly true if mining activity is at all linked to price action… That would motivate the miners even more.”\nA new report published on Yahoo! Finance suggests that bitcoin’s long-term trends remain positive, but that bitcoin is likely to strike the high $6,000 range before any serious recovery can take place. The final support mark probably lies at around $6,800 before BTC bottoms out and begins to exhibit momentum in its price hikes.\nInterestingly, this report goes against the words of analyst Willy Woo, whom we discussed during yesterday’s price piece. His predictions – which were also published on Yahoo! – stated that bitcoin was likely to fall as low as $5,500 in the coming weeks, but now it appears such a drastic fall may have been an overstatement. Bitcoin would have to fail to sustain $6,800 and fall below $6,500 for this prediction to have a chance at becoming reality.\nAt press time, the technical analysis suggests this is not probable, nor will the cryptocurrency market cap fall below the $300 billion mark. Despite the consistent price drops over the past month, it appears bitcoin and its crypto-cousins are slated to remain above certain trading levels, ensuring that investors don’t lose too much in the end. However, it is difficult to predict when bitcoin and other digital assets can enter their respective recovery periods.

The current price action suggests a downside break below $7,250. Should it move further down to $7,100, then a further decline toward $7,000 or even $6,800 could surface.\nOn the upside, there is also a bearish trend line forming near the major resistance level at $7,300.

The devised treatment program is therefore closer to existing methods for treating gambling addictions, rather than to substance abuse programs.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was quoted by the Evening Standard as saying:\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center’s new treatments. Marini told the Standard that “introducing life structure is key,” adding:\n“I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they’re not alone.” Castle Craig said that there are currently no figures for the number of ‘crypto addicts,’ but “around 13 mln” people worldwide are trading in the system.\nLast year, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his home as collateral for a $325,000 equity loan, in pursuit of making a mid-term profit on the cryptocurrency. Crypto community members, evidently viewing his investment mindset as equivalent to gambling , remarked that the move was “almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.”\nFrom another perspective, there has been some discussion in the UK as to whether declaring your crypto trading to be gambling could help to avoid taxes with the British tax authority HMRC, which generally deems crypto profits as subject either to income or capital gains tax laws.\nSee this content where it was originally posted .

The survey was a fake, and respondents were actually sending their personal details back to Grant so that he could sell them to the dark black market – the phishing scam alone netted West £180,000 or $240,000 which he then converted into Bitcoin. BBC reports that the scam cost the Just Eat company £200,000 or $265,000.\nWest also directly targeted over 100 other companies including major firms like Barclay’s, Asda, Ladbrokes, Uber, and British Airways, hacking them for more customer data to sell. His Barclay’s attacks resulted in West’s clients fraudulently removing £84,000 or $110,000 from customer accounts and costing the bank £300,000 or $400,000 to remedy through new security measures. Similarly, West cost British Airways £400,000 or $530,000 after he hacked Avios accounts.\nHe reportedly used the money to pay for a new Audi worth £40,000 or $53,000 and several trips to Las Vegas among other luxuries.\nWest was arrested in 2017 on a first-class train to London in September 2017. Detectives from the Scotland Yard cybercrime unit chose the moment to end their two-year investigation carefully, making sure Grant was logged into his computer so and grabbing his arms before he could log out of his heavily encrypted cryptocurrency wallets and dark web accounts, which otherwise would be very difficult to link to him legally.\nOn the laptop, which belonged to West’s girlfriend, police found the financial information of 100,000 people. A subsequent raid on his home revealed an SD card with the details of 63,000 credit and debit cards as well as 7 million email addresses and passwords, along with £25,000 or $33,000 in cash and half a kilogram of cannabis, which West was also selling on the dark web.\nWest went by the username Courvoisier, after the top-shelf brandy, selling stolen information and drugs on the now-defunct site Alpha Bay. He pled guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offenses on 2 May and on Friday May 25 Judge Michael Gledhill sentenced West to 10 years and eight months in prison.\nPolice accessed and seized over £500,000 or $667,000 worth of ill-gotten Bitcoin from West’s girlfriend’s device, and she was sentenced to community service for unauthorised access of computer material – however, according to Judge Gledhill, over £1.6 million or $2.13 million worth of West’s cryptocurrency is still unaccounted for.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

Well, duh? Of course they are. Whether the activities meet the legal definition of manipulation or can lead to a criminal indictment remains to be seen, but I'd be shocked if there wasn't manipulation of prices occurring. Never forget Rule #2 of the \" 3 Rules of Bitcoin \" - \"There are no rules!\"\nI would expect to find problems with price manipulation because\nThere are allegedly several very large holders of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies). The concentration of wealth gives them the incentive to push prices higher. In the stock market, anyone holding a large proportion of the outstanding security is subject to additional rules and scrutiny. No such protections exist for cryptocurrency. The person telling you about how great it is, may be very incentivized to see the price go higher. Whether or not this falls under the definition of manipulation that is being investigated, assume it occurs and assume it distorts price.\nMiners , some of which may have large positions, are also motivated to see prices rise as it should mean more money for them. They earn bitcoins for mining, so it is logical for them to want higher prices at any given time for the same amount of computing work. That is particularly true if mining activity is at all linked to price action. Is there a correlation between activity, which should award miners with more bitcoins, and price? I don't know, but if so, that would motivate the miners even more. Again, I'm not sure whether this activity, if it exists, would meet a legal definition of manipulation for any charges to be brought. We have seen and heard of manipulation in actual markets - from LIBOR to FX. Many are actually regulated. Here, to my knowledge, regulation is light if it even exists. Some traders took the time and effort to establish accounts on various platforms to \"arbitrage\" price differences. They should be (and likely have been) rewarded for their efforts. In a fragmented market, where many participants only took the time to set up on one or two exchanges and didn't have the patience or willingness to do more work to ensure price transparency, they likely pay a price that goes to those who did that. But, like much else about crypto, I would be shocked if it ended there. Why not try and 'push' markets around? Create the dislocations? It seems completely logical that someone would try to do this. Again, I'm not sure this is manipulation (unless done in the futures), just like I wouldn't think it would be criminal manipulation to attempt to move the price of Beanie Babies on E-Bay (beannie babies ebay is apparently not an uncommon search). I am more shocked that anyone would be surprised that manipulation likely occurs in cryptocurrencies and their pricing. I will be interested to see how this investigation can proceed on things that occur on platforms I don't view as regulated exchanges on products that I didn't think were securities.\nFor now, this is yet another reason to expect cryptocurrencies to continue to drift lower. They are losing support and more and more of the issues with them are being exposed - further slowing the rate of adoption. Even knowing that manipulation occurs, whether indictable or not, doesn't mean I can't get bullish cryptocurrencies again, but certainly not right now. I would be more confident the market can weather these times of headlines if crypto had been able to rally after the #Consensus2018 conference, but it didn't .\nI expect the headlines surrounding ICO's and tokenization in general will be equally problematic in terms of encouraging new investors to get involved or existing holders to add more.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "opin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg the justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes contributors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T21:44:29.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "713a078d0e5d48318a29e17bdf097c0fb4277afc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS34wVYZJ8CHSaEC2Q5w1sno-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "title_full": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "713a078d0e5d48318a29e17bdf097c0fb4277afc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS34wVYZJ8CHSaEC2Q5w1sno-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nTo get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

That’s what the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) is currently looking into as part of a new criminal probe into crypto crimes.\nThe investigation comes on the heels of complaints by crypto critics that crypto markets are being scammed by savvy traders who know how to “spoof” the trading platforms and flood them with fake buy and sell orders. Such crimes can drive the price of a crypto way up, or cause it to plunge way down, apart from natural market forces.\nIt isn’t exactly a good thing for the reputation of cryptocurrency in general, which requires honesty, transparency, and accountability if people are going to trust using it. That the crypto world is essentially rife with misconduct at this current juncture is precisely why the DoJ is now getting involved, along with the help of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees derivatives specifically tied to Bitcoin .\nWhile crypto exchanges are expected to go after these bad players themselves, this obviously doesn’t always happen – hence the DoJ involvement. And with all of the crazy price swings with Bitcoin over the past year, many say there isn’t a better time than now for regulators to start cracking down and cleaning up the crypto world.\nWhat the DoJ is specifically focused on are spoofing and wash trading, two forms of cheating that regulators have been working for years to eradicate from both the futures and equities markets. Spoofers essentially submit a spate of orders that they then cancel after prices have moved in the desired direction. Wash traders basically trade with themselves, which creates an illusion of artificial market demand, again in order to manipulate prices. Sponsored solution from the Health Ranger Store: Lab-verified Nascent Iodine solution is a dietary supplement that provides your body with supplemental iodine to help protect your thyroid during radiation exposure. Nuclear accidents such as Fukushima (or nuclear war) can expose your body to radioactive iodine-131, a dangerous radioisotope. Pre-loading your system with stable iodine occupies the iodine receptor sites on your organs, causing your body to naturally expel radioactive iodine you may have been exposed to through air, food, water or milk products. This defensive strategy is recommended by nearly all health authorities, worldwide, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is hovering right around $7,500. Finance professor says committing crypo fraud is “easy”\nIt’s the mom and pop investors who are being hit the hardest by these scams, as many of them assume the crypto markets are regulated in a similar manner to traditional money markets. Natural supply and demand, in other words, isn’t necessarily at work when it comes to crypto trading, and it’s the price manipulators who are largely to blame, critics say.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also cracking down on crypto crimes , with its own investigation into rampant fraud with initial coin offerings, or ICOs, which are basically digital tokens that some up-and-coming companies offer to investors in exchange for their investments.\nBecause the concept of cryptos is still so new, regulators haven’t yet figured out how to properly keep tabs on which ones are real and which ones are fake. This is especially problematic with fly-by-night ICOs, many of which have defrauded investors of tens of millions of dollars.\nAnother problem is that many crypto trading platforms still aren’t registered with either the CFTC or the SEC, which means they could disappear in an instant, along with the money of everyone who used them to make an investment.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing, and wash trading,” says John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who studies manipulation, including that of digital coin markets. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nOne of the most well-known examples of this is a trader, or group of traders, widely known as “Spoofy” that allegedly placed orders as high as $1 million, only to not execute them, thus driving the price of crypto toward Spoofy’s desired target.\nRead Bitraped.com for more coverage of the coming Bitcoin collapse.\nSources for this article include: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethan huff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "naturalnews.com doj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T12:41:05.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6301ff426d2e4c20a6390ea695196a3ff1f75d29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUkEKSYP3F3Nw7zJpxcgT6uaYWvJvlgj.Lli7mkLnpCgL9_PneCvEu9PQJxPXG8iyYB0yLohXQnXnVdxludcO4X", "site_full": "networkurl.com", "site": "networkurl.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin options at cheapest levels in months – NetworkURL", "title_full": "Bitcoin options at cheapest levels in months – NetworkURL", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.698, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/networkurl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/0528_networkurl_default_960x720_003366.png?fit=960%2C720", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6301ff426d2e4c20a6390ea695196a3ff1f75d29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUkEKSYP3F3Nw7zJpxcgT6uaYWvJvlgj.Lli7mkLnpCgL9_PneCvEu9PQJxPXG8iyYB0yLohXQnXnVdxludcO4X", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin options at cheapest levels in months – NetworkURL", "text": "Monday, May 28, 2018 Network Technology 0\nBitcoin has retreated over 25% from its recent highs in early May, and the implied volatility of options on Deribit’s bitcoin options exchange has also decreased significantly over the same period.\nWith the consolidation of price in the low- to mid-$7000s, the prices of bitcoin options have fallen dramatically, giving buyers more favorable entry points. After trading close to 100% implied volatility in early May, the at-the-money options are currently trading 70%, which is close to the lowest level of the last several months.\nThe largest increases in open interest have been in the June 29 (29-06-18) 9000 calls and 8000 puts.\nWith implied volatility at the lower end of the historical range, buying options can be an extremely valuable tool to either take long or short directional positions or to hedge directional risk in already established cash/futures positions.\nTake a look at the bitcoin put options on Deribit as a useful tool to protect long positions, or to profit when the price of bitcoin goes lower. Put options give the buyer a defined level of risk – the loss is limited to the amount paid for the put. For many investors, this can be a better mechanism to take advantage of prices moving lower than taking outright short positions in bitcoin futures, with unlimited risk.\nWith Deribit’s BTC Index trading $7250, the market on the September 28 (28-09-18) $7000 call is $1350-1385 and the market on the September 28 (28-09-18) put is $1035-1055.\nThe width of the bid-ask spreads on Deribit continues to tighten, allowing buyers and sellers less slippage when entering a position. If you haven’t visited Deribit’s one-of-a-kind bitcoin options marketplace, now is the time.\nFull details at www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/05/28/bitcoin-options-at-cheapest-levels-in-months/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T23:24:15.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a4a5547e05bea1b3cb80c9cddfb20e977ba8c4ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxBtdS4VbO.9xkwhkPsrQ7W7BbOHb61C24flSyBGQJ_v9Mrr5swcylHmvMWNIYBwAddCxvpInotoT_Ss8kJlqfDHK4TVi1Xa8ANfu2Yj1rAyQ--", "site_full": "faucetfriend.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Faucet Friend: Scottish Hospital Launches Treatment for Bitcoin Trading Addicts", "title_full": "Faucet Friend: Scottish Hospital Launches Treatment for Bitcoin Trading Addicts", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.918, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a4a5547e05bea1b3cb80c9cddfb20e977ba8c4ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxBtdS4VbO.9xkwhkPsrQ7W7BbOHb61C24flSyBGQJ_v9Mrr5swcylHmvMWNIYBwAddCxvpInotoT_Ss8kJlqfDHK4TVi1Xa8ANfu2Yj1rAyQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Faucet Friend: Scottish Hospital Launches Treatment for Bitcoin Trading Addicts", "text": "Follow for updated Bitcoin and cryptocurrency faucet links. Follow our sister handle @DogecoinFaucet Free Bitcoin at http://goo.gl/HazDlI Pages Monday, May 28, 2018 Scottish Hospital Launches Treatment for Bitcoin Trading Addicts\nA hospital in the Scottish Borders, a council in Scotland next to the City of Edinburgh, is pioneering an addiction treatment for ‘cryptocurrency junkies.’\nCastle Craig Hospital has introduced a course of residential treatment for people suffering from the underlying issues of trading addiction in order to be able to quit the cryptocurrency market altogether if they want to. Cryptocurrency Trading Addicts Offered Treatment in Scotland\nThe trading of virtual currencies can induce behavioral addiction the same way online gambling does, according to experts that helped create the first course to treat the problem using techniques found in gambling addiction programmes.\nCryptocurrency traders can become obsessive to the point of following minute-by-minute fluctuations in prices. Chris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, finds many similarities between gambling and the cryptocurrency trading world.\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation .”\nThe gambling therapist may have inadvertently confused the terms ‘classic bubble’ with ‘volatility.’ The definition of a ‘speculative bubble’ refers to the trading of an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset’s intrinsic value. Volatility is measured by the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, which seems to be what Burn’s was referring to.\nTherapist Tony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, will lead some of the treatments at the rehabilitation center to help introduce a life structure for addicts.\n“Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem. I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realize that they’re not alone.”\nIt is unknown how many people in the world trade cryptocurrencies and how many of them day trade to the extent of being regarded as addicts. High-risk trading usually gives a kick and rush, especially for people with an innate psychological tendency toward compulsion and addiction. The nucleus accumbens is the pleasure center of the human brain and also responds to the thrill of trading. Featured image from Shutterstock.

It's exciting to be in this early stage of development before it can be fully commercialised\" he said.\n\"Attending Myriad has been invaluable as it allowed me to network with people who can help me progress and it's great to get some exposure for the Sunshine Coast Community.\nMaree Machin founder of tracTAG is another Sunshine Coast startup from the group, providing solutions for people who lose belongings like cameras to be reunited with their property using QR code identification linked with one's personal or business details.\n\"tracTAG is personal loss recovery technology powered by goodwill, making it second nature to do the right thing,\" she said.\n\"The 2018 Myriad festival was a fantastic opportunity for us.\n\"A key outcome was forming a Brisbane-based mentor relationship that will take shape this week and three new business connections which will support the next steps on our success trajectory - very exciting!\"\nMs Sullivan said the event provided Sunshine Coast attendees with a significant amount of meaningful networking and collaboration opportunities, access to innovation thought leaders presenting on developments in a number of fields and the opportunity to pitch their business ideas to potential investors.\n\"Attending the conference allowed the delegates the chance to come together as a local community and speak with hundreds of visitors at Myriad about the benefits of living and bringing innovative dreams to life on the Sunshine Coast,\" she said.\n\"Australian and international investors are hungry for the next exceptional person, project and even region to invest in and attending these events ensures our region is rightly placed among the best of the best.\" Bees, Bikes and Bitcoin - Sunshine Coast Entrepreneurs Shine at Myriad Festival (3) Founder of Symbiote Motorcycles Robert James with a picture of his prototype electric motorcycle Maree Machin with her innovation tracTAG to make reuniting lost items super efficient Sunshine Coast entrepreneur delegation at Myriad Festival 2018", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T03:31:26.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da0f7f692293f083d06bb4dcda6bc30ff4f5408b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGtWLt88TkBUCphB.aGK1U.9I9Hq_xkmInhjtlhZJf8FeVJ5ZPAF7pp5zuJph2Db.2OHVPvQBvbbk790HcWUzAbE-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Can Bitcoin Cash smart contracts perform loops with the existing OP codes?", "title_full": "Can Bitcoin Cash smart contracts perform loops with the existing OP codes? : btc", "published": "2018-05-28T02:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.051, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da0f7f692293f083d06bb4dcda6bc30ff4f5408b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGtWLt88TkBUCphB.aGK1U.9I9Hq_xkmInhjtlhZJf8FeVJ5ZPAF7pp5zuJph2Db.2OHVPvQBvbbk790HcWUzAbE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BitcoinIsTehFuture", "published": "2018-05-28T02:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can Bitcoin Cash smart contracts perform loops with the existing OP codes?", "text": "YouTuber “Ivan on Tech” said it cannot.
