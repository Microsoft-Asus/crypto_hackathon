A recently conducted research goes on to show the depths of this concerns and concludes that a billion-dollar cryptocurrency network could be brought down with a few million dollars, and a little technical work. Algorithms Tremendously Exposed\nAs per a blog post on May 22, 2018, Brazilian cryptocurrency researcher Husam Abboud demonstrated the fatal exposure of Ethereum Classic’s (ETC) blockchain algorithm to a 51 percent attack . Abboud estimated that a 51 percent attack could be conducted by an enterprising miner for as little as $1.5 million. A 51 percent attack allows the aggressor to ‘double spend,’ which could potentially cause havoc for exchanges.\nThe startling findings go on to show that simulations suggest an amount of $55 million could bankrupt the world’s 17th largest digital currency (by market cap ). In return, the attacker could obtain a $1 billion profit by short selling ETC with 35x margin, assuming a price drop of 50 percent.\nAs stated, the protocol’s proof-of-work algorithm – same as Bitcoin and Ethereum – is inherently vulnerable to network attacks, which can effectively put an entire network in jeopardy with minimal resources, as there are no barriers to entry regarding capital costs.\nAbboud said:\n“Any miner who contributes as little as 2.5 percent of Ethereum Nethash can simply switch to mining Ethereum Classic and control more than 51 percent of hashing power of Ethereum Classic network.”\nFor purposes of his research, Abboud deployed a Rindex v2.0 model , moving away from the traditional model for calculating the costs of a 51 percent attack, which include the costs of acquiring mining equipment and electricity. However, the Rindex focuses only on hashpower leasing, ignoring the redundant equipment costs for PoW blockchains. Several Cryptocurrencies Face 51 Percent Attack Threat\nAbboud used the same model to calculate the costs for executing a similar attack on other cryptocurrency blockchains. The researcher calculated an amount of $2 million for performing a network attack on Bitcoin Cash , the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency valued at $16 billion, and a paltry $300,000 for Bitcoin Gold , a Bitcoin hard fork with a value of $750 million.\nThe estimate for the cost of a 51 percent attack on Monero is suggested to be inflated, as Nvidia GTC 1080 mining cards are not as powerful as Vega mining cards. Once taken into account, it would make Monero the fifth most expensive blockchain network to attack and cuts the cost of 51 percent attack by two thirds, according to one Monero subreddit user. Cost of launching network attacks on major cryptocurrencies. Source: Medium\nIn theory, the attacks are present as long as the core developers of the victim blockchain deploy a patch, or as long as the attacks remain profitable for the attacker to continue.\nThe researcher states that Bitcoin ’s creator did not consider a 51 percent as a major threat while developing the protocol, as it would ultimately lead to a lower market value for the digital currency, making it highly unprofitable and disadvantageous for them.\nHowever, the launch of bitcoin futures and margin trading has created an environment where traders can profit from short-selling the plunging market, making this assumption false.\nAbboud noted:\n“We have major exchanges with a lot of liquidity which allow you to short-sell with a trading margin from 2.2 to up to 100 times. It’s just becoming easier everyday and the market is more liquid for opportunities where you can benefit from price decline.” Crypto51 Highlights Theoretical Costs of an Attack\nA website known as Crypto51 has also emerged, which highlights the theoretical cost of a 51 percent attack on each network. The data shows that the one-hour attack cost for Bytecoin is $981 despite the altcoin having a market cap exceeding one billion.\nMoreover, Bitcoin Private has a similar figure for the one-hour attack cost, but with the coin not present on many exchanges and the lack of options to short the altcoin, the only incentive to attack coins like these would be “malice” according to Jackson Palmer, a former Dogecoin developer. Source: Crypto51\nThe NiceHash-able column shows how much computing power could be rented from NiceHash to conduct such an attack. So for a cryptocurrency with 100 percent or more in the NiceHash-able column, the capital costs of a 51 percent attack are eliminated as the hashrate needed can be entirely rented out.\nBitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr reckons that 51 percent attacks are feasible for altcoins like bitcoin gold and bitcoin cash, and maybe even bitcoin if “Bitmain wanted to”: PSA: if someone has a full >50% hashrate for your cryptocurrency, there is NO NUMBER of blocks where confirmation is safe. Once you get beyond 50%, you can reverse an unlimited number of blocks!\n(What happened to BGold, CAN be done to BCH or maybe Bitcoin if Bitmain wants to…)\n— Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) May 25, 2018\nWhile attacks on some cryptocurrencies seem trivial regarding finance, it is the technical know how that is the biggest obstacle to translating these theoretical attacks into actual double spends on these blockchains. Sticking with the Heavyweights\nThe recent findings highlight how index-tracking the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization could become devastating, given that Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Litecoin are the most robust and hardest to attack, while others in the top ten, 15, or 20 are relatively easier to attack.\nA takeaway from these results for investors is to stick with coins that are dominant for their respective hashing algorithms; i.e., bitcoin for SHA-256, Ethereum for ETHhash, and Litecoin for Scrypt.\nA possible solution for such concerns – which are only stipulated to grow as the networks increase – is to introduce newer consensus protocols to blockchains, primarily moving wholly away from a PoW consensus to other types, such as proof-of-stake.\nVarious suggestions have been buoyed, ranging from increasing the number of required confirmations, upgrading the hashing algorithms to make the networks ASIC-resistant, and sharding. A Blitz Against Low-security Blockchains Incoming?\nBut with 51 percent attacks emerging on networks like Bitcoin Gold and Verge , many commentators believe it is just a matter of time before the weaker cryptocurrencies are exposed to attack. It could be the case that hackers are just testing the waters and will gear up toward more lucrative attacks on larger cryptocurrencies in the near future.\nWhile attacking a cryptocurrency network in of itself is not illegal, shorting the said crypto and conducting a 51 percent attack is, which may deter some attackers.\nInterestingly, after cryptocurrency markets were overstretched regarding valuation during early 2018, the rest of the year could well see attacks on smaller cryptocurrencies and weed out the good from the bad.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/999974330191753216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1001193393962143744"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abboud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "husam abboud", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blitz against low-security blockchains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:41:51.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fa93c70c20426e8eddc45dcbfd5aa64e1d86fe4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhGy0sxquTHxzH1NWiSHcZhY-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-30T17:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fa93c70c20426e8eddc45dcbfd5aa64e1d86fe4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhGy0sxquTHxzH1NWiSHcZhY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-30T17:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 30, 2018 NEWS Everything Green as Price of Bitcoin Approaches $7500 The Merkle After reaching initials lows earlier in the day of just above US$7,000, Bitcoin saw a huge jump to above $7,400, and is continually inching higher.

It is interesting that yesterday, the Bitcoin digital currency market moved to growth after almost three weeks of non-stop decline, bitcoin showed an impressive gain rebounding from local lows around the round mark of $7000 and rose to $7500.\nFor the equity markets as well as for the European currency, the day was extremely negative. The political crisis in Italy has exerted strong pressure on the euro. Italian bonds were sold out on the background of risks for the third largest economy in Europe, and the Italian version of Brexit.\nGlobal stock markets were under strong pressure, and the single European currency fell to the level of seven-month lows. Over the course of the trading day, safe haven assets such as gold, US bonds and... Bitcoin were in demand.\nOnce again we are witnessing a curious situation when the decline in equity markets, the high volatility of the foreign exchange market and just high economic and political risks dramatically increase the demand for digital decentralized currencies.\nThe intrigue with the fate of Italy in the EU is just beginning to unfold, in the coming months, the country will be forming regular elections. In addition, this means medium-term risks for the euro and medium-term support for the Bitcoin market. However, other digital currencies, such as Ether and Bitcoin cash also traded positively.\nTechnically, the nearest local resistance is in the $7570 zone. More significant and stronger resistance is located at $7690-$7740.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:03:13.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8529419e46e0bf39e8c7a1e841263c7454ea70bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6X71ao3RyXwKY2spfCZloVZgFgNYpLjyh6E1dtVElH5jDyNZ_W9rSg1pdmIntQ9NpGy1x3msQ_RPw_VruxjTc2KYcR4ftY.smVyHN2galBhhCPDi4aIPu7sRAA_7tkB0-", "site_full": "bitco.in", "site": "bitco.in", "site_section": "https://bitco.in/forum/forums/bitcoin-protocol.4/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Protocol | Bitcoin Forum", "title": "CryptoTab | Earn Bitcoins while using your browser (Google Chrome)", "title_full": "CryptoTab | Earn Bitcoins while using your browser (Google Chrome) | Bitcoin Forum", "published": "2018-05-30T17:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitco.in/img/opengraph.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8529419e46e0bf39e8c7a1e841263c7454ea70bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6X71ao3RyXwKY2spfCZloVZgFgNYpLjyh6E1dtVElH5jDyNZ_W9rSg1pdmIntQ9NpGy1x3msQ_RPw_VruxjTc2KYcR4ftY.smVyHN2galBhhCPDi4aIPu7sRAA_7tkB0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joji Mathew", "published": "2018-05-30T17:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "CryptoTab | Earn Bitcoins while using your browser (Google Chrome)", "text": "Have you heard of the bitcoin mining plug-in?

The eosDAC holders should move their assets to the EOS mainnet before 06:59:59(GMT+8) June 2nd 2018, or else they may lose their eosDAC.\nTo ensure you get your eosDAC on the EOS mainnet as scheduled, we hereby announce that Bitpie supports the EOS public key mapping.( http://docs.bitpie.com/en/latest/commonContract/index.html )\nTwo ways to get your eosDAC on the EOS mainnet:\n1. Keep your eosDAC (ERC20 tokens) on an Ethereum address of Bitpie that has been registered through the EOS Crowdsale contract before 06:59:59(GMT+8) June 2nd 2018. (Click for Details) ( http://docs.bitpie.com/en/latest/commonContract/index.html )\n2. If you keep your eosDAC (ERC20 tokens) on an unregistered Ethereum and transfer it afterwards, you can still get your eosDAC assets based on the EOS mainnet  It may take some time to get a smooth process in place and the eosDAC website will later give detailed steps.\nThe Bitpie team advises everyone to map the public address.\nAttention: If you keep your eosDAC on an exchange or centralized platform that does not support the migration to the EOS mainnet, you will definitely lose your eosDAC. ( https://steemit.com/eos/@eosdac/how-eosdac-tokens-will-move-to-the-eos-chain ) for more information on how to get your eosDAC on the EOS Mainnet\nAttention: For users who have EOS in Bitpie Wallet, please register by yourself before 06:59:59(GMT+8) June 2nd 2018.\nERC20 token is kind of a temporary EOS, so you will not get the real EOS on the EOS mainnet without mapping. We detected that there are currently a number of Bitpie users who havent done mapping, among which many have several millions of EOS assets. We have informed our users through various channels as we can, and please forward this message to others to make sure they register as scheduled.\nFor users who keep EOS in Bitpie Wallet, please register by yourself before 06:59:59(GMT+8) June 2nd 2018. Bitpie Wallet does not have its users private key so we cannot do mapping on behalf of you.

The FBI was puzzled about the elusive yet polite robber who approached tellers saying, \"Put the money on the counter…\" and walked away with thousands in cash in a clear plastic bag.\nRichard Stanley Up On Game Upon his sudden arrest, the shocking truth was revealed when this criminal mastermind who outwitted authorities turned out to be an eighteen-year-old white kid from the Hispanic gang-filled streets.\nWith his \"degree in business\" from one of California's finest \"correctional\" institutions where he was given a free ride in their eight-year program (with a seven-month sabbatical in solitude), he's graduated from robbing banks to stacking Bitcoin as a legit entrepreneur and shares a vital message: People can change.\nToday, Stanley is a successful entrepreneur, in business in the adult marketing world, and a daytrader in cryptocurrency.\nStanley did his time in Donovan, a rough Southern California prison, where he hustled to stay up on game and where he experienced the real Orange Is the New Black .\nIn his memoir UP ON GAME: From Robbing Banks to Stacking Bitcoin, Stanley recounts a tumultuous childhood of growing up in the dangerous neighborhood of Otay, surrounded by gangs, drugs, violence, and poverty.\nStanley illustrates what daily life was like in jail, his interactions with other inmates, and the dark side of the correctional officers whose jobs are to maintain law and order. After his release, Stanley learned the ropes of—and became successful in—adult online marketing with exotic dancers and professional escorts where he was introduced to Bitcoin as a form of payment.\nHe schooled himself in daytrading of cryptocurrency. Although he doesn't say he's an expert, he's moved up in the world to swanky Newport Beach where he lives a life far from the hellhole of the two-man prison cell.\n\"Brutally honest and shockingly real,\" said one reviewer. \" Orange Is the New Black has nothing on this memoir,\" said another.\nMEDIA : Contact for media review copies of the book (hard copy or ebook via Amazon), photos, to schedule an interview or speaking opportunity.\nSandra Wendel\n(402) 516-2412\n196113@email4pr.com\nREAD the first chapter and for more info: www.UpOnGameBook.com\nView original content with multimedia: releases/bank-robber-no-longer-needs-banks-turns-to-stacking-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrency-300656238.html\nSOURCE Richard Stanley", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.upongamebook.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1732141711"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard stanley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neb.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T15:45:55.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "633ce2f4a6d96ba17c889017c2d1f486d9bd64ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4332VnImjCdT33MieeRnve8DunZv8QvbAW1Xd2X3MZVPktpL308DbuLTzAj5nr8NHdSxsCJnfVSGozyuTY.qU1d0WDpb6o3oED0yPsoMNkNAVN2E_HBZuHmpoTXrSdLM3NSLiZDpfCmkzZNMt_sj5E6euT1hMgZ9cs7eornZ558MLC0_gWVvlfwMpKwrc4PM-", "site_full": "www.slideshare.net", "site": "slideshare.net", "site_section": "http://www.slideshare.net/rss/latest", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "social"], "section_title": "Recently Uploaded Slideshows", "title": "Read Cryptocurrency: 5 Expert Secrets For Beginners: Investing Into Bitcoin, Ethereum - Anthony Tu PDF Free Download", "title_full": "Read Cryptocurrency: 5 Expert Secrets For Beginners: Investing Into Bitcoin, Ethereum - Anthony Tu PDF Free Download", "published": "2018-05-30T16:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.slidesharecdn.com/ss_thumbnails/readcryptocurrency5expert-180530133904-thumbnail-4.jpg?cb=1527687563", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "633ce2f4a6d96ba17c889017c2d1f486d9bd64ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4332VnImjCdT33MieeRnve8DunZv8QvbAW1Xd2X3MZVPktpL308DbuLTzAj5nr8NHdSxsCJnfVSGozyuTY.qU1d0WDpb6o3oED0yPsoMNkNAVN2E_HBZuHmpoTXrSdLM3NSLiZDpfCmkzZNMt_sj5E6euT1hMgZ9cs7eornZ558MLC0_gWVvlfwMpKwrc4PM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "voxodevic4@slideshare.net(voxodevic4)", "published": "2018-05-30T16:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Read Cryptocurrency: 5 Expert Secrets For Beginners: Investing Into Bitcoin, Ethereum - Anthony Tu PDF Free Download", "text": "Published on May 30, 2018 Are you new to cryptocurrencies?

2018, 07:37:50 AM If blockchain technology improves, the capacity of the block is enlarged. Solve the problem of delayed transactions, and more and more people involved. Then five years after the Bitcoin will be what price?\nBitcoin is really good for the people nowadays they start accepting bitcoin and they are really want it for the good fr the business , Since bitcoin growth the price range of $10000-15000$ dollars how ever there are still problem that people keep destroying people no matter how good bitcoin is , More company are now using bitcoin not only for the good but because they knew the better way of using bitcoin , Bank as well is now legalize using bitcoin even other crypto currencies that might help other people in there business the price of the price should be 30000$ dollars or more in the year of 2023..\nThe Bitcoin price prediction is not easy and most of the predictions made up till now are not accurate and most of the predictions became invalid as the market response resulted in a different way. The most precise and accurate value can be made after the analyses of experts by introducing graphs and other actions of the market factors. The future market will be good as the average rate of market price is increasing.\nIf we look 5 years back we would see that very small number of people invested in bitcoin because no awareness about cryptocurrency world and the investment cap was too very low as so was the price, but now there is huge number of investors in this world and in increasing with every passing day. So it is expected that after 5 years bitcoin will cover local market and the price will be triple from that of today.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T14:58:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0706e2003bb509fbab6c92a445fac31bdc6e9484", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQmynwE3RF2zBGhBTm00h8xoryCVmH3hlizhfs2ebZZA8ljtvhll_PLG1RqykyH1IZXg4DIfav59HAsq.ge.WHm", "site_full": "agorafinancial.com", "site": "agorafinancial.com", "site_section": "http://agorafinancial.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Agora Financial", "title": "The Great Bitcoin Crash: What Happens Next?", "title_full": "The Great Bitcoin Crash: What Happens Next?", "published": "2018-05-30T16:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d2qbakl2bl4uob.cloudfront.net/headshot/editor-greg-guenthner-new.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 36503, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0706e2003bb509fbab6c92a445fac31bdc6e9484", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQmynwE3RF2zBGhBTm00h8xoryCVmH3hlizhfs2ebZZA8ljtvhll_PLG1RqykyH1IZXg4DIfav59HAsq.ge.WHm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Greg Guenthner", "published": "2018-05-30T16:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Great Bitcoin Crash: What Happens Next?", "text": "Our first forecast takes an in-depth look at a new frontier in the world of trading: cryptocurrencies.

(OTC: EPAZ ), a leading provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that the ZenaPay Blockchain Bitcoin wallet will release its next version in June. This release supports Bitcoin Cash and Segwit on Play store. ZenaPay already supports Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Epazz believes Segwit support will increase our user base.\nThe ZenaPay Wallet app will continue to adopt multiple cryptocurrencies on a single Blockchain Wallet. ZenaPay offers a quick, simple, complete transaction. ZenaPay will include features from our other blockchain apps.\nEpazz CEO Shaun Passley, PhD, stated, “We continue to expand and improve ZenaPay, which is being a more competitive solution with each new version.”\nOur user base is the key to growing ZenaPay’s business.

According to the Korean news agency Yonhap, this decision comes after the South Korean Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that cryptocurrencies could be viewed as land with value which may be subject to forfeiture in criminal cases. As of press time, the almost 200 bitcoins are worth a bit over $1.4 million, based on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The Supreme Court order backs up a former ruling in the appeal that overturned a lower court’s decision to reject a prosecutor’s request to forfeit the offender’s cryptocurrency assets.\nAccording to Yonhap, the lower court denied the petition based on the argument that cryptocurrencies only exist electronically and don’t have any physical form. Nevertheless, the court of appeal later found that cryptocurrency can be viewed as a profit earned from trade in goods. It remains unclear, but as to how a South Korean authority would handle the forfeited digital assets. Nevertheless, today’s decision marks a legal note mention, because there are ongoing criminal cases in South Korean between cryptocurrencies. As mentioned previously by CoinDesk, prosecutors from the Incheon district filed a lawsuit in December 2017 contrary to a company named Max Mining and 21 suspects in an alleged $250 million cryptocurrency mining fraud.\nMost lately, Prosecutors in Seoul also have raided several neighborhood cryptocurrency exchanges over suspicions of fraud and embezzlement, reportedly seizing assets for further investigation.

The treatment is said to help patients deal with crypto trading addiction and more importantly teach them how to live without trading. Hospital Lends a Hand\nReports have shown that like online gambling, cryptocurrency traders can just as well become chronic addicts to digital currency trading like bitcoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies as many are consumed with the tracking of every price move in the market.\nCritically considering the situation, it should be noted that it’s not just cryptocurrency traders who are locked up in this dilemma. There are also those who trade stocks and follow foreign exchange markets in a similar situation. The reason behind pinpointing cryptocurrency traders, however, is directly related to the market’s high volatility, making trading cryptocurrencies way riskier than trading in any other markets.\nChris Burn, a therapist for gambling patients for many years at the hospital, said:\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin has been heavily traded, and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nTo adequately address this situation, Castle Craig Hospital, which currently runs programs for drugs and alcohol addicts, has also set up this course for cryptocurrency addicts. The hospital happens to be the first to offer such program to help locals and also uses the same therapeutic methods with those who are addicted to gambling. Crypto Addiction: “Rare as Hens’ Teeth”\nThough the hospital has no exact figure of those who might be suffering from this kind of situation, it reports that there are roughly 13 million people world over who are actively trading cryptocurrencies.\nTony Marini, a former drug and gambling addict, will also hold therapy sessions with the patients. Being someone who could relate to their situation, he said it was vital to have life structure plans introduced to these addicts.\n“Having been through it myself, my experience of addiction gives me insight and empathy towards others who have the same problem. I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in.”\nAs cryptocurrency traders are on the rise, the need for them to keep their emotions in check is critical so as they can avoid visits to generous hospitals like Castle Craig.\nIs there a need of such therapy sessions for crypto trading addicts?

It’s a sign of uncertainty in the market, as several technological hurdles are tantalizingly close to market, but still not at the finish line.\nAt mid-morning, bitcoin held at the $7,300 mark, a less than zero percentage point move down in the last 24 hours. Others in the top ten coins were in the same range, with most down incrementally. There was also wide price variances, depending on which exchange you were monitoring, indicating some parts of the world were more optimistic on a rally than others.\nBitcoin market highlights for the 24 hours ending May 30, 2018 at 1:00 pm U.S. Eastern Time\nThe highest price seen was $8,577.92 on the Simex exchange at 2:25 pm yesterday. Simex saw $36,613,000 of bitcoin change hands.\nThe lowest price seen was $6,962.17 on Simex’s exchange at 2:01 pm yesterday.

However, most of us do not understand how it actually functions and how it can make us a profit. For beginners analysing price charts and understanding trading terms from the financial world can be a harrowing experience so we take a look at how Bitcoin became expensive over the years.\nDiscovered in 2009, Bitcoin was not traded on any exchange . The first recorded price was in 2010. Technically, Bitcoin was worth $0 in 2009 , during its very first year of existence. The price of Bitcoins never touched the $1 mark in 2010 and the highest price for the year was just $0.39.\nAfter two long years, Bitcoin touched the dollar on the Mt Gox exchange in February 2011. Bitcoin reached the top of its first ‘bubble’ at $31, followed by the first major price drop. It dropped to a serious low of $2 by December 2011, which eroded more than 95% of its value. A lot of opinions on improving the Bitcoin came up but they were never implemented.\nAltcoins came into existence later when some people from the community started their own projects. Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. It is in this period that the value of Bitcoin started rising at a consistent level from $2 in December 2011 to an all-time high of $1,242 in November 2013 and it fell to $750 by November 2016. The rise and fall has been typical of Bitcoin’s volatility.\n2017 was, however, the year when everything changed for Bitcoins in terms of price movement. It rose from $900 in January 2017 to $20,000 by December 2017 and attracted a plethora of followers. Alongside Bitcoin, the price of Ethereum rose by over 9000% in 2017. The market valuation of Ethereum recorded a 64-fold increase from $700 million to $45 billion, officially becoming the best performing cryptocurrency in the market year-to-date.\n2018 has brought with it a barrage of questions about the longevity of cryptocurrencies and their usage. Governments across the countries will definitely try to regulate their use and the exchanges, which is sure to affect the price movements in either direction.\nYou can visit the original article here on btcwires .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.btcwires.com/how-bitcoin-became-expensive/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "muray peter bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T20:25:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6112cdc5136f70323b695d6e3c472a9fb2ec6d72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hQ0jFPMhvIa4r4KiV3f1.GvPc61nTx8bpVKGhaZt3BegCN54HEh3fQmHojD7SWcEiMIFNR0gfVg--", "site_full": "www.homepokergames.com", "site": "homepokergames.com", "site_section": "http://www.homepokergames.com/vbforum/forumdisplay.php?f=36", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Forum Home - HomePokerGames Poker Forum", "title": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS", "title_full": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS - HomePokerGames Poker Forum", "published": "2018-05-30T15:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6112cdc5136f70323b695d6e3c472a9fb2ec6d72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hQ0jFPMhvIa4r4KiV3f1.GvPc61nTx8bpVKGhaZt3BegCN54HEh3fQmHojD7SWcEiMIFNR0gfVg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Helenwog", "published": "2018-05-30T15:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW perfect soft for breaking any Captcha 1.

If Bitcoin is not the first digital currency, I don't think that we can still say this. Bitcoin has the highest price but it don't have great features like fast transaction and anonymity like the other crypto currency has. Bitcoin will be just above other currencies in terms of its price.\nWould have to strongly disagree there... if you can only see this first-mover advantage, then you perhaps missed out a lot on the whole idea behind Bitcoin, as described subtly in the white paper, as pointed out by many early and current developers, some active on this forum.\nLet us forget about price and volume, which is really all that contributes to this market dominance. And which is why even if this \"dominance\" drops to 5% or less, it will mean little about true dominance - the confidence and preference of its users against any other alternative.\nStrip away the cosmetic superiority of altcoin's technology and Bitcoin is still unrivalled in terms of security and robustness. Bitcoin is dominant. And that dominance isn't being regained or lost, it just grows with each day, with each challenge overcome, with each alt propped up as the next pretender.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T17:03:09.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78ff7d703c2a543fb9b65a955bde8302316829db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4eGfGrT7Ky3wRUItZ_TXIaoXaG61T7LHQEfBNpR7eW.CO2eU1IXZTvg--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Beaches and Bitcoins: Remarks by SEC Commissioner Peirce", "title_full": "Beaches and Bitcoins: Remarks by SEC Commissioner Peirce", "published": "2018-05-30T15:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78ff7d703c2a543fb9b65a955bde8302316829db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4eGfGrT7Ky3wRUItZ_TXIaoXaG61T7LHQEfBNpR7eW.CO2eU1IXZTvg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-30T15:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Beaches and Bitcoins: Remarks by SEC Commissioner Peirce", "text": "Beaches and Bitcoins: Remarks by SEC Commissioner Peirce\nBeaches and Bitcoins: Remarks by SEC Commissioner Peirce Lexology Session on ICOs and bitcoins allotted at SEC Investor Conference BCFocus Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peirce", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T15:48:29.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7e12c4d3cebe3069641c20ada761e0a78c8a71d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9TQrY8xdacywdPxYHTOJVVI.UvvYOT3YJgHT6YPoDqiUmvS5iQexLrn2Y0VER6fIFBbANtKos35KVTml0LRz7a881i6DvgH9dn.W3rLYDhKHTAfVBEBHpk8gdFKuhH8ATw7YPGVzjGt9bdcIn_j2v6WOTx6UNB2QEJcnb0UEBI.g--", "site_full": "www.cafedealtura.com", "site": "cafedealtura.com", "site_section": "http://www.cafedealtura.com/feed/rss/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Café de Altura", "title": "Motrin 200 mg günstig kaufen – BitCoin payment Is Accepted – Canadian Family Pharmacy", "title_full": "Motrin 200 mg günstig kaufen – BitCoin payment Is Accepted – Canadian Family Pharmacy", "published": "2018-05-30T15:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b7e12c4d3cebe3069641c20ada761e0a78c8a71d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9TQrY8xdacywdPxYHTOJVVI.UvvYOT3YJgHT6YPoDqiUmvS5iQexLrn2Y0VER6fIFBbANtKos35KVTml0LRz7a881i6DvgH9dn.W3rLYDhKHTAfVBEBHpk8gdFKuhH8ATw7YPGVzjGt9bdcIn_j2v6WOTx6UNB2QEJcnb0UEBI.g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bonzopoe", "published": "2018-05-30T15:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Motrin 200 mg günstig kaufen – BitCoin payment Is Accepted – Canadian Family Pharmacy", "text": "Café de Altura Comunicación, Motrin 200 mg günstig kaufen – BitCoin payment Is Accepted – Canadian Family Pharmacy Motrin 200 mg günstig kaufen – BitCoin payment Is Accepted – Canadian Family Pharmacy Motrin 200 mg günstig kaufen Generic Motrin Motrin kaufen günstig.

Meticulous and calculating, Richard Stanley evaded capture with each additional bank heist. The FBI was puzzled about the elusive yet polite robber who approached tellers saying, \"Put the money on the counter…\" and walked away with thousands in cash in a clear plastic bag. Upon his sudden arrest, the shocking truth was revealed when this criminal mastermind who outwitted authorities turned out to be an eighteen-year-old white kid from the Hispanic gang-filled streets. With his \"degree in business\" from one of California's finest \"correctional\" institutions where he was given a free ride in their eight-year program (with a seven-month sabbatical in solitude), he's graduated from robbing banks to stacking Bitcoin as a legit entrepreneur and shares a vital message: People can change. Today, Stanley is a successful entrepreneur, in business in the adult marketing world, and a daytrader in cryptocurrency. Stanley did his time in Donovan, a rough Southern California prison, where he hustled to stay up on game and where he experienced the real Orange Is the New Black . In his memoir UP ON GAME: From Robbing Banks to Stacking Bitcoin, Stanley recounts a tumultuous childhood of growing up in the dangerous neighborhood of Otay, surrounded by gangs, drugs, violence, and poverty. Stanley illustrates what daily life was like in jail, his interactions with other inmates, and the dark side of the correctional officers whose jobs are to maintain law and order. After his release, Stanley learned the ropes of—and became successful in—adult online marketing with exotic dancers and professional escorts where he was introduced to Bitcoin as a form of payment. He schooled himself in daytrading of cryptocurrency. Although he doesn't say he's an expert, he's moved up in the world to swanky Newport Beach where he lives a life far from the hellhole of the two-man prison cell. \"Brutally honest and shockingly real,\" said one reviewer. \" Orange Is the New Black has nothing on this memoir,\" said another.

ICO Tokens and Not Bitcoin\nOn April 5 th , SEC CEO Jay Clayton , had given a speech at Princeton University regarding ICOs and cryptocurrencies. Clayton believes that, several ICOs and crypto assets so far held or being held can be categorized as securities. He was questioned whether ICOs generate fraudulent instances, he said “absolutely not” . He believes that the regulations issued by SEC have a positive impact on crypto space. Moreover, the SEC regulations would assist in preventing bad actors and enabling authentic projects to thrive. US Securities and Exchange Commission CEO Jay Clayton.\nFurther, Clayton adds saying that SEC was looking forward on ICO tokens, not Bitcoin. In the meantime, the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin that, “extremely comfortable” that Ethereum is not a qualified security asset.\nHowever, many crypto community members were stating that SEC is perceiving cryptocurrencies as securities. It means that tokens concerning underlying asset will be treating as securities as opposed to being utility tokens.\nInitially, the SEC Investor Conference is focusing classifications on crypto tokens and ICO investment process. Therefore, the session on Bitcoin and ICOs may simplify the government authorities on crypto communities and legal matters.

With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. One of the busiest metros in Europe, over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway daily.\nThe company published an update on its website where it provides a detailed description of the location of each ATM. The new machines were installed in Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka and Hlavní Nádraží.\nAccording to Coinatmradar.com , the Czech Republic now has 46 bitcoin ATMs, with 34 of these ATMs concentrated in Prague. Of the 3,138 bitcoin ATMs manufactured globally, GENERAL BYTES has now manufactured 27.63 percent, with their machines installed in every major city in the world . Their ATMs support the purchase and sale of bitcoin, litecoin, dash and monero.\nIn conversation with Bitcoin Magazine , Martijn Wismeijer, Marketing Manager of GENERAL BYTES, described his company as “veterans in the blockchain space who have been there from the very beginning.” He pointed out that the company was “the first to introduce sending cryptos via email” as well as the creator of the first BATMOne models.\nWismeijer said his company offers “seven different cryptocurrency ATM models as well as a point-of-sale (POS) called CortexPay.” These crypto ATM models are all based on a similar code base; however, he also explained that, even though the machines were similar in code base, there are some minor differences in the hardware design and a range of additional features. These features include the capacity of the acceptor, dispenser and recycler combinations as well as the acceptance of multi-currencies on a single machine.\nThe ATM models are called the BATM series ATM. BATM is the name of the platform created by GENERAL BYTES for producing the ATMs. These machines are further divided into the BATMTwo series (one-way and two-way options) and the BATMThree series ATMs.\nAccording to Wismeijer, the one-way BATMTwo series ATMs were chosen for this project as there are already many two-way ATM locations in and around the city. “Installing the one-way BATMTwo models allows GENERAL BYTES to showcase the possibilities that abound for clients brand-wise with the optional BATMStand which transforms the machines into a free-standing unit.”\nWismeijer explained that clients can either run and maintain their servers or they can use the company’s cloud-hosted server, which allows operators to run their software on GENERAL BYTES’ server for a small fee. Cryptocurrencies in Prague\nPrague has been a growing hotspot for everything crypto for a while now.\nThere hasn’t been much definition or regulation of virtual currencies in the Czech Republic, and the government is seen to be somewhat friendly to cryptos.\nThe subject matter is, however, being discussed in government circles as the Czech National Bank published a paper titled “Don’t be Afraid of Bitcoin,” where it declared that “Prague is home to a strong community of cryptocurrency users,” while playing down the potential threats of cryptocurrency to the traditional monetary system.\nLast year, Alza became the “first large European retailer” to add cryptocurrency payments to its website and install two bitcoin ATMs in its showroom locations in Prague and Bratislava.\nThe hip and trendy Holešovice district in Prague is also home to the famous Cryptoanarchy Institute, Paralelni Polis , an organization that educates the public on cryptocurrencies. Prague is also home to a couple of crypto startups like SatoshiLabs (makers of Trezor hardware wallets).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinatmradar.com/manufacturer/5/general-bytes-bitcoin-atm-producer/", "https://coinatmradar.com/charts/", "https://satoshilabs.com/", "https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/o-nas/en/", "https://www.generalbytes.com/bitcoins-at-alza/", "https://services.generalbytes.com/cs/", "https://www.lidovky.cz/nejvytizenejsi-stanici-je-i-p-pavlova-d88-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A081212_164914_ln_praha_hel", "https://coinatmradar.com/country/57/bitcoin-atm-czech-republic/", "https://www.cnb.cz/en/public/media_service/interviews/media_2017/cl_17_170731_hampl_omfif.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martijn wismeijer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hlavní nádraží", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skalka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague metro", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florenc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "můstek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dejvická", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nádraží veleslavín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zličín", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pankrác", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T00:29:40.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f3c6fe8ad531ad201a3ffacc268aedf3457ab104", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIt4BtCAHrZqw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nThat's the thing you don't want in an investment, volatility.

Author: share A look at recent price action in cryptocurrencies\nSince the middle of May and ever since the price of Bitcoin did not test the major resistance level of $10,000 the crypto market has been on a steady downward spiral. The large majority of tokens and small cryptos have been following the price trends of both bitcoin and Ethereum.\nOn both the up and down of it, the price movements of tokens have gotten more intense, recording bigger drops than bitcoin during the minor corrections of the market. On May 25, it seemed that the Bitcoin price would most probably fall under the $6,000 level and test $5,500 to $5,700 in terms of a long-term support level.\nIn prior reports, there have been observations that the $6,500 mark is an important resistance level which Bitcoin has been able to gain momentum from since the early part of January. Here we take a lot at the markets so that you have the info you need to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies .\nBitcoin :\nEarlier in the day, May 30, the price of Bitcoin rose to $7,512, having bounced off a recent low for the month. Despite the newly formed confidence in the market, it is still too soon to tell of the start of the beginning of a new bull market.\nEthereum :\nThere were significant falls in ETH price below the $590 level against the US Dollar. The price fell sharply and broke several vital supports such as $560, $545 and $540 respectively. It tested the $500-510 support area where the buyers finally appeared. However, the price is now trading above the $555 pivot level and the 100-hourly simple moving average, at $569.\nLitecoin :\nIn the previous week, Litecoin to US Dollar was trading above the price of $100 all week. The price of Litecoin has a bearish tendency - the asset fell from the high of $138.49 to the low of $120.83. On May 23rd the price of Litecoin had a bearish breakout that even broke the support level at $130.\nIt was assumed that if the price broke the support level at $130, the asset would fall to the low of $115. At moment, Litecoin is trading at $121.7 as at the time of writing.\nRipple : There was no saving grace for buyers as Ripple price fell further near the $0.5400 level against the US Dollar. The price settled at under the $0.5900 and $0.5800 support levels, resulting in a big move downwards. It even traded further below the $0.5500 level and a low was formed at $0.5453. At the moment, the price is slowly recovering and moving to bigger levels above $0.6133.

Despite the sluggishness in the crypto market in the last few months, the number of Bitcoin continued accelerating at the pace of 6 installations daily and as of now there are 3,000 Bitcoin ATM’s across the world. Similarly, South African company, Vendibit re-opened and rebranded its very first cryptocurrency VTM which is also called as BTM.\nSouth Africa Joins Digital Finance Revolution\nThis cryptocurrency ATM has been upgraded with Vendibit blockchain technology. Launched initially in 2014 to offer Bitcoin purchases, the machine now, will be available to everyone and shows how easy it is to purchase all types of virtual currencies including Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and South African Rand (ZAR). Vendibit is known for providing services related to machine deployment including installation, software, hardware, support, and management.\nAccording to its senior blockchain consultant, Daniel Cappiello, there will be a brisk uptake in cryptocurrency as South Africa joins the global revolution in digital finance. It will bring a major change across the world as anyone with a Smartphone can carry out digital currency transactions with ease. Cappiello has overseen several worldwide projects and deployed numerous VTM’s across Europe, Asia, and America since 2014.\n3,125 Bitcoin Vending Machines Installed Worldwide\nAccording to the latest report, 3,125 Bitcoin vending machines have been installed worldwide. The pace of installation of vending machines has increased rapidly because 15 months ago at the start of 2017, there were only 1,000 Bitcoin ATMs. But now every day more than 6 ATMs are installed. Importantly, it also indicates that the slump in the cryptocurrency during the first quarter of this year has not in any way affected the rate of installation of ATM. Rather; the market has grown at a huge speed in the past three years with the prices rising as never before.\nThe increase in the speed of installation of Bitcoin vending machines indicates that the demand for both buying and selling the cryptocurrency has increased. Secondly, despite the volatility in the prices of digital currencies, the business model of the crypto market has been largely profitable for all the operators.

This is generally considered bullish, as prices closed significantly higher than they opened. If the candle appears when prices are “low,” it may be the first sign of a bottom. If it occurs when prices are rebounding off of a support area (e.g., a moving average, trendline, or retracement level), the long white candle adds credibility to the support. Similarly, if the candle appears during a breakout above a resistance area, the long white candle adds credibility to the breakout. During the past 10 bars, there have been 1 white candles and 0 black candles for a net of 1 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 1 white candles and 0 black candles for a net of 1 white candles.\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 8.2381. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a buy 5 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 36.77. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 41 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -108.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a buy 6 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 12 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed up 198.297 at 7,420.407.
