Lightning technology speeds up transaction time by pushing the exchange to off-chain payment channels so there’s no waiting time for a block to be mined, thereby also alleviating mining fees.\nReports as of late April indicated the number of active nodes on the Lightning Network had crossed 2,000, with 5,801 open channels on the network. As well, its total network capacity had expanded past $150,000.\nSince that information was released, the number of channels and network capacity have increased yet further . As of May 24, NewsBTC says 6,600 direct connections now exist. Though these numbers aren’t staggering, it’s clear the trend is escalating.\nSlow Adoption But Trend Still Growing But full-scale uptake hasn’t yet occurred either. Is this a negative indicator for the much heralded technology?\nNot so says Vadim Koleoshkin CBDO at Zerion . The fact that more and more nodes have started supporting lightning network means the technology will ultimately gain adaption by Bitcoin users.\n“The idea itself has existed for quite a while, even though its implementations still haven’t reached their stable states. However, the fact that this scalability approach that has been discussed for a long time has been finally implemented, brings hope about the future of Bitcoin. To be more specific, if the technology is adopted by the majority of the community, users will be able to finally use Bitcoin on a daily basis, and it might replace credit cards faster. Moreover, Lightning gives a way for many new products for the Bitcoin ecosystem.”\nCould Lightning Network be the puzzle piece the cryptocurrency and larger financial environments have been missing, the missing link needed for Bitcoin to achieve full utilization as both a completely accepted asset class and acknowledged payment vehicle? Michal Zajda, Lead Architect at aeternity , the blockchain 3.0 platform, believes the Lighting Network is one of the missing pieces needed as well as a much anticipated extension of existing blockchain systems.\nIt feels very natural from a usability point of view, explains Zajda, and it enables us to make elements of blockchain systems far more scalable. In Zajda’s view, the Lightning Network is essentially the instant messenger of blockchain which finally makes it possible for consumers to engage in a simple task, like buying a cup of coffee, without risk or delay.\n“It is positive to see Bitcoin adopting new layers that make it friendly and convenient to use. This also represents a major opportunity for altcoins to impress the public with the native handling of payment channels and further drive the adoption of cryptocurrency.”\nThe evolution of the blockchain protocol has been evident over the past few years, and new research in the area continues to develop. Notes Zajda, “this research gave us tools to implement not only payment channels but also, so-called state channels which are capable of executing contracts between parties.”\nAlthough the Lightning Network has been tipped as the solution to Bitcoin’s scalability problem, Gabriele Giancola, co-founder and CEO of blockchain-powered loyalty ecosystem qiibee acknowledges it’s still early days.

A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation – in bitcoin. The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said. “For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome.\nThe mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology. “For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said. Egypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s … accepted by a group of people …. We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved … we are a charity,” Adeyemi said. The mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300). Muslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.- Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://telegram.me/share/url?url=http://www.digikuwait.com/2018/05/28/london-mosque-accepts-bitcoin/&text=London"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T03:19:04.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2dcc2b7c1ee6ebfd3c3393eb56d7e8bccecea836", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNpZyINmpylEhZZPYo_Phglo8ajPx3eQiPfFST5UVC4DLJc2h0IvyBDerI_lEBW8iAd0s7P8eKaCE-", "site_full": "redliontrader.com", "site": "redliontrader.com", "site_section": "https://redliontrader.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RedlionTrader", "title": "Bitcoin Core Fees Fall to Their Lowest in Years", "title_full": "Bitcoin Core Fees Fall to Their Lowest in Years", "published": "2018-05-28T22:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2dcc2b7c1ee6ebfd3c3393eb56d7e8bccecea836", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNpZyINmpylEhZZPYo_Phglo8ajPx3eQiPfFST5UVC4DLJc2h0IvyBDerI_lEBW8iAd0s7P8eKaCE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MrTopStep", "published": "2018-05-28T22:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Core Fees Fall to Their Lowest in Years", "text": "Bitcoin Core Fees Fall to Their Lowest in Years Posted By: MrTopStep May 28, 2018\nFees on the bitcoin core network have reached their lowest in seven years, with the median cost of sending BTC currently standing at $0.11. While there are several reasons why BTC fees are low, one of them is obvious: less people are using the network. The number of daily transactions has dropped sharply since last year, and has declined further in the past month.\nAlso read: Blockchain Projects Live a Little Over a Year on Average, China Claims Lower Fees, Lower Usage\nIt is no secret that the number of on-chain bitcoin core transactions, along with those of other blockchains, has dropped significantly since late 2017. This mirrors the decline in the valuation of bitcoin and most other digital assets during this timeframe. On December 14, almost half a million BTC transactions were recorded in a single day. By February, this figure was averaging below 200,000 a day. On April 24, the number peaked at 254,000, but has since declined, reaching a low of 158,000 on May 26, according to Bitinfocharts.com .\nIn early April, the median BTC transaction fee dropped to under 10 satoshis per byte before rising to almost 40 sats by the end of the month. As of yesterday, May 26, the median fee was back below 10 sats/byte once more. Median fees are taken as being a more useful metric than looking at average fees, for as Coinmetrics.io explains , “Median figures are generally much more informative for data like fees or transaction value since the data is normally extremely (positively) skewed”. The number of daily BTC transactions has been dropping BCH Is Still 3x Cheaper Than BTC to Send\nOn May 24, the number of BTC transactions utilizing Segwit reached an all-time high of 38%. This will have contributed to reducing median fees, although many believe that Segwit’s role in doing so has been overstated, with one assessment pointing out the role that transaction batching has played in fee reduction. Median BTC fees are at their lowest in years\nOn the bitcoin cash network, fees reached their three-month low on April 2, hitting a median of $0.0018. They now stand at $0.0038 per transaction, a significant increase in the space of a month but still three times cheaper than bitcoin core, at $0.113. When fees are unusually low, shrewd BTC holders use the opportunity to consolidate their unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This is done by sending all of the dust in their wallet to a BTC address they control.

Of course they are.\"\nPeter Tchir, the Head of Macro Strategy at Academy Securities writes :\nThere are allegedly several very large holders of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies). The concentration of wealth gives them the incentive to push prices higher. In the stock market, anyone holding a large proportion of the outstanding security is subject to additional rules and scrutiny. No such protections exist for cryptocurrency. The person telling you about how great it is, may be very incentivized to see the price go higher. Whether or not this falls under the definition of manipulation that is being investigated, assume it occurs and assume it distorts price.\nTchir also points to miners having a large position and being motivated to manipulate the prices and the fact that regulated markets have been prone to this type of activity.\nI am more shocked that anyone would be surprised that manipulation likely occurs in cryptocurrencies and their pricing. I will be interested to see how this investigation can proceed on things that occur on platforms I don't view as regulated exchanges on products that I didn't think were securities.\nFor now, this is yet another reason to expect cryptocurrencies to continue to drift lower.\nBITCOIN PRICE COULD DROP BELOW 2018 RECORD LOW OF $5900\nBitcoin developer and educator Willy Woo has warned Bitcoin prices could soon dip under 2018’s record low of $5,900 .\n“I think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can’t see $7000 holding.\n“Most likely we’ll balance a bit, then we’ll slide through.

While there are several reasons why BTC fees are low, one of them is obvious: less people are using the network. The number of daily transactions has dropped sharply since last year, and has declined further in the past month.\nAlso read: Blockchain Projects Live a Little Over a Year on Average, China Claims\nLower Fees, Lower Usage It is no secret that the number of on-chain bitcoin core transactions, along with those of other blockchains, has dropped significantly since late 2017. This mirrors the decline in the valuation of bitcoin and most other digital assets during this timeframe. On December 14, almost half a million BTC transactions were recorded in a single day. By February, this figure was averaging below 200,000 a day. On April 24, the number peaked at 254,000, but has since declined, reaching a low of 158,000 on May 26, according to Bitinfocharts.com .\nIn early April, the median BTC transaction fee dropped to under 10 satoshis per byte before rising to almost 40 sats by the end of the month. As of yesterday, May 26, the median fee was back below 10 sats/byte once more. Median fees are taken as being a more useful metric than looking at average fees, for as Coinmetrics.io explains , \"Median figures are generally much more informative for data like fees or transaction value since the data is normally extremely (positively) skewed\".\nThe number of daily BTC transactions has been dropping BCH Is Still 3x Cheaper Than BTC to Send On May 24, the number of BTC transactions utilizing Segwit reached an all-time high of 38%. This will have contributed to reducing median fees, although many believe that Segwit's role in doing so has been overstated, with one assessment pointing out the role that transaction batching has played in fee reduction.\nMedian BTC fees are at their lowest in years On the bitcoin cash network, fees reached their three-month low on April 2, hitting a median of $0.0018. They now stand at $0.0038 per transaction, a significant increase in the space of a month but still three times cheaper than bitcoin core, at $0.113. When fees are unusually low, shrewd BTC holders use the opportunity to consolidate their unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This is done by sending all of the dust in their wallet to a BTC address they control. That way, when bitcoin core fees inevitably rise again, they'll be able to save money on fees because each transaction will contain less UTXOs, making it smaller and thus cheaper.\nDo you think BTC fees will stay low, or is this just a temporary dip?

A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation — in bitcoin. The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said. “For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology. “For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said. Egypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision. “Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s ... accepted by a group of people ... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters. The mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It said it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300). Muslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active. Hide comments Updated 13 min 53 sec ago Reuters Oil prices mixed, but pressure builds on expected Saudi Arabia and Russia output hike Updated 13 min 53 sec ago Reuters May 29, 2018 06:39 0\nSEOUL: Oil prices were mixed in Asian trading on Tuesday, but remained under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more crude to ease a potential shortfall in supply. Brent crude futures were up 21 cents, or 0.28 percent, at $75.51 a barrel at 0635 GMT, after settling at their lowest since May 8 at $75.30. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down $1.11, or 1.64 percent, at $66.77 a barrel, sitting around its lowest since April 17. “Investors have started pricing in the likelihood of Saudi Arabia and Russia increasing crude oil production,” ANZ Bank said in a note. “However, doubt remains, with any agreement to be finalized at the June OPEC meeting.” Concerns that Saudi Arabia and Russia could boost output have put downward pressures on oil prices, along with rising oil production in the United States. Saudi Arabia and Russia have discussed raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil production by some 1 million barrels per day to make up potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is due to meet in Vienna on June 22. The spread between Brent and WTI stands at around $8.7 a barrel, the widest since March 2015 due to the depressed price of US crude compared to Brent. “The way I see it is that WTI prices are stabilizing rather than falling after rising sharply in recent weeks because the prices were expected to be in the range of $55-$65 a barrel,” said Vincent Hwang, commodity analyst at NH Investment & Securities in Seoul. “But at the same time there are some worries over a fall in US oil demand if more Middle East crude supplies flow into the market,” Hwang said. Meanwhile, record crude oil volumes from the United States are expected to head to Asia in coming months, nibbling away the market share of OPEC and Russia. US oil production has surged by more than 27 percent in the last two years to 10.73 million barrels per day (bpd). That puts the United States ahead of top exporter Saudi Arabia, and only Russia pumps out more, at around 11 million bpd.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lukasz musial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "musial", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shacklewell lane mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:37:24.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1bba29220cf68254cdfd3582148572212c76604d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VGISmYZvA8eFMBKLKRGGEf7gLRbTuCj8UWGPRJ2WryrrsMJ3LWne_lKCvdYsq5qAqeHXOQrOnW1RIlxSTIc0LBI4an9jQT.7_X0FG7xgUEW5CDdSHcUoLzX.j.Kf027_2DP1R.lwi4g--", "site_full": "www.zombiecommand.com", "site": "zombiecommand.com", "site_section": "http://www.zombiecommand.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Zombie Command", "title": "BitCoin Accepted – Aggrenox für männer rezeptfrei – Trackable Delivery", "title_full": "BitCoin Accepted – Aggrenox für männer rezeptfrei – Trackable Delivery", "published": "2018-05-28T22:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1bba29220cf68254cdfd3582148572212c76604d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VGISmYZvA8eFMBKLKRGGEf7gLRbTuCj8UWGPRJ2WryrrsMJ3LWne_lKCvdYsq5qAqeHXOQrOnW1RIlxSTIc0LBI4an9jQT.7_X0FG7xgUEW5CDdSHcUoLzX.j.Kf027_2DP1R.lwi4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LendMeYourEyes", "published": "2018-05-28T22:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "BitCoin Accepted – Aggrenox für männer rezeptfrei – Trackable Delivery", "text": "Aggrenox für männer rezeptfrei Generic Aggrenox\nAggrenox kaufen.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration More LONDON (Reuters) - Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain's capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n \"For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,\" said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n\"For the donor, it's just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque's perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,\" Musial said.\nEgypt's Grand Mufti, the nation's top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque's decision.\n\"Bitcoin is like any other currency. It's ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,\" Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.\n(Reporting by Parul Gupta; Writing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg; Editing by Alison Williams)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ramadan", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "sparks", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lukasz musial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "musial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sun", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shacklewell lane mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:41:32.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7bd8d79edb18ba30379d0cb7151912f6ffdb9d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGrIiElM.0mQovl31dX5yLigbRgdjy_vHW0F.RRlgQwo.UJPjQBK_lWWeV04Yx5E6piHgkX_awg.wcCKN6d6BNMU-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Poloniex Responds to Frozen Accounts Complaints", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Poloniex Responds to Frozen Accounts Complaints : btc", "published": "2018-05-28T22:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.423, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7bd8d79edb18ba30379d0cb7151912f6ffdb9d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGrIiElM.0mQovl31dX5yLigbRgdjy_vHW0F.RRlgQwo.UJPjQBK_lWWeV04Yx5E6piHgkX_awg.wcCKN6d6BNMU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BobsBurgers3Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T22:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Monday: Poloniex Responds to Frozen Accounts Complaints", "text": "submitted by /u/BobsBurgers3Bitcoin\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-in-brief-monday-poloniex-responds-to-frozen-accounts-complaints/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T18:22:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb5bf6d3e77f1af28c6dbaea325572392bda9196", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5JgIt2z_X5KaO2nlZyO0oi0DiYdDrcKrCeSbMn6ql1UfZtG2P3.phA8YuvCmXLOmHz2KAjVjj5yWCh2_BkVtMjaA75sdxkTLLJxuwoZihQ3JOfc5Vin9xuZktJjg1WcgaO1og2IhHH6UX8D6W1XF0vfI.KtlZAFCU-", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Japan gears for 6 new crypto-exchange platforms for trading Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], Ripple [XRP], Litecoin [LTC]", "title_full": "Japan gears for 6 new crypto-exchange platforms for trading Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], Ripple [XRP], Litecoin [LTC]", "published": "2018-05-28T22:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb5bf6d3e77f1af28c6dbaea325572392bda9196", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5JgIt2z_X5KaO2nlZyO0oi0DiYdDrcKrCeSbMn6ql1UfZtG2P3.phA8YuvCmXLOmHz2KAjVjj5yWCh2_BkVtMjaA75sdxkTLLJxuwoZihQ3JOfc5Vin9xuZktJjg1WcgaO1og2IhHH6UX8D6W1XF0vfI.KtlZAFCU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-05-28T22:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Japan gears for 6 new crypto-exchange platforms for trading Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], Ripple [XRP], Litecoin [LTC]", "text": "Japan gears for 6 new crypto-exchange platforms for trading Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], Ripple [XRP], Litecoin [LTC] May 29, 2018\nJapan’s corporate world seems to be taking a liking to the digital platform.

These budding public companies will join the previous companies, who had announced their plans to launch crypto-exchanges, such as – SBI Group, Yahoo! Japan, and Line Corp.

It’s just beginning of good days. Xrp community and ripple team will remember forever for this technology!”\nForkiusMaximus, a Reddit user said:\n“55% top-rate tax on all crypto gains (including usage for any purpose) isn’t very friendly (64% if you include mandatory national health “insurance” increases for no additional coverage). Though they are discussing reducing it to 20% (plus insurance) and treating crypto-to-crypto as like kind, which would be a huge improvement.”\nTomorrowisToday_, another Reddit user commented:\n“Are they focused on BTC though to the exclusion of Bitcoin (BCH)? Sometimes it seems like that from the advertisements.”\nThe demography of Japan states that 80% of the 3.5 million are the traders between the ages of 20 to 40.

Well i know that you can add up more when comes to the advantage of investing bitcoin from the other members as well. In fact i get a lot of idea from them from reading and reading from their post. Thus includes bitcoin as a form of savings highlights the best idea on investing bitcoin which could be later use as for emergency needs also. So how it will work? Well i have some extra money from my salary so instead of putting it to my piggy bank i will invest it here in cryptocurrency though it is not that big yet it could be consider as savings. From time to time as other members done like holding and selling it in the right time will do also. So it will be savings plus profit and that could also be use for emergency needs and easier to get or convert it to money for emergency uses unlike lending money from banks that will cater 2-3days process before you get your money. So this is the best idea i guess. How about you?Could you consider this thoughts?\nSaving money for emergency use is not a positive idea, although it is done by a lot of people. We save for the future, for financial stability and security. Once we are financially secured, we can handle any untoward incident involving financial obligations.

This got me thinking, would people buy or sell organs to get their hands on Bitcoin? This is a very\ncontroversial topic and I am in no way judging people who would do this or asking people to do this. I am just curious to\nknow to what length people will go to get their hands on Crypto currencies and bitcoins. It looks like the kidney trade in 3rd\nworld countries are a lucrative business these days, with a high number of people in 1st world countries getting kidney\ndiseases, due to bad eating habits. I am totally against this kind of practice, but I can now understand why people are doing\nthings like this.\nLet's say for one moment that you are diagnosed with imminent kidney failure and you only have a few months to live, would\nyou pay someone for their kidney and how much would you pay? Also, let's say you are one step away from imprisonment,\nbecause of bad debt, would you sell a kidney or another organ for bitcoins to stay out of jail?\n#Remember : In my opinion it is WRONG to do this, but I am just creating a hypothetical situation to satisfy my curiosity.\nOf course not, if I don't have any severe problem with my body.

The devised treatment program is therefore closer to existing methods for treating gambling addictions, rather than to substance abuse programs.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was Quote: d by the Evening Standard as saying:\n\"The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.\"\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center’s new treatments. Marini told the Standard that “introducing life structure is key,” adding:\n\"I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don't like the world they're in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they're not alone.\"\nCastle Craig said that there are currently no figures for the number of ‘crypto addicts,’ but “around 13 mln” people worldwide are trading in the system.\nLast year, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his home as collateral for a $325,000 equity loan, in pursuit of making a mid-term profit on the cryptocurrency. Crypto community members, evidently viewing his investment mindset as equivalent to gambling , remarked that the move was “almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.”\nFrom another perspective, there has been some discussion in the UK as to whether declaring your crypto trading to be gambling could help to avoid taxes with the British tax authority HMRC, which generally deems crypto profits as subject either to income or capital gains tax laws.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/news/man-borrows-325000-to-buy-bitcoin-investment-or-gambling-on-life-savings", "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-addicts-are-offered-treatment-in-uk-for-first-time-a3849456.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-blockchain-technology-is-taking-gambling-industry-to-new-level", "https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/907649/Bitcoin-tax-cryptocurrency-ripple-HMRC-capital-gains-earnings-gambling-bet-winnings", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/britain-introduces-crypto-task-force-to-foster-fintech-innovation"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T22:46:12.046+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c3971e8e21c30d2afbea1ad2c0b8bbe0d5da29e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRGOtINK87KEqgkKkjMTtera_I5O081RP5Fu0iLoQFmlngTQ2gNU8pcoZEsEUJqDQLuXQRlvxmBHgX.nKHLoa1y", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "I Would Be Shocked If Bitcoin Prices Weren’t Manipulated", "title_full": "I Would Be Shocked If Bitcoin Prices Weren’t Manipulated", "published": "2018-05-28T21:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c3971e8e21c30d2afbea1ad2c0b8bbe0d5da29e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRGOtINK87KEqgkKkjMTtera_I5O081RP5Fu0iLoQFmlngTQ2gNU8pcoZEsEUJqDQLuXQRlvxmBHgX.nKHLoa1y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-28T21:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "I Would Be Shocked If Bitcoin Prices Weren’t Manipulated", "text": "Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

While there are several reasons why BTC fees are low, one of them is obvious: less people are using the network. The number of daily transactions has dropped sharply since last year, and has declined further in the past month.\nAlso read: Blockchain Projects Live a Little Over a Year on Average, China Claims Lower Fees, Lower Usage\nIt is no secret that the number of on-chain bitcoin core transactions, along with those of other blockchains, has dropped significantly since late 2017. This mirrors the decline in the valuation of bitcoin and most other digital assets during this timeframe. On December 14, almost half a million BTC transactions were recorded in a single day. By February, this figure was averaging below 200,000 a day. On April 24, the number peaked at 254,000, but has since declined, reaching a low of 158,000 on May 26, according to Bitinfocharts.com .\nIn early April, the median BTC transaction fee dropped to under 10 satoshis per byte before rising to almost 40 sats by the end of the month. As of yesterday, May 26, the median fee was back below 10 sats/byte once more. Median fees are taken as being a more useful metric than looking at average fees, for as Coinmetrics.io explains , “Median figures are generally much more informative for data like fees or transaction value since the data is normally extremely (positively) skewed”. The number of daily BTC transactions has been dropping BCH Is Still 3x Cheaper Than BTC to Send\nOn May 24, the number of BTC transactions utilizing Segwit reached an all-time high of 38%. This will have contributed to reducing median fees, although many believe that Segwit’s role in doing so has been overstated, with one assessment pointing out the role that transaction batching has played in fee reduction. Median BTC fees are at their lowest in years\nOn the bitcoin cash network, fees reached their three-month low on April 2, hitting a median of $0.0018. They now stand at $0.0038 per transaction, a significant increase in the space of a month but still three times cheaper than bitcoin core, at $0.113. When fees are unusually low, shrewd BTC holders use the opportunity to consolidate their unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This is done by sending all of the dust in their wallet to a BTC address they control. That way, when bitcoin core fees inevitably rise again, they’ll be able to save money on fees because each transaction will contain less UTXOs, making it smaller and thus cheaper.\nDo you think BTC fees will stay low, or is this just a temporary dip?

Tucker, Editorial Director", "published": "2018-05-28T21:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Threat to Bitcoin from Quantum Computing", "text": "Print At nearly every lecture I’ve given on blockchain technology, and its most famous use case in Bitcoin, someone stands to ask about quantum computing. What exactly do I propose to do about this terrible threat? My answer has been that I propose nothing personally but the very core of innovation in this sector is about problem solving. If there is a known problem, there are people working on solutions, with tremendous professional awards accruing to the winner. Governance models are designed to implement solutions. It’s this adaptivity that makes this technology so much superior to central planning over money and ledgers. That’s a fine answer but it still leaves the question: just how real is this threat? This week, it was my pleasure to sit on a panel with Gavin Brennen of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, a physicist and one of the world experts on this topic. He presented a very nice paper that examined this question in some detail. He began with his frustration over the headlines that swept the tech world last October and November. They were as alarmist as they were misleading. He set the record straight. You can read his paper in full for the details . Proof of Work At the root is the remarkable speed of quantum computing, which is far more efficient than classical computing at performing key functions that make the blockchain work, namely hashing operations and proof of work. The proof of work standard can be met with far less energy and time which could potentially hack existing mining operations and centralize the network. In addition, quantum computing could pose a threat to standard cryptography by cracking keys in a way that could pose security risks, at least in theory. Gavin and his coauthors set out to examine the likelihood and timeframe when this threat becomes real. The results are far more boring that you might expect. Their simulation models show the following: The extreme speed of current specialized ASIC hardware for performing the hashcash PoW, coupled with much slower projected gate speeds for current quantum architectures, essentially negates this quadratic speedup, at the current difficulty level, giving quantum computers no advantage. Future improvements to quantum technology allowing gate speeds up to 100GHz could allow quantum computers to solve the PoW about 100 times faster than current technology. However, such a development is unlikely in the next decade, at which point classical hardware may be much faster, and quantum technology might be so widespread that no single quantum enabled agent could dominate the PoW problem. The paper presents a graph comparing the efficiency of current hashing strategies with eventual quantumization. The results show that the problem cannot become an issue for another 10 years but even following, there is no real threat to the existing Bitcoin network. The Signature Threat What about the second threat to cryptography posed by better signature-cracking technology. Here the threat is more real but not without solutions. The problem as they state it is that “the signature scheme can be broken in less than 10 minutes...as early as 2027.” The most serious problem concerns the following scenario: After a transaction has been broadcast to the network, but before it is placed on the blockchain it is at risk from a quantum attack. If the secret key can be derived from the broadcast public key before the transaction is placed on the blockchain, then an attacker could use this secret key to broadcast a new transaction from the same address to his own address. If the attacker then ensures that this new transaction is placed on the blockchain first, then he can effectively steal all the bitcoin behind the original address. What can be done? Gavin presented a number of post-quantum signature schemes that would protect against such a scenario. He points out that there are at least four classes of known solutions to the problem and alternatives within each, all within reach of programmers today. Moreover, there are ten years of lead time to get there and adapt them to the protocol. All of which is to say: this quantum threat to Bitcoin is mostly a red-herring, not entirely false but a fixable issue, especially given the robust network behind cryptocurrency and the strong incentive to provide the best security possible. Problems and Solutions As I listened to the paper, and his proposed solutions, it struck me how precise and intense is the brain trust behind this technology as compared with, for example, the Federal Reserve, the banking system, and existing fiat currency. The problems in the fiat status quo are enormous enough to fill whole libraries (starting with certain obvious problems: no one knows how much money the system produces, or how much crisis risk is present at any time, not even the people charged with managing the system). The problems revealed themselves in 2008. The system has not been repaired in a way that can prevent a repeat of that experience. Political economy is not about generating perfect solutions but rather choosing among options to find the best one while supporting adaptive institutions that deal with real threats with real solutions. The brilliance of cryptocurrency is that it rallies around truth, and never stops improving to reveal ever more of it.

What exactly do I propose to do about this terrible threat? My answer has been that I propose nothing personally but the very core of innovation in this sector is about problem solving. If there is a known problem, there are people working on solutions, with tremendous professional awards accruing to the winner. Governance models are designed to implement solutions. It’s this adaptivity that makes this technology so much superior to central planning over money and ledgers. That’s a fine answer but it still leaves the question: just how real is this threat? This week, it was my pleasure to sit on a panel with Gavin Brennen of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, a physicist and one of the world experts on this topic. He presented a very nice paper that examined this question in some detail. He began with his frustration over the headlines that swept the tech world last October and November. They were as alarmist as they were misleading. He set the record straight. You can read his paper in full for the details .

While there are several reasons why BTC fees are low, one of them is obvious: less people are using the network. The number of daily transactions has dropped sharply since last year, and has declined further in the past month.\nAlso read: Blockchain Projects Live a Little Over a Year on Average, China Claims Lower Fees, Lower Usage\nIt is no secret that the number of on-chain bitcoin core transactions, along with those of other blockchains, has dropped significantly since late 2017. This mirrors the decline in the valuation of bitcoin and most other digital assets during this timeframe. On December 14, almost half a million BTC transactions were recorded in a single day. By February, this figure was averaging below 200,000 a day. On April 24, the number peaked at 254,000, but has since declined, reaching a low of 158,000 on May 26, according to Bitinfocharts.com .\nIn early April, the median BTC transaction fee dropped to under 10 satoshis per byte before rising to almost 40 sats by the end of the month. As of yesterday, May 26, the median fee was back below 10 sats/byte once more. Median fees are taken as being a more useful metric than looking at average fees, for as Coinmetrics.io explains , “Median figures are generally much more informative for data like fees or transaction value since the data is normally extremely (positively) skewed”. The number of daily BTC transactions has been dropping BCH Is Still 3x Cheaper Than BTC to Send\nOn May 24, the number of BTC transactions utilizing Segwit reached an all-time high of 38%. This will have contributed to reducing median fees, although many believe that Segwit’s role in doing so has been overstated, with one assessment pointing out the role that transaction batching has played in fee reduction. Median BTC fees are at their lowest in years\nOn the bitcoin cash network, fees reached their three-month low on April 2, hitting a median of $0.0018. They now stand at $0.0038 per transaction, a significant increase in the space of a month but still three times cheaper than bitcoin core, at $0.113. When fees are unusually low, shrewd BTC holders use the opportunity to consolidate their unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). This is done by sending all of the dust in their wallet to a BTC address they control. That way, when bitcoin core fees inevitably rise again, they’ll be able to save money on fees because each transaction will contain less UTXOs, making it smaller and thus cheaper.\nDo you think BTC fees will stay low, or is this just a temporary dip?

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release. Bitcoin meetups are probably the most iconic social activity that cryptocurrency enthusiasts engage in – apart from epic Twitter and Reddit battles. These gatherings of like-minded enthusiasts bring thousands of people together around the world. Their power to attract people transcends borders so much that enthusiasts actually look for these meetups when they fly abroad. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency fans in many cases would rather check the local crypto scene out than go into a museum or go on a guided tour of the city they are traveling to. Vertex knows this, and as a project that is deeply rooted in this sense of camaraderie and community that transcends borders, it decided to launch it very own Bitcoin meetup competition: the Battle of the Meetups!\nBattle of the Meetups Sponsored by Vertex The Battle of the Meetups is simple. Vertex will go through all the Bitcoin meetups registered on meetup.com and will proceed to do the following:\nSelect 25 meetups to sponsor. Sponsor those meetups throughout a period of 5 months. Give the selected meetups a list of criteria that Vertex will use to select the top 2 meetups over this period. Proceed to give the two winners an amazing prize. Criteria to Participate in the Battle of the Meetups The criteria that Vertex established to determine the winner in this Battle of the Meetups is also quite simple. There are 4 vectors along which meetups can score points every time they meet. At the end, a final tally will determine the 2 winners. The following is the point system:\nThe meetup that accumulates the most Facebook likes since the start of the Battle of the Meetups until the end, will be awarded 3 points. The meetup with the second most likes will get 2 points and the meetup that comes in third will accumulate 1 point. Vertex retweets after every meetup will yield 3 points for the meetup that retweets the most, 2 points for the runner-up and 1 point for third place. The meetup that brings Vertex the most Telegram introductions will get 3 points, with the second place getting 2 points and the third place getting 1 point. Attendance will allow meetups to compete on how many people they attract each time. Meetups that attract 600 participants or more, will get 3 points each time. Those that gather 400 participants at least will be rewarded with 2 points and those that bring more than 200 participants will gather 1 point. The Prize!

From a Canadian Dentist's perspective", "text": "Why Bitcoin? I started with, \" Why is dentistry so expensive? \" Preface: how things are today is continuous with events in the past, and sets the stage for what is to come\nDentistry in Canada wasn't always unaffordable. I've had dental instructors at the University of Toronto show off pictures of their invoices for services rendered in the 1970's. $8 for a filling, $10 for an extraction ($32.xx, and $40.xx respectively, adjusted for inflation). Please send me vintage receipts for dental services, I'd really appreciate it. Adjusted for inflation, the average hourly wage in 1977 was $24, whereas the average hourly wage in 2016 was $27.70 . A filling today may cost $161 - $330+ in Ontario, and an extraction $145 - $227+.\nOn average, 2 hours of wage can pay off a filling/extraction in 1977, but in 2016, you'll need 5-8 hours to do the same. Our provincial fee guides for dental services also increases yearly to adjust for inflation:\nSo, wages are stagnant, and inflation happens - that's nothing new. There's a bigger picture that I'm drawing. Canadians: Record levels of Debt\nAt the end of 2017, Canadian households owed just over $2 trillion. Household debt is around 170 per cent of disposable income. In other words, the average Canadian owes about $1.70 for every dollar of income he or she earns per year , after taxes . On top of that, half of Canadians homeowners lack a proper emergency fund . I find it unsettling that the root canal treatment and crown ($2000+) which is necessary to save a tooth will put half my patients at financial duress. So I often find myself negotiating compromised treatments to address an issue for the short-term, fully knowing that the long-term consequences of such decisions become more difficult and more costly to fix. What's more, I find that a lot of patients are embarrassed that they can't afford standard-of-care treatment , unknowing that they are the norm rather than the exception.\nTuition for dentistry has risen significantly over the years: $39,240 for tuition alone in 2017-2018 . Please send me figures for earlier years . For the academic year 2003–2004, total expenses for housing, tuition, food, clothing, debt-serving, entertainment, was $37,500. I tried to go through the process of opening up a dental office in a 1750 sq ft. retail space in Southern Ontario. I'd be paying approx $115,000 rent/year, $220,000 in leasehold improvements, $375,000 in equipment and supplies for a 3-chair practice. I need to mention how predatory the industry that supports dentistry is as well, but that will be for a later article. Poker players use different strategies when they're on tilt. My intuition is that high levels of debt influences treatment recommendations, and the culture of heavy debt ultimately leads to the detriment of the Patient's care. Healthcare: show me the money\nIn 2001, provincial governments spent a combined $68.5 billion (about $2,209 per person) on healthcare.\nIn 2016, provincial governments spent a combined $228.1 billion (about $6,299 per person) on healthcare.\nYou'd think that with increased funding, we'd have better healthcare. Well, no. In fact, the Ontario Health Association is sounding the alarm for being on the brink of collapse . This is not new either, the public healthcare sector has consistently been short on resources.\nat 60+, they utilise more resources A significant portion of our population is going to be 65+\nThat's an issue. With the recent provincial campaigns, some parties are promising more services, like \"free childcare,\" \"free prescriptions,\" and \"free dental.\" I understand that we need a safety net for those who truly need those services, but w here is the money coming from? Flawed foundations - systemic issues\nWe'll print more money. That's right. We'll create money that we don't have to keep us afloat. This is what all countries do, and that's fine, right ? Canada has 0% fractional reserve requirement , which means that banks can lend out an infinite amount of money. Canada began phasing out cash reserve requirement in 1992 and removed it in 1994. If you are interested, see BOC Working Paper 97-8 (April 1997) \" Implementation of Monetary Policy in a Regime with Zero Reserve Requirements \" by Kevin Clinton.\n2007-2008 in the States was the \"wait...what???\" moment for me. The event revealed to me that money wasn't what I thought it was. A central authority dictates how money works, and without anchoring to a sound store of value, there is no consideration for the limits of finite resources. They're trying their best to fine-tune the properties and mechanics of money, but the economy is a second-order chaotic system, and they're playing the game with asymmetric information, on a global scale. They certainly didn't account for a bailout of the banks. The bailout money ended up inflating the money supply, and whatever currency people held was worth less after the bailout. If you were well-off enough to have investments (real estate, stocks, mutual funds, collectables, etc) before the bailout, then you enjoyed all time highs in traditional investments . The bankers benefited most from playing the system, except now they have a bigger stack of chips, and are permitted to rinse and repeat. The rich keeps getting richer, the poor gets poorer . Losses are socialised while gains are privatised. The vast majority of us are on the losing side of this process.\nThe government can spend money that we don't have - this has been the case for the United States as recently as 1971. In the linked video, Mike Maloney explains deficit spending during the Vietnam War (1 November 1955 -30 April 1975). The US government spent more than it could afford to sustain a war that the public didn't support. France knew this, and traded in their USD reserves for gold. Other countries responded similarly, and because US provided more receipts for gold than they had in reserve, the event forced the US off the gold standard.\nThe government can now spend money that they don't have on things that its constituents didn't necessarily want. During that process, the money that you worked so hard for lost value .\nPoliticians and government aren't stepping up to address this either. Politicians will play hot potato, hoping the system doesn't fail on their watch. They'll promise more, spend money that we don't have, get a piece of the pie for themselves and their friends, and pass on the ticking time bomb.\nDentistry is unaffordable to a large segment of our population. We're experiencing rising costs in healthcare, housing, food, clothing, and electronics. It's not so much that these items and services are becoming more expensive, but rather the value of your Dollar is decreasing, which is symptomatic of unsound monetary policy.\nIdeas in this video are supported by the anthropological record of monetary history, summarised in David Graeber's book, \"Debt, the first 5000 Years.\" I learned that Credit vs Bullion cycles happened multiple times in history. An excerpt: The cycle begins with the Age of the First Agrarian Empires (35oo-8oo Be), dominated by virtual credit money . This is followed by the Axial Age (8oo BC-6oo AD) , which will be covered in the next chapter, and which saw the rise of coinage and a general shift to metal bullion . The Middle Ages (6oo-1450 AD), which saw a return to virtual credit money, will be covered in chapter 10; chapter 11 will cover the next turn of the cycle, the Age of Capitalist Empires, which began around 1450 with a massive planetary switch back to gold and silver bullion, and which could only really be said to have ended in 1971, when Richard Nixon announced that the U.S. dollar would no longer be redeemable in gold. This marked the beginning of yet another phase of virtual money, one which has only just begun, and whose ultimate contours are, necessarily, invisible.\nBitcoin\nBitcoin is a much needed return to sound monetary policy.\nYou might think, \"pfft, the world powers are too powerful to let that happen.\" I would direct you to \"Nicholas Nassim Taleb - Black Swan\" regarding the impact of the highly improbable.\nI choose to participate in Bitcoin because: I have a moral objection to the culture of short-term, profit-driven consumerism, while ignoring long-term societal and environment implications Central authority has demonstrated to be irresponsible, incompetent, and unaccountable for missteps in monetary policy Existing monetary policy is the root cause of systemic sickness in society - high levels of civil unrest = lose-lose situation for everyone The totality of my life's work is denominated in State-currency, and policies set by the State may not be in our best interests (more to come on this) Existing financial institutions don't value your basic right to commerce and financial sovereignty - RBC has banned the trading of crypto using Interac - there is no better demonstration that your money is censored I'm proud to be Canadian, and I thank the country for allowing me freedom of thought, but I am human before I am Canadian. I am a sovereign individual The take home message for canadians\nI omitted the following, but I saved the best for last . This is the only message that I think you'll remember in this piece.\nI see around 15 patients a day. I've worked 4 years in private practice. I know that about 50 percent of you can even afford/have insurance to see a dentist regularly. I see around 3 a week who experiences this situation: Patient presents to clinic with agonising pain. The tooth is very much salvageable, and an important one to keep in the mouth. The ideal solution is to save the tooth via root canal treatment.\nAbout half of you couldn't afford $600 - $2000, because it would put you behind on rent/mortgage. Less of you can afford this since the 2017 housing peak.\nIn other words, half of us would rather rip a tooth out of their skull to relieve short term pain , fully knowing that the consequences are more costly to deal with in the long-term. This is putting money where your mouth is at the most literal level, and is telling of a bleak state of financial duress. For a 95% confidence level with +/- 5 confidence interval for 13,600,000 people in Ontario, the sample size is significant. It is rational for me to question my country's financial health.\nAt the end of the day DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH .\n- Richard Cheung", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/404469/publication.html", "http://www.usdebtclock.org/world-debt-clock.html", "https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2018/05/canada-economy-household-debt-how-big-the-problem/", "https://youtu.be/wD3KYlpE2lk?t=4m45s", "https://www.oha.com/hospitals-on-the-brink", "https://globalnews.ca/news/3085917/nearly-half-of-canadian-homeowners-lack-proper-emergency-fund-survey/", "http://wir2018.wid.world/files/download/wir2018-summary-english.pdf", "https://globalnews.ca/news/3531614/average-hourly-wage-canada-stagnant/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2018/01/05/stocks-are-at-an-all-time-high-is-it-too-late-to-get-in-on-the-action/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f2347c46bc15", "http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/link/students/fees18/dom_dentistry.htm", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-72/issue-8/729.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T00:31:15.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93b1a15563f5e89f1a1db36e26b820e16b745818", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr7ROLWbTdtzzO2SY2yY0Kko5fY1h_Hk.9QHzwYoxq.aqinuokqX9OIP6vFlnRg0cLrGe4s.iGVJ4B35_m9JzHcbsSVcn5mu43UzH7Bzustz94_Ul3qLpEVo", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Niall Ferguson claims Bitcoin [BTC] to be the financial approach of the future", "title_full": "Niall Ferguson claims Bitcoin [BTC] to be the financial approach of the future", "published": "2018-05-28T21:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93b1a15563f5e89f1a1db36e26b820e16b745818", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr7ROLWbTdtzzO2SY2yY0Kko5fY1h_Hk.9QHzwYoxq.aqinuokqX9OIP6vFlnRg0cLrGe4s.iGVJ4B35_m9JzHcbsSVcn5mu43UzH7Bzustz94_Ul3qLpEVo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-05-28T21:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Niall Ferguson claims Bitcoin [BTC] to be the financial approach of the future", "text": "Niall Ferguson claims Bitcoin [BTC] to be the financial approach of the future May 29, 2018\nOn May 28 th , the Central Bank of England was told that Bitcoin is headed towards being the ultimate financial system for the future by the popular British historian and political author Niall Ferguson.\nFerguson is one of history’s most wanted commentators’ and the author of ‘The House of Rothschild’. On Tuesday, he attended a seminar addressing the Bank of England that the subject of Bitcoin is ahead of the major challenges faced since the ‘2008 financial-crisis’ following its current fiat-based system.\nHe believes that the financial system of today is not much different from the financial system of the pre-crisis period, other than the aspect of better capitalization of big banks. The crypto-revolution is yet to overtake the financial markets with context to time and electricity-backed experiments of these alternative forms of money exchange.\nFerguson was quoted as saying:\n“The novelties, the things that will really matter ten years hence are still relatively small in scale. Whether its bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally or the massive revolution in online payments that is being achieved by the big Chinese tech companies, that’s the financial system of the future, and it is still small enough not to be systemically important in 2018.”\nSo, it shouldn’t come off as a surprise that the next crisis is “only a matter of time”. He also truly believes that blockchain-based coins and tokens will not be able to completely replace Bitcoin as it has set its standards of becoming world’s most popular digital gold.\nHe had claimed earlier that “it is a store of value for wealthy investors”, in countries that own high political risks and weak governance. Since then, the cryptocurrency market has grown beyond recognition with more and more ICOs coming into the scene.\nInitial Coin Offerings who have raised their money in Bitcoin and other big cryptocurrency exchanges like Ethereum have found a “quick and easy” way to fund new innovations, which is an alternative to issuing shares.\nFerguson reported last week, saying:\n“I wish I had a bitcoin for every phony white paper I’ve been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down, adding a reference to the fact that with zero regulation, rogues are bound to be in the scene.”\nVitor Constancio, the Vice-President of the European Central Bank, arguably quoted as saying:\n“Bitcoin is a sort of tulip. It’s an instrument of speculation for those that want to bet on something that can go up and down 50% or 40% in a few days, but certainly not a currency.”\nAbout 5 days ago, Economics’ Nobel Laureate, Robert Shiller had tried answering the questions of cryptocurrency surpassing the constant warnings and scams. He stated that Bitcoin entrepreneurs still continue to work on developing use cases with the help of new innovations and technology.\nShiller explained this by saying:\n“Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The Cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T22:17:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e46826e66ccf25f3687b9cce7911c1a3227d00df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbYTvbDDMYd0C0NlHOY88yI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "People are joking about Bitcoin", "title_full": "People are joking about Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T21:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e46826e66ccf25f3687b9cce7911c1a3227d00df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbYTvbDDMYd0C0NlHOY88yI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Goodday", "published": "2018-05-28T21:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "People are joking about Bitcoin", "text": "The market reaction indicates the bitcoin reaction is too large to be destroyed so it seems impossible that bitcoin will remain a no coin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T16:11:12.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10e8e492c1b90c24ff81bafb2ae4eb58771f6bd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbecadA.AmhUvvF6kCybkUc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "60% of world population cannot access computer so Bitcoins will fail.", "title_full": "60% of world population cannot access computer so Bitcoins will fail.", "published": "2018-05-28T21:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.029, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10e8e492c1b90c24ff81bafb2ae4eb58771f6bd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbecadA.AmhUvvF6kCybkUc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "marites", "published": "2018-05-28T21:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "60% of world population cannot access computer so Bitcoins will fail.", "text": "Quote: from: manismanja on May 28, 2018, 09:46:36 AM there are still 40% who can access bitcoin then it can still survive, unless no one can access bitcoin then bitcoin will die. as long as there are still connected even if only 1 it can still survive.\nEven in the provinces mostly has a gadget, how much more in the cities so I don't think that Bitcoin will fail because there's no acces in computer.

Otherwise the network would not be usable. Therefore, transaction fees should be reasonable, say around 50sat/byte, which would mean opening and closing channels are not too expensive.\nSince the assumption is small blocks (1MB), it means there will be constant (unchanging) mining rewards (in Satoshis) over time. We expect the Bitcoin Cash chain mining rewards to grow over time, as its blocks can contain more and more transactions, thus it has growing mining rewards (in Satoshis). Therefore, miners will move their hashpower to the Bitcoin Cash chain over time.\nThis will continue unbounded. Once a single miner on the Bitcoin Cash chain has more hash power than half of the BTC chain, he can do a 51% attack, without sacrificing his own chain.\nTo prevent this, the BTC chain can either ditch the Lightning Network and embrace large, growing blocks (seems unlikely politically), or change to a new proof-of-work to avoid this attack.\nThis might be a reason why some Core developers push for a proof-of-work change.\n submitted by /u/eyeofpython\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T16:10:32.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a88969de0ea89be2f6f8a3a7e6f03cebe019cf00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwxhVu4uw52IUGPG4rk6XRGONVJLZEeRd3jqqvDZWvs0afBBH055Jp3gnehXV.XHqgVBtJqY_DbM7yRsPyT1kpyYVo8oyDfsflxqp6BA3XdemwSmvQjyIxn.HH384Iima0-", "site_full": "feeds.feedburner.com", "site": "feedburner.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/zerohedge/feed?format=xml", "site_categories": ["media", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "RSS", "title": "Scottish \"Crypto Clinic\" Now Treating Bitcoin Trading Addicts", "title_full": "Scottish \"Crypto Clinic\" Now Treating Bitcoin Trading Addicts", "published": "2018-05-28T20:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/2018-05/cryptoaddict.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a88969de0ea89be2f6f8a3a7e6f03cebe019cf00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwxhVu4uw52IUGPG4rk6XRGONVJLZEeRd3jqqvDZWvs0afBBH055Jp3gnehXV.XHqgVBtJqY_DbM7yRsPyT1kpyYVo8oyDfsflxqp6BA3XdemwSmvQjyIxn.HH384Iima0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tyler Durden", "published": "2018-05-28T20:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scottish \"Crypto Clinic\" Now Treating Bitcoin Trading Addicts", "text": "SHARES\nSubmitted by CoinTelegraph A Scottish hospital is treating people who are addicted to trading cryptocurrencies in the UK’s first ever ‘crypto clinic,’ the Evening Standard reported today, May 28.\nCastle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, has created a course of residential treatment for those it deems to be crypto addicts.
