Some projects are seemingly better at it than others. Whereas Bitcoin still lacks PR and marketing, it seems TRON is doing the exact opposite. Even so, there are some concerns regarding its odd way of advertising this project. Living up to people’s expectations will not be easy. Fueling the TRON Hype\nFor the second time in a few weeks, a massive TRON advertisement appeared on a Nasdaq billboard. The same happened prior to the project’s test net launch. While that generated quite a buzz, the overall interest in TRON has remained somewhat unchanged. Not entirely surprising, considering the project still has everything to prove to the masses. #TRON hits #NASDAQ once again! We’re going to change blockchain, the internet, and the world! We’re going full speed. Don’t get left behind.\n— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) June 1, 2018\nPeople need to understand why this advertisement shows up on this billboard. It is a paid ad, just like any other which is displayed on the same screen. This doesn’t mean NASDAQ has any interest in TRON or its technology. Nor does it mean this will immediately lead to bigger adoption of this ecosystem or its native currency.\nFounder Justin Sun seems to be rather deceptive in this regard. He claims how TRON “hit NASDAQ” again. This is clear misdirection, as the project isn’t even on the radar of the major stock exchange. Instead, this paid advertisement is being packaged as something which it isn’t. Granted, it will attract eyeballs and makes for a nice picture on social media. That doesn’t guarantee any major impact on the project or the price. Deceptive Marketing or Sheer Brilliance?\nAnother recent tweet by Justin Sun has stirred a hornet’s nest. More specifically, he compared TRON to Ethereum , even though these projects are not in the same league. Ethereum has a multi-year track record and has overcome many challenges. TRON is only just getting started with an imminent main net launch. As such, there is no point in comparing the two. Why #TRON is better than #ETH : 1. 2000TPS vs. 25TPS 2. Popular sovereignty of token vs. Authoritarian rules 3. 100M Dapp users vs. Thousands 4. None fees vs. High fees 5. Coin burn vs. No coin burn 6. $2B bonus vs. Zero 7. High scalability vs Poor scalability #TRX $TRX pic.twitter.com/W7jEjmx0wp\n— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) June 1, 2018\nAccording to Sun, TRON will support 100 million dApp users. An interesting concept, even though there are no main net dApps which attract thousands of users. That situation can still change, yet all it does is create hype and speculation for the project rather than develop. On the Ethereum side of things, hundreds of “useful” dApps exist already, which makes one wonder which project is effectively the more advanced.\nLast but not least, Sun is deceiving users by comparing the transaction throughput. In his opinion, TRON will support 2,000 transactions per second. Ethereum only supports 25, according to his infographic. Even so, Ethereum processes over 1 million transactions per day, TRON has a lot less activity. Without network activity to speak of, the project will never be in the same league as Ethereum.

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,610 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now facing another important barrier near the $7,700 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Bitcoin price is trading nicely above the $7,400 pivot against the US Dollar. BTC/USD could accelerate gains once it breaks the $7,700 and $8,000 barriers. Bitcoin Price Decline After a major decline, bitcoin price formed a decent support above the $7,000 handle against the US Dollar. The price started an upside move and traded above the $7,200 and $7,400 resistance levels. There was also a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,057 low. Moreover, there was a close above $7,500 barrier, which is a positive sign. During the upside, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,610 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is now trading above the $7,550 pivot level and it looks set for more gains in the near term. On the upside, the $7,700 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours) is a key hurdle for buyers . Above $7,700, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,057 low is positioned at $7,830 to prevent gains. Looking at the chart , the price has to break the $7,700 and $7,830 resistance levels to trade further higher. On the flip side, if there is a downside correction, the broken resistances at $7,500 and $7,400 are likely to act as supports. Looking at the technical indicators: 4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly gaining pace in the bullish zone. 4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently just around the 60 level. Major Support Level – $7,400 Major Resistance Level – $7,830\nFull details at www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/03/bitcoin-price-weekly-analysis-btc-usd-accelerate-gains/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "network technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T13:53:32.087+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa93a02e946fc7593e3c442be4b45aed5257eb5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUkEKSYP3F3N2KlOrkHCOHeDo2y4MexkWlQvoSQDjq.KS.tIabjytbbnh_XAx_.EqicNaFc4xsmPKTDMHemqbGcOytL3i.rysWN2qTkX_Zp0Q--", "site_full": "networkurl.com", "site": "networkurl.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round – NetworkURL", "title_full": "This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round – NetworkURL", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.029, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/networkurl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/0528_networkurl_default_960x720_003366.png?fit=960%2C720", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa93a02e946fc7593e3c442be4b45aed5257eb5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUkEKSYP3F3N2KlOrkHCOHeDo2y4MexkWlQvoSQDjq.KS.tIabjytbbnh_XAx_.EqicNaFc4xsmPKTDMHemqbGcOytL3i.rysWN2qTkX_Zp0Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round – NetworkURL", "text": "Sunday, June 3, 2018 Network Technology 0\nThe Weekly\nThis week we saw that despite most countries being less open to cryptocurrency than we would have wanted to, this amazing innovation continues to fascinate the whole world . This was evident in stories from all over the globe that were covered in this week’s daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App Poloniex Responds to Complaints\nOn Monday we reported that Poloniex, the US-based cryptocurrency trading platform which was taken over by Circle earlier this year, has finally responded to complaints by its clients about frozen accounts. The company tried to reassure clients their funds were safe and that it has taken steps to increase the speed of the identity verification process. Additionally covered was the fact that the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone. McAfee Warns of War on Crypto\nJohn McAfee (Photo by Gage Skidmore)\nThe big news on Tuesday was that cybersecurity expert turned pump and dump guru John McAfee has issued another bullish prediction. Bitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicted. His prediction was in contrast with Russian analysts who expect that value of BTC will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold.\nMcAfee also also talked about “the war we are all engaged in”, Claiming that the banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto. He advised crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. McAfee called on his followers to also write the SEC and ask “to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.” China Fights Impersonators and Fraudsters\nA couple of stories that show cryptocurrency is still a hot topic in China were our focus on Wednesday . First, Chinese social media has erupted in anger this week after the use of a Mao Zedong impersonator at the Boao Blockchain Forum for Asia in Hainan province. Second, a Chinese procurator’s office has reportedly prosecuted 98 people and recovered 1.7 billion yuan (about $270 million) in an alleged Onecoin pyramid scheme. Additionally covered were high market awareness in Germany, a London mosque that accepts bitcoin donations, a new green mining farm in Canada and an MMA champ’s love for crypto. Asus Creates 20-GPU Mining Motherboard\nAsus H370 Mining Master\nOn Thursday we reported that Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer Asus has created a new motherboard with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The company explains that: “Mining is a numbers game; it’s only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. ” We also reported about a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin. Expanding Horizons in Uganda, Bahrain and Georgia\nCountries not often mentioned in the news made headlines on Friday . First, Binance could be opening a new office in Uganda, CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference. “I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,” CZ stated. Second, Bahrain has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency due to an absence of limiting regulations and a shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in Riffa. Lastly, we reported that a luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins in Georgia. Blockchain on the Agenda in Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Hungary\nGovernments all across Europe were our focus on Saturday . Lawmakers in Spain have issued a unanimous call for adopting regulations that favor the implementation of crypto and blockchain technologies. The government of Slovenia has adopted an action plan to underpin the implementation of blockchain technology in the country and create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In Estonia, officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. And in Hungary, “The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,” said Péter Benedek, the CEO of Blockchain Competence Center (BCC).

Tucker is of the view that the fear of quantum computing as an existential threat to bitcoin and other blockchain applications is based on scare-mongering and ignorance.\nIn actual fact he says, the entire basis of blockchain technology is to crowdsource solutions for problems including security threats potentially posed by quantum computing, and this is what makes Blockchain networks superior to centrally planned networks and platforms. Insisting that any potential security risks are solvable, Tucker references a research paper published by Dr. Gavin Brennen, a quantum physicist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who is a globally respected authority on the subject of quantum computing. “Still A Long Way Off”\nDr. Brennen’s paper analyses the threats posed by advanced quantum computing to blockchain technology using a study to ascertain how possible it is for a quantum computer to ‘rig’ a blockchain by centralizing it’s hashing power, and whether it can crack a cryptographic key, which is currently the main security apparatus that protects blockchain users. The results indicate that quantum technology as we imagine it and quantum technology as it currently exists are still far away from each other.\nIn answer to both scenarios, the answer is no, based on current quantum computing capacity. Existing quantum infrastructure supports gate speeds that are relatively low compared to those needed to carry out an extremely complicated function like cracking a cryptographic key in a short period of time. In another ten years, there is a possibility that hardware permitting gate speeds of up to 100GHz may be in existence, but at the same time, the already extremely-fast ASIC hardware that is used for the Proof-of-Work blockchain functions will also continue to evolve and improve in that time. Bitcoin isn’t vulnerable to quantum computing, research suggests.\nIn other words, any theoretical advantage that quantum computing possessed over the blockchain is canceled out in practice by the constraints of existing hardware and continued evolution of blockchain security. The technology that can successfully compromise a blockchain running currently, is always about ten years away from successful development, such that by the time it comes out, it is always effectively obsolete. “Red Herring”\nBoth Dr. Brennen and Tucker agree that while there is certainly a security risk posed by quantum computing to blockchain networks, at least on paper, these fears are based on sensational reporting and scaremongering. Tucker’s opinion is that the conversation about quantum computing posing an existential threat to the blockchain is a red herring because it serves as a distraction from what should really be discussed. In his words,\n“…This quantum threat to Bitcoin is mostly a red-herring, not entirely false but a fixable issue, especially given the robust network behind cryptocurrency and the strong incentive to provide the best security possible.”\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

The NFC feature allows people in close proximity to transfer funds without using wallet addresses or QR codes. The new update allows users to send and received just by mentioning the recipient’s ‘handle’ further simplifying and speeding up the transfer process. A newly launched application called Keyport has also lifted Bitcoin Cash.

The level currently stands at $352 billion, up 2.6% on the day. It has been a bullish week with total market cap climbing 8% since the same time last Monday.

The Chicago Board Choices Alternate (CBOE) and the Chicago Mercantile Alternate (CME). The US Commodity Futures Buying and selling Fee (CFTC) gave the last approval obligatory for Bitcoin to be categorized as a legit different funding for each institutional and retail buyers. Bitcoin futures have opened Bitcoin as much as a bigger investor pool as a result of now there may be one other strategy to put money into Bitcoin with out having to get a pockets. What are Futures? Futures are monetary derivatives . A future is a contract offered to buyers. The futures contract holder is certain to the settlement to purchase or promote an underlying asset at a set value on or earlier than a longtime future date. Futures buying and selling has been historically completed with commodities like crude oil and gold. So for example how this works , let’s say you’ll want to purchase loads of crude oil as a result of you could have a non-public jet fleet that you just’re planning on flying around the globe later that yr. It’s January, and also you imagine the worth of oil goes to go up within the subsequent three months from its present fee of $100 a barrel. So you should buy a futures contract to have the appropriate to buy 10 barrels of crude oil at $100 on or earlier than March 31st for a complete of ($1000). It’s now March and such as you predicted oil is now $200 a barrel, so your new contract worth is ($2000). You may shut your contract out by both getting your revenue of $1000 in fiat foreign money or have the oil delivered to your fleet on the agreed buy value. The benefit of a futures contract is the contract holder didn’t have to really purchase the ten barrels of oil in January to learn from the rise in value. Only the price of the contract was the one capital required in January to make a wager on this oil place. Futures contracts have the next traits: Standardized Listing the amount of the asset Futures contracts will be redeemed in 2 methods: Fiat foreign money A bodily supply of the asset listed on the contract What Do Futures Imply for Bitcoin? Bitcoin futures permit buyers to invest on the worth of bitcoin with out having to undergo the difficulty of getting a bitcoin pockets to retailer their place. This function of not having to carry Bitcoin dramatically reduces one of many crucial dangers of investing in digital currencies, particularly, secure storage. As Bitcoin futures are exchange-traded , they may develop into very liquid funding autos over time. Extra liquidity will draw in additional institutional buyers to take part in crypto. Thus far, liquidity in bitcoin futures has been decrease compared to different commodities, however it’s nonetheless comparatively early on for Bitcoin futures. Moreover, via using futures contracts, buyers can now wager on the worth of bitcoin declining by promoting futures. This new potential to promote futures permits all of the bitcoin “bears” to place their money the place their mouth is and quick Bitcoin . You may flip a revenue if the worth declines , however your publicity to loss is limitless. The worth can solely fall a lot, however the value can rise theoretically with none restrict. In case you have a future contract on the market, you need to cowl the losses if the worth of Bitcoin rises. The power to promote futures offers you the flexibility to hedge towards the crash of Bitcoin. Let’s say you personal 5 Bitcoins and then you definitely promote a futures contract that predicts it’ll crash in worth. If Bitcoin has an exponential rise, you’ll be coated with what you personal. If it crashes, you’ll be able to revenue off of the futures contract. This futures contract helps scale back the chance of your total place . The power to have “insurance coverage” on an funding place lowers the general threat of the funding. This lowered threat will entice extra institutional money into the Bitcoin house and provides them publicity to crypto. Bitcoin futures are a financially regulated service. Rules are enticing to giant institutional buyers as a result of they’re certain by tight fiduciary rules when buying and selling their purchasers property. This new introduction of getting some guidelines as an alternative of being the wild west opens Bitcoin as much as a a lot bigger funding group. Earlier than Bitcoin futures, the inflow of fiat foreign money was restricted to solely retail buyers and excessive internet price people. Institutional funds personal about 78% of the market worth of the U.S. broad-market Russell 3000 index, and 80% of the large-cap S&P 500 index. So if even when solely 30% of the whole institutional money goes into the crypto market, it’ll have an enormous impression on its liquidity and total worth.

Seriously, for the first 5-8 years, the digital currency was mainly used as a means for criminals to launder money and sell illegal goods on the dark market. Think of all the massive hacks in the early days also, and all those darknet markets that disappeared with huge amounts of bitcoin.\nLiterally millions and millions of the 16 million coins out there would be owned by criminals. And now with bitcoin becoming more centralized and less anonymous, they are swiftly exiting the market and looking for alternative dark coins.\nI also personally avoid using bitcoin all-together because of the extremely slow transaction speeds and high cost's associated with it.\nThe bitcoin mining business is dust, so that interest will die quickly.\nI just don't see a very bright future for the god of cryptocurrency and it will surely be surpassed by one of its rivals soon enough.\nI'm torn between predicting it to be Dash, or Ethereum, and I recon it could be about 2 years before that happens.\nWould love to know peoples thoughts on the future of bitcoin.\nWhere will bitcoin be in\n2 weeks?\n2 months?\n2 years?\nWill it be surpassed by another coin? If so, which one and when?\nBitcoin has a drawback- high transaction fees. The price is high due to this.

(Supplied: TravelbyBit/Facebook)\nFrom cafes in Launceston, Tasmania to hairdressers in Burleigh on Queensland's Gold Coast, bricks and mortar retailers across Australia are gradually beginning to accept digital currency, which is bought online and encrypted using data technology known as blockchain.\nThe Australian dollar currently is 18th on the Bitcoin Volume by Currency index — well behind the Japanese Yen, which sits at the top of the ladder in a market that constantly fluctuates.\nHowever, cryptocurrencies are not yet regarded as legal tender in Australia, meaning businesses are not obliged to accept them.\nThe Australian Tax Office views bitcoin and other currencies as \"neither money nor Australian or foreign currency (but) property\".\nLast week, Queensland start-up TravelbyBit rolled out its point-of-sale app that facilitates crypto payments at Brisbane Airport, earning it the moniker of \"Australia's first digital currency-friendly airport\".\nA tracker on the company's website shows just a handful of transactions in the airport each day so far, worth between $5 and $55.\nTravelbyBit CEO Caleb Yeoh said it was early days for the currency, and that there was strong support for it as a \"social movement\".\n\"If you travel around the world you have to deal with multiple currencies, the exchange rate can be confusing, sometimes you struggle to find ATMs, and sometimes you get swindled by money changers,\" he said.\n\"Travelling with one global currency like Bitcoin … makes sense.\"\nHe said the blockchain technology protected merchants from the costs of credit card fraud.\n\"Blockchain has the ability to make transactions a lot more transparent and efficient … I think it's the way of the future.\" Taking cryptopayments to regional Australia\nIn Agnes Water-1770, Mr Christian began looking into digital currency when a client of his, who was also a business owner, wondered how to go about processing a bitcoin payment from a customer.\nMr Christian learned the currency was being rolled out at Brisbane Airport.\n\"I thought, 'This is something worth having a look at'.\"\nMr Christian said building the support of businesses in the small town of just over 2,000 permanent residents wasn't hard.\n\"We started from the ground up, shared it with a couple of businesses and they were straight on board … I guess they were international travellers themselves and had heard of these types of payments.\n\"Initially we had a good 10 businesses that just said, 'Fine — let's go for it'.\"\nHe said the idea spread across the town's tourism industry with the \"digital traveller\" in mind.\n\"So it started out as, 'Well, how would they get here? Could we provide a shuttle service to bring them from the airport or the railway station?'\n\"Then [we considered], 'Where would they stay and what are they going to do when they get here?',\" he said.\nThirty-one businesses in the town have now signed up, from resorts and backpackers to tour companies, restaurants, the local pub and a day spa.

As more miners join the Bitcoin network , some individuals fear that the amount of electricity consumed by mining will have a negative impact on the environment. Others believe that the benefits of Bitcoin mining outweigh the cost it takes to produce the digital currency. Bitcoin mining and energy consumption\nNew Bitcoin are produced through a process called mining , where computers expend energy and computational resources to solve a difficult math problem that verifies a recent block of Bitcoin transactions. The miner who solves the math problem adds the block to the blockchain and receives newly minted Bitcoin. The difficulty of the math problem depends on how much computational power the network has in summation. As the Bitcoin network attracts more miners, the mining difficulty increases, and usually, the amount of energy a mining rig consumes increases too.\nThe Bitcoin network currently consumes about 2.55 gigawatts (GW) of electricity per year; to put that into perspective, the entire country of Ireland has an average electricity consumption of 3.1 GW , and Austria has an average electricity consumption of 8.2 GW per year. Over the past year, the estimated amount of TwH that the Bitcoin network consumes per year increased 413.37 percent. When compared to countries like the Czech Republic, the Bitcoin network uses 102.3 percent of the entire electricity consumed by the country per year.\nData consultant and blockchain specialist Alex De Vries believes that the amount of energy Bitcoin mining consumes is problematic. In a recent research study published in Joule, De Vries found that the average amount of electricity consumed per Bitcoin transaction is 300 kwH, and at the rate new miners are joining the network – and the mining difficulty increases – this number has the potential to reach 900 KwH by the end of 2018.\nDe Vries told Cointelegraph that even though society can not see the changes being made to the environment via Bitcoin mining, mining operations are not helping the world get closer to their climate and environmental goals: “We know that mining is done with coal-electricity, but also with renewable energy. In the latter case, we don’t know what we are displacing, plus renewable energy never has zero lifetime carbon footprint either. There’s more work to be done here, but there’s certainly an impact. The more energy Bitcoin uses, the more it will impact the environment for sure – which in turn will impact everyone. It’s not helping us reach our climate goals.”\nThere is a grey area when it comes to figuring out how Bitcoin mining is impacting the environment. Although some of the electricity used is sourced from coal , mining operations usually do not release carbon emissions themselves. Just because miners do not see the physical impact that mining has on the environment, the amount of resources consumed and the opportunity cost involved should be concerning in itself. Hash rate and energy consumption The amount of energy mining consumes seems to be increasing. As mining equipment becomes better at solving blocks, the electricity consumed by each mining rig increases. To stay ahead of their competitors, miners are always looking for mining equipment with a higher hashrate . The hashrate is the speed at which the miner is able to provide answers to the math problem. The higher the hash rate, the faster one can guess the answer to the problem.\nAt first, the problem was easy enough to be solved by a standard CPU , but as more miners joined the network and the problem became more difficult, miners found that GPU were better suited to solve the problem. Just a few years later, FPGAs and then ASICs – application specific integrated circuits – were better suited than GPUs to solve a block.\nOthers, like entrepreneur and former Google information security engineer Marc Bevand, believe that the amount of energy that mining consumes will cause further innovation in the form of renewable energies. Bevand believes that the energy consumption will eventually lead to decreased costs of renewable energy for society at large:\n“Because miners are so sensitive to electricity prices, they are often a driver pushing utilities to further develop renewables which are now the cheapest source of energy. For example in China, many miners are located in the Sichuan province because of its abundant hydroelectricity. Another example is an Australian entrepreneur who is building a 20 megawatt (MW) solar-powered mining farm. If the energy use of cryptocurrency miners continue to increase it will help decrease the costs of renewables for society at large (increased demand → increased RD → increased capacity higher efficiency → lower costs through economies of scale).”\nElectricity costs have already put miners in search for a cheaper source of energy. Companies have been looking to places like Canada and the Sichuan province where electricity is typically cheaper. Because miners have incentives to use cheap electricity, this leads to more RD in the energy space. In the long run, this should make forms of electricity cheaper to all of society as innovations are made in energy. The Price of Network Security\nAlthough the amount of energy mining operations consume does not go unnoticed, some individuals believe that the benefits of mining – network security – outweigh the negative externalities like electricity consumption.\nThe Bitcoin network is secured by a consensus algorithm called proof-of-work (PoW) . Miners are paid newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees for solving a block, securing the network in the process. If a miner is not able to solve the cryptographic proof, blocks of transaction history would not be added to the blockchain and blockchain technology as a whole would be nullified; no record of transaction history would be created if blocks were not solved and added to the chain by miners. The cost that has to be paid for this network security is the large amounts of energy that a PoW consensus consumes.\nCypherpunk Jameson Lopp took to twitter to express how he feels about Bitcoin’s energy expenditure problem. Lopp believes that the electricity expense that Bitcoin mining accrues is simply a tax that must be paid for network security. Whining about the energy expenditure to secure Bitcoin against computational attacks will have no effect. The Bitcoin ecosystem pays contractors (miners) for security; if you want them to stop then you’ll have to make a better offer on the open market.\n— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) May 18, 2018\nEconomic researcher Vasily Sumanov also believes that energy inefficiency and waste is currently the price we pay to conduct blockchain experiments:\n“Higher energy consumption is associated not only with environmental pollution but also with the higher security of a distributed ledger dedicated to storage and transfer of value. I have a strong feeling that this is a temporary situation, and in the future, Bitcoin energy efficiency as a function of transaction volume and energy consumption will increase as a result of Lightning Network adoption.”\n“Just look at any other industry, for example, cars or electronic devices – their environment pollution and energy costs considerably decreased over time as these industries developed. So why do people expect high energy efficiency from the Bitcoin in the very beginning? It is only 9 years old.” Consensus algorithm\nPoW is currently the most popular form of consensus on a blockchain network. Before transactions are verified, miners must solve cryptographic proofs. However, it is also the most energy intensive form of consensus. Alternatives that consume less energy like Proof-of-Stake and the Lightning Network are being developed to make blockchain networks more efficient. But for the most part, these innovations have not officially launched. Bitcoin is still in its early stages and is not even 10 years old yet, and throughout history, it is not uncommon for technologies to be sub-optimal in their beginning stages. Improving efficiency\nAt the same time, there are people working towards solutions for these network problems. The Ethereum network is looking into proof-of-stake solutions to increase its efficiency while decreasing electricity consumption; the Bitcoin network is looking to implement the Lightning Network. But until these solutions are out of their test net phases and go live, PoW will continue to be criticized for its electricity consumption.\nOnce the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is optimized, the overall efficiency of the Bitcoin network will increase. In an academic paper titled Banking on Blockchain: Costs Savings Thanks to the Blockchain Technology , Luisanna Cocco , Andrea Pinna , and Michele Marchesi from the University of Cagliari’s electrical engineering and computer science departments, found that Bitcoin must increase its economic efficiency, operational efficiency, and service efficiency before it truly optimizes global financial infrastructures. “In a nutshell, all of our results show that the overall efficiency of the Bitcoin system can increase only after overcoming its main limitations: the low number of transactions per block and the too high computational power that it currently needs”\nBitcoin is useful for its transparent ledger, secure data storage, and user empowerment features, but is going to struggle with mass adoption until it can sort out scalability and energy consumption problems . The total amount of Bitcoin that can ever exist is 21 mln , and as mining rigs consume more energy, miners incur higher electricity bills, and the reward for mining Bitcoin diminishes. Eventually, the profit from Bitcoin mining alone will not be enough to cover the electricity expense. In the future, miners will need to supplement their electricity cost payment with money from the transaction fees they receive for signing a block. Is the energy expenditure worth it?\nAlthough some people believe that the amount of energy mining consumes is problematic, it is difficult to measure how much of society is benefiting from Bitcoin. Bevand told Cointelegraph: “Answering “is Bitcoin’s energy consumption worth it?” is very subjective, because we don’t have any hard data measuring how much Bitcoin is helping society. How many Venezuelan are using it to escape inflation? How many families are using it for international remittance and therefore avoiding the average fee of 7.13 percent of remittance providers? How many Bitcoin millionaires given back their newfound wealth to charities? We don’t have much data for any of these questions. I don’t think that the current level of energy consumption is worrisome. We are only at 0.2-0.5 percent of the worldwide electricity consumption. Like Morgan Stanley researchers said in their reports cryptocurrency miners are currently just a “blip on the radar” for utilities”\nSo far, there is no way for the world to quantitatively measure or know how many people are using Bitcoin , what they are using it for, and if it is making their lives better. But individuals like Bevand and businesses like Morgan Stanley say there’s no need to worry, because Bitcoin mining consumes such a small fraction of the world’s total electricity consumption. Innovation is imperative\nAlthough we may not be able to see the toll that Bitcoin mining is taking on our environment with the naked eye, there is no doubt that the Bitcoin network will have to reduce its energy consumption before the Bitcoin blockchain undergoes mass adoption. It would not be surprising to see a regulating body create policy and regulation for miners in attempt to control/reduce electricity consumption .\nBecause Bitcoin miners are so sensitive to the price of electricity, this should push RD in the energy space and produce more efficient energy solutions. It is hard to get an understanding of the positive vs negatives externalities of Bitcoin, so it is hard to say if the amount of energy consumed is truly “worth it”. But if the amount of electricity consumed by mining is not kept under control or made more efficient, then it is possible that the impact to the environment will be irreversible once people become aware of the negative effects that Bitcoin mining had on it.

Neighboring Delaware will hold that honor.\nNew Jersey's plan to roll out sports betting at Monmouth Park and in Atlantic City has been on hold while state lawmakers work on a regulation bill.\nMonmouth Park operator Dennis Drazin said \"of course\" he's disappointed that New Jersey won't go online first.\n\"But, I'm going to continue to support our legislative process,\" he said.\nNeedless-to-say, Florida gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds.

Using Bitcoin? Written by: Published on: Jun/02/2018\nFor this year's FIFA World Cup, the best way to place bets online from Delaware will be with bitcoin using a cryptocurrency wallet that can be linked to one's banking account. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL DELAWARE WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nGambling911.com is happy to announce that Delaware is open for business this World Cup as they already had the pieces in place to begin offering legalized sports betting at their three state casinos.\nDelaware Park, Dover Downs Hotel & Casino and Harrington Raceway & Casino will begin taking single-game bets on baseball, football, hockey, basketball, soccer, golf and auto racing at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday June 5, just days before the start of this year’s World Cup.\nNeedless-to-say, Delaware gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal.

He said that the easiest country had been the US, particularly San Francisco, where Bitcoin acceptance was widespread around the city.\nHe struggled in Cuba having to revert to cash. In Asia, he said his cash usage again was high and found a higher degree of Bitcoin acceptance in South America.\nHard Fork’s Neer Varshney researched how this picture might pan out in today’s crypto space by contacting airlines: the first port of call for any travelers. He found that there are multiple airlines accepting cryptocurrency payments including CheapAir.com, who started accepting cryptocurrency payments as far back as 2013. The company now accepts Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Dash payments.\nOther companies offering cryptocurrency booking services included Expedia, BTCtrip.com, Destinia.com, Japan’s Peach Aviation, California’s Surf Air, and Latvia’s airBaltic, and A Bit Sky.\nFinding a placed to stay has become even easier as most of these companies also allow you to pay in crypto for accommodation too, although it depends on exactly which part of the world the traveler chooses.\nEating is not quite such a simple affair with limited restaurants and cafes around the globe accepting Bitcoin and other currencies. Although, CoinMap can help travelers find a Bitcoin-accepting venue for the next meal. La Sirene in Manhattan now accepts Bitcoin. Some companies now offer a gift card service which can be used to purchase food coupons for Bitcoin.\nShopping has become easier with many online stores now accepting the popular cryptocurrency, and as revealed in the last week if you land in Brisbane, the International airport there will be welcoming crypto payments in all its terminal shops and cafe’s this year.\nThe last resort, of course, is to hunt down a Bitcoin ATM. This is good news for the traveler, as there are now over 3000 such ATMs worldwide, and if South America is the list, then Argentina must be a destination for the discerning Bitcoin traveler, with its plan to install 30,000 machines in that country alone. Europe and the US are increasingly installing machines to keep up with customer demand, most machines offering Bitcoin and often a choice of other major digital currencies.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post A Traveler’s Guide: How to See the World With Bitcoin in 2018 appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

As more miners join the Bitcoin network , some individuals fear that the amount of electricity consumed by mining will have a negative impact on the environment. Others believe that the benefits of Bitcoin mining outweigh the cost it takes to produce the digital currency.\nBitcoin mining and energy consumption New Bitcoin are produced through a process called mining , where computers expend energy and computational resources to solve a difficult math problem that verifies a recent block of Bitcoin transactions. The miner who solves the math problem adds the block to the blockchain and receives newly minted Bitcoin. The difficulty of the math problem depends on how much computational power the network has in summation. As the Bitcoin network attracts more miners, the mining difficulty increases, and usually, the amount of energy a mining rig consumes increases too.\nThe Bitcoin network currently consumes about 2.55 gigawatts (GW) of electricity per year; to put that into perspective, the entire country of Ireland has an average electricity consumption of 3.1 GW , and Austria has an average electricity consumption of 8.2 GW per year. Over the past year, the estimated amount of TwH that the Bitcoin network consumes per year increased 413.37 percent. When compared to countries like the Czech Republic, the Bitcoin network uses 102.3 percent of the entire electricity consumed by the country per year.\nData consultant and blockchain specialist Alex De Vries believes that the amount of energy Bitcoin mining consumes is problematic. In a recent research study published in Joule, De Vries found that the average amount of electricity consumed per Bitcoin transaction is 300 kwH, and at the rate new miners are joining the network – and the mining difficulty increases – this number has the potential to reach 900 KwH by the end of 2018.\nDe Vries told Cointelegraph that even though society can not see the changes being made to the environment via Bitcoin mining, mining operations are not helping the world get closer to their climate and environmental goals:\n“We know that mining is done with coal-electricity, but also with renewable energy. In the latter case, we don’t know what we are displacing, plus renewable energy never has zero lifetime carbon footprint either. There’s more work to be done here, but there’s certainly an impact. The more energy Bitcoin uses, the more it will impact the environment for sure – which in turn will impact everyone. It’s not helping us reach our climate goals.”\nThere is a grey area when it comes to figuring out how Bitcoin mining is impacting the environment. Although some of the electricity used is sourced from coal , mining operations usually do not release carbon emissions themselves. Just because miners do not see the physical impact that mining has on the environment, the amount of resources consumed and the opportunity cost involved should be concerning in itself.\nHash rate and energy consumption The amount of energy mining consumes seems to be increasing. As mining equipment becomes better at solving blocks, the electricity consumed by each mining rig increases. To stay ahead of their competitors, miners are always looking for mining equipment with a higher hashrate . The hashrate is the speed at which the miner is able to provide answers to the math problem. The higher the hash rate, the faster one can guess the answer to the problem.\nAt first, the problem was easy enough to be solved by a standard CPU , but as more miners joined the network and the problem became more difficult, miners found that GPU were better suited to solve the problem. Just a few years later, FPGAs and then ASICs – application specific integrated circuits – were better suited than GPUs to solve a block.\nOthers, like entrepreneur and former Google information security engineer Marc Bevand, believe that the amount of energy that mining consumes will cause further innovation in the form of renewable energies. Bevand believes that the energy consumption will eventually lead to decreased costs of renewable energy for society at large:\n“Because miners are so sensitive to electricity prices, they are often a driver pushing utilities to further develop renewables which are now the cheapest source of energy. For example in China, many miners are located in the Sichuan province because of its abundant hydroelectricity. Another example is an Australian entrepreneur who is building a 20 megawatt (MW) solar-powered mining farm. If the energy use of cryptocurrency miners continue to increase it will help decrease the costs of renewables for society at large (increased demand → increased R&D → increased capacity & higher efficiency → lower costs through economies of scale).”\nElectricity costs have already put miners in search for a cheaper source of energy. Companies have been looking to places like Canada and the Sichuan province where electricity is typically cheaper. Because miners have incentives to use cheap electricity, this leads to more R&D in the energy space. In the long run, this should make forms of electricity cheaper to all of society as innovations are made in energy.\nThe Price of Network Security Although the amount of energy mining operations consume does not go unnoticed, some individuals believe that the benefits of mining – network security – outweigh the negative externalities like electricity consumption.\nThe Bitcoin network is secured by a consensus algorithm called proof-of-work (PoW) . Miners are paid newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees for solving a block, securing the network in the process. If a miner is not able to solve the cryptographic proof, blocks of transaction history would not be added to the blockchain and blockchain technology as a whole would be nullified; no record of transaction history would be created if blocks were not solved and added to the chain by miners. The cost that has to be paid for this network security is the large amounts of energy that a PoW consensus consumes.\nCypherpunk Jameson Lopp took to twitter to express how he feels about Bitcoin’s energy expenditure problem. Lopp believes that the electricity expense that Bitcoin mining accrues is simply a tax that must be paid for network security.\nWhining about the energy expenditure to secure Bitcoin against computational attacks will have no effect. The Bitcoin ecosystem pays contractors (miners) for security; if you want them to stop then you'll have to make a better offer on the open market.\n— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) May 18, 2018\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nEconomic researcher Vasily Sumanov also believes that energy inefficiency and waste is currently the price we pay to conduct blockchain experiments:\n“Higher energy consumption is associated not only with environmental pollution but also with the higher security of a distributed ledger dedicated to storage and transfer of value. I have a strong feeling that this is a temporary situation, and in the future, Bitcoin energy efficiency as a function of transaction volume and energy consumption will increase as a result of Lightning Network adoption.”\n“Just look at any other industry, for example, cars or electronic devices – their environment pollution and energy costs considerably decreased over time as these industries developed. So why do people expect high energy efficiency from the Bitcoin in the very beginning? It is only 9 years old.”\nConsensus algorithm PoW is currently the most popular form of consensus on a blockchain network. Before transactions are verified, miners must solve cryptographic proofs. However, it is also the most energy intensive form of consensus. Alternatives that consume less energy like Proof-of-Stake and the Lightning Network are being developed to make blockchain networks more efficient.\nBut for the most part, these innovations have not officially launched. Bitcoin is still in its early stages and is not even 10 years old yet, and throughout history, it is not uncommon for technologies to be sub-optimal in their beginning stages.\nImproving efficiency At the same time, there are people working towards solutions for these network problems. The Ethereum network is looking into proof-of-stake solutions to increase its efficiency while decreasing electricity consumption; the Bitcoin network is looking to implement the Lightning Network. But until these solutions are out of their test net phases and go live, PoW will continue to be criticized for its electricity consumption.\nOnce the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is optimized, the overall efficiency of the Bitcoin network will increase. In an academic paper titled Banking on Blockchain: Costs Savings Thanks to the Blockchain Technology , Luisanna Cocco , Andrea Pinna , and Michele Marchesi from the University of Cagliari’s electrical engineering and computer science departments, found that Bitcoin must increase its economic efficiency, operational efficiency, and service efficiency before it truly optimizes global financial infrastructures.\n “In a nutshell, all of our results show that the overall efficiency of the Bitcoin system can increase only after overcoming its main limitations: the low number of transactions per block and the too high computational power that it currently needs”\nBitcoin is useful for its transparent ledger, secure data storage, and user empowerment features, but is going to struggle with mass adoption until it can sort out scalability and energy consumption problems . The total amount of Bitcoin that can ever exist is 21 mln , and as mining rigs consume more energy, miners incur higher electricity bills, and the reward for mining Bitcoin diminishes. Eventually, the profit from Bitcoin mining alone will not be enough to cover the electricity expense. In the future, miners will need to supplement their electricity cost payment with money from the transaction fees they receive for signing a block.\nIs the energy expenditure worth it? Although some people believe that the amount of energy mining consumes is problematic, it is difficult to measure how much of society is benefiting from Bitcoin. Bevand told Cointelegraph:\n“Answering \"is Bitcoin's energy consumption worth it?\" is very subjective, because we don't have any hard data measuring how much Bitcoin is helping society. How many Venezuelan are using it to escape inflation? How many families are using it for international remittance and therefore avoiding the average fee of 7.13 percent of remittance providers? How many Bitcoin millionaires given back their newfound wealth to charities? We don't have much data for any of these questions. I don't think that the current level of energy consumption is worrisome. We are only at 0.2-0.5 percent of the worldwide electricity consumption. Like Morgan Stanley researchers said in their reports cryptocurrency miners are currently just a \"blip on the radar\" for utilities”\nSo far, there is no way for the world to quantitatively measure or know how many people are using Bitcoin , what they are using it for, and if it is making their lives better. But individuals like Bevand and businesses like Morgan Stanley say there's no need to worry, because Bitcoin mining consumes such a small fraction of the world's total electricity consumption.\nInnovation is imperative Although we may not be able to see the toll that Bitcoin mining is taking on our environment with the naked eye, there is no doubt that the Bitcoin network will have to reduce its energy consumption before the Bitcoin blockchain undergoes mass adoption. It would not be surprising to see a regulating body create policy and regulation for miners in attempt to control/reduce electricity consumption .\nBecause Bitcoin miners are so sensitive to the price of electricity, this should push R&D in the energy space and produce more efficient energy solutions. It is hard to get an understanding of the positive vs negatives externalities of Bitcoin, so it is hard to say if the amount of energy consumed is truly “worth it”. But if the amount of electricity consumed by mining is not kept under control or made more efficient, then it is possible that the impact to the environment will be irreversible once people become aware of the negative effects that Bitcoin mining had on it.\nfrom Cryptocracken Blogger https://ift.tt/2JeHWNV\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitc", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T01:02:18.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "532c682eb1e677fe508ff245c8c19b7cfaf1cbd0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ynIHQpIcbOvjn7zralcqHtV3tHlJ4E3FO7QKYisDktP4hmWLlY5ph6JStBk6oomGjL6DIlCHuy3HUiKANT22PpBLVL99rq_YY8_5cNtGkeqoR26U2RPozhCFExpJ1752sORI0EQ49PydwUKkMlBSkxunUpZ9Owxk-", "site_full": "www.afr.com", "site": "afr.com", "site_section": "http://www.afr.com/news/policy", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Australian Government Policy News | afr.com", "title": "Home offices, digital economy, bitcoin top targets for ATO tax return crackdown", "title_full": "Home offices, digital economy, bitcoin top targets for ATO tax return crackdown | afr.com", "published": "2018-06-03T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.787, "main_image": "https://www.afr.com/content/dam/images/g/h/1/l/v/x/image.related.afrArticleLead.620x365.h10tq0.png/1527831605385.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 16906, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "532c682eb1e677fe508ff245c8c19b7cfaf1cbd0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ynIHQpIcbOvjn7zralcqHtV3tHlJ4E3FO7QKYisDktP4hmWLlY5ph6JStBk6oomGjL6DIlCHuy3HUiKANT22PpBLVL99rq_YY8_5cNtGkeqoR26U2RPozhCFExpJ1752sORI0EQ49PydwUKkMlBSkxunUpZ9Owxk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Duncan Hughes", "published": "2018-06-03T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Home offices, digital economy, bitcoin top targets for ATO tax return crackdown", "text": "If elected, Labor will increase taxes on high-end super contributions, restrict negative gearing and reduce the capital gains tax discount.
