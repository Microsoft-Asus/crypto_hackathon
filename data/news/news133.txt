From local media reports, it seems as if the company is attempting to modernize its infrastructure to better align with the present. The company stated, “We want to get closer with the young generation and not be perceived as old.” Sponsored Links Accepting Bitcoin as Payment was Necessary\nThe national energy giant will begin taking payments in bitcoin from June 2018. Users that log on to the website of the company to pay their bills will be redirected to a new payment gateway with the option to pay with crypto. By default, there will be two payment options available to users. One being the Czech currency Koruna and the other, bitcoin.\nHN Paul Janecek, who serves on the Board of Directors of Prazska Plynarenska, said:\n“We will open a payment gateway in June, which will automatically convert our payment in cryptocurrency to the normal currency, so we will not speculate on the development, but if anyone wants to pay an alternative way, we want to allow it.”\nAccepting bitcoin is a part of the company’s image makeover as it tries to make itself more appealing to the younger generations. Prazska Plynarenska will also soon be rolling out CNG car rental advertisements on YouTube. Paul said, “We are trying to go to the young customers across the street, we do not want to be perceived as old dysfunctional company.”\nThe company has stated, however, that it will not hold any bitcoin. As soon as a payment is made through the gateway, any crypto will be converted to a fiat currency, including possibly the euro. Czech Merchants Accepting Cryptocurrency\nEnergy giant Prazska Plynarenska is not the first to accept bitcoin as a payment method in the country. Online e-commerce major Alza.cz has been accepting bitcoins from buyers since February 2018. The move has paid great dividends for them as bitcoin payments are quick and still relatively easy to use for the end user. Bitcoin payments also come with the added bonus of lower fees than that imposed by credit card providers.\nJan Sadilek, Head of Internet Marketing at Alza.cz said, “The number of orders that are paid through bitcoin is increasing in Alza since the introduction of sales into tens of millions and thousands of orders, and to a large extent BTC is used to buy cryptocurrency mining components, as well as hardware wallets.”\nA growing number of other merchants have also started accepting cryptocurrencies. Paralelní Polis, a cafe in Prague which is at the center of all bitcoin and cryptocurrency activities in the Czech Republic and declines any payments with fiat currency. A number of bitcoin ATMs have also popped up in the Czech Republic. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are 46 bitcoin ATMs in the country with 34 of them situated in Prague. Regulatory Hurdles\nIn the past, ECB President Mario Draghi has said that there is a great need to regulate cryptocurrencies. However, he failed to provide a timeframe for any forthcoming legislation.\nIt is unlikely that the Czech Republic will close the door on cryptocurrencies given their popularity in the country. The only reason regulation is necessary is because of concerns over cryptocurrencies being used to facilitate money laundering, smuggling and even financing illegal activities.

The ADAMANT Project team have already developed a Messenger that includes basic functionalities for instant private-messaging and token transfers. In order to extend the use of the ADAMANT platform, the developers are now turning their attention to the highly-desirable use-case of a combined token-transfer system that allows for multi-token transfers and a greater variety of integrated payment options. Cover by @Azza1070 (Telegram) The ambitious goal to create a built-in, multi-token transfer system within the messenger is the key focus for the ADAMANT development team at this point in time, with plans to stretch the use of the platform far beyond the ADM token. The goal of the ADAMANT team is to allow major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lisk, and others, to be transferred within private chats. If the ADAMANT team succeeds in its development of this system, these tokens will soon be able to be sent and received within the private messaging platform, signalling a breakthrough in private-messaging services. In order to add increased value to the ADAMANT Messenger platform, developers are also focusing on the use of their token within the ADAMANT ecosystem. The (ADM) token’s current features are as follows: ADM token can be used as a transfer fee for messaging & payments to maintain the whole network infrastructure; ADM token has a 5-second block time; this means fast transaction speeds; Is available on chat screens and is easily accessible for making direct payments; Is a completely independent token and is built as a self-sufficient system. By incorporating major cryptocurrencies into the token transfer ecosystem, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and LISK community members will be attracted to the ADAMANT Messenger platform to send and receive tokens of their choice more easily via private chats. In-turn, this will likely generate higher fees and a greater demand for the ADM token. Cover by @Azza1070 (Telegram) Privacy Matters. ADAMANT is a secure blockchain-platform for data and message transfers built on-top of a LISK codebase. ADAMANT takes data privacy very seriously. The blockchain provides anonymity that does not allow the chat history of a user to be traced. Social networking users post extravagant amounts of personal information everyday, ignoring the fact that their data is sent and stored amongst third party centralized servers operated by large conglomerates and companies that are able to greedily profit from the use of their data. The belief that your information is safe amongst third party servers is delusional at best, relentless cyber-attacks prove that even the largest, most-secure companies are unable to prevent data from being stolen. Companies are able to freely disclose data to other businesses and governments. The complications of centralized and third party servers is indefinite. Complete solutions to privacy are a necessity for any society seeking to regain control of their privacy and data. The only requirement to use the ADAMANT Messenger? A private key that can be created within ONE click . The barrier for entry is lower than all social networks available on the market today. You do not have to provide your first or last name, email address, phone number, or any device information. With open-source code, any user is allowed to publicly view the authenticity of the system in-which they’re using. Users can audit the code independently and even build and create fully-functional systems on their own. Here are a few important features of the ADAMANT Messenger: No access to the user’s address book; All chat history is stored in the Blockchain; No access to the user’s location information; No user identifications — complete anonymity of use; Messages are encrypted on the sender’s device and then decrypted on the recipients side. The client app never transfers a user’s Private Key or mnemonic phrase (your password) over the network. All work is done locally on the user’s device; therefore no Private Data is transferred; Message history is never stored on a machine and is directly loaded from the Blockchain; Unlike P2P-Messengers, it is impossible to obtain the user’s IP-address; ADAMANT Code and Blockchain is Open-Source; ADAMANT accounts cannot be closed, blocked or limited by anyone, including the developers. ADAMANT proves that blockchain messengers have their advantages. Open-source, trustless, distributed, and reliable infrastructure with proven security models that provide complete immutability (no messages can be changed), but more importantly: all blockchain integrations and cross-chain communications are possible. As the world advances, new technologies such as ADAMANT make it more convenient for everyday users and businesses to interact and communicate with each other, without the interruption and regulation of third parties. ADAMANT aims to solve the problems of privacy and provide truly anonymous freedom of messaging.

The method to collect money is an ICO. The chance that you are being scammed is there, the chance of losing money is also there. So it’s time to look for a method to earn money.\nThat is why it is earning money in the suppliers. Well, you could, of course, invest money in companies like Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Oracle and so on. But everyone does that. The real returns can be found in a different angle.\nIf those bitcoins and other crypto coins have to be made by computers. Those computers use a lot of energy. In China they therefore have subsidies, in Iceland they have geothermal energy. But the rest of the world? If you realize that the use of bitcoins and other crypto coins is as much energy as in Argentina? profits can be earned! Especially now that the oil price is going up. The sustainable alternatives such as sun and wind are therefore even more attractive! Sun and wind are becoming increasingly cheaper. Do you also want to benefit from this?

I'm here to get input, quotes, resources, and feedback from anyone involved in Bitcoin education. I'm an educator in Seoul, Korea, and I also help organize the Seoul Bitcoin meetup with a few others. For a graduate school course I'm taking in Visual Media Technology, I'll be creating a presentation on The Benefits of Teaching Bitcoin. This project will satisfy my course requirements but will also be presented by me at an upcoming Seoul Bitcoin meetup in early July. My presentation will mainly be centered on the following components but will will also include how Bitcoin works by the nature of these components: 1) Teaching about Bitcoin can help learners understand and take interest in: economics, game theory, information theory, privacy and censorship, ethics, politics, cryptography, coding (explanation of how it's true and why it's important) 2) How to teach about Bitcoin (what to start with and steps through the process & useful methods/activities/analogies) My goal is to explain how teaching about Bitcoin can be a valuable educational tool. I'd appreciate any of your thoughts, experiences, resources (links, video, images, Ppts). Title: Bitcoin: A Cross-Curriculum Education Tool Format: PowerPoint Presentation Exigency: Bitcoin is something I have grown to love studying and teaching about. It encompasses aspects of my childhood education that I have always disliked, yet which I now enjoy. I believe Bitcoin can serve as a strong educational tool to motivate and educate young learners, garnering interest in important fields that are often taught with little real world application. Bitcoin can solve those teaching woes because it is shockingly brilliant. Audience: My audience will be learners (high school and up) who know little to nothing beyond having heard the word “Bitcoin”, but who are willing to learn about it and open to the possibility that it might be a good for it to be used as an educational tool to possibly incorporate into a classroom curriculum. Constraints: There are perhaps too many aspects of Bitcoin to explain, yet they are all important to the system. Some parts are very technical, and it will be challenging to find a balance between explaining certain things at a surface level and diving deep into the technical details.

Experts predict that the Bitcoin price would reach $60000 by end of this year.\nBitcoin currently surviving at the price of 8.3k dollar and is considering as a stable price in comparison with other times. This stability in the price of Bitcoin is responsible for its demand which is considering in equilibrium that is why the value is stable.

This was the same person who first reported XVG’s previous attack, not too long ago.\nRegarding the last hack, Ocminer believes XVG only patched the exploit and that’s why it’s under attack again. Several members of the community reported XVG’s mining difficulty to be at 0.002.\nWhile some celebrated and hoped to wake up rich the next day, others warned their earnings would be invalid due to the hack. As for XVG, it tweeted about the incident, but there wasn’t any mention of the stolen XVG.

The markets continue to favor the downside as the US dollar has been the strongest fiat currency that I follow, and I think that the market rallying gives you an opportunity to pick up the greenback “on the cheap.” I think that we will more than likely go towards the $7000 level, and then the $6000 level as it is a major support level. If we break down below there, it’s likely that this market will unwind rather drastically. Currently, it looks as if the $8000 level will offer a major “ceiling.”\nGet Into Bitcoin Trading Today\nBTC/JPY Bitcoin fell significantly during the trading session on Friday, reaching towards the ¥800,000 level. If we break down below there, then the market more than likely goes down to the ¥700,000 level. The ¥700,000 level is the bottom of the overall consolidation that we have been in for some time. If we were to break down below there, then the market would drastically unwind and fall apart rather rapidly. I think that we will more than likely see some type of support there to cause a bounce, but currently it looks as if the crypto currency markets are falling apart. I believe that the ¥1 million level is now the “ceiling” in the market, and it should not be lost on traders that we have not been able to reach the top of the longer-term consolidation this last rally.

00:04 34 Views Argentinian Banco Masventas (BMV), has announced a partnership Bitex to enable clients to use Bitcoin for international payments as an alternative to SWIFT, according to a Facebook post May 21. Bitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider based in Latin America. According to BMV, the new service allows customers to transfer money from account to account in less time than traditional bank transfers. BMV states that the new service will reduce transfer times by up to 24 hours. José Humberto Dakak, a principal shareholder of Masventas, said that the move intends to strengthen the bank’s digital and smartphone-based services and reduce banking service costs. He said: “One of the initiatives is to use Bitex as a strategic partner to provide our overseas customers with payment and collection services at the Bitex Exchange.” In addition to expediting transfers, Bitex claims that it can provide more secure transactions. According to their website, Bitex observes “the strictest compliance rules” and know-your-client (KYC) measures. They have also hired one of the “Big Four” accounting and audit firms, Deloitte , to serve as an impartial third party to review and report on operations, procedures, as well as on balances and funds of users and the company. Earlier this month, a pilot of Ripple (XRP)’s xRapid platform was launched, which is designed to facilitate cross-border fiat transfers between financial institutions. Organizations who participated in the project reported transaction savings of 40-70 percent. Payments through the new pilot reportedly took around two minutes, as opposed to the average 2-3 days required by many conventional cross-border payments.\nIn March, financial messaging provider SWIFT published a report on how distributed ledger technology (DLT) proof of concept (PoC) could help nostro account reconciliations. According to SWIFT, the PoC, “went extremely well, proving the fantastic progress that has been made with DLT and the Hyperledger fabric in particular.” 9 Argentinian Bank Bitcoin CrossBorder Transactions See more", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/deloitte", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/swifts-blockchain-pilot-for-bank-to-bank-transfers-went-extremely-well", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/kyc", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/payments", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/proof-of-concept", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ledger", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nostroaccount.asp", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-cross-border-payments-pilot-financial-institutions-report-significant-time-cost-savings"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josé humberto dakak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "argentinian bank now using bitcoin for cross-border transactions argentinian bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitex exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T15:45:13.074+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7afecf45b4e0e28c6aa950342e5a5e2e512cccd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme3WI7HOSNQQoRJ6kKQqS20-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Do you think capital controls in China will impact bitcoin price?", "title_full": "Do you think capital controls in China will impact bitcoin price?", "published": "2018-05-26T12:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7afecf45b4e0e28c6aa950342e5a5e2e512cccd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme3WI7HOSNQQoRJ6kKQqS20-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "maculeth", "published": "2018-05-26T12:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Do you think capital controls in China will impact bitcoin price?", "text": "yes, though not entirely influential. because market cap and bitcoin market capitalization is not only in china.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T10:04:08.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df684541ec560e4e4766603984e998abc3391120", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme2464.nAjZXH93DkxlvyJ4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=224.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation (Altcoins)", "title": "PayPal CEO said bitcoin SCAM !", "title_full": "PayPal CEO said bitcoin SCAM !", "published": "2018-05-26T12:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.135, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df684541ec560e4e4766603984e998abc3391120", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme2464.nAjZXH93DkxlvyJ4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "morgan4140", "published": "2018-05-26T12:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "PayPal CEO said bitcoin SCAM !", "text": "Then why did he even develop a project on blockchain?

As a result of Bitcoin has fallen-rates of about three percent in the last 24 hours. Current state of play to Bitcoin’s Gold (BTG)\nAfter the first step of the Forks, a “Snap-Shot” of the Bitcoin-to create a Blockchain as the basis for the creation of the replica, was made, there was, according to the BTG group is a DDoS (“Distributed Denial-of-Service”) attack.\nThere have been a plethora of requests to the Server of BTG, which resulted in an outage of all services.\nThe website of the project was the whole of Tuesday on is not reachable. The BTG group is not the information of the current property stand out.\nOnly on Twitter, it was reported that it was the target of a DDoS attack, and 10 million requests per Minute to receive. Who stands behind it, is unclear.\nAs a result of the events there is no price for Bitcoin Gold (BTG). Own blocks have not been created yet.\nA usable Wallet, block Explorer, or other Tracking Tools were not yet published.\nAs in the run-up to the Forks, the voices on the Internet, the designate BTG as a fraud are on the increase.

The fact is that already in the run-up to a variety of Problem existed and virtually no transparency to the project was given.\nIt might as well be possible that as a result of the frenzied speculation before the Hard Fork the website is real user requests, not more.\nEventually, probably) a lot of people have invested (extra in Bitcoin, get free Bitcoin Gold. Consequently, it would not be surprising if they want to know many millions of people, such as the status of the project and the website on a regular basis to call.\nOn the other hand, it is also likely to Bitcoin for the settlement of disputes in the Bitcoin Community and the controversial views of Gold the project will be the target for attacks.\nThe real reason we don’t know and can speculate. The fact is that there are significant problems and continues to be virtually no transparency in Bitcoin Gold.\nFirst platforms to report no support for Bitcoin Gold\nThe Wallet service provider Jaxx and the online platform Coinbase have announced support for security reasons, Bitcoin Gold.\nJaxx answered relatively clearly and expressed that Bitcoin Gold is not a functioning code base and no Replay-Protection.\nIn addition, the Code could not be tested so far on safety. Thus, BTG could be for security reasons not supported.\nAlso, Coinbase stated that it sees no sufficient guarantee of the security and, therefore, currently Bitcoin, Gold does not offer.\nDisclaimer: — trading in crypto-currencies carries a large financial risk, and can be up to a total loss of the invested capital.

Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 percent to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. It’s down more than 20 percent since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders Colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading -- forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise -- it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 -- has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry.\nSome market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nBy Matt Robinson and Tom Schoenberg\nhttps://www.geezgo.com/sps/25564 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price manipulation the justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T11:44:02.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "264d60dd4ee718fadcfb8935349b2751872b9421", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU3Q_K3i88h.4iVzIBffJ6U-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=224.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation (Altcoins)", "title": "bitcoin or ethereum ?", "title_full": "bitcoin or ethereum ?", "published": "2018-05-26T11:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.641, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "264d60dd4ee718fadcfb8935349b2751872b9421", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU3Q_K3i88h.4iVzIBffJ6U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kicauklaten", "published": "2018-05-26T11:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin or ethereum ?", "text": "Ethereum has significantly lower capitalization so I think that the growth of this crypto currency is more likely.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T08:30:56.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63c9851c160f22f5b8a8723d81aa66ce690f6a40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaVCPxuJt_1Dmjn1VrLCEWw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Depending your future in bitcoin...", "title_full": "Depending your future in bitcoin...", "published": "2018-05-26T11:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63c9851c160f22f5b8a8723d81aa66ce690f6a40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaVCPxuJt_1Dmjn1VrLCEWw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gurang", "published": "2018-05-26T11:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Depending your future in bitcoin...", "text": "Quote: from: IvyAguas on March 12, 2018, 02:55:15 PM I think bitcoin is really a good investment for now, but I don't think it is a good idea to put all your investment in bitcoin or crypto currencies since it is unpredictable and very risky to take.

It’s too unstable and erratic, plus people need to know the pound in their pocket is going to be worth pretty much the same today, tomorrow, and next year.\nOn top of that, the US Justice Department has commenced criminal investigations into the possibility that traders might be manipulating the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. And we surely don’t need reminding of the punishments meted out to those banks that tried much more subtle manipulation in the Libor rate scandal of 2012.\nThe fact that bitcoin really doesn’t work like a currency is a conclusion that more and more commentators are reaching, as the intangible stuff keeps on gyrating in value. From trading at more than $19,000 per bitcoin at its peak, we’re looking at only around $7,500 today.\nSo why is the investment world moving towards seeing bitcoin as akin to gold ? There are some striking similarities.\nFirstly like gold, there’s a finite supply of bitcoin. In fact, the most that can ever exist is limited by its blockchain technology. And that technology, at least in theory, adds a layer of security. It allows bitcoins to be traced to their true owners in a way that gold rarely can — all gold is essentially the same, and it’s easy to melt down and remove any markings.\nThere’s also a ready market for bitcoin, and it can be bought and sold with relative ease. And not being a heavy physical thing, it’s easier to carry around and potentially harder for authorities to control — you can carry far more value in bitcoins on your phone that you can in gold coins in your pocket.\nNot so good But I think some of these similarities are superficial and not as attractive as they might at first seem.\nTake the supply. Sure, there might only be a finite supply of bitcoin itself, but we’re already seeing many alternatives popping up to take advantage of cryptocurrency mania. Who knows where that will end? And that technology is partly restrained by today’s computing limits — and surely only a fool would expect that not to continue to advance dramatically.\nThe tangibility of gold is also, I reckon, actually a benefit. You can see it, touch it, weigh it. And unless you have access to some top-end nuclear technology, there’s not a lot you can do to destroy it — and that certainly can’t be said for bitcoin’s magnetic tweaks on a computer disc.\nThe physicality of gold doesn’t have to be a hindrance either. It’s easy enough to take certificated ownership of gold without ever seeing the metal, and trade it that way.\nBut the real hurdle in the way of bitcoin being seen as a gold substitute is tradition. Everyone understands gold and our species has been hoarding it for millennia — and you can put on a far more impressive bling display with gold than you can with bitcoin.\nSo no, the multitudes on Earth are not going to give up on gold and invest in bitcoin which, to my mind, remains a lousy and very risky investment.\nSo should you buy gold instead? I say no, because gold doesn’t create any new wealth. For that, you need part ownership in productive companies.\nYou Really Could Make A Million\nOf course, picking the right shares and the strategy to be successful in the stock market isn’t easy.

Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 percent to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. It’s down more than 20 percent since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders Colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading -- forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise -- it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 -- has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry.\nSome market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nBy Matt Robinson and Tom Schoenberg\nhttps://www.geezgo.com/sps/25564 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price manipulation the justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T11:11:27.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da4b92c5fdbb4e1512d9a6c20c272bba7acdabbb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbkJEADDtVI0HKlL6dZhCKffLnLkS_mZKSujs4fZSpVZEvAuIX6193o3DPWhl243xg--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Cryptocurrency This Week: As The Bitcoin Celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day, India Mulls To Levy 18% GST On Bitcoins And ...", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency This Week: As The Bitcoin Celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day, India Mulls To Levy 18% GST On Bitcoins And ...", "published": "2018-05-26T11:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da4b92c5fdbb4e1512d9a6c20c272bba7acdabbb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbkJEADDtVI0HKlL6dZhCKffLnLkS_mZKSujs4fZSpVZEvAuIX6193o3DPWhl243xg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-26T11:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency This Week: As The Bitcoin Celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day, India Mulls To Levy 18% GST On Bitcoins And ...", "text": "Cryptocurrency This Week: As The Bitcoin Celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day, India Mulls To Levy 18% GST On Bitcoins And ...\nCryptocurrency This Week: As The Bitcoin Celebrates Bitcoin Pizza Day, India Mulls To Levy 18% GST On Bitcoins And ...

According to Iskra:\nAn unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use ‘51% attacks’ to perform ‘double-spend’ attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.\nA 51 percent attack is no mean feat, even on a small blockchain as a significant amount of computing power is required to pull it off successfully. However, if an attacker were able to hijack a blockchain, combining it with a double-spend would monetize the effort, and this is precisely what the suspected BTG hacker did.\nThe image above is the Bitcoin Gold address of the suspected hacker. The attacker sends a particular number of BTG tokens to an exchange, trades them for another coin and makes a …\nRead more –> click here all content is copyright Bitcoinist.\nNeed Bitcoin marketing and PR?

Let’s take a look at the Chart of Bitcoin (BTC) to see what may be in store moving forward.\nAs we can observe above, Bitcoin (BTC) has officially failed with its second attempt out of an inverted H&S formation and in the process, has now breached both our previously noted 8200 as well as the 7800 potential short-term support levels.\nIn addition, we can also see that BTC now resides beneath all of its important moving averages (20/50/200), which from a technical perspective, remains in an unfavorable posture.\nMoving forward, both investors/traders may want to pay particular attention to the following levels for further clues/evidence with respect to direction.\nIf, at any time in the days ahead, BTC is capable of recapturing both the 7800 as well as the 8200 levels, which were acting as potential support and will now serve as short-term resistance, such development/s, should they materialize, would be a start in repairing the technical damage inflicted.\nOn the flip-side of the coin, both the 7240 as well as the 6880 levels may offer/provide short-term support. Should both levels ‘give way’ at any point in the days/weeks ahead, the probability suggests that a re-test of the February low located at the 6K level is likely.\nNeedless to say, the entire cryptocurrency universe remains under pressure and while we fully suspect that both investors/traders will be treated to some relief in the days ahead, a tremendous amount of technical damage has been levied and will take time in order to repair.\nFor those trading this tape, be sure to keep things on a tight leash and to honor Your Stops.

He predominately used ‘phishing’ email scams to obtain the financial data of tens of thousands of customers. Operating under the pseudonym “Courvoisier”, West would then sell this personal data in different market places on the dark web. West would convert the profit made from selling financial details online into Bitcoins, and store these in multiple accounts.\nWest was sentenced on Friday, 25 May at Southwark Crown Court to ten years and eight months’ imprisonment.\nOfficers from the Met’s Police Cyber Crime Unit (MPCCU) arrested and charged West in September 2017 following a two-year investigation. He was identified as the head of an Organised Crime Network (OCN) which predominantly targeted London-based organisations.\nThroughout the course of the investigation detectives discovered evidence of West conducting cyber attacks on the websites of 17 major firms including Sainsbury’s, Nectar, Groupon, AO.com, Ladbrokes, Coral Betting, Uber, Vitality, RS Feva Class Association 2017, Asda, the British Cardiovascular Society, Mighty Deals Limited, Truly Experiences Ltd, T Mobile, M R Porter, the Finnish Bitcoin exchange, and Argos.\nArrest Rachael Brookes, 26 (22.02.92) of Denbigh, North Wales pleaded guilty to unauthorised use of computer material at Southwark Crown Court on 7 March.\nBrookes was sentenced on Wednesday, 2 May at Southwark Crown Court to a two year community order.\nRachel Brooks\nDetective Chief Superintendent Mick Gallagher, Head of the Met’s Organised Crime Command, said: “This case illustrates the lengths that our detectives will go to in order to pursue offenders on the dark web. We will use many different measures to ensure such offenders are identified, prosecuted and their assets are seized. This is the first time we have seized a cryptocurrency and we are determined to remain one step ahead of cyber criminals who believe they can act with impunity.\n“I wish to thank our partners within the MPS and in both public and private industry who have all assisted with this investigation which was incredibly complex and lengthy. I am very proud of my team for bringing this offender to justice.\n“To reduce your chances of being a victim of cybercrime, it is important to use strong passwords, preferably three different words and numbers and symbols.

His kidnappers had demanded a Bitcoin ransom of roughly $120,000.\nThere is likely no greater fear for a parent than to have their child abducted and held for ransom. Far too often, such crimes end in tragedy. Fortunately for a young man in South Africa, his kidnapping has a happy ending.\nGrabbed While Playing Katlego Marite, a 13-year-old boy, was playing with two friends at a playground in the South African province of Mpumalanga last Sunday. Suddenly, three men in a car pulled up and grabbed him. His parents later received a Bitcoin ransom demand of roughly $120,000 (15 bitcoins).\nThe demand was for a payment of 1 Bitcoin by May 21st, with the remaining 14 coins to be paid by May 27th. A wallet address was included. If the parents did not pay, the kidnappers threatened to kill Katlego.\nWhat makes the case unusual is that Katlego's parents are not wealthy, and they had no idea what cryptocurrency is.\nThree Taken into Custody An apparent break in the case occurred when a family friend showed up shortly after the kidnapping. After seeing CCTV footage of the crime, he drove around to various bars, looking for the car, a Toyota Corolla. The friend eventually found the car in question and alerted authorities, who then took three men into custody.\nThe police have not stated if the three men are involved in the kidnapping, and it is unclear if they are still in police custody. However, the car is still being held by law enforcement.\nSafe and Sound Fortunately, the parents' ordeal is now over. On Thursday, police announced that they have found Katlego Marite and that he is alive and well.\nPolice spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi commented:\nThe combined efforts by the police and the community paid off when Marite was found safe and sound. The circumstances under which he was found are a subject of investigation.\nPolice have not said if the Bitcoin ransom was paid. Nor have they released any further details of the crime and subsequent finding of the victim. Of course, the most important thing is that Katlego Marite is safe and back with his family.\nNeedless to say, this isn't the first time a Bitcoin ransom was demanded by kidnappers. A cryptocurrency exchange managing director, Pavel Lerner, was abducted last December in Kiev and was only released after he paid a $1 million ransom in bitcoins.\nDo you think the media will play up the cryptocurrency angle for this kidnapping story?

But we all knew the risks involved in placing funds with Steven. We all became complacent,” BTC Global said on its website. “Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.”\nSouth African police said they were investigating the alleged fraud, with more than 28,000 investors affected. Police said the company had targeted potential investors with promises of 2 percent interest per day, 14 percent a week and 50 per cent per month.\nPayments to investors were reportedly made every Monday until they suddenly dried up.\nRegulators worldwide are grappling with the boom in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which lure investors with the promise of high returns but are not backed by any central banks.\nOn Thursday, a South African teenager was found four days after he was kidnapped by a gang who demanded a ransom in 15 bitcoins, worth about USD 123,000 (EUR 105,000 or Rs 84 lakhs).\nPolice gave no details about any ransom payment.\nAFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yolisa matakata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape town", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T12:18:11.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0a28779bdb61b1f4697ef657539600a329d2dae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGkbon6ojbh.zv3_Ox39ux7XO6KwtknjIP5AGXEjw0gj0afooqDAnKlYb5XcVAh1K8sbVkbxZ0kePbYmpVP_HAGo-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "The Necessity Of Bitcoin As A Reserve Asset", "title_full": "The Necessity Of Bitcoin As A Reserve Asset : btc", "published": "2018-05-26T10:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.926, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0a28779bdb61b1f4697ef657539600a329d2dae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGkbon6ojbh.zv3_Ox39ux7XO6KwtknjIP5AGXEjw0gj0afooqDAnKlYb5XcVAh1K8sbVkbxZ0kePbYmpVP_HAGo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Erumara", "published": "2018-05-26T10:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Necessity Of Bitcoin As A Reserve Asset", "text": "submitted by /u/Erumara\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-25/necessity-bitcoin-reserve-asset"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T09:31:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "892ac69d0c6f2d1be0096da74a79ec03e229b8cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.srbLmTnqm6b_vTcfD9W4BOYyGA0kYJ7nI5Xb8vy2cxPnXnMtG6x.Q6ubzzqmwYiLfE.hAZt4u4FW", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "What improvements / changes can we expect from Bitcoin Core 0.17.0?", "title_full": "What improvements / changes can we expect from Bitcoin Core 0.17.0?", "published": "2018-05-26T10:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "892ac69d0c6f2d1be0096da74a79ec03e229b8cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.srbLmTnqm6b_vTcfD9W4BOYyGA0kYJ7nI5Xb8vy2cxPnXnMtG6x.Q6ubzzqmwYiLfE.hAZt4u4FW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-26T10:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "What improvements / changes can we expect from Bitcoin Core 0.17.0?", "text": "What improvements / changes can we expect from Bitcoin Core 0.17.0?\n/u/Delmonte91\nHi all,\nas a non-technical Bitcoin enthousiast, I was wondering what new features / changes / improvements there will be in the 0.17.0 version of Bitcoin Core.

However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\nEthereum is top public blockchain in China’s new index\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T10:36:56.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8bdc1e82857cf4b3f204f859b73e76f7dbd4004a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfhGmLoaRwJ4nTdquRdf_SKHrYrVaFzF5kshoAulet3VU8ppnHFmcx1Tyon38DfTLo5lAU3LsSz42vhUhEZ2HTuX1OC1mvZmE-", "site_full": "cmsthemespluginstemplates.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://cmsthemespluginstemplates.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "CMS Themes Plugins Templates", "title": "ICO TOKEN - Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology) download", "title_full": "ICO TOKEN - Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology) download", "published": "2018-05-26T10:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8bdc1e82857cf4b3f204f859b73e76f7dbd4004a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfhGmLoaRwJ4nTdquRdf_SKHrYrVaFzF5kshoAulet3VU8ppnHFmcx1Tyon38DfTLo5lAU3LsSz42vhUhEZ2HTuX1OC1mvZmE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cosma Dan (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-26T10:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "ICO TOKEN - Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology) download", "text": "Meet ICO TOKEN – the best-selling premium ICO landing page and Cryptocurrency HTML Template, that perfectly fits for any type of digital consulting or crypto business.\nICO TOKEN landing page template included all the necessary benefits and special features that perfectly fit for ICO development agencies, Blockchain technology consulting firm or any type of digital crypto currency / bitcoin business website.\nWith ICO TOKEN theme the sky is only the limit!

His kidnappers had demanded a Bitcoin ransom of roughly $120,000.\nThere is likely no greater fear for a parent than to have their child abducted and held for ransom. Far too often, such crimes end in tragedy. Fortunately for a young man in South Africa, his kidnapping has a happy ending. Grabbed While Playing\nKatlego Marite, a 13-year-old boy, was playing with two friends at a playground in the South African province of Mpumalanga last Sunday. Suddenly, three men in a car pulled up and grabbed him. His parents later received a Bitcoin ransom demand of roughly $120,000 (15 bitcoins).\nThe demand was for a payment of 1 Bitcoin by May 21st, with the remaining 14 coins to be paid by May 27th. A wallet address was included. If the parents did not pay, the kidnappers threatened to kill Katlego.\nWhat makes the case unusual is that Katlego’s parents are not wealthy, and they had no idea what cryptocurrency is. Three Taken into Custody\nAn apparent break in the case occurred when a family friend showed up shortly after the kidnapping. After seeing CCTV footage of the crime, he drove around to various bars, looking for the car, a Toyota Corolla. The friend eventually found the car in question and alerted authorities, who then took three men into custody.\nThe police have not stated if the three men are involved in the kidnapping, and it is unclear if they are still in police custody. However, the car is still being held by law enforcement. Safe and Sound\nFortunately, the parents’ ordeal is now over. On Thursday, police announced that they have found Katlego Marite and that he is alive and well.\nPolice spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi commented:\nThe combined efforts by the police and the community paid off when Marite was found safe and sound. The circumstances under which he was found are a subject of investigation.\nPolice have not said if the Bitcoin ransom was paid. Nor have they released any further details of the crime and subsequent finding of the victim. Of course, the most important thing is that Katlego Marite is safe and back with his family.\nNeedless to say, this isn’t the first time a Bitcoin ransom was demanded by kidnappers. A cryptocurrency exchange managing director, Pavel Lerner, was abducted last December in Kiev and was only released after he paid a $1 million ransom in bitcoins.\nDo you think the media will play up the cryptocurrency angle for this kidnapping story?

Forensic Analysis of the BTG hack\nOn May 18, Edward Iskra, the BTG communications director alerted the crypto community to the attack via a blog post on the Bitcoin Gold forum. According to Iskra:\nAn unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use ‘51% attacks’ to perform ‘double-spend’ attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.\nA 51 percent attack is no mean feat, even on a small blockchain as a significant amount of computing power is required to pull it off successfully. However, if an attacker were able to hijack a blockchain, combining it with a double-spend would monetize the effort, and this is precisely what the suspected BTG hacker did.\nThe image above is the Bitcoin Gold address of the suspected hacker. The attacker sends a particular number of BTG tokens to an exchange, trades them for another coin and makes a withdrawal. The hacker then returns those same coins in his/her wallet, hence the double-spending problem. Thus, the attacker can spend and hold the same coins at the same time. Looking at the image above, if all 76 transactions were indeed part of the hack, then the hacker has stolen about $18 million based on the current BTG price. 51 Percent Attacks are All the Rage Now\nThere have been no transactions since May 19. However, the hacker could theoretically continue the attack, especially if they still control 51 percent of the blockchain. According to Iskra, the onus is on exchange platforms to be vigilant against such attacks. He also urged them to increase the number of confirmations for large deposits. The BTG communications director also added:\nThere is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets.\nBitcoin Gold joins Verge and Monacoin as blockchains hacked within one crazy week for cryptocurrency networks. The Verge attacker gained control of two of the five mining algorithms, successfully mining 35 million XVG tokens valued at $1.75 million in only a few hours.\nCan BTG overcome its present predicament?

Bob Mason Reblog Bitcoin slipped 1.58% on Friday, reversing Thursday’s 1.08% gain, to end the day at $7,456.8. A move through to a morning high $7,654.1 fell short of the day’s first major resistance level at $7,783.93 and 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,906.4 before reversing. Bitcoin fell to an intraday low $7,318.2 in the late morning to call on support at the day’s first major support level at $7,314.13 before recovering to $7,400 levels, the second half of the day relatively range bound, with a downward bias. The Bitcoin bears ruled the roost through the week, with Bitcoin falling 12.5% Monday through Friday, supporting the extended bearish trend formed at 5 th May’s swing hi $9,999, with Bitcoin failing to test resistance at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level for a second consecutive day, while also striking a new swing lo $7,260 on Thursday. Negative news through the week included talk of price manipulation and an investigation by the U.S Department of Justice into trading practices, reminding investors of how eager governments and regulators are to take control and introduce standards into the cryptomarket in the months ahead, the roll out expected to roil the markets. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 0.51% to $7,418.4, an early morning $7,467.3 high falling short of the day’s first major resistance level at $7,634.53 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,906.4 before easing. Negative sentiment from the week continued through to the early part of the weekend, Bitcoin falling to a morning low $7,368.6 before recovering to $7,400 levels, while Bitcoin avoided the day’s first major support level at $7,298.63. For the day ahead, a move through to $7,470 would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level of $7,634.53, though gains are likely to lead to investors locking in profits early, which will likely leave the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,906.4 out of reach, Bitcoin’s intraday highs having been on a downward trend through the week. Failing to move through to $7,600 levels will likely see Bitcoin pullback to $7,300 levels through the middle part of the day, bringing the day’s first major support level of $7,298.63 into play before any recovery, the day’s second major support level at $7,140.47 likely to be left untested through the day. Investors will be looking out for the weekend rally to kick in, with Bitcoin needing to break through the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $8,306.3 to support a bearish trend reversal and draw investors back in from the side lines, the year’s extended bearish trends attributed to a general lack of catalysts to support the Bitcoin bulls. Elsewhere in the markets, it was a mixed start to the weekend, with Stellar’s Lumen and Litecoin leading the way amongst the majors, with gains of 0.82% and 0.71% respectively, while DASH and NEO saw the greatest losses through the morning, down 2.19% and 1.55% respectively, Bitcoin’s early decline weighing on the broader market.

On the otger hand, bounty campaigns are quite good, and as time goes by, it gets better and better. A lot of people are getting involvled in the bounty campaigns scene therefore making this sector of cryptocurrency investment healthy. And what's more better than being able to be rewarded by cryptpcurrencies which you can use to invest or convert into other cryptocurrencies in the market, which means to say that you can be involved in the cryptocurrency industry without directly spending money on the coin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T05:30:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd64961d41bfbe12f30474d08fbf1029cb09db45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhGtKduPa4LYBoiA6YwbMT4U-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-26T10:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd64961d41bfbe12f30474d08fbf1029cb09db45", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhGtKduPa4LYBoiA6YwbMT4U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-26T10:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 26, 2018 WEB Search Results for 𝟙𝟠𝟜𝟜𝟚𝟙𝟝𝟞𝟛𝟘𝟙 BITCOIN SUPPORT NUMBER Maine BTC HELPLINE ...
