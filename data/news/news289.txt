It’s a new kind of vault for a new age and one Argentine pioneer has finally convinced the wealthy that this is where their digital currency will be safe.\nThe brainchild of entrepreneur Wences Casares , a startup called Xapo has built crypto bunkers on five continents—including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker , and now he’s housing some $10 billion in bitcoin for the wealthy—though the price volatility of digital tokens makes it impossible to estimate real-time value.\nThe bunkers house encrypted computer servers that are not connected to the internet or networked with any other external computers.\nThe bunkers’ systems store the cryptographic keys that make bitcoin real and determine ownership.\nIn Xapo’s words, they “developed a new standard in bitcoin security that protects your assets by using man, machine and even a mountain…”\nAnd there’s a good reason the bunkers are spread out across five continents : Never keep all your eggs in one basket.\nRight now, it is said that Xapo is storing almost 7 percent of all bitcoin in circulation in its underground bunkers, and it’s a highly lucrative prospect for criminals. But this isn’t a job for hackers because it’s entirely disconnected. The only way in is physical, and Xapo has taken pains to ensure that the usual criminal tactics, such as (as Bloomberg points out) using an amputated arm or finger to gain admittance, wont’ work. Gaining access means getting through fingerprint scanners with pulse readers. Related: Google's Controversial New A.I. Assistant\nBacked by billionaire visionaries like Linked-In co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, Xapo has a major vote of confidence that Bitcoin whales like to see. According to the start-up, it’s raised $40 million from Benchmark, Greylock Partners, Index Ventures, Fortress Investment Group, Ribbit Capital and Emergence Capital Partners.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo, told Bloomberg. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nIt beats cold storage, which is just putting your codes on a hardware device that can easily be stolen. And it beats online wallets, which hackers love. For crypto whales who have too much at stake, it beats what Bloomberg says has gotten as bad as hiding identities, fortifying homes and studying self-defense.\nFor bitcoin holders of any significant amount, it’s like being “under attack 24/7”, Xapo head of security Carlos Rienzi told Quartz : “This is not a race. It is a chess game. You have to think about the opponent’s next movement. You can never relax.”\nThat’s especially true for cryptocurrency because there’s no protection.

It’s not looking very well for the once mighty dollar, either.\nThroughout history, attempts at using fiat currency, even today , has failed. When the government prints fiat money that isn’t backed by any value, disaster inevitably ensues. Still, the long history of failed fiat currency is being ignored by today’s money printers.\nAt the start of the first century, the Roman denarius was a coin containing approximately 94 percent real silver. By the end of the century, the amount of silver was reduced to 85 percent. Devaluing the denarius meant Nero and succeeding emperors could pay off their bills more easily while becoming richer. A hundred years later, the denarius contained less than 50 percent silver, and in 244 A.D., Emperor Philip the Arab devalued the currency down to 0.05 percent silver content. By the time the Roman empire collapsed, the denarius was made of 0.02 percent silver, and it became useless as a currency.\nCopper backed China’s initial paper currency. When copper became scarce, China began to make iron coins. The iron currency became overissued and soon became devalued. By the 11th century, a Szechuan bank issued another paper currency that could be exchanged for valuable goods such as rare metals or silk. Continuous war with neighboring Mongols caused economic inflation. China lost the war to Genghis Khan, who was too busy with other conquests to take much interest in China. Genghis’ grandson Kublai brought China and its finances under Mongolian control. Kublai used fiat currency for the vast China trade, including trade with Marco Polo. Kublai simply continued to print vast amounts of money as he continued his marauding and conquering. But infusing the economy with worthless monopoly money ruined many and chaos became the norm.\nFrance has an interesting history with paper money. It may be the only country to face economic collapse not once, not twice, but three times by flooding the country with fiat currency.\nHigh-living Sun King Louis XIV left a debt of 3 billion livres for his successor to deal with. Louis XV desperately needed incoming tax payments and demanded these be paid in paper currency. Predictably, the paper currency was quickly overprinted and became worthless.\nIn the 18th century, France began another attempt at printing paper currency called assignats. By the end of the century, the assignat suffered 13,000 percent inflation. Napoleon rode to the rescue by instituting the gold franc, which stabilized France’s erratic currency. One would think the French might have seen a connection between the stable economy and gold-backed currency. No such luck.\nFrance reverted to paper currency in the 1930s, the paper franc. In just more than a decade, the fiat franc became devalued by 99 percent. France’s third attempt at printing worthless monopoly money proved to be a dismal failure.\nFollowing WWI, Germany’s Weimar Republic faced historic debts. So, Germany put the printing presses to work – a total of 133 printing companies were kept busy. The mark became more than worthless. It was used to heat furnaces. Burning the paper currency to keep warm was more efficient than using it for trade. A wheel barrel became a wallet.\nThroughout the 20th century, many other countries flooded their economy with fiat currency – and collapsed as a result. The direct correlation between government interference with money and the devaluation of currency seems to escape many.\nHas the US learned anything about fiat money? The Colonies happily jumped on the fiat currency bandwagon and began flooding the land with their own paper money. When these currencies quickly became overissued, they became – surprise! – devalued. Like the marc to come a few centuries later, colonial currency made for excellent bathroom tissue. The Revolutionary War was financed with a paper currency called the continental. It, too, crashed on a grand scale. This, finally, brought about some healthy American distrust for fiat currency. The US dollar was now backed by actual gold and saw the most splendid and richest economic growth in history. People came from all parts of the globe to be a part of such a success story.\nAs if on schedule, the Federal Reserve appeared. Currency once again fell under the aegis of government control and manipulation. In 1933, President Roosevelt made ownership of gold illegal. The ties between the US dollar and the country’s gold reserves were severed gradually until President Nixon eliminated the gold standard entirely in 1971. The once mighty US dollar instantly turned into fiat currency. This was followed by a decade of disastrous inflation.\nThe US has followed the historical pattern of paper money. The government is currently printing dollars with abandon to pay off its record debt (sound like a familiar refrain?). Following a long historical precedence, the US dollar is losing value at an alarming rate as we head into a period of high inflation.\nAs history has demonstrated, inflation is a guaranteed devaluer of currency. Following WWII, Greece saw an increase in inflation of 18 percent per day. The country’s deficit tripled within a year. And then things got really bad. An invasion by the Axis powers saw income plummet by 70 percent. Like so many other countries in the past, Greece started printing worthless currency and experienced one of the worse hyperinflations in history.\nAs previously stated, Germany’s Weimar Republic faced unprecedented debt in the wake of WWI. No country would accept its worthless mark as repayment, forcing Germany to sell off marks for other foreign currencies at any price. This lead to Germany’s famous hyperinflation of 29,500 percent.\nZimbabwe is famous for its 100 trillion-dollar note during its period of catastrophic hyperinflation. Prices doubled daily as Zimbabwe faced hyperinflation of 79 billion percent in 2008 . A loaf of bread was priced at 35 million Zimbabwe dollars. Government intervention can invariably be found as the source of any hyperinflation.\nThere is no escaping history. Paper money and out-of-control national debts have always devalued the currency and caused massive inflation. The US dollar remains on the cusp. It is anyone’s guess which way it will go. But the roadmap to a financial disaster was printed thousands of years ago.

In the first instance, the patent mentions “a data stream that publishes or includes global bitcoin transactions (or any cryptocurrency transaction)” for use by electronic or internet retailers.\nEven more concerning still is the second example which explains how the tech can be used specifically by cops to keep tabs on users and track purchases made with crypto: For example, a law enforcement agency may be a customer and may desire to receive global bitcoin transactions, correlated by country, with ISP data to determine source IP addresses and shipping addresses that correlate to bitcoin addresses. The agency may not want additional available enhancements such as local bank data records. The streaming data marketplace may price this desired data out per GB (gigabyte), for example, and the agency can start running analytics on the desired data using the analysis module.\nStatists gonna state.\nAnonymity and decentralization are paramount to crypto’s value as an alternative currency—freedom from the prying eyes of government goons is reason enough to use it. But the ring of power as symbolized in The Lord of the Rings is too alluring for even the most successful private companies, and Jeff Bezos is proving to be yet another casualty seduced by it.\nUsing the government patenting system to monopolize control over a technology that tracks Bitcoin transactions—that’s about as fascistic as it gets.\nBut apparently, it’s happening. Are we now witnessing the final stage of the co-opting of bitcoin?\nThis is exactly why the real ring of power needs to be destroyed altogether—and cryptocurrencies on the whole offer society one of our best hopes to achieve that.\nThis also reinforces why other cryptos, which we have recommended, including Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and Monero, are so important. In various ways, each of them offers potential privacy options that bitcoin, due to its being morphed into “digital gold” is now less able to provide.\nSome want to use state-sponsored regulations to crack down on blockchains, but thankfully, “we the people” may be just too far ahead of the inefficient, archaic bureau-rats for them to catch up.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://dollarvigilante.com/blog/2018/05/10/amazon-patents-orwellian-tech-allowing-police-to-track-bitcoin-transactions.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff berwick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon technologies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trademark office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon.com", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states patent", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T02:09:43.130+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5f212fc7c4d6ad98fa9fb4364a924eeddeb53bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqCe0NaanOoUpFuU5A4fBVHjARZtYK0ZBxU.iWiOU7KdBQicd7rqQ3R1PQ2m8JRh4GePnKxRO9QQyRZ9r7u1wfLyIE1o5vDkSc_IeDCcW4ogJYoMARWR04EPbrjFbWzhxwwcMtrT36w5ZKv73Tlx9p8Jv1D_XBNpX0fjoyDwvwJAoF0WLA.ZE4skP7g.sFjAesCpMS.7XKh8uA--", "site_full": "www.longroom.com", "site": "longroom.com", "site_section": "https://longroom.com/discussions/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Long Room", "title": "The former tech chief at secretive trading firm Jump has joined a bitcoin exchange as raid on Wall Street talent continues in crypto", "title_full": "The former tech chief at secretive trading firm Jump has joined a bitcoin exchange as raid on Wall Street talent continues in crypto", "published": "2018-05-13T01:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5acb8873146e7120008b4955-640-320.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5f212fc7c4d6ad98fa9fb4364a924eeddeb53bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqCe0NaanOoUpFuU5A4fBVHjARZtYK0ZBxU.iWiOU7KdBQicd7rqQ3R1PQ2m8JRh4GePnKxRO9QQyRZ9r7u1wfLyIE1o5vDkSc_IeDCcW4ogJYoMARWR04EPbrjFbWzhxwwcMtrT36w5ZKv73Tlx9p8Jv1D_XBNpX0fjoyDwvwJAoF0WLA.ZE4skP7g.sFjAesCpMS.7XKh8uA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cv2angels", "published": "2018-05-13T01:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "The former tech chief at secretive trading firm Jump has joined a bitcoin exchange as raid on Wall Street talent continues in crypto", "text": "in General Steve Hunt, the former chief technology officer at secretive trading firm Jump Trading, has been hired by Kraken, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange, people familiar with the matter told Business Insider.Hunt was hired as vice president of engineering, the people said.

May 13, 2018\nSince last three days, the crypto-market is experiencing a massive blow, as the prices are dropping significantly. Social media communities are blaming Mt. Gox (a ceased crypto-exchange) for the bear trend in the market as they believe it was followed by Bitcoin’s drop in price. Bitcoin had dropped by 8% and is currently trading at a price of $8.223.\nThe market capitalization is fallen to $140 billion, a week back it was at $154 billion.\nIn the last 7 day period, the market has fallen by 14.5% after reaching a hike the previous week. The major drop happened in the last 24-hour mark as the price fell down by 6.5%. The market is still depicting a decline, at the time of writing it is falling by 0.3%.\nMt. Gox is a former exchange company which was one of the largest in 2013 but it got hacked and went into bankruptcy. According to news reports, Mt. Gox had lost 650,000 Bitcoins in the year 2013. In the year 2014, $473 million worth of bitcoins were stolen. The exchange still had 200,000 Bitcoins. Recently 36 thousand Bitcoins were sold by the trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi\nNobuaki Kobayashi is the attorney and trustee for the non-functioning Mt. Gox. He recently revealed to the public that he had been selling $ 400 million in both Bitcoin [BTC] and Bitcoin Cash [BCH] since last year September. After the disclosure, the social media started blaming Kobayashi for bringing down the market.\nExperts say that even though Mt. Gox is selling Bitcoins it could make the slightest of impact, not enough to bring such a decline.\nMark a crypto-analyst says:\n“I believe the main reason for such a drop, is the large mass, which is actually following the downward flow just after the $19,000 hike. This is largely a concern of public interest; a consensus will show you what I mean. The public interest index rate has fallen from 100% interest in December to 12% now.”\nStatistics show that there is more than 600 thousand bitcoins exchange occurring every day. On the other hand, the social media is blaming Mt.Gox for selling away their Bitcoins. The Bitcoin price is dropping by 0.2% at the time of writing. BTC chart\nA Redditor says:\n“The drop in price is because of Kobayashi that S.O.B selling his bitcoins when he should have waited till the $10,000 breach. Shitty move. Boo.”\nAnother Redditor says:\n“it’s a free market. he can sell as many BTFC as he wants. let’s be honest. if you were trusted with that amount of BTC, you’d have sold way earlier and you would have crashed the market before anyone could make anything.”\nA Twitterati says:\n“Haters will hate but this is just a casual thing take it light.

I'm hoping to transfer them out into Coinbase or something similar, but none of my transactions seem to be entering the mempool. On the wallet, they appear as having left but have been stuck at 0 confirmations for over a week, but if I look the transaction ids up on blockchain.info (9def5314cd193eb375634fbbddb2ff07bb5db9710311b1afe4b0c531db949b57 and 10239862eb947b6194920045423ac1a1e75c8a9bb7bbd0e87b4c8676a2656457), it says they don't exist, which makes me think that they've not actually gone into the mempool.\nThe first transaction had no fee associated with it (don't hate on me - I've not actually sent any BTC before, and this was the default on my wallet), which is what I assumed the problem was. But when I tried again it should have had plenty to get confirmation quickly. I've tried using the getrawtransaction command from the console to get the hex and broadcast it using /pushtx: for the first transaction, it says the minimum relay fee wasn't met (fair enough), but for the second it returns \"Missing parents for [txid #2 (with fee)] while inserting [txid #1 (without fee)]\". This means very little to me. If I check my wallet address on blockchain.info it still has the original sum associated with it.\nApologies if this has been asked before (I have been looking for over a week and haven't found it if so!), but I'm at my wits end and could use some help. I'd be very happy to make a donation to anyone who can help me unlock my BTC as a token of my gratitude.\nThanks in advance!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T02:08:32.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d62f0b45fc4f2902ad8daea3898069a18466fb71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ467rsaZCDSSAgkGfhKoyyjQA--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=29", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Hardware - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!", "title_full": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program! - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-13T01:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.048, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d62f0b45fc4f2902ad8daea3898069a18466fb71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ467rsaZCDSSAgkGfhKoyyjQA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-13T01:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!", "text": " soft for breaking any Captcha\n can solve\nThis software can bypass ANY captchas, including gReCaptcha , Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program! , Google ReCaptcha2 defeated: new program \"XEvil 4.0\" did that , XEvil 4.0 + any SEO/SMM software = PROFIT!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xrumersale.site/", "http://votehealth.info/index.php/topic,35220.new.html#new", "http://mobeautycare.com/index.php/component/users/?option=com_k2&view=itemlist&task=user&id=515", "http://XEvil.net/", "http://datamaiden.us/earthlywonders/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=46150", "http://poniesonthedelta.com/personals/index.php/topic,177.new.html#new"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T03:17:19.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2972d69cbf91cd7b3138ba5ddb90a357287b541", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyB5EOYRQpB6st1_59Ma0Ti12974A42X2y7nWCUTWYq86Iv0RPrkzjuYmpBQRmF8nw2gUwZduVU78T4WWKuKnisfi7PPF6CIj0cc83udNMirkgp7v0paIx.XFp3Ed.ZxWTDWBhEGCSbF480My44Ptb1", "site_full": "forums.vrzone.com", "site": "vrzone.com", "site_section": "http://forums.vrzone.com/singapore-finance-news/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Singapore Finance News", "title": "Bitcoin Weekly: Consensys 2018 Incoming", "title_full": "Bitcoin Weekly: Consensys 2018 Incoming", "published": "2018-05-13T01:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.218, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2972d69cbf91cd7b3138ba5ddb90a357287b541", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyB5EOYRQpB6st1_59Ma0Ti12974A42X2y7nWCUTWYq86Iv0RPrkzjuYmpBQRmF8nw2gUwZduVU78T4WWKuKnisfi7PPF6CIj0cc83udNMirkgp7v0paIx.XFp3Ed.ZxWTDWBhEGCSbF480My44Ptb1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "VRNews", "published": "2018-05-13T01:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Weekly: Consensys 2018 Incoming", "text": "Bitcoin Weekly: Consensys 2018 Incoming Bitcoin Weekly: Consensys 2018 Incoming Last week we discussed how Bitcoin was approaching key levels.

You are paid in cash.\nThe reload bonus emphasizes customer loyalty and is paid out for subsequent deposits.\nAdditionally there are a number of VIP type bonuses geared towards high rollers.\nUsing Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies\nThe online betting site of your choice will have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nIt is always recommended to use a Bitcoin wallet in order to ensure complete anonymity.\nSome exchanges allow one to connect to their bank accounts. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2GYokfZ", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T19:38:02.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e40bf7cc9763201a42c67723b25264f52c730ff6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQUHu0IGGR9Fg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-05-13T00:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.135, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e40bf7cc9763201a42c67723b25264f52c730ff6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQUHu0IGGR9Fg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FractalUniverse", "published": "2018-05-13T00:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Quote: from: pacman7331 on May 12, 2018, 04:09:49 PM Looks like a whale wanted to buy below the 50 day.

In fact, in our society, often the more useful the work is, the less they pay you. Whereas bullshit jobs are often highly respected and pay well but are completely pointless, and the people doing them know this.\nIran Claims Israel Attack Was A False Flag (blackeagle)\nDuring the attack, Israeli jets and mortars struck intelligence sites and arms depots, among other military targets allegedly operated by the Iranian forces. Syria's SANA state news channel said earlier that a Syrian radar installation was hit in the attack while \"tens\" of missiles were intercepted.\nTrump Was Right To Blow Up The Iran Deal (thc0655)\nSince the Iran Deal did absolutely nothing meaningful to safeguard against the production of nuclear weapons in the long run, it’s in the national interest of the United States to exit and seek a better deal. The Obama administration, which assented to every imaginable Iranian demand to preserve this agreement, allowed Teheran to dictate the terms of IAEA access, which included asking permission for inspections, the ability to deny access to military sites and the ability to take nearly a month’s time to clean up at sites.\n‘Iran has no reason to strike Golan’: Analysts dispute Israel’s ‘political’ claim of missile attack (blackeagle)\nThe retired colonel-general also drew attention to the fact that Tehran is even less inclined to make such moves at a time when the fate of the 2015 deal on the Iranian nuclear program is in limbo. “Iran is highly interested in keeping the deal” intact, Ivashov said, implying that Tehran would probably avoid any aggressive steps that could spark a backlash from the international community.\nEU wants to 'replace' US after it ditched Iran nuclear deal. But can it? (blackeagle)\nThe top European official accused the US of being unwilling \"to cooperate with other parts in the world.\" His words came just days after the US President Donald Trump announced that he would pull the US out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, which he repeatedly denounced as the \"worst deal ever negotiated.\" Despite facing criticism from other parties to the deal, as well as some other members of the international community, the US leader seems to be sticking to his decision.\nThe Corbett Report – The REAL Middle East Nuclear Threat (yogmonster)\nThere is in fact a Middle Eastern nation that is in fact in control of a vast, undeclared stockpile of nuclear weapons. This nation does have the capability of deploying those weapons anywhere in the region. It is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and its arsenal has never been inspected by any international agency. But this nation is not Iran. It’s Israel.\nStress and Resilience: Preparing for the Days Ahead (Thomas R.)\nStrеѕѕ аnd ѕlеер рrоvе tо hаvе a robust relationship that саn be utіlіzеd to combat ѕtrеѕѕ аnd іtѕ negative еffесtѕ.

Having a traditional clock in the room could be a cause of unnecessary stress, he added.\nHe said that schools are trying to make everything as “as easy and straightforward as possible” for pupils during their exams.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of ETFs (Thomas R.)\nETFs can be more tax-efficient than mutual funds because most of the tax on capital gains is paid on sale and completely up to the investor -- even if the ETF sells or buys shares while attempting to mimic the basket of shares it is tracking. This is because the capital gains from in-kind transfers, seen in ETFs do not result in a tax charge, and therefore, can be expected to be lower compared to mutual funds.\nCash payment crackdown to counter tax evasion and black economy (Thomas R.)\nIt says the three main sources of illicit tobacco in Australia are smuggling, leakage from licensed warehouses, and illicit domestic production. To combat this, it will create an illicit tobacco taskforce with powers to prosecute organised crime groups at the centre of the illicit tobacco trade.\nGarden Cheats – Quickie Starts & Expansions (Thomas R.)\nHere are a few hacks we can use on that front, whether we’re beginners, or in a hurry for some expansions. Most are totally appropriate for anyone with a patio, balcony, or prime prepper property with acreage. They’re about saving time so we can start learning our gardening lessons or increasing our yields.\nHawaii volcano shows 'no sign of slowing down,' destroys dozens of homes (Thomas R.)\nHawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Talmadge Magno told reporters on Sunday that some of the fissures “have established pretty good flows and just continue to cover more of the subdivision,” adding a sizeable lava flow was heading north of a new vent.

It reflected the spirit of individuals representing the crypto movement all over the globe and who could deal with skeptics and naysayers in an effective way.\n\"It was intended to be humorous, but the word stuck and became the name of our first collection,\" says Cryptomatic's watch designer, Luis Rosende, whose team has been in business for over a decade, helping a number of fashion and watch brands design and manufacture their collections.\nHowever, when the Cryptomat launched in 2014 , the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market entered a prolonged bearish cycle that lasted through 2016.\n\"It was a real winter for Bitcoin, it truly tested people's faith in the idea,\" he explains.\nThe belief didn't die. Bitcoin came back stronger than ever as its price has skyrocketed in recent years while giving rise to a booming new industry in the process.\nRosende adds:\nAfter that roller coaster of a ride, it was quite clear that the second collection should be dedicated to those patient souls who HEDL through the hard times, and so, the HODLER was born.\nA Timeless Design 'Hodling' is a term that has taken on a life of its own, evolving from a typo meme on an online forum to an entire subculture that believes in the long-term transformative power of Bitcoin technology.\nOn the surface, the Cryptomatic watch is a stark contrast. It's fully mechanical, based on old-world watch technology that doesn't use any batteries, digital dials, or electronics.\nUpon a second look, however, its metal gears, springs, and jewel bearings made of ruby to reduce friction are a testament to Bitcoin's peer-to-peer design that eliminates the need to trust middlemen. The glass back reflects the transparency of its public ledger and proof-of-work backbone.\nHand-assembled in Japan, the country of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the watch's binary hour markers is another unique design element that pays homage to digital currency.\nAnd like Bitcoin, which remains the indisputable king of cryptocurrencies despite an ever-increasing amount of novel altcoins, Cryptomatic believes that mechanical watches are the only type of timepieces that are here to stay in the long run as Rosende states:\nQuartz watches didn't kill mechanicals and smartwatches won't either, you can quote us on that now and ten years from now.\nAll the gadgety smartwatches will most likely stop being useful when the next technology cycle hits the market or when there's no more support for firmware or replacement parts.\nThe build does feel incredibly solid when wearing it on your wrist. The watch comes with a lifetime warranty, for which you can register by scanning the QR code printed on the individual customer card. It also comes with either steel or genuine leather strap options. (I personally prefer the black leather strap after trying both.)\nStaying Crypto Cryptomatic is a pretty unique company as it only takes payments in Bitcoin for their watches, which means no credit cards and no cash. The Holder collection watch currently costs around 0.09 BTC, or from $819 to $849 USD depending on the model.\n\"About 98% of the watches have been sold for Bitcoin,\" Rosende says. \"The other ~ 2% are sales to clients who asked if they could pay in other cryptocurrencies, to which we have been mostly open.\"\nTo date, Cryptomatic has produced a limited number of editions numbering a few hundred watches per collection. The most popular and fastest selling model has been the Silver & Black HODLER , while the original Silver and Rose Gold CRYPTOMAT was the favorite from the first collection, says Rosende.\nHe notes that Cryptomatic intends to remain a small and exclusive brand while continuing making small runs of high-quality, hand-assembled watch es but doesn't rule out the addition of \"smart\" features in the future.\nSo will we ever see a price ticker or a Bitcoin wallet integrated into a Cryptomatic?\n\"One thing we can say is that our watches will always have a mechanical heart even if we decide to add 'smart' elements to them,\" he says.\nThe company does a lot of brainstorming when it comes to their designs, constantly thinking about new collections, though we probably won't see a Litecoin-themed design in the near future.\n\"What about putting in a moon rock if Bitcoin price breaks a new all-time high this year?\" I asked Luis.\n\"For now we will stick to Bitcoin as it is the origin of all cryptos,\" Rosende says. \"We'll see what happens in the future. The moon rock idea is a really good idea by the way.\"\n[Disclosure: Cryptomatic provided Bitcoinist with a free Cryptomatic watch for review purposes.]\nWhat do you think of the new Cryptomatic watch?

As you may know, the block subsidy halves every 210,000 blocks (approx. 4 years). Due to this reward schedule, more than 80% of all bitcoins have already been discovered, and in a decade, it'll be more than 95%. As the number of new bitcoins being added to the money supply dwindles, another mechanism to fund the security of the network will need to take over.\nThe source of that funding is meant to be transaction fees. This seems feasible, especially in light of us seeing the first block with transaction fees greater than the block subsidy last year.\nvia smartbit.com.au\nThe transition to a fee funded mining market is tightly coupled with the blocksize debate. For example, Princeton's Weinberg et al have shown that a fee-funded mining market may become unstable unless there is a constant backlog of transactions waiting to be confirmed. Some Bitcoin clients explicitly lock new transactions to the next block's height to encourage mining of a new block in contrast to miners attempting orphaning attacks on the current blockchain-tip for fee sniping.\nThe described dynamic is also cause for speculation that altcoins with oversized (and thus empty) blocks may need to transition to a constant block subsidy in the longterm to maintain a stable mining market.\nFinally, the limited availability of blockspace and presence of transaction fees creates a fair market for users to signal the urgency of their transactions. This allows more valuable use of a limited resource to displace frivolous or inefficient use. The fee market especially discourages spam and business models that depend on abundant blockspace. Early acceptance of the inherent limitedness of blockspace is a prime driver for innovation and investment in sound second layer technology such as the Lightning Network.\nPeople have been speculating for years, why Bitcoin was designed with the abrupt halvings of the block subsidy instead of a smoother payout or even a constant reward. There even was an attempt to turn the initial block subsidy of 50 bitcoins per block into a constant subsidy around the first halving, but the broader network rejected the miner's attempt to increase the money supply.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.smartbit.com.au/block/000000000000000000016f84f5cc7e15e1c504322a5fad2a34acae761e29d94c", "https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/CKWN-CCS16.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "weinberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "princeton", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T01:12:10.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8657d3d0d9845164b0902d5708904b0d757eb530", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmesS1goA8G4r_ZpkQtetfUI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "[ANN] [BITG] Bitcoin Green | Sustainable Bitcoin | POS | 85% MN | #savebitcoin", "title_full": "[ANN] [BITG] Bitcoin Green | Sustainable Bitcoin | POS | 85% MN | #savebitcoin", "published": "2018-05-13T00:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8657d3d0d9845164b0902d5708904b0d757eb530", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmesS1goA8G4r_ZpkQtetfUI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "awill333", "published": "2018-05-13T00:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] [BITG] Bitcoin Green | Sustainable Bitcoin | POS | 85% MN | #savebitcoin", "text": "\"\nHoly shit dude that's an insanely long story.\nSo ,\nWho are the Devs ?\nHow did I find Bitg MNO where it was promising 1k+ roi.

(is pow a waste of energy well maybe but bitg is far from the only coin that solves that problem)\nYe sounds legit Satoshi is a Asic dev ... i stopped reading after that .\nInstead of answers to some of the very basic questions asked u go and write x pages of this.\n\"\nI wrote an essay for the public to digest. I am not here to interact with you or answer your half baked questions. You obviously did not read the article because your response does not address any of the relevant points. You simply spit back a bunch of half baked questions/statements just like any other shill. Greetings ...\nPS: Plenty of shill accounts have a ton of posts that say absolutely nothing. Any bot can do that. How about compiling a dictionary into completely useless sentences or regurgitating bits and pieces of the previous post back. No I am not here to answer your questions and I am not here to do your research for you.\nPPS: DO YOU OWN RESEARCH AND FIND YOUR OWN TRUTH.\nPPPS: I don't care if you earn or not on BITG or what you think about BITG. I care about the Earth and all of you POW idiots are just shitting on her. So have fun with your conscience.\nPPPPS: To anyone else who cares to ask me questions about my article, Don't bother! There will be no additional responses (from me).\nS: I am sorry for you if you actually are a human and you are still on that sinking ship.\nS: It's demons like you who would laugh at the Earth's devastation as long as your bags are full. Have fun breathing all of that Co2 emission when the O2 has been displaced thanks to your bitcoin mining!

A cyber-enigma with an enthusiastic following, it pops up in headlines and fuels endless media debate. You can apparently use it to buy anything from coffee to cars, yet few people seem to truly understand what it is. This raises the question: Why should anyone care about bitcoin? In \"The Age of Cryptocurrency,\" Wall Street journalists Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey deliver the definitive answer to this question. Cybermoney is poised to launch a revolution, one that could reinvent traditional financial and social structures while bringing the world s billions of \"unbanked\" individuals into a new global economy. Cryptocurrency holds the promise of a financial system without a middleman, one owned by the people who use it and one safeguarded from the devastation of a 2008-type crash. But bitcoin, the most famous of the cybermonies, carries a reputation for instability, wild fluctuation, and illicit business; some fear it has the power to eliminate jobs and to upend the concept of a nation-state. It implies, above all, monumental and wide-reaching change for better and for worse. But it is here to stay, and you ignore it at your peril.Vigna and Casey demystify cryptocurrency its origins, its function, and what you need to know to navigate a cyber-economy. The digital currency world will look very different from the paper currency world; \"The Age of Cryptocurrency\" will teach you how to be ready.\"To Download Please Click https://azuszenfonm1.blogspot.ca/?book=1250081556 ...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://azuszenfonm1.blogspot.ca/?book=1250081556"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael j. casey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T00:02:56.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aef29c1efe6c7a1d894f02e73baf1c9d15c936eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQK4CHUfMaTGKYn.N1K6LzdD5R9kbgSwBdPeDLUNP9zeGIIXjVMBxnMU_spAMoedc0UTiSM6_qJzm8xzwiCME0_ZHZpvHdN8lw1emi4a5XyqJCUqbYj0BoqgHtmNs51dqOUQYKJL3iW0p3IoqUGd4Jojf5AnkRp8Y-", "site_full": "btcihowtoinvest.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://btcihowtoinvest.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Shows Some Resilience in the Midst of Widespread Crypto Price Decline – How to invest with bitcoin 2018", "title": "Bitcoin Shows Some Resilience in the Midst of Widespread Crypto Price Decline", "title_full": "Bitcoin Shows Some Resilience in the Midst of Widespread Crypto Price Decline", "published": "2018-05-13T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aef29c1efe6c7a1d894f02e73baf1c9d15c936eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQK4CHUfMaTGKYn.N1K6LzdD5R9kbgSwBdPeDLUNP9zeGIIXjVMBxnMU_spAMoedc0UTiSM6_qJzm8xzwiCME0_ZHZpvHdN8lw1emi4a5XyqJCUqbYj0BoqgHtmNs51dqOUQYKJL3iW0p3IoqUGd4Jojf5AnkRp8Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "btcihowtoinvest", "published": "2018-05-13T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Shows Some Resilience in the Midst of Widespread Crypto Price Decline", "text": "\nCrypto prices have dipped within the last 24 hours as the market reacts to a series of events over the previous few days.

According to Reuters, a German online bank – known as Bitbond – allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the globe just by using Bitcoin . German Bank Bitbond Works With Bitcoin\nBitbond has decided to adopt the famous virtual currency so as to bypass the SWIFT international transfer system. During the last year, SWIFT has proven to be vulnerable to hackers and other cyber attacks.\nRadoslav Albrecht, Bitbond Founder, commented:\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days. With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and fees are low.”\nClients are able to hold the loans in digital tokens, including Bitcoin, just for some seconds or minutes and they are then exchanged back to the local currency. This helps to avoid the fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices.\nUntil now, Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way to transfer credit for international transactions.\nOther cryptocurrencies and systems are starting to replace the SWIFT platform. We can mention the Ripple product xRapid – which reduces times and costs of transactions. As we wrote some time ago at CryptStorm , financial institutions that used the xRapid service developed by Ripple were able to save between 40-70%. About BitBond\nBitbond has been launched in 2013 by Mr. Albrecht and gained popularity in recent years. At the moment, his office is employing 24 individuals from 12 different countries that are managing the loans for 100 clients. Every month they handle around $1 million in loans.\nMost of the clients of the bank are small businesses, freelancers, or small companies that need some funds. Since 2016, Bitbond is considered a bank, when it was officially licensed.

It is easy to send and receive funds via your Bitcoin.com wallet then transfer to your bank account and convert into USD, Euro and other currencies.\nReload Bonus\nThese are among the best as types of bonuses as they encourage retention and loyalty but are not available at all cryptocurrency casinos.\nTypically, in order to claim these bonuses you will need to play through a certain number of times that bonus amount, similar to that of the bitcoin online casino deposit bonus .\nFor example, in order to claim a FREE US$200 bonus, you might have to gamble 10X or $2000.

For example, in order to claim a FREE US$200 bonus, you might have to gamble 10X or $2000. It's not uncommon for an individual to lose his or her initial deposit enroute to claiming this FREE money. It is also not uncommon to have to play 20X to 30X the amount of your initial deposit.\nKeep in mind also that some of these bonuses are in the form of FREE PLAY, meaning you can only bet with the additional money. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as the money can be turned into something much greater for you to withdraw.\nFinally, the last ace up most online casinos sleeve is imposing a ticking clock – if you do not wager the required amount in a certain time period (usually 2-4 months), your deposit bonus will be forfeited.\nUsing Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies\nThe online betting site of your choice will have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nIt is always recommended to use a Bitcoin wallet in order to ensure complete anonymity.\nSome exchanges allow one to connect to their bank accounts.

AirID bildet das Rückgrat des Transaktionssystems für AirPocket, eine Überweisungsanwendung, die Verbrauchern sichere und kosteneffiziente grenzüberschreitende Zahlungen ermöglichen soll. Mit AirID können zeitlich begrenzte Sätze von Zahlungssätzen geteilt werden, die kryptografisch über die Blockchain verbunden sind und eine neue Form der Kreditprüfung ermöglichen. Neben der Verwendung in AirPocket bietet AirID auch Anwendungen für Rechnungsfactoring, Supply-Chain-Management, Verwaltung akademischer und professioneller Anmeldeinformationen, Mikrokredite, Echtzeit-AML-Compliance und Betrugsbekämpfung sowie Handelsfinanzierung. 0 auf Facebook teilen ) Digitalx startet aktuell mit einer Kooperation mit dem lateinamerikanischen Partner Telefonica. Durch diese Kollaboration gibt es nun die Möglichkeit, ein Überweisungsnetzwerk aus den USA und Kanada in Länder wie Argentinien und Uruguay mit der Blockchain-basierten Geldtransfer-App „Airpocket“ zu nutzen. Dies spricht sowohl die großen lateinamerikanischen Arbeitergruppen an, die Geld nach Hause schicken wollen, als auch rund 65 Prozent der Lateinamerikaner, die sagen, dass sie mehr Transaktionen über ihr Handy tätigen wollen, so eine E-Marketer-Umfrage. Dies war der höchste Prozentsatz aller untersuchten Regionen. Da Digitalx noch relativ jung ist, liegt der Market-Cap gerade einmal bei 50 Millionen US-Dollar. Digitalx steht zwar gemäß Market-Cap ganz am Anfang, besitzt jedoch dank der Kooperation zu Telefonica und dem innovativen Ansatz des „Airpocket“ großes Potential – gerade in einem Markt wie Lateinamerika. TIO Networks hat, ähnlich wie Sia Tech, das Potential den Cloud-Markt aufzumischen – gerade bei den Themen Pricing und Security können beide Clouds klare Vorteile gegenüber Amazon S3, Google Cloud und Microsoft Azure bieten. 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wallstreet-online.de%2Fdiskussion%2F1280080-21-30%2Ffacebook-goes-blockchain-israel-jagt-bitcoin-steuersuender-huawei-telefon-bitcoin-wallet%23beitrag_57747253"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blockchain-technologie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neben der verwendung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eine überweisungsanwendung", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "israel jagt bitcoin steuersünder & huawei telefon mit bitcoin wallet facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "israel jagt bitcoin steuersünder & huawei telefon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "technologie", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "anwendungen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T02:13:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f7f3bfa126d98aee26281ca2d32e59ee3613623", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46tLJuCcM8dsqzKTI8FsDdxQ--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=22", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Información - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program! - PROGRAMADORES", "title_full": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program! - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-12T23:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f7f3bfa126d98aee26281ca2d32e59ee3613623", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46tLJuCcM8dsqzKTI8FsDdxQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-12T23:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program! - PROGRAMADORES", "text": " software complex for breaking any Captcha\n1.

Below we present the various types of bonuses available to gamers, all of which can be obtained by sending funds via your Bitcoin.com Wallet .\nDeposit Bonus\nThe deposit bonuses are normally between 50% – 200% of your first deposit and are common ways of attracting players.\nTypically, in order to claim these bonuses you will need to play through a certain number of times that bonus amount. For example, in order to claim a FREE US$200 bonus, you might have to gamble 10X or $2000. It's not uncommon for an individual to lose his or her initial deposit enroute to claiming this FREE money. It is also not uncommon to have to play 20X to 30X the amount of your initial deposit.\nKeep in mind also that some of these bonuses are in the form of FREE PLAY, meaning you can only bet with the additional money. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as the money can be turned into something much greater for you to withdraw.\nReload Bonus\nThese are among the best as they encourage retention and loyalty. The same stringent requirements as above are in place and need to be met before withdrawing. A word of warning: If you have an existing balance at a casino and partake in a reload bonus special, it could affect withdrawals of any funds which you already have at the casino (i.e. – your entire balance may become privy to the same terms and conditions).\nFree Play Bonus\nSome casinos offer a small amount of money deposited in a newly registered account with no deposit necessary. The terms and conditions of this type of bonus are usually even more draconian than that of deposit bonuses, with players, on average, having to turnover their stake 50X before a withdrawal is possible.\nCash Back Rewards\nSome casinos offer monthly, or even weekly, cash back program in which up to 10% of all losses are refunded to the player. The convenient aspect of this is that there are generally no strings attached and the money is credited to the player’s account. Reputable online casinos will make that money available for withdrawal instantly.\nVIP Programs\nAn online casino V.I.P program entails some form of point-accruing system based on turnover, similar to frequent flyer miles. More points are earned for games in which the house has a higher edge. Cash back rewards, together with other perks including exclusive offers are up for grabs. These programs can sometimes be reserved for the top 5-10% of players who are the high rollers.\nSlot Specific Perks\nOn occasion, an online casino can offer an enhanced pay-out of a particular pay-line on a designated slot. (i.e. – 150% of the pay-out on 5 of a kind with a certain symbol). This is done to attract player attention to a particular offering. Players should be aware that normally the offer is limited to one rare pay-line outcome only.\nUsing Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies\nThe online betting site of your choice will have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nIt is always recommended to use a Bitcoin wallet in order to ensure complete anonymity.\nSome exchanges allow one to connect to their bank accounts. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2GYokfZ", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T19:38:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "437f7ef1483fcd86390d33e810e6f6102b7e9233", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmn1WFWo6925Xqd0.VpzQ7GfPFzpNGm0p04UuoKzk3xspxjmDLmQsqg4ChU1z71EwIwn3u5mVVIzKr1ktjeVU.KUDQ6FMP8wPtme6iXvNLLHUTTZUH78d6EGB0YlH6rm.Yk-", "site_full": "republicbuzz.com", "site": "republicbuzz.com", "site_section": "http://republicbuzz.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Republic of Buzz", "title": "‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz", "title_full": "‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz", "published": "2018-05-12T23:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://republicbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/20180512/1089467_Mike-Novogratz-Hudson-River-Park-1024x683.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "437f7ef1483fcd86390d33e810e6f6102b7e9233", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmn1WFWo6925Xqd0.VpzQ7GfPFzpNGm0p04UuoKzk3xspxjmDLmQsqg4ChU1z71EwIwn3u5mVVIzKr1ktjeVU.KUDQ6FMP8wPtme6iXvNLLHUTTZUH78d6EGB0YlH6rm.Yk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Republic Buzz", "published": "2018-05-12T23:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz", "text": "Republic Buzz 1 hour ago No Comments\nBillionaire bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Capital Management, says every investor should have 1% to 2% of their portfolio in cryptocurrency in an interview with CNN’s Maggie Lake on “Markets Now.” Not to do so, in his view, is “almost irresponsible.” 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "galaxy digital capital management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maggie lake", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T00:44:35.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4d910b76f3b6046d9df3b26490477007a359e19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46L5Gboc2GYZ3tnTcdMizqDA--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=32", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "CSS - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "That is why Bitcoin crashed... - PROGRAMADORES", "title_full": "That is why Bitcoin crashed... - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-12T23:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4d910b76f3b6046d9df3b26490477007a359e19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46L5Gboc2GYZ3tnTcdMizqDA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-12T23:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "That is why Bitcoin crashed... - PROGRAMADORES", "text": " soft for breaking any Captcha\n can bypass\nXEvil 4.0 + CryptoMarkets = PROFIT! , Google ReCaptcha2 defeated: new program \"XEvil 4.0\" did that , I'm shocked!

A look at CMC’s rankings shows only a couple of coins posting positive 24-hour price changes. However, in the midst of the general cratering, Bitcoin appears to be the least affected of the lot.\nSouth Korea: The Epicenter of Events UPbit , the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform in South Korea, is currently under investigation. A joint task force of local police and financial regulators raided its Gangnam headquarters on May 10th. The platform is accused of diverting client funds into the wallets of its executives and forging its accounting records to cover up the malfeasance.\nThe reaction from the crypto community to the news followed the established script – panic. At some point on May 11th, the top 25 cryptos, according to market capitalization, were all in the red. Prices were declining by as much as 16 percent for tokens like Stellar, EOS, and Cardano .\nAccording to Marius Rupsys , a digital currency investor:\nThe main reason seems to be UPbit news. Most are talking about it, and if you look at prices in Korean exchanges, they are leading the drop.\nCrypto prices in South Korea are usually at a premium ( KimChi premium ) to the rest of the market. For the most of 2018, this premium was non-existent as the market recovered from a slow start to 2018. By the last week of April, market observers reported that the premiums were back . This return coincided with a considerable increase in average prices and total market capitalization values. As a result, any blip in the country’s local crypto market causes shockwaves in the global arena.\nHowever, some analysts believe that the present situation is an exaggerated reaction. According to Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of the crypto hedge fund firm, BitBull Capital:\nAs is so often the case, an event that should rightfully cause turbulence in a specific region seems to be creating shockwaves globally. The UPbit raid is not the first of its kind, and the markets overreacted in past similar instances as well. As the market continues to mature, these events should grow fewer and farther between, and investors will grow a thicker skin.\nBitcoin Resilience Bitcoin has so far suffered less of a decline than most other cryptos. The number one crypto fell below $9,000, but regarding percentage movement, its fall was much lower than the other top ten cryptocurrencies. Some analysts are attributing this to the stability of Bitcoin compared to other cryptos. Commenting on the stability of Bitcoin, Shone Antsey of Blockchain Intelligence Group said:\nBTC is the anchor crypto that all other cryptos are tied to in terms of price. Bitcoin is the most stable and dominant cryptocurrency with the largest network effect. Bitcoin is the one to watch, since if it fails they all fail.\nCrypto enthusiasts expect Bitcoin to make a full recovery beginning from the upcoming Blockchain Week in New York.\nIs the market reaction to the UPbit saga exaggerated?

A look at CMC’s rankings shows only a couple of coins posting positive 24-hour price changes. However, in the midst of the general cratering, Bitcoin appears to be the least affected of the lot. South Korea: The Epicenter of Events\nUPbit , the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform in South Korea, is currently under investigation. A joint task force of local police and financial regulators raided its Gangnam headquarters on May 10th. The platform is accused of diverting client funds into the wallets of its executives and forging its accounting records to cover up the malfeasance.\nThe reaction from the crypto community to the news followed the established script – panic. At some point on May 11th, the top 25 cryptos, according to market capitalization, were all in the red. Prices were declining by as much as 16 percent for tokens like Stellar, EOS, and Cardano .\nAccording to Marius Rupsys , a digital currency investor:\nThe main reason seems to be UPbit news. Most are talking about it, and if you look at prices in Korean exchanges, they are leading the drop.\nCrypto prices in South Korea are usually at a premium ( KimChi premium ) to the rest of the market. For the most of 2018, this premium was non-existent as the market recovered from a slow start to 2018. By the last week of April, market observers reported that the premiums were back . This return coincided with a considerable increase in average prices and total market capitalization values. As a result, any blip in the country’s local crypto market causes shockwaves in the global arena.\nHowever, some analysts believe that the present situation is an exaggerated reaction. According to Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of the crypto hedge fund firm, BitBull Capital:\nAs is so often the case, an event that should rightfully cause turbulence in a specific region seems to be creating shockwaves globally. The UPbit raid is not the first of its kind, and the markets overreacted in past similar instances as well. As the market continues to mature, these events should grow fewer and farther between, and investors will grow a thicker skin. Bitcoin Resilience\nBitcoin has so far suffered less of a decline than most other cryptos. The number one crypto fell below $9,000, but regarding percentage movement, its fall was much lower than the other top ten cryptocurrencies. Some analysts are attributing this to the stability of Bitcoin compared to other cryptos. Commenting on the stability of Bitcoin, Shone Antsey of Blockchain Intelligence Group said:\nBTC is the anchor crypto that all other cryptos are tied to in terms of price. Bitcoin is the most stable and dominant cryptocurrency with the largest network effect. Bitcoin is the one to watch, since if it fails they all fail.\nCrypto enthusiasts expect Bitcoin to make a full recovery beginning from the upcoming Blockchain Week in New York.\nIs the market reaction to the UPbit saga exaggerated?

Gox isn’t done with bitcoiners just yet. Just as it appeared the world’s most popular cryptocurrency was ready to strike above the stubborn high nine thousands in price, Nobuaki Kobayashi, Tokyo-based, court appointed trustee of the remaining bitcoin to be distributed among creditors, seems ready to flood another 8,000 coins onto a fragile market struggling to recover. Also read: Venezuela’s President Launches Crypto Funded Youth Bank, Encourages Mining Farms Gox Trustee to Flood Market with Over 8,000 Bitcoin The Tweets were unusually sure over the last three weeks. Luminaries who’ve seen it all wistfully claimed that, should the speculative price of bitcoin core (BTC) break above $10,000 again, and this was all but a foregone conclusion in their view, it would be the last time investors would ever see such a low. And then something happened along the way. The hot hand held by BTC enthusiasts was left cold: the price dropped to the low nine thousands. Then it broke below $9,000. It would finally settle very near $8,000 by press time. Mt. Gox happened, again. The exploded exchange from ancient history by crypto standards, 2014, is rearing its head in the form of trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi. Yet another flood of bitcoin selling appears to be poised, as Blockchain.info shows over 8,000 from the court ordered fund’s cold storage wallets (two) was recently shifted. As watchdog news of coin movement spread, the corresponding bitcoin core (BTC) price plummeted. It is unclear whether Gox coins will be shed through mainstream markets or over-the-counter exchanges. Fear, doubt, uncertainty (FUD) has been heaped on the digital asset in particular this week not only surrounding a potential market dump but also through legacy business media incessantly quoting Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Bill Gates about the supposed inherent ills of crypto. Not First Rodeo Something on the order of 137 thousand bitcoin remain in the Gox trust, according to various sources and wallet monitoring groups. The ecosystem has long accused institutional whales of shorting the market at the expense of overall prices. And as BTC goes, so do, historically, the rest of the cryptocurrency listings across the board. Not quite two months ago, Mr. Kobayashi dumped nearly half a billion dollars worth of BTC and bitcoin cash (BCH) onto markets. The response, which the Gox trustee denied, seemed to be an economic law: prices bottomed out under the mere weight of momentary over supply. Mr. Kobayashi insisted his flood back then had been orchestrated through OTC outlets rather than more mainstream markets. What is highly probable, however, is arbitrage of a sort. Keen OTCers could snap up discounted BTC and BCH, and then promptly unload them onto recognizable exchanges. The rub is always trying to avoid the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc , exuberantly asserting because X happened before Y, it caused Y.

BMW Tracking Mileage on a Blockchain Another blockchain partnership aims to track the mileage of cars. A team at BMW, the German automobile manufacturer, has been tasked with finding a way to better preserve the resale value of vehicles leased by the company. Collecting reliable data for the mileage, amortization and maintenance of these cars is crucial for achieving the best price on the second-hand market. The blockchain startup DOVU has been invited by BMW to establish a partnership with Alphabet, the auto giant’s leasing and fleet vehicle branch, and BMW’s Innovation Lab in order to develop a system to collect and keep record of the important information. The companies behind the project hope to also evaluate how effective tokenization can be in encouraging customers’ cooperation. In a pilot program implemented by the partners, BMW drivers are prompted by a custom wallet app to take a picture of their dashboards once a week. All submissions are added to DOVU’s blockchain which is used by Alphabet to compile consistent and unalterable data reflecting the exploitation of the vehicles. The information is then used to assess the mileage and the depreciation of the used cars and ultimately determine their resale value. What do you think of today’s Bitcoin in Brief stories?

This “experiment in philanthropy ” has seen many great successes, but the time has come to move on. It will be interesting to see which venture takes its place. Donating $55 million worth of Bitcoin to charities around the world is nothing to sneeze at. The Success of the Pineapple Fund For those unfamiliar with the Pineapple Fund , it was a project meant to bring Bitcoin to charities all over the world. The person responsible for creating this venture donated the majority of his or her own cryptocurrency holdings to various charities and good causes. Anyone in need of funding could apply through the project’s website and have their organization vetted. It was a simple business model which seemingly worked out quite well. Since its launch, the Pineapple Fund has successfully contributed to charities big and small. Any legitimate cause that the owner believed in – or that at least had a chance of succeeding – received a contribution in the form of Bitcoin. By taking this route, the world’s leading cryptocurrency received positive attention. It also highlighted the benefits of dealing in cryptocurrency rather than traditional payment methods. With $55 million in Bitcoin donations to date, it is safe to say the Pineapple Fund has been a success. During last year’s massive price bubble, the owner converted a total of 5,104 BTC to $55 million, which was then distributed among the eligible charities. Even though no one knows who is behind this charitable venture, the success of this project cannot be denied. Unfortunately, it will not be continued. One has to acknowledge the Pineapple Fund has always been a rather unique philanthropic effort. Most people who contribute to charities want to be in the spotlight. The individual known only as “Pine” has no such desire, which makes him or her a very unusual individual among both philanthropists and Bitcoin enthusiasts. People generally like to highlight their wealth, but Pine has always maintained a completely different mindset. It remains unclear why the Pineapple Fund will cease to exist. Ending on a high note is always a smart idea. Additionally, Pine made it a goal to donate $55 million worth of Bitcoin to charity, and that goal has been reached. Whether it was done well ahead of schedule, or perhaps took longer than Pine expected, will remain a bit of a mystery. Either way, the end result is still the same, which is all that matters in the end. With 60 different charities having been supported , the Pineapple Fund achieved the goal it set out to accomplish. Among the supported charities were Charity: Water, OpenBSD, Quill, The Reagent Project, WildMe, and many others. In all, the Pineapple Fund received over 10,000 applications for funding, which further shows how much interest this venture generated. It was a remarkable feat, and a valuable addition to the history of Bitcoin. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "worth of bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pineapple fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T21:11:16.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32210, "moreResultsAvailable": 3310, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=28900", "requestsLeft": 373}
