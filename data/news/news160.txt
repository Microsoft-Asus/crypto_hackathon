The institution has partnered with the Latin America–focused exchange startup Bitex — founded in 2014 — to potentially compete with SWIFT , a global, bank-owned messaging network.\nSWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is built to handle and process international bank payments. Unfortunately, the project has been suffering from security issues since it first entered the monetary arena.\nBanco Masventas is now the first financial establishment to base its cross-border payment system on the Bitcoin network. The website states that the service is set to enable international transfers to as many as 50 countries and that payments can be processed in 24 hours or less. Translated from their website, the service “allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers, as there are no international banks [serving] as intermediaries.” The move was reportedly inspired by the bank’s goal to enhance its digital services and lower transaction costs.\nOne of the establishment’s principal shareholders, José Dakak, stated that the bank is also looking to grow its list of international customers. “One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad,” he explained.\nDakak then added, “The customers will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the bank uses Bitex as a provider. For the customer, it’s transparent, they don’t touch, they don’t see the bitcoin. We are a provider for them, and they are not touching bitcoin.”\nAside from accelerating transaction times, Bitex — according to its website — will provide heightened security for customers by enforcing “strictest compliance rules,” including know-your-client (KYC) measures. The company has also contracted one of the “Big Four” accounting and audit firms, Deloitte, to review and report on specific procedures, operations and balance funds.\nArgentina’s blockchain and cryptocurrency ambitions have witnessed regular growth over the past several months, and the Argentinian government has been relatively welcoming to the technology. Earlier this year, for example, new legislation paved the way for approximately 4,000 bitcoin ATMs , which are now being installed throughout the country.

Kiwifruit exports rose $197 mln or 82% on a year-on-year basis. The other main contributors to April’s export rise were meat and edible offal, up $94 million, and milk powder, butter, and cheese, up $68 million. Lamb, up $42 million, led the rise in meat exports, closely followed by beef, up $41 million. Butter led the rise in dairy exports. The leading contributor to the rise in imports was an increased value of petroleum and products, up $221 million or 56 percent. Vehicles, parts, and accessories, up $179 million, and mechanical machinery and equipment, up $108 million, were the other main contributors to imports rise.\nBASE EROSION PROFIT SHIFTING New legislation to improve the fairness of the tax system and prevent large multinationals from exploiting rules in order to shift their profits offshore has passed another step closer to becoming law. The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill passed through its second reading in Parliament. Detailed debate will continue when Parliament resumes in June. The changes will prevent multinationals from using BEPS strategies, including artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties to shift profits out of New Zealand, related-party transactions which are intended to shift profits to offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore, hybrid mismatch arrangements that exploit differences between countries' tax rules to achieve an advantageous tax position, artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence or a permanent establishment in New Zealand and tactics to stymie an Inland Revenue investigation, such as withholding relevant information that is held by an offshore group member. Related Topics News Bonds Term deposits Currencies TWI NZ$ borrowing saving\nRETAIL MARKETS The latest Retail NZ Retail Radar report shows that 58% of retailers either hit or exceeded their targets in the March 2018 quarter. This means that 42% did not meet targets as a result of low consumer confidence in a highly competitive market. However, retailers are still confident and three-quarters expect to meet target in the coming quarter. The ‘liquor’ and ‘electrical and electronic goods’ category had the strongest growth, and declines were seen for ‘motor vehicles and parts’ and ‘recreational goods’. In terms of prices, a third of the retailers expect prices to rise due to higher wage costs in production and retail and higher freight costs due to higher fuel prices.\nAPRIL 2025'S BOND TENDER The New Zealand Debt Management Office conducted a tender to $200 mln worth of April 2025 bonds . The bonds attracted 38 bids with a total value of $797 mln. Of these, 13 bids were successful in bidding for the bonds at a weighted average accepted yield of 2.56%. The lowest accepted yield was 2.5550% and the highest accepted yield was 2.5650%. WESTPAC CONDUCT The Federal Court in Australia has dismissed ASIC's case that Westpac manipulated one of the country's most important interest rates, but found the bank engaged in unconscionable conduct. Justice Jonathan Beach said there were four occasions where Westpac traders had acted with the dominant purpose of influencing the bank bill swap rate, which amounted to unconscionable conduct, but he was not convinced they had successfully manipulated the price in these instances. CBA'S SUPERANNUATION STING The Commonwealth Bank plans to slug superannuation and pension fund members with a hefty fee to fund the cost of regulatory compliance , in a move described as an \"out-and-out gouge\" by Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer. The bank this month wrote to members of its flagship superannuation fund Colonial First State, informing them they'll be charged a \"regulatory reform fee\" in June 2018.\nTARIFFS ON CAR IMPORTS The Trump administration is considering adding a 25% tax on imported cars in the US on the basis that vehicle and parts imports were threatening the industry's health and ability to research and develop new, advanced technologies.\nBENCHMARK INTEREST RATES SLIP/FLATTEN AGAIN Local swap rates are lower and flatter today, with the short end down -1 bps and the long end down -3 bps.

A BI investigation last year found \"pump and dump\" scams — where groups falsely ramp up the price of assets for profit — are rife in cryptocurrency markets.\nLONDON — The US Justice Department has reportedly opened a criminal probe into potential market manipulation of bitcoin prices, according to a Bloomberg report.\nBloomberg reported that the Justice Department is working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees cryptocurrency derivatives, to investigate potential market manipulation.\nThe investigation is said to focus on \"spoofing\" — where false orders are placed on exchanges and then withdrawn to manipulate prices — in an attempt to lure other people into buying or selling and \"wash trading,\" where market participants trade with themselves to create the illusion of market activity.\nThese kinds of activities allow bad actors to manipulate the price of assets in their favour. Spoofing and wash trading are illegal in mainstream regulated markets such as equities and futures.\nThere are around 26 different ways to manipulate a market, according to a study last year .&\nA Business Insider investigation last year found so-called \"pump and dump\" scams are rife in cryptocurrency markets. This is where people \"pump\" a price of a certain crypto by bidding up the price before \"dumping\" it on unsuspecting traders who are lured into the market by the pumpers who say the price is only going up.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently cited Business Insider's investigation in a report highlighting concerns about cryptocurrency markets.\nAnonymous Twitter account Bitfinex'ed, which has over 38,000 followers, has also repeatedly drawn attention to alleged instances of wash trading and spoofing, calling for action from regulators.\nBloomberg reports that the US regulators' investigation, which is in its early stages, focuses on bitcoin, ether, and other major cryptocurrencies.\nBusiness Insider interviewed an alleged \"pump and dump\" ringleader last year who claimed to have been involved in bitcoin price manipulation in the past but said the size of the market made it too hard to manipulate today.\n\"We did manipulate these but now it's too hard with big market capitalization,\" the trader, who went by the name Nico, claimed. \"Our biggest power ever has been around $5 million...

I followed the open innovation minor the study provides, where I can basically choose any subject that I want to learn about, and make something :). For me that subject was blockchain, being in bitcoin for almost 5 years triggered my interest to really learn about the tech behind it.\nWhen I started with the minor I was a little clueless about what exactly blockchain was good for, hearing mixed things about it online for so long. On one side blockhain promises huge potential for all sorts of usecases but when I started looking in to it I realized that there really aren't that many legit usecases and that money and bitcoin is what the discussion should really be about. BITCOIN IS THE KILLER APP.\nTeachers weren't very exited about my findings in the first place and kept pushing that there must be a lot of other things blockchain is good for, it took me a while to gather the right arguments to convince them that they shouldn't be looking a blockchain but instead focus a bit more(if not completely) on bitcoin. Anyway, one idea that stood out and that fitted limited time that I had in the minor was a gambling site, using the block hash as a random source. Not a new concept but I figured it would be a good one to learn about the tech. So I created https://www.blockhash.win/ where players can earn 2x their bet amount by guessing the right last digit of the blockhash that includes their transaction. I've spend many hours developing and I've learned a lot. I would recommend any software engineer or student like me to learn about the tech and build somthing. I learned a lot from the book that I picked up for this minor: Mastering bitcoin by Andreas M. Antonopoulos (I would really recommend the book if your a software guy or just technical!)\nI'm open for feedback and I'm really curious what you guys think of it, let me know :) If you would like to get started developing something bitcoin and don't know where to get started, hit me up! Don't cry about bitcoin's price, learn about the tech and develop something or contribute to an existing project.\n submitted by /u/pocketnl\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.blockhash.win/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T23:38:52.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8f390dd66d398103f847c88e895bb375256cf94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4ORs3LB4hXgyUwZYR0uIBMG79lQi1dhPWhe.uVGBG4vc5ChuBGEcRcyEYVWvTQpqo", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin rallies and sell-offs since mid-2016", "title_full": "Bitcoin rallies and sell-offs since mid-2016", "published": "2018-05-24T04:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8f390dd66d398103f847c88e895bb375256cf94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4ORs3LB4hXgyUwZYR0uIBMG79lQi1dhPWhe.uVGBG4vc5ChuBGEcRcyEYVWvTQpqo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T04:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin rallies and sell-offs since mid-2016", "text": "Bitcoin rallies and sell-offs since mid-2016\n/u/fabricioespe\nsubmitted by /u/fabricioespe\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:29:28.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5d10fe51c3a03c7abe8b26e62541204a54396be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRE8l6tXhiMVApnBb40J0CY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-24T04:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5d10fe51c3a03c7abe8b26e62541204a54396be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRE8l6tXhiMVApnBb40J0CY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "susuberuang", "published": "2018-05-24T04:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "text": "Mainstream media is controlled by governments and big banks.

For many of their owners, those bitcoins have proved to be a valuable asset. They’re happy to leave them to rise in value and build up their wealth. For others though, those giant piles of coins are exactly what they’re supposed to be: a currency that they want to exchange for goods and services. But businesses are reluctant to accept them. In July last year, Bloomberg reported that just three of the Internet’s top 500 retailers were willing to accept the cryptocurrency. The biggest reason is clear enough. When the payment you take for a product can lose as much as a quarter of its value within a week , pricing becomes difficult. A seller that paid $80 for a product and sold it online for $100 in bitcoin could find that he has only $75 a week later–and no business at all not long afterwards. On the other hand, they could find that they’ve earned an additional 10 percent the day after the sale with no extra effort. While those fluctuations are exciting, business owners tend to want stability. They want to be sure that the payments they receive for their goods and services cover their costs and deliver a reliable profit. It’s the only way that they can stay in business. So how can you take advantage of the availability of billions of dollars of a new currency without leaving yourself vulnerable to the currency’s volatility? How can your business join the cryptocurrency world and accept bitcoin risk-free? There are options and smart businesses are making good use of them. In 2013, a man in Florida called a Lamborghini dealership in Newport County, CA and asked if he could buy a Tesla from them using bitcoin. Other dealers had already turned him down, he said. The dealership was cautious. The car cost $103,000. But the company didn’t want to reject a sale so it accepted the payment using Bitpay . The buyer paid 91.4 bitcoins and the seller received the money in dollars. According to CNN , news of the sale prompted ten more potential buyers to call the dealership. Bitpay still allows businesses to accept payments while receiving fiat. Users of bitcoin transfer their payments using the company’s payment platform. The firm locks in an exchange rate and delivers fiat to the seller’s bank account. Companies can advertise to wealthy bitcoin owners and accept their payments without exposing themselves to the coin’s volatility. A number of other companies now offer a similar service. CoinGate extends the acceptance to more than 40 different kinds of altcoins with instant conversion to euros or dollars. These tools, and more are surfacing, allow business to accept bitcoins risk-free. They can also allow businesses to receive their payments in bitcoin. While that brings back the risk, it’s worth noting that if the Newport Beach car dealer had kept the bitcoin, he would have sold that Tesla for around $1.5 million in today’s money. Some risks might well be worth taking.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-bitcoin/bitcoin-falls-30-percent-posts-worst-week-since-2013-idUSKBN1EG0A8", "http://inc.com/joel-comm/7-cryptocurrency-investors-you-need-to-follow.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/06/autos/tesla-bitcoin/index.html", "http://inc.com/joel-comm/5-bitcoin-alternatives-you-need-to-watch.html", "https://bitpay.com/", "https://twitter.com/share", "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/bitcoin-shrugs-off-bubble-talk-and-surges-past-19000/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-12/bitcoin-acceptance-among-retailers-is-low-and-getting-lower", "https://coingate.com/accept-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:02:29.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fbb5a2d3e21b8a3afae719f921070864e773d644", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqWyGFWD4HG.epTp3YqIVum40-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-24T04:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fbb5a2d3e21b8a3afae719f921070864e773d644", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqWyGFWD4HG.epTp3YqIVum40-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T04:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 24.

ANON coin was developed to address the demand for a cryptocurrency that provides truly anonymous transactions. A list of participating exchanges is expected by August 15, 2018, and the remainder of the BTCA testnet will take place up to the snapshot on September 9, 2018. ANON will officially be available on September 10, 2018 at a 1:1 ratio to holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and ZClassic (ZCL). As it is a co-fork of BTC and ZCL, one must hold BTC or ZCL prior to the fork to acquire ANON. The maximum amount of ANON will be 31.5 million, with 24 million ANON available when the fork occurs. BTCA intends to set ANON apart from other forks by succeeding where previous forks did not. The team cites lack of anonymous transactions, high transactions fees, and lengthy transaction times as some of the failures their coin will circumvent. The ability to anonymously transact draws many to cryptocurrency. BTC, the most prominent cryptocurrency, does not facilitate anonymous transactions. ANON draws from the privacy protocol of ZCL to provide anonymous transactions by using the same MIT-developed zkSNARKs privacy protocol. The zkSNARKs protocol allows for verifiable transactions without requiring interaction between the prover and verifier. As such, transactions are both secure and completely anonymous. While previous forks, like ZCL, have succeeded in providing anonymous transactions, they have fallen short in other ways that deterred widespread market adoption of the currency. The BTCA team includes several crypto and Fintech veterans who have observed other forks and what the crypto community wants to see. Increased block size and incorporation of masternodes are two features the BTCA team integrated into ANON in response to crypto market demand. Developers increased block size to support faster transaction times. Masternodes provide an opportunity for return on investment for holders of a minimum required amount of a particular coin. Through masternodes, holders of ANON can stake the currency. Staking incentivizes holding the coin for extended periods of time. The BTCA team intends that ANON is accessible and appealing to both those who have never used crypto and existing crypto users. As such, a community presence and transparent development are core principles for BTCA. BTCA has a social media presence, through which they communicate with their public. Videos of the forking process, frequent updates, and Q&A events allow anyone to follow the forking process. The team wants to tell their forking story in such a way that those unfamiliar with crypto are interested and informed, thus overcoming what was a challenge for previous forks in terms of effectively connecting with those new to crypto.

The demand of the existing institutional clients for a credible, efficient and secure platform to trade cryptocurrencies have led way to the development of the new cryptocurrency trading platform called ‘LMAX Digital’.\nLMAX Exchange has also mentioned in their statement that LMAX Digital is only going to list the most liquid and established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], Litecoin [LTC], Ripple [XRP] and Bitcoin Cash [BCH].\nThe exchange is going to align with regulations and rules laid by Financial Conduct Authority [FCA] by providing trading facility seven days a week and 24 hours a day. The exchange is going to make sure that all the market participants will be treated equally regardless of their activity levels, status and size. The exchange promises to provide best-of-breed security, KYC, compliance and anti-money laundering policies.\nLMAX Exchange has transacted over $10 trillion of fiat currency in over 100 countries as a multilateral trading venue since its initial launch in 2010. The exchange operates as a worldwide FX exchange with offices in London, New York, and Tokyo.\nThe CEO of LMAX Exchange, David Mercer has said that they are furthering the legitimization of the cryptocurrency market by offering an institutional platform on which their clients can trade, hold and acquire cryptocurrencies securely with high quality and deep liquidity.\nThey are perfectly positioned to address the gap in the market for a robust physical cryptocurrency exchange. They believe that their exchange is going to support the transformation of the cryptocurrency market from the fringes to the mainstream.\nDavid Mercer, the CEO of LMAX Digital says:\n“After the launch of LMAX Digital in our London-based data center [LD4], we are true to our ambition of becoming the leading exchange. We are planning to roll out other LMAX Digital exchanges in New York and Tokyo to meet demand from our clients”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lmax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lmax exchange group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial conduct authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lmax digital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lmax exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T10:57:21.060+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "893ea566581b920c1a13b005189a498928d7e46b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg87QClJIy4ce_f7._0N1DcbSks_WFyalw2KEbCx6HLgjm9HNyZjz5Jut_TSrQwipsspsfGTJJiiTixZROWcbWxZkd06fcS8uvavg358ENeDiQ--", "site_full": "www.zerohedge.com", "site": "zerohedge.com", "site_section": "https://www.zerohedge.com/archive/all", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Archive | Zero Hedge", "title": "Can Bitcoin Become A Flight-To-Quality Asset?", "title_full": "Can Bitcoin Become A Flight-To-Quality Asset? | Zero Hedge", "published": "2018-05-24T03:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/2018-05/Can-Bitcoin-still-be-considered-a-safe-haven-commodity.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2435, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "893ea566581b920c1a13b005189a498928d7e46b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg87QClJIy4ce_f7._0N1DcbSks_WFyalw2KEbCx6HLgjm9HNyZjz5Jut_TSrQwipsspsfGTJJiiTixZROWcbWxZkd06fcS8uvavg358ENeDiQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tyler Durden", "published": "2018-05-24T03:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can Bitcoin Become A Flight-To-Quality Asset?", "text": "Authored by Omid Malekan via Medium.com,\n2018 might be the year we find out.\nThere’s an old saying on Wall Street that when times are good, you should focus on the return on your capital, but when times are bad, you should only care about the return of your capital. A flight to quality asset then is anything that tends to go up in times of turmoil because investors perceive it as a safe place to park their money.\nUpon first glance, Bitcoin is a terrible candidate for such a role. It’s volatile, hard to understand, and difficult to access given how it exists outside of the traditional banking system.\nSo why would anyone consider it desirable during a crisis? Because it exists outside of the traditional banking system.\nOne of the first parabolic up-moves for the cryptocoin began with a banking crisis in Cypress. Back in 2013, while still reeling from the aftermath of the financial crisis, the tiny Mediterranean country found its banking system teetering , and reached out to the bigger European powers for help.\nBut instead of offering them a bailout, the EU came back with something more along the lines of a bail- in, as it demanded that Cypriot banks confiscate a portion of their customers deposits to shore up their balance sheets. To add insult to injury, they also imposed capital controls that prevented people from moving their money to a safer jurisdiction.\nAs you can see on the chart below, a decentralized form of money like Bitcoin, despite its drawbacks, can suddenly look very appealing when the centralized system starts to falter.\nCrypto skeptics who tell us that digital money should not be worth anything often forget that fiat money like the Euro is also in of itself worthless. It’s only valuable when someone else is willing to trade a good or service for it. But you can’t get anything in exchange for money that the government is taking or locking up, which is why the Cypriot crisis brought a lot of attention to the then relatively unknown Bitcoin.\nGovernment officials don’t like cryptocoins because they transfer the sovereignty of money from their control to a decentralized consensus mechanism, a transfer that they view as a downgrade in the quality of money. If our existing system of money and banking was always stable, they would have a point.\nBut every time there is a crisis , it reminds the public that the folks in charge are not as smart as they think they are. When those same leaders respond to the crisis with draconian capital controls (or selective bailouts for their once and future employers on Wall Street) they remind the public that they aren’t as fair as they think they are, either. Bitcoin might be volatile and hard to understand, but it’s always fair, because math does not discriminate, nor does it change the rules when people start to panic.\nSo why bring this issue up now? Because there is financial trouble brewing in certain corners of the global financial system, and if things continue to deteriorate, this year might serve as an important test of the crypto economy.\nIran and Venezuela are in the midst of the kinds of hyperinflationary currency death spirals that bring societies to their knees. In Argentina, the peso has fallen to an all-time low against the dollar as inflation and interest rates spike. Turkey is having problems of its own , and China continues to do everything it can to prevent its citizens from liberating their own money.\nSome of this weakness was to be expected, because the Federal Reserve is now removing the liquidity it has provided for the past decade. But there’s a bigger issue in play, as the perennial economic mismanagement of developing nations is now rubbing up against the increasing political instability ( Brexit, Trump, Catalonia, Five Star ) of developed ones.\nIn the old days, the two best candidates for flight to quality assets were gold and the Dollar. But the former is hard to get a hold of and even harder to store, and the latter is no panacea either. When the Argentinian government last devalued its currency back in 2001, it first forced all local banks to convert the dollar-denominated accounts of its citizens to the Peso. Even the citizens that were smart enough not to trust the local currency had their savings destroyed, learning the valuable lesson that dollars in the bank is not the same as dollars under the mattress.\nOne of the most important takeaways from past financial crisis is that when the stuff hits the fan, banks are nothing more than a policy tool for the government.\nSo can a cryptocoin like Bitcoin be considered a flight to quality asset for certain countries? Given everything we’ve learned in the past 20 years, a better question to ask might be how could it not.\n* * *\nOmid Malekan is the author of the newly published The Story of the Blockchain: A Beginner’s Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands.

It is presently at about 400 million per month worldwide or about 12-13 million per day. LocalBitcoins purchases should be looked at as especially bullish for the price of Bitcoin because of the premium that buyers are willing to pay to be able to get ahold of BTC. It means that they are almost exclusively hodler's or users of Bitcoin and that type of capital has the lowest turnover. Low turnover matters because every single day about 90 percent of the money coming from local bitcoins is new money that is adding to the demand for coin and is unlikely to sell for a long time. That eventually eats away at supply slowly but surely.\nCoinbase is the retail level of bitcoin purchasing. During December of last year Coinbase had 400 million dollars in trading revenue. So if you put their average fee at about 2 percent of a trade, means about 20 billion dollars in btc. was traded in that one month alone. Since December Coinbase has increased the number of support people by 500 people. The number of new users to the site is approaching 30 million. Which is about 66 percent higher than in December. The ratio of buyers to sellers on Coinbase is 80/20 and the average purchase of a buyer is $428 dollars. What matters to the bull case of bitcoin are people that are buying Bitcoin as an investment and who aren't instantly trading it when the price moves up. If GDAX does 300 million in volume per day and that includes Coinbase volume in that number, than it's fair to say that about 50 million per day is being added to long term positions per day.\nThe exchanges have a lot of new customers around the world. Combined they are doing about 5 billion per day in volume on btc. in total. What percentage of that are new buyers that aren't trading? If that number is 1 percent which I think it's reasonable that's another 50 million per day of investment level longs that are happening.\nBitcoin ATMS are confirmed at 3 million dollars per day new money with 90 percent one way invested. Over 3k ATMS now.\nThe Square cash app just added Bitcoin trading last quarter and that number adds up to about 300k per day and it's only available so far in 5-6 states.\nRobinhood had a waiting list with over 1 million people on it to be able to trade crypto. They have 4 million registered users.\nThere was recently an article that said that OTC demand was coming in at about 100 million dollars per day for large traders. If all OTC demand is taken into consideration it's probably closer to 200 million. I'm including trades between friends, family, and other trusted people. I think that at least 5 percent of that trading would be net long. So that's at least another 10 million per day.\nBitcoin.org wallets are growing at about 15k new wallets per day and about 26 million overall.\nCircle says that it's doing about 2 billion a month in crypto volume.\nIn a growing market the law of large numbers starts to work in bulls favor. Because if it's true for instance that 5 percent buy with intention to hold for x number of years regardless of price the total number of those types of trades increases as the size of the addressable market grows. So traders have to trade above a floor that keeps moving up.\nBears lose when the price decreases because even though new user interest is lower during price lulls the total growth doesn't go away and the amount of coin that buyers can get for every dollar of fiat increases. In a increasing market FOMO kicks in and user registrations sky rocket because of all of the media attention that the price increase generates.\nBears, sellers, and short-sellers are making the new money the \"smart money\" by giving them a deal that is almost certain.\nThink about it differently. Let's say all of a sudden by magic there were 1 billion owners or potential owners of bitcoin. It doesn't matter if they are all about to sell it. What matters is that they are involved in the market. Involvement means that they all want to own the most bitcoin that they can for the best possible price. How much effort they are willing to put into that goal influences the short term price. But the overall amount of involvement in the market is something that they cannot control. They might have very strict conditions about when they are willing to buy bitcoin. But because a certain percentage of people in the market will purchase bitcoin as a store of value for their fiat currency regardless of price, those people in total can cause the overall price to outpace what a picky trader would be willing to pay. When there is limited supply and an increasing number of participants those traders will eventually be forced to accept the conditions or stop trading at all. This dynamic is similar to forex markets. The liquidity of the underlying currency is so high that the value becomes extremely predictable. Even major news cannot harm liquidity if it exists. The liquidity determines the price not the event.\nIf 16-17 million bitcoins had to be divided among a group of 1 billion people because they had made involvement with crypto an economic decision in their life, consumer behavior would be the first layer that would determine the overall value. The first factor would be how much can each of them really own at this exact same price, to determine if the price will be higher when the market reaches 1 billion users. About 160 dollars worth each. But that number doesn't jibe if you have people like the Winklevosses that own 1 percent of all bitcoin. It also doesn't work if the average first purchase of a bitcoin buyer is over 400 dollars. And that's just the first purchase.\nBefore the market cap can reflect the instrinic value of Bitcoin the market growth has to stop. New money has to stop being added to the market. It may be true that based on transaction volume alone that bitcoin \"should\" be worth 10k or whatever number. But there is way more to the use case for Bitcoin than just that one purpose.\nGold has pretty limited uses as well but it's worth 7 trillion dollars because of the size of the market and not necessarily its usefulness.\nBitcoin will reach that same \"irrational\" result as long as new people keep pouring money into the system. Bitcoin at 5-10 trillion is not just likely it's mathematically inevitable at this rate of growth.\n submitted by /u/olesentv\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:34:07.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26e7e4122ff81e3e0daae7a17720dfcb6ffe8f51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2T9ht_ywizwbG_E8csNiIRz1viHPZWDm5v97xJ8DkVOl42sy2oEXRhva3RKr7x1zCdJ5HhJS9DOTcWoxwVAZEcXvrjgfch6H2msMs95yXUNZo-", "site_full": "feedproxy.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "http://conservativeangle.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "Conservative Angle", "title": "Can Bitcoin Become A Flight-To-Quality Asset?", "title_full": "Can Bitcoin Become A Flight-To-Quality Asset?", "published": "2018-05-24T03:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5177826-thumb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26e7e4122ff81e3e0daae7a17720dfcb6ffe8f51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2T9ht_ywizwbG_E8csNiIRz1viHPZWDm5v97xJ8DkVOl42sy2oEXRhva3RKr7x1zCdJ5HhJS9DOTcWoxwVAZEcXvrjgfch6H2msMs95yXUNZo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EdJenner", "published": "2018-05-24T03:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can Bitcoin Become A Flight-To-Quality Asset?", "text": "Authored by Omid Malekan via Medium.com,\n2018 might be the year we find out.\nThere’s an old saying on Wall Street that when times are good, you should focus on the return on your capital, but when times are bad, you should only care about the return of your capital. A flight to quality asset then is anything that tends to go up in times of turmoil because investors perceive it as a safe place to park their money.\nUpon first glance, Bitcoin is a terrible candidate for such a role. It’s volatile, hard to understand, and difficult to access given how it exists outside of the traditional banking system.\nSo why would anyone consider it desirable during a crisis? Because it exists outside of the traditional banking system.\nOne of the first parabolic up-moves for the cryptocoin began with a banking crisis in Cypress. Back in 2013, while still reeling from the aftermath of the financial crisis, the tiny Mediterranean country found its banking system teetering , and reached out to the bigger European powers for help.\nBut instead of offering them a bailout, the EU came back with something more along the lines of a bail- in, as it demanded that Cypriot banks confiscate a portion of their customers deposits to shore up their balance sheets. To add insult to injury, they also imposed capital controls that prevented people from moving their money to a safer jurisdiction.\nAs you can see on the chart below, a decentralized form of money like Bitcoin, despite its drawbacks, can suddenly look very appealing when the centralized system starts to falter.\nCrypto skeptics who tell us that digital money should not be worth anything often forget that fiat money like the Euro is also in of itself worthless. It’s only valuable when someone else is willing to trade a good or service for it. But you can’t get anything in exchange for money that the government is taking or locking up, which is why the Cypriot crisis brought a lot of attention to the then relatively unknown Bitcoin.\nGovernment officials don’t like cryptocoins because they transfer the sovereignty of money from their control to a decentralized consensus mechanism, a transfer that they view as a downgrade in the quality of money. If our existing system of money and banking was always stable, they would have a point.\nBut every time there is a crisis , it reminds the public that the folks in charge are not as smart as they think they are. When those same leaders respond to the crisis with draconian capital controls (or selective bailouts for their once and future employers on Wall Street) they remind the public that they aren’t as fair as they think they are, either. Bitcoin might be volatile and hard to understand, but it’s always fair, because math does not discriminate, nor does it change the rules when people start to panic.\nSo why bring this issue up now? Because there is financial trouble brewing in certain corners of the global financial system, and if things continue to deteriorate, this year might serve as an important test of the crypto economy.\nIran and Venezuela are in the midst of the kinds of hyperinflationary currency death spirals that bring societies to their knees. In Argentina, the peso has fallen to an all-time low against the dollar as inflation and interest rates spike. Turkey is having problems of its own , and China continues to do everything it can to prevent its citizens from liberating their own money.\nSome of this weakness was to be expected, because the Federal Reserve is now removing the liquidity it has provided for the past decade. But there’s a bigger issue in play, as the perennial economic mismanagement of developing nations is now rubbing up against the increasing political instability ( Brexit, Trump, Catalonia, Five Star ) of developed ones.\nIn the old days, the two best candidates for flight to quality assets were gold and the Dollar. But the former is hard to get a hold of and even harder to store, and the latter is no panacea either. When the Argentinian government last devalued its currency back in 2001, it first forced all local banks to convert the dollar-denominated accounts of its citizens to the Peso. Even the citizens that were smart enough not to trust the local currency had their savings destroyed, learning the valuable lesson that dollars in the bank is not the same as dollars under the mattress.\nOne of the most important takeaways from past financial crisis is that when the stuff hits the fan, banks are nothing more than a policy tool for the government.\nSo can a cryptocoin like Bitcoin be considered a flight to quality asset for certain countries? Given everything we’ve learned in the past 20 years, a better question to ask might be how could it not.\n* * *\nOmid Malekan is the author of the newly published The Story of the Blockchain: A Beginner’s Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands.

Lee identifies three key factors that make him believe the price will surge past the 2017 high. On Wednesday, BTC dropped below $8,000 and traded around $7,500, losing most of the gains it made from mid-April to early May. With Wednesday's plunge, BTC is now down 41 percent this year. Lee believes the drop is only due to “typical crypto volatility”, and explains his bullish stance with three major factors. The first key factor is the BTC production and replication costs. At the “Futures Now” show on CNBC on Tuesday, Lee said that BTC was “trading at cost”, because the price of production was almost equal to the trading price. Since, according to Lee, the cost production for BTC production was around $6,000 on Wednesday, it is still worth more than its mining cost. Among the major factors which could trigger a possible price increase, Lee names institutional investors who, while interested in the crypto space, haven’t fully entered the industry due to regulatory uncertainties. He said: I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven't really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty. But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why Bitcoin rallies. Lastly, data compiled by Fundstrat shows a historical trend, by which Lee recommends that investors hold on to their BTC. He said: Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of Bitcoin's price. If you just took out those 10 days, Bitcoin's down 25 percent a year. So as miserable as it feels holding Bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days. Earlier this month, Fundstrat Global Advisors revealed research placing the BTC price at $36,000 in 2019 based on historical averages. The analysis of the relation between BTC mining costs and price led analysts to predict the cryptocurrency’s range to be between $20,000 and $64,000 by the end of 2019. At press time, BTC is trading at $7,594 .

An AI compilation published on Youtube Tuesday that used pre-existing Bitcoin (BTC) explainers to come up with its own “basic stage training” on Bitcoin has resulted in almost complete nonsense, Mashable reports May 22.\nCreated by Botnik Studios, which describes itself on Twitter as a “human-machine creative force,” the Youtube video is a voice over of the texts generated by an AI that used “predictive keyboard trained on dozens of Bitcoin explainers.” In order to introduce the viewer to the coin, the video first explains that “Bitcoin is the most valuable form of electricity.” The AI explainer then teaches the viewer exactly how Bitcoin transactions work according to its generated text: “Randomly pick a number between one and 30,000. Now spend that amount of money on Ethereum.\nThis is known as hashing the code to get some of that Bitcoin.” The video also touches on the topic of blockchain, which a user can gain access to by installing “exploit.bin, and it will remind you every day of your biggest nightmares.” Having Bitcoin – whose most popular form is the “Wild Richard” which can be used to pay for “counterfeit coffee” – is described as having advantages despite its risks: “One benefit of Bitcoin is that you can upload a version of your future self on the darknet, but it will kill your retirement account, because it is over 1,000 years old.” The video ends with two warnings to all viewers, the first being that the “safest way to protect your Bitcoin wallet is simply to lose it,” and the second touching on a more personal subject: “Caution: the last time I mined a fresh Bitcoin, billionaire killer Mark February tried to patent my life.” Cointelegraph has its own series of explainers that were not created with AI, including ones on Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining, blockchain, and crypto wallets.

Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 percent to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. It’s down more than 20 percent since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders Colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading — forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise — it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 — has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC . As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry.\nSome market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Matt Robinson in New York at mrobinson55@bloomberg.net; Tom Schoenberg in Washington at tschoenberg@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bloomberg law", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "focus of u.s. criminal probe bitcoin manipulation said", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "focus of u.s. criminal probe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:13:02.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88e51196681af3a5aa82df51b1f6922911405236", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYr8ndUg8MeJ0qojbQBxPlhN2xQ4lDKWvhQM4A5BXNic7s.QXjOFL2TZOmo7MQSEhKhmaPa6BNT.Jp.NIjildW", "site_full": "cryptocurrencynews.com", "site": "cryptocurrencynews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Possible Bitcoin Price Manipulation?

A flight to quality asset then is anything that tends to go up in times of turmoil because investors perceive it as a safe place to park their money.\nUpon first glance, Bitcoin is a terrible candidate for such a role. It’s volatile, hard to understand, and difficult to access given how it exists outside of the traditional banking system.\nSo why would anyone consider it desirable during a crisis? Because it exists outside of the traditional banking system.\nOne of the first parabolic up-moves for the cryptocoin began with a banking crisis in Cypress. Back in 2013, while still reeling from the aftermath of the financial crisis, the tiny Mediterranean country found its banking system teetering , and reached out to the bigger European powers for help.\nBut instead of offering them a bailout, the EU came back with something more along the lines of a bail- in, as it demanded that Cypriot banks confiscate a portion of their customers deposits to shore up their balance sheets. To add insult to injury, they also imposed capital controls that prevented people from moving their money to a safer jurisdiction.\nAs you can see on the chart below, a decentralized form of money like Bitcoin, despite its drawbacks, can suddenly look very appealing when the centralized system starts to falter.\nCrypto skeptics who tell us that digital money should not be worth anything often forget that fiat money like the Euro is also in of itself worthless. It’s only valuable when someone else is willing to trade a good or service for it. But you can’t get anything in exchange for money that the government is taking or locking up, which is why the Cypriot crisis brought a lot of attention to the then relatively unknown Bitcoin.\nGovernment officials don’t like cryptocoins because they transfer the sovereignty of money from their control to a decentralized consensus mechanism, a transfer that they view as a downgrade in the quality of money. If our existing system of money and banking was always stable, they would have a point.\nBut every time there is a crisis , it reminds the public that the folks in charge are not as smart as they think they are. When those same leaders respond to the crisis with draconian capital controls (or selective bailouts for their once and future employers on Wall Street) they remind the public that they aren’t as fair as they think they are, either. Bitcoin might be volatile and hard to understand, but it’s always fair, because math does not discriminate, nor does it change the rules when people start to panic.\nSo why bring this issue up now? Because there is financial trouble brewing in certain corners of the global financial system, and if things continue to deteriorate, this year might serve as an important test of the crypto economy.\nIran and Venezuela are in the midst of the kinds of hyperinflationary currency death spirals that bring societies to their knees. In Argentina, the peso has fallen to an all-time low against the dollar as inflation and interest rates spike. Turkey is having problems of its own , and China continues to do everything it can to prevent its citizens from liberating their own money.\nSome of this weakness was to be expected, because the Federal Reserve is now removing the liquidity it has provided for the past decade. But there’s a bigger issue in play, as the perennial economic mismanagement of developing nations is now rubbing up against the increasing political instability ( Brexit, Trump, Catalonia, Five Star ) of developed ones.\nIn the old days, the two best candidates for flight to quality assets were gold and the Dollar. But the former is hard to get a hold of and even harder to store, and the latter is no panacea either. When the Argentinian government last devalued its currency back in 2001, it first forced all local banks to convert the dollar-denominated accounts of its citizens to the Peso. Even the citizens that were smart enough not to trust the local currency had their savings destroyed, learning the valuable lesson that dollars in the bank is not the same as dollars under the mattress.\nOne of the most important takeaways from past financial crisis is that when the stuff hits the fan, banks are nothing more than a policy tool for the government.\nSo can a cryptocoin like Bitcoin be considered a flight to quality asset for certain countries? Given everything we’ve learned in the past 20 years, a better question to ask might be how could it not.\n* * *\nOmid Malekan is the author of the newly published The Story of the Blockchain: A Beginner’s Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands.

Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 per cent to $7,409 as of 9:32 am London time. It’s down more than 20 per cent since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders Colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading -- forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nSpoofing Is a Silly Name for Serious Market Rigging: QuickTake\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy .\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise -- it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 -- has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry.\nSome market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bitcoin", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bitcoin-manipulation-said-to-be-focus-of-us-criminal-probe/articleshow/64303324.cms&title=Bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom schoenberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matt robinson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloombe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T12:39:17.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e667a3406712f3307bcad862cd4d75756a05ffb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVN1YyoN5wVn9.9IZZpeyuL.2HGKoGsFLslygkWvWw8E6nXp9GBZxnmIGpsCaiF0jXTgyYr.3lk66Cr7gusL.3P2hb_F89kRqcUElLRUt8RrQ-", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.192, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/US-DOJ.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e667a3406712f3307bcad862cd4d75756a05ffb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVN1YyoN5wVn9.9IZZpeyuL.2HGKoGsFLslygkWvWw8E6nXp9GBZxnmIGpsCaiF0jXTgyYr.3lk66Cr7gusL.3P2hb_F89kRqcUElLRUt8RrQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Avi Mizrahi", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market - Bitcoin News", "text": "5702 US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market\nHave you ever felt that someone is controlling the crypto markets, increasing prices to lure you in and crash it all as soon as you buy? Well, US authorities have apparently heard your whining because they are now reportedly suspicious manipulation is indeed occurring.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street Spoofing and Wash Trading\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly launched a criminal investigation to determine if big money traders are manipulating the prices of Bitcoin, Ether and possibly other cryptocurrencies. The illicit trade tactics that the DOJ is looking into include spoofing and wash trading, and federal prosecutors are working in collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the investigation, this according to “four people familiar with the matter” cited by Bloomberg .\nSpoofing refers to creating false buy orders to attract other traders (usually bots) to get in, with the intention of manipulating the market price in order to make a profit by actually selling. The Dodd-Frank Act defines spoofing as “the illegal practice of bidding or offering with intent to cancel before execution.” Similarly, wash trading is when someone simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading activity, meant to make it appear as if an asset has more trade volume than it really does. Why Now?\nUS authorities are reportedly concerned that cryptocurrency markets are prone to manipulation for a number of reasons including doubts that all trading venues are on the lookout for fraudsters, massive price swings that make it possible to steer valuations and a lack of strong regulations on crypto exchanges.\nWhile many will surely applaud the DOJ for its diligence in protecting crypto investors, skeptics might wonder if US authorities are not doing this also in an effort to further cool the market down by frightening investors. They are not generally known to be welcoming toward the field, and only recently it was revealed that American regulators also took part in a crackdown on what they call “fraudulent ICOs and crypto-asset investment products.”\nAre cryptocurrency prices manipulated and is it the US DOJ’s job to investigate these global markets at all?

The current market value of the bitcoins is more than $140 million, according to the CoinMarketCap price index, which values one bitcoin at around $8,800 . The sale of such a large amount of bitcoins could have a significant impact on cryptocurrency markets. The Tokyo-based Mt Gox went out of business in 2014 after losing around 1 million of its customers bitcoins. At the time, the lost bitcoins were worth around $387 million but the price of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has since risen considerably. The moving of the funds, first spotted by The Next Web, is the first time in over three months that the former exchange has moved any of its assets.

Ironically, he wrote the White House memo on cryptocurrency.\nHe is a blockchain expert and businessman. Forde was also a White House senior advisor in the office of science and technology during the Obama administration. He is now running for the Democratic nomination for the upcoming congressional elections in California.\nHis rival Dave Min, professor of law at the University of California and former SEC attorney, is circulating an advertisement against Forde’s campaign. He said that it is being illegally funded by Bitcoin [BTC] speculators who are against prevention of human trafficking and promotion of drug deals. Brian Forde has responded to allegations by saying:\n“My supporters didn’t HODL, but they made donations to my campaign in Bitcoin[BTC] is because they have faith in the technology. The comments accusing my supporters are completely inaccurate, sensationalist and it is due to my opponent’s lack of understanding of the technology. My supporters wouldn’t have donated to the campaign if they were just trying to speculate.”\nHe added:\n“While my opponent’s advertisement is trying to disparage a technology, what he doesn’t understand is that the United Nation is using is it to fight human trafficking worldwide and we need more rational technologists and scientists who can make policies based on evidence rather than politicians who making irrational decisions based on their emotions.”\nBrian Forde’s campaign has attracted support from cryptocurrency giants like the Winklevoss brothers and Mike Novogratz. He was a vital part of Obama’s Climate Data Initiative and TechHire during Barack Obama’s term. Brian Forde has become the head of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.\nThe US Federal Election Commission [FEC] has allowed political action committees to accept Bitcoin [BTC] as donations, given that donors identify themselves. Donations in Bitcoin are treated as in-kind donations which gives the candidates 10 days to transfer the BTC raised to their official campaign funds. Back in 2014, New Hampshire was the first US state to accept BTC as donations with Colorado. loading…\nArjun .B is an intern at Ambcrypto who likes to learn and keep himself updated.

He stood his ground on his previous prediction that Bitcoin would hit $25000 soon.\nAfter Bitcoin crashed yesterday to below $8000, the outcome looked bleak for BTC HODLers. It is currently trading at around $7500, undoing the profits it made this year for a new low in 2018. Lee believes that the drop is due to “typical crypto volatility”, identifying three factors that will make his prediction come true.\nWhile he did say that the charts are “pretty scary for folks”, he mentioned that the “notion of blockchain as a way to solve trust in the digital world has gained a lot of traction”.\nThe first of Tom Lee’s three factors is the cost of producing Bitcoin. He believes that it is trading at cost, with the cost of making Bitcoin being around $8000, unlike gold, which is being traded at double its extraction cost.\nLee also mentioned that he would keep an eye on institutional investors, believing that they would be one of the big catalysts in the crypto space.\nHe said:\n“I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty, but that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.”\nCryptocurrencies are still waiting on regulators to develop new frameworks to accommodate digital assets in the real world. Lee believes that a declaration for the side of cryptos would push Bitcoin into a rally.\nHe also went on to say that only 10 days comprise all the performance in one year of Bitcoin’s price. Without those 10 days, Bitcoin is only down by 25% in a year. He also said:\n“So as miserable as it feels holding bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days,”\nBitcoin is currently trading around the $7500 mark, after suffering a flash drop from $7918 to $7520.

While cryptocurrency isn’t really Revolut’s focus point, it’s a good way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\nIf you have a Revolut account, you can now buy and hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Behind the scene, the startup has partnered with Bitstamp to process the transactions. Revolut currently charges a 1.5 percent fee for cryptocurrency transactions. There are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nCompared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. You don’t get a bitcoin address for instance. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you’ll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults . Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time.\nYou can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. For instance, if you pay $3.47 for that delicious ice cream, you’ll save 53 cents in your vault. You can also multiple that amount so that you save multiple times your spare change with each transaction. Many fintech startups also provide this feature.\nYou can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money each day, each week or each month. Interestingly, you get to choose the currency of your vault. So it means that you can decide to buy ethers with spare change and weekly payments for instance. It’s a great way to hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nUsers don’t earn interests on vaults. It’s just a way to set some money aside that doesn’t appear in your main Revolut account.

This can turn out to be pretty bad if it continues but at the moment it is manageable.\nBitcoing Gold does have most of its cold just as Bitcoin but there are differences that appeared. While Bitcoin did manage to properly deal with 51% attacks, mainly because of its sheer size, Bitcoin Gold is still vulnerable.\nNow, the nightmare scenario is in effect. There is an attacker that did take control of the Bitcoin Gold blockchain and is defrauding exchanges. A blockchain should be decentralized but with 51% attacks this is no longer the case. The Bitcoin Gold available at the moment is valued at around $758 million and can lose a lot of value if the scenario continues. What Is A 51% Attack?\nThe 51% attack is when an individual or a group of individuals controls most of the processing power of the blockchain. This has always been a huge concern for institutions like tech companies and banks. With Bitcoin it is close to impossible to have a 51% attack because of the sheer size of the cryptocurrency. However, with Bitcoin Gold it is not that difficult to accomplish.\nWhen a single miner manages to control over 50% of the blockchain hash power, he can mess with all transactions in so many different ways. The one that is happening right now is double-spending . Bitcoin Gold’s 51% Attack\nReports about double-spending attacks started appearing around a week ago in regards to Bitcoin Gold. There is someone that now controls over 50% of the hash rate and is actively double-spending. The attacker has to spend coins in possession so new coins cannot be conjured. Due to this the attack is limited and did not drastically affect the network. Related Articles: Bitcoin Miners Arrested In China For Power Theft\nThe exchanges that accept really large deposits in an automatic manner are targeted. Fraudster(s) deposit Bitcoin Gold in exchanges where these coins can be traded. Then, after the currency was credited to the account, the coins are exchanged to other cryptocurrencies. After, the amounts are withdrawn. Then, because of the 51% attack problem, the fraudster can make a deposit with the same exact Bitcoin Gold deposited initially. This offers double, the profit. The Outcome\nThis is not the first time that cryptocurrencies had to deal with 51% attacks. Verge was hit 2 times in the past 2 months, with around $2.7 million ended up being stolen. Then, we have Electroneum and Monacoin that suffered 51% attacks in recent history.\nThe good news is that there is a really low possibility that Bitcoin will be hit by the 51% attack. The bad news with Bitcoin Gold is that its hash rate is much lower than that of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin miners are now contributing a processing power that is around 1 million times higher than that of the Bitcoin Gold miners. In 2013, the Bitcoin network’s processing power was higher than 500 supercomputers combined. Since then the hash rate for Bitcoin went up around 1.4 million times.

It shares much of the same code and works in a similar way to bitcoin, with Bitcoin Gold miners contributing computational power to process new transactions. That also means it faces the same vulnerabilities as bitcoin, but without the protections that come from the large, dispersed group of people and organizations whose computers are powering the bitcoin blockchain. In recent days the nightmare scenario for any cryptocurrency is playing out for Bitcoin Gold, as an attacker has taken control of its blockchain and proceeded to defraud cryptocurrency exchanges. All the Bitcoin Gold in circulation is valued at $786 million, according to data provider Coinmarketcap . Blockchains are designed to be decentralized but when an individual or group acting in concert controls the majority of a blockchain’s processing power, they can tamper with transactions and pave the way for fraud. This is known as a 51% attack. A NASA photographer caught the perfect SpaceX launch shot. Then his camera melted The possibility of a 51% attack has been one of the concerns institutions such as banks and tech companies have had over the years about using the blockchain for transactions; some have worried that the Chinese government could at some point endeavor to do that, ordering all of the Chinese bitcoin miners to act in concert. It’s unlikely for bitcoin, but for smaller cryptocurrencies, 51% attacks are a concern, one dramatized on a recent episode of HBO’s series Silicon Valley .

Mike Judge (Office Space, Beavis & Butthead, King of the Hill) brings his irreverent brand of humor, and his own experiences working in Silicon Valley, to the award-winning comedy now entering its third season.\" /> Cryptocurrency miners commit their computer processing power—or hash power—to adding new transactions to a coin’s blockchain. They are rewarded in units of the coin in return. The idea is that these incentives create competition among miners to add more hash power to the chain. The more hash power is added, the better the chances of winning a reward. So what’s a 51% attack? It’s when a single miner controls more than half of the hash power on a particular blockchain. When this happens, that miner can mess with transactions in a bunch of ways, including spending coins twice. This is the “ double-spending problem ,” a puzzle surrounding digital money that has vexed computer scientists for years—and which was solved by bitcoin. But the solution only holds if no single miner controls the majority of the hash power on a chain. Bitcoin Gold has been experiencing double-spending attacks for at least a week, according to forum posts by Bitcoin Gold director of communications Edward Iskra. Someone has taken control of more than half of Bitcoin Gold’s hash rate and is double-spending coins. Since an attacker must spend coins in his or her possession, and can’t conjure up new coins, the attack is somewhat limited. What’s happening now, according to Iskra, is that exchanges that automatically accept large deposits are being targeted. The fraudster deposits Bitcoin Gold into an account at an exchange, where coins are traded. Once the exchange credits the Bitcoin Gold to the attacker’s account, the attacker trades those coins for another cryptocurrency and withdraws it. The attacker can repeatedly make deposits of the same Bitcoin Gold it deposited in the first exchange and profit in this way. A bunch of other cryptocurrencies have been attacked in similar ways recently. Something called Verge has been hit twice in the last two months, leading to $2.7 million being stolen. The exotic-sounding coins Monacoin and Electroneum have also suffered from 51% attacks not too long ago. Story Continues A 51% attack isn’t likely to hit bitcoin any time soon. Bitcoin Gold has a lot less hash rate securing it than bitcoin. Bitcoin miners are contributing about a million times more processing power than Bitcoin Gold miners at the moment. To give you an idea of how much money would be required to capture more than half of the bitcoin network, in 2013 the processing power on the bitcoin network was already greater than the 500 most powerful supercomputers combined— by eightfold (although it’s worth noting that the comparison isn’t entirely fair, since the specialized chips mining bitcoin can only perform one operation, instead of general computing). In the five years since, bitcoin’s hash rate has increased by about 1.4 million times.

The result is an incredibly misleading ad that says Bitcoin fans are for drug deals and human trafficking.\nFellow Democrats Dave Min and Brian Forde clashed over accepting cryptocurrencies as donations while running for California’s 45 th Congressional race.\nForde is promoted by the media as amongst the earliest politicians to start accepting cryptocurrencies as donations. With that said, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, have made their way into mainstream politics over the last couple of years. Back in September 2017, Austin Petersen, a Senate candidate in Missouri also began accepting Bitcoin for campaign contributions.\nCryptocurrency and politics is a relatively new phenomenon. Winston Edmonson, a four-time mayoral candidate in the Texas city of Lewisville, proposed the issuance of a municipal cryptocurrency as means of funding the local police force without having to raise taxes. Then there was firebrand Ron Paul putting forward a bill to allow competing currencies. Democratic Deer Fight\nAs reported by multiple outlets, Brian Forde has stated that his campaign has managed to raise upwards of $130,000 in different cryptocurrencies. This clearly shows that Forde is currently a favorite among the world of crypto enthusiasts. Another proof for that is that he’s managed to get more Bitcoin contributions than all of the previous candidates for Congress combined, according to Bloomberg.\nNaturally, this fires up the spark of competition. A rival Democratic candidate of Forde – Dave Min, who’s also a former SEC attorney, launched a TV ad which contained the following line about his rival:\nBrian Forde’s big donors? Bitcoin speculators who oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.\nNow that’s harsh. Pressing Where It Hurts\nNaturally, a strong statement of the kind is to be expected to trigger a serious reaction. As such, one would expect for it to be substantiated with facts, as politics is all about hard facts and decisions based on them, right? Don’t answer that.\nAccording to Axios , Min’s campaign manager failed to provide any reasonable merit for these serious accusations. As a matter of fact, as if she’s realized that the ad might have gone a bit too far, she states that while Min “is a huge believer in the potential of distributed ledger technology ,” his primary concerns are focused towards some “deregulatory agenda being pushed by Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.” Questionable Merits at Best\nDespite refusing to provide any straightforward specifics, Min’s campaign manager pointed towards Brock Pierce as one of Forde’s leading Bitcoin donors. To this, Forde responded that:\nPierce, while extremely controversial, has never publicly said he opposes ‘cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.’\nIndeed, starting beef of that kind seems quite sensational, but it should at least be backed by certain spot-on facts so that it doesn’t deflate as soon as someone questions it. Can we Please Cut the Cr*p Already?\nFor whatever reason, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, are continuously being associated with all kinds of illicit activity. Yes, Bitcoin is used by criminals, and so are other digital currencies. But it doesn’t even begin to compare to conventional fiat currency in this respect.\nAnd that’s a stone cold, research-backed truth. So much so, in fact, that it has been confirmed by official authorities and institutions throughout the entire world. The UK’s National Crime Agency confirmed it, Quebec’s government confirmed it, and even Hong Kong’s Financial Services and Treasury confirmed it, to list a few.\nIn other words, it might be high time for officials, especially those who are in or currently running for office, regardless of where they are, to do a flat-out fact check before refuting an entire community based on, well, nothing.\nDo you agree with Dave Min’s position on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ usage for human trafficking and drug deals?

Alongside adding the decentralized exchange (Dex), the firm has also revealed it is retiring the name GDAX and that platform will soon be known as ‘Coinbase Pro.’\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Stormy Weather Continues to Plague Cryptocurrency Traders Coinbase Exchange Acquires Decentralized Token-Relay Platform Paradex\nCoinbase has revealed some interesting decisions today as the cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage service purchased a peer-to-peer Dex that allows users to swap “hundreds of tokens” like ERC-20s. According to various reports, Coinbase plans to “enhance” the Paradex protocol and launch the service to international customers located outside of the U.S. Reuters details that Coinbase purchased the platform for an undisclosed sum.\nBasically, the Paradex development team of ten, explains the platform allows the peer-to-peer relay of ERC-20 tokens on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The system is entirely decentralized by utilizing the 0x protocol which provides “handling settlement without necessitating user accounts or taking custodianship of users’ funds,” explains the Paradex team.\nToday the Paradex website states:\nWe know we’ve been a little quiet, but we’ve been hard at work, and we’re incredibly excited to share that Paradex is joining Coinbase — While we work to integrate with Coinbase, the Paradex app will be temporarily unavailable, starting today, May 23, at 3pm ET. This doesn’t change our commitment to our users — We’re still working hard to build the best relayer, now with a larger team and more resources. GDAX Will be Overhauled Into ‘Coinbase Pro’\nCoinbase also told the press it would “eventually” provide Paradex services to U.S. customers but it needs to make compliance changes first. The firm headquartered in San Francisco also announced the same day that it was completely overhauling and rebranding the GDAX exchange. This summer GDAX will be known as ‘ Coinbase Pro’ the company explained on Wednesday. The Coinbase Pro Trading Interface.\nDavid Farmer, the General Manager of Coinbase Pro, detailed the trading platform will be more intuitive with a simplified deposit and withdrawal process. Further, the exchange will offer improved charts and access to historical data while also offering a new portfolio feature called ‘My Wallets.’\n“As the decentralized ecosystem advances, we expect there will be many more opportunities for customers to interact with digital assets in new and unique ways,” Farmer states .\nThe news follows the trading platform’s plan to offer institutional custody services , and purchasing the website Earn.com .\nWhat do you think about Coinbase purchasing Paradex?

Yesterday’s highlighted major bearish trend line with current resistance at $1,080 is intact on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently correcting higher towards the $1,050 and $1,080 resistance levels in the near term.\nBitcoin cash price failed to recover and declined below $1,000 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD may correct higher, but upsides are likely to be limited. Bitcoin Cash Price Decline\nThere was a sharp increase in selling pressure from $1,150 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and broke many supports such as $1,100 and $1,050. The decline was such that sellers succeeded in pushing the price below the $1,000 handle. BCH is now trading well below the $1,100 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nIt traded as low as $967.5 recently before buyers appeared. At the moment, the price is consolidating losses with a correction angle towards $1,100. An initial resistance is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,191 high to $967 low. More importantly, yesterday’s highlighted major bearish trend line with current resistance at $1,080 is intact on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The same trend line resistance is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,191 high to $967 low. Therefore, if the price corrects higher, it could face sellers near the $1,050 and $1,080 levels.\nLooking at the chart , the price is in a bearish trend with a decent support near $960-80. A break below the mentioned $960 support may open the doors for a push towards the $900 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly recovering in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is moving higher and is currently 40.\nMajor Support Level – $980\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,080 Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Jaw Dropped Below $1,000 was last modified: May 24th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "aayush jindal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "newsbtc bitcoin cash price analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:26:34.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9ffe80a501da0dfa1480d6af7edd0095f6320123", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SXVyMjZyR5i2rZjWaLeVa40_EwC7yiXdDQ5.H7q1aVEc9bgdlwUggH", "site_full": "allafrica.com", "site": "allafrica.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "South Africa: Mpumalanga Boy Whose Kidnappers Demanded Bitcoin Found - allAfrica.com", "title_full": "South Africa: Mpumalanga Boy Whose Kidnappers Demanded Bitcoin Found - allAfrica.com", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00430801:440bf68163bd17b2638e4bde7e512060:arc614x376:w1200.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11679, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ffe80a501da0dfa1480d6af7edd0095f6320123", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SXVyMjZyR5i2rZjWaLeVa40_EwC7yiXdDQ5.H7q1aVEc9bgdlwUggH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa: Mpumalanga Boy Whose Kidnappers Demanded Bitcoin Found - allAfrica.com", "text": "Photo: Bitcoin Bitcoin (file photo). Mpumalanga police have confirmed that Katlego Marite, the 12-year-old boy who was abducted outside his home in eMalahleni this past weekend, has been found. Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said he was found in eMalahleni on Thursday afternoon. \"We found him around Witbank. He was found alone,\" Hlathi said. \"I am on my way there and I will get more information. The investigators are with him, so they can't speak to me,\" he said. Marite was kidnapped outside his parents' home on Sunday afternoon. Hlathi said Marite was taken by a man dressed in black with a green jacket, before jumping into a gold-coloured Toyota Corolla. \"Katlego's friends ran to his mom and told her about the ordeal, she in turn reported the incident to the police,\" he said. A ransom note was allegedly left behind demanding a ransom of 15 Bitcoin for his release. The value of 15 Bitcoin - the decentralised, digital, cryptocurrency - is roughly around R1.5m. Hlathi said he was waiting for investigators to finish with Marite before he would be able to provide more information.

In December 2017, Muslim scholar Sheikh Assim Al Hakim stated that using Bitcoin is not permissible under Shariah (or Islamic) law. Assim said:\n“We know that bitcoins remain anonymous when you deal with it… which means that it’s an open gate for money laundering, drug money and haram money.”\nBefore I go into what else the Saudi Arabia based cleric said, let’s just examine the above statement he made. Yes, Bitcoin (BTC) transactions have a certain level of anonymity, but does that really make them haram? If we go by this logic, then there are ways fiat currency can and is used anonymously as well. Fiat Transactions Can Be Anonymous As Well\nFor instance, you could deal entirely in fiat cash and not go through a bank, which requires proper ID. There are a number of money changers I’ve personally worked with that accepted my fiat currencies without requiring me to provide any ID. These money changers are out here in Pakistan, Kuwait, and Turkey – all Islamic countries. And, of course, they also accept large amounts of fiat money from people without ID throughout the world. So, that can be considered “ anonymous “. But, does that make fiat haram? Absolutely not.\nAssim also says that Bitcoin can be used in money laundering. That’s true, but is not fiat money used in money laundering as well? It has been used in money laundering ever since it has existed. The point here is that any medium of exchange can be used for good things and bad things . So, it’s how you use a medium of exchange, be it Bitcoin , gold, fiat money, or any other asset that has value. If you use that asset to engage in illicit activities like human trafficking, then that is haram. It’s not only haram, but also immoral and illegal. Nothing About Bitcoin Itself That’s Haram\nTherefore, the claim that Bitcoin itself is haram is absolutely invalid and baseless. There’s no logical argument to support this claim based on what’s written in the Quran (holy book for followers of Islam) nor does it state anywhere in the Quran that it’s forbidden to use a medium of exchange , which is just what Bitcoin (BTC) is.\nWith all this talk about Bitcoin being permissible in Islam or not, I can tell you what IS probably haram: Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts . That’s because you’re betting, which is gambling, on the future price of BTC. And, gambling is not permissible for practicing Muslims. Ramadan – A Great Time to Use Bitcoin\nNotably, billions of Muslims worldwide are observing the holy month of Ramadan right now. During this month, followers of Islam must fast from sunrise to sunset. Also, Muslims are required to give zakat throughout the year, or donations to the poor. The amount to be paid in zakat is 2.5% of your income. This is only for those who are financially stable and can afford to do so. If you happen to be searching for articles on crypto at this time, you must have come across a number of trending articles about a mosque (Muslim place of worship) accepting donations in either Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).\nThere’s nothing wrong with this at all. In fact, it should be encouraged. These donations are going to a noble cause, which is to make the lives of the less fortunate better. The way I see it, there’s no greater purpose than serving humanity . Before us humans are Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, or any other faith / belief, we are humans! So, humans helping other less privileged humans must always be encouraged. Just by using Bitcoin, you are spreading knowledge and awareness of a revolutionary new technology as well. Seeking Knowledge Is A Must for Muslims\nThere are many verses in the Holy Quran that explicitly and clearly state that one must seek knowledge. Here are a few:\n“And say: My Lord, increase me in knowledge .” (Quran 20:114)\n“Allah raises of those who believe and those who have been given knowledge many levels.” (Quran 58:11).\n“Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists). He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not” (Quran, 96: 1-5)\nSo, above it clearly stresses the importance of seeking knowledge. By seeking knowledge and then gaining knowledge, we make a conscious effort to not be ignorant. Being informed allows us to make better decisions in life. There’s probably no argument against that. Now, if all Muslims would actually open their holy book and adhere to the actual source itself, rather than relying on some “scholar”, then they would realize just how valuable their own brain that God gave them actually is.\nSo, what does this have to do with using Bitcoin in Ramadan? By using it, you are not only helping the less fortunate, but you are also spreading awareness (knowledge) about a great technology. So, not only Muslims, but every human on this Earth should embrace new technology, learn more about the latest innovations through independent research, and then inform others as well. Other “Verdicts” From Islamic Scholars About Bitcoin\nNow, let’s go over what else Assim said about Bitcoin:\n“Bitcoin is something that is recent and new and there are a lot of serious concerns when it comes to dealing with it … whether it’s from the origin or from the aspect of sustainability and security. As of today, one bitcoin that was [worth] 0.1 cents is now equivalent to $11,000 plus. This is ridiculous. This is not something physical you can touch.”\nWith all due respect, what Mr. Assim fails to realize here is that since Bitcoin is new and recent which he correctly points out, the majority of the world does not know much about it. So, this is not something wrong with Bitcoin itself. However, what needs to be done is do what the Quran itself tells us to do, which is to seek knowledge, as so clearly expressed in the Quranic verses mentioned above. Also, as the world is beginning to learn and appreciate the flagship cryptocurrency, its value is being understood and so it’s rising. There’s absolutely nothing illogical about that.\nBitcoin (BTC) was worth practically nothing at one point only because the world knew nothing about it. How ignorant can one be to think that if he or she does not know about something, then that something is worthless? There’s no shortage of rulings by Islamic scholars that are not based on sound logic or the fundamental teachings of Islam. Notably, here’s a statement from the Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs:\n“Buying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation.” Bitcoin, Just Like Anything, Can Be Misused\nThe key words to note here are “at this time”. Yes, the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies market is driven a lot by speculation right now. However, that’s not the fault of cryptocurrencies themselves. There’s nothing inherently wrong with them. It is us, the users, who are abusing them. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has said on many occasions that we should learn more about the technology behind cryptocurrencies instead of thinking of them as a “get rich quick” scheme. And, he’s absolutely right.\nIt’s us humans who orchestrate pump and dump schemes. It’s us humans that decide to scam people by misusing cryptocurrencies . Similarly, scams run rampant with fiat money or just about anything. This does not mean we stop using Bitcoin, traditional money, or any other valuable asset. All Islam and other religions teach us is to exercise good moral judgement and a responsible attitude. Although I could go on more on this topic, I will end it here and perhaps in a future article, I will address some of the other misconceptions about Islam, Muslims, and Bitcoin.
