The idea was to replace the existing banking structure with an online alternative that couldn’t be controlled by a handful of powerful organizations.\nBut instead of being replaced, the old banks are beginning to assert their own role in the unorthodox financial world of virtual currency, sometimes called cryptocurrencies.\nWhile Bitcoin was originally intended to be used by consumers for all sorts of transactions — without any financial institutions getting involved — it has mostly become a virtual investment, stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world. People buy Bitcoin in the hope that its value will go up, similar to the way they purchase gold or silver.\nDetails of the platform that Intercontinental Exchange is working on have not been finalized and the project could still fall apart, given the hesitancy among big Wall Street institutions to be closely associated with the Wild West of virtual currencies. A spokesman said that the company had no comment.\nMany corporations and governments have expressed interest in the technology that Bitcoin introduced, particularly a form of database known as the blockchain.\nSome large financial exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have already created financial products linked to the price of Bitcoin, known as futures. But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer’s account at the end of the trade.\nICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day — with the backing and security of the exchange, according to the people familiar with the project.\nThe swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin. But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws — something today’s Bitcoin exchanges have struggled to do.\nThe chief executive of Nasdaq, Adena Friedman, recently said her company could also create a virtual-currency exchange if regulatory issues are ironed out. While several hedge funds have been buying and selling Bitcoin, most large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pensions, have avoided it largely as a result of similar regulatory concerns.\nBitcoin still faces plenty of skepticism in the mainstream financial world. Over the weekend, Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who has long been critical of virtual currencies, said Bitcoin was “probably rat poison squared” in an interview with CNBC. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates added his own skepticism, saying he’d “short” Bitcoin if he could.\nAnd the new efforts to trade Bitcoin don’t help answer basic questions about what makes the virtual currency useful in the real world. Most attempts to use Bitcoin for everyday commerce haven’t gained traction, and investors have treated it as a speculative commodity like gold or silver.\nSome Bitcoin enthusiasts have said that its increasing integration into the existing financial system has pulled it away from its founding ideals. Paul Chou, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who set up LedgerX, a regulated Bitcoin exchange that would compete with Intercontinental Exchange, said his company has made a point of focusing on large Bitcoin holders, rather than financial institutions.\n“The reason we got into crypto was not to partner with a bank, but to replace them,” Mr. Chou said, using the shorthand for cryptocurrencies. “We deal with crypto holders directly in a way that really takes advantage of Bitcoin’s strengths, while avoiding brokers, banks and other institutions that take multiple cuts of the transaction.”\nGoldman will initially only be trading futures contracts linked to Bitcoin’s price. But Goldman executives said they were looking at moving in the direction of buying and selling actual Bitcoins.\nIntercontinental Exchange’s effort, if it pans out, could make Bitcoin available to a much wider and more influential customer base, including other financial firms.\nSeveral big corporate names, including the giant technology investor SoftBank, which has stakes in Sprint and Uber, have been in discussions about being involved with the exchange in some way, the people familiar with the project said. But a spokesman for SoftBank said this week that it was no longer involved.\nLedgerX, the exchange founded by Mr. Chou, is the only exchange that now offers the kind of swaps that ICE has discussed. LedgerX has experienced increasing trading volume in recent months, but ICE would start with an edge because essentially every large financial institution is already hooked into it.\nThe interest in Bitcoin trading illustrates how the reputation of the virtual currency has, after a rocky start, improved.\nRegulators are currently looking at whether many virtual currencies, including the second most widely used digital token, Ether, have been issued and traded in violation of securities regulations. Institutional investors believe that because of the way Bitcoin was created and structured — without any one company or organization behind it — it would be on safer ground with regulators.\nICE was considering launching a swap contract linked to Ether, but backed away from that because of regulatory uncertainty, the people briefed on the effort said.\nMr. Chou, at LedgerX, said he made a similar decision and has delayed creating any products linked to Ether.\nWith Bitcoin, on the other hand, Mr. Chou said that road seems to be clear for big institutions to get involved.\n“The industry is seeing unprecedented institutional interest for the first time in Bitcoin’s history,” he said. “I’ve been amazed that the strongest believers in cryptocurrency often start out the most skeptical. It’s a healthy skepticism. But at some point the perception shifts, and for many institutions — I think we’re finally there.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T01:03:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19dbaaa1c7634ba0f65058dbffb15cfb00c5e43d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqCe0NaanOoUpOETjVUXv4iaw7GZ6rPAC0itAKrY_DCCBX.TrxObVGvgoZRInZ0XlyxJ1WUk6JreRZFxhcQxNJCwdpC.h3N5wLrmbf9OFx7n0VU.AoMCp7Uhl0bY2jR43YLP65Mk_EEhQl9pwHOxSkj4", "site_full": "www.longroom.com", "site": "longroom.com", "site_section": "https://longroom.com/discussions/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Long Room", "title": "Bitcoin exchanges are stepping up their game to lure high-speed traders like Virtu and Citadel", "title_full": "Bitcoin exchanges are stepping up their game to lure high-speed traders like Virtu and Citadel", "published": "2018-05-13T18:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af435f14c9ab969008b466d-640-320.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19dbaaa1c7634ba0f65058dbffb15cfb00c5e43d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6m5_DJ5Wv6RdXp9Qi0xfHiKw0L.4vQqCe0NaanOoUpOETjVUXv4iaw7GZ6rPAC0itAKrY_DCCBX.TrxObVGvgoZRInZ0XlyxJ1WUk6JreRZFxhcQxNJCwdpC.h3N5wLrmbf9OFx7n0VU.AoMCp7Uhl0bY2jR43YLP65Mk_EEhQl9pwHOxSkj4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "InLove4567", "published": "2018-05-13T18:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin exchanges are stepping up their game to lure high-speed traders like Virtu and Citadel", "text": "in General The cryptocurrency market is known for a profusion of cryptocurrency exchange venues.To compete for business from large trading firms, some crypto exchanges are building out their infrastructures to look like traditional...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "virtu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "citadel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T18:33:01.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1344f331613343e4e9a2202f229ca1191d6992ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVmNspNiNcG7_0Vl6zLxkAg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin cannot be reached 20000$ this year??", "title_full": "Bitcoin cannot be reached 20000$ this year??", "published": "2018-05-13T18:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1344f331613343e4e9a2202f229ca1191d6992ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVmNspNiNcG7_0Vl6zLxkAg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "whaawh", "published": "2018-05-13T18:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin cannot be reached 20000$ this year??", "text": "There is such a chance still.

To compete for business from large trading firms, some crypto exchanges are building out their infrastructures to look like traditional equities exchanges. Exchanges such as Gemini and Coinbase have begun supporting block trading. Some crypto exchanges are rolling out new liquidity programs and considering co-location and other market structure developments, according to executives.\nCrypto exchanges are trying to step up their game to lure the fastest traders on Wall Street.\nThese exchanges, which helped shepherd the nascent market for digital currencies through 2017’s boom, have been adding customers and making money hand-over-fist. Bloomberg estimates crypto exchanges bring in $3 million a day in fees. Still, many have failed to attract large institutional investors to the platform, relying for now on small time traders for liquidity.\nIn order to draw in big traders, exchanges across the space are beefing up their capabilities and rolling out new products to attract liquidity.\n“How do we get Virtu, Citadel Securities, DRW, Susquehanna to make markets?” said Larry Tabb, founder of consultancy Tabb Group, said in an email to Business Insider. “Those are the things they’re thinking about. It’s going to be a combination of incentives, order types, connectivity, co-location, and pricing.” Block Trades\nThe exchange business is a volumes game with more volumes equaling more profit. Attracting large traders or investors is one way to boost volumes. But most customers of this profile have opted to trade in over-the-counter markets, rather than on retail exchanges.\nThat’s because big trades on a crypto exchange can impact the broader price in the market, said Michael Moro, chief executive of Genesis Trading, an OTC trader and market making firm in the crypto space. Moro told Business Insider that most of his accounts would never trade on an exchange.\n“As better as these exchanges have kind of gotten, 95% of what I do is OTC,” Moro said. “I don’t touch the exchanges for liquidity at all, but that’s because OTC markets are far more efficient, especially for size.”\nTo compete for larger orders in the crypto markets, a number of exchanges have started to offer block trades, which are executed off an exchange main order book as to not move the market in a direction against the trader.\nGemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, started allowing customers to buy and sell large quantities of crypto in April. Coinbase has also started supporting block trades as well. That could lure large traders to their venues, according to CoinRoutes chief executive Dave Weisberger.\n“ I think that there is a clear need for more tools available for block trading in Bitcoin and other crypto assets, so companies that fill that need will be rewarded,” Weisberger said in an interview. Liquidity programs\nCrypto exchanges have also been flirting with different incentive programs, which provide discounts to certain market makers for adding liquidity to a venue.\nThe idea of providing incentive to liquidity providers is not new to trading. IEX, the upstart stock exchange, recently unveiled such a program that offers discounts on trading fees across a number of securities trading on its venue. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq offer rebates to brokers to incentivize them to send their order to their exchange.\nThe point of a market maker is to ensure immediacy of execution, even if there isn’t natural interest in the market. With incentives, you are more likely to attract traditional market makers to the fold, executives from market making firms told Business Insider.\n“It could draw in those who have only been involved in a lower capacity,” one trading executive said.\nThe lack of liquidity in crypto is one reason behind its neck-breaking volatility.\n“There’s less liquidity in the marketplace than people might think,” the executive added. “This last run-down can show you. People selling because of Tax Day drove this market to the ground.”\nIn the US, dollar to crypto transactions are in the couple hundred millions of dollars a day, according to research by crypto firm MithrilX.\nCurrently GDAX, Coinbase’s cryptocurrency exchange, does not charge liquidity providers for placing orders on the exchange. And it is currently looking into adding new liquidity incentive programs, according to a job advertisement for a head of market structure . Gemini provides incentive for some market makers trading in its auctions.\nCircle, the fintech firm that recently acquired crypto exchange Poloniex, is also looking into new incentive programs for market makers, the company’s chief executive office Jeremy Allaire told Business Insider in an interview.\n“We inherited a fee structure and are obviously looking closely at that to make sure it is in line with what participants expect,” Allaire said. “I think there will be multiple models and experiments tried across venues.” What else can be done?\nOutside liquidity incentive programs, cryptocurrency exchanges are also looking into supporting co-location capabilities, which would allow high-frequency traders to house their servers in the same building as exchange matching engines.\nThe practice, which was highlighted in the hit Michael Lewis book “Flash Boys,” has been controversial on Wall Street, since it provides traders with faster access to information.\n“I would imagine in the upcoming year that we will see exchanges develop co-location capabilities, and it will be something of a common occurrence,” Miha Gcrar, head of business development at Bitstamp, said.\nCoinbase is considering co-location as well, a source told Business Insider.\nTo be sure, at this time, co-location isn’t a “core necessity” for trading firms, Gcrar said.\nWhat they want to see in the crypto exchange market, for the most part, according to market insiders, is outside of their control or will require years to come to fruition.\nFor instance, the lack of a proper prime broker is keeping Virtu Financial, the high-speed trading firm from entering the market. Here’s chief executive Douglas Cifu: We are a market maker in the Cboe and the CME futures products around [cryptocurrency], I guess they’re bitcoin futures right now. We do not currently make markets in any of the [cryptocurrency] markets primarily because of our concerns round risk management. In other words our MO has always been to trade in transparent and regulated exchanges with centralized clearing or clearing though a prime broker in cash, if you will, bitcoin and other [cryptocurrencies] that is currently not available.\nA prime broker would allow traders to trade across venues simultaneously without maintaining a balance on a single exchange. A prime broker would put their own funds into a crypto exchange and then extend their customers credit to trade in and out.\nThere also isn’t a major clearing firm in crypto to act as an intermediary between banks. As a result, small banks such as Silvergate and Signature act as quasi clearing houses.\n“You can only have instant clearing if your counterparty is using the same banks, ” Jonathan Benassaya, founder of MithrilX, said. “The bank is becoming the clearing house.”\nStill, even if these things were to come to fruition, it may not be enough for some large traders.

Exchanges\nThere are, broadly speaking, two types of exchanges. Centralized exchanges, such as Bitfinex, Bittrex, Kucoin, etc., and decentralized exchanges such as Etherdelta and Switcheo.\nTrading on a centralized exchange requires you to deposit cryptocurrencies before you can trade them. In this regard, they function as custodial services, and thus come with a very high level of risk. If the exchange operators steal your coins, or if the exchange gets hacked, your funds may disappear, and there may be very little you can do to get them back.\nIn general, one should only store coins that they are actively trading on an exchange. To reduce the risk of loss via theft or fraud, balances that are not being actively traded should be withdrawn to one of the wallets described below.\nDecentralized exchanges are less risky, as they allow you to deposit coins as part of your trade, and the proceeds from a trade will typically go directly to your wallet. However, certain risks still exist, such as: The site acting as the front of the decentralized exchanges could be compromised, and work to steal your keys perhaps the contract is a scam and will take your incoming coins, and not pay out the proceeds of the trade.\nThese risks can be reduced by: Using a temporary wallet for trades Only storing coins you are trading in that wallet Ensuring that you are using the correct decentralized exchange (check the domain, check the contract address). Personal Wallets\nPersonal wallets also come in a number of flavours. We will break them down into three broad categories: Hosted Wallets Cold storage, or offline wallets Hosted Wallets\nHosted wallets, such as exchange wallets, do not give you direct access to your keys. If the service is down, compromised, or shuts down permanently, you can no longer access your coins. Do not use a hosted wallet unless you are using another service offered by that company, such as trading. Ensure you withdraw your funds to a more secure wallet when you complete your exchange business. Local hot wallets\nHot wallets, in general, refer to wallets where the keys are stored on an Internet-connected computer. They are designed to quickly process outgoing transactions. Many services offer a hybrid hosted-hot-wallet, such as btc.com and blockchain.info. The provider of a hosted-hot-wallet will provide you seed words or private keys which can be used to recover your coins if the service goes down. Hosted-hot-wallet services also offer ways to easily access your wallet, such as a regular email/username/password account system, mobile apps, 2FA , etc.\nHosted Hot wallets come with several risks. You must trust that: the initial key generation is not backdoored. they are not storing unencrypted copies of your keys. they will not steal your funds when you are using their web interface/mobile apps, which would naturally need access to your keys to make any transactions.\nYou are also vulnerable to phishing attacks for the account credentials, domain takeovers, and hacks of their systems, which may be compromised and made to serve malicious versions of their apps that would steal your keys or otherwise drain your accounts.\nMany people use these services for their ease-of-use, and a number of (so far) reliable ones exist. Always be careful when using such a service, and follow basic security measures such as ensuring you use strong passwords, enable 2FA, confirm the website address is correct, use a trusted computer to access the service, etc.\nSome hot wallets, such as Bitcoin-qt, Electrum, etc., allow you to run them locally on your own computer. These wallets generate and store keys on your computer, and will typically only require a password to unlock the wallet. They do not rely on centralized servers, and instead may either connect directly to the bitcoin P2P network (or the network of your altcoin), or to second layer P2P networks such as Electrum servers. While generally more secure than a host hot wallet, these have risks such as : your computer being compromised and the keys stolen downloading a malicious version of the wallet client that gives you non-random keys, or steals keys after generating or importing them.\nTo avoid such attacks, you should only use a trusted computer, and verify the signature and hashes of the wallet client software after downloading it. Cold storage\nCold storage refers to the most secure type of wallet where the keys are not stored on an Internet-connected computer. There are essentially two types of cost storage wallet; paper, and hardware.\nPaper wallets usually just consist of a private key and public address printed out or otherwise stored on a physical medium that is not connected to a computer or the internet. Creating the private key and public address, in an ideal scenario, would use a peer-reviewed, vetted bitcoin address generator on an air-gapped , recently formatted, trusted computer with a cryptographic-quality random number generator. These requirements are occasionally difficult to meet, but are doable by most people given enough effort. Once generated, coins can be transferred to the address, and the private key can be stored on a piece of paper or a flash drive, or inscribed in a metal sheet, and then stored somewhere physically safe, such as a bank vault, home safe, or even split up into pieces and stored in multiple locations.\nThese wallets are typically extremely safe, since if generated correctly, they are impossible to compromise without physically compromising the location where the private key is stored. However, they are cumbersome to use, as the key must be physically retrieved and imported into a software wallet before a transaction can be signed . The signing itself can be done on an offline computer to minimize risk, with the signed transaction verified and broadcast by a separate, online computer.\nOffline wallets are typically used to store coins for a long time, without the intention of regularly spending them. Coins can be sent to the paper wallet at any time without retrieving or using the private key.\nHardware wallets, such as the Ledger and Trezor, are newer takes on cold storage. These are essentially tiny computers than generate and store the private keys, and sign transactions on the device itself. You use them by connecting them to a computer, which then passes an unsigned transaction to the device. The device will then display the amount and destination, and attach the signature after you confirm the details are correct. The signed transaction is then sent back to the computer, and the private keys never leave the device.\nThe attack vectors here are limited to: a device flaw stealing the seed words for the device (make sure you keep these very safe) tricking someone into signing a transaction without verifying the outputs.\nThe wallet devices themselves are currently considered quite safe (although an attack was recently demonstrated and patched by Ledger). Provided you choose a strong PIN and store the seed words safely, hardware wallets are the safest, most user-friendly way to store cryptocurrencies, offering a large advantage over hot wallets and exchanges, and even paper wallets in terms of ease of use. However, hardware wallets currently do not support all cryptocurrencies, and one may have to resort to paperwallets + hardware wallets to cover their entire portfolio. General Advice\nThis advice applies no matter what wallet you opt for, and extends to general computer security as well Use a trusted computer - Make sure you don't install any untrusted programs that may contain keyloggers or other malware. If paranoid, get a separate computer for crypto use, and format it regularly. Verify the hashes and signatures of any clients you download. All trustworthy crypto software comes with known-good hashes published on the website along with the download links, and often with signatures from trusted developers/community members. Verifying these hashes and signatures helps ensure the program you downloaded was not been tampered with. Check where you are downloading a program from - Make sure it is the official site, as many phishing clones exist. Check the domain for character swaps ( l instead of i , etc.), check the extension, make sure it uses https , and use a computer you trust. Use strong, random passwords/PINs for wallets and accounts - Get a password manager, no other way to say it really. Enable 2FA everywhere you can. Ideally, use time-based 2FA where available, instead of SMS-based ones, and use a device you trust for saving the 2FA codes. Always verify the transaction address and amount before sending. Malware exists that will silently change a crypto address after you copy it, and before you paste it into the wallet. Verify the address before sending. Many wallets, such as hardware wallets, Bitcoin-qt, Electrum etc. offer a preview function before signing or broadcasting the transaction. Use this feature to ensure the address and amount matches what you entered. 99. % of the time, anything that offers you free BTC, offers to mine BTC for you, offers to double your coins, etc. is a scam - Don't fall for it. Make backups of your seed words/wallet files and verify them. Computers or hardware wallets can break, and having a backup is essential. Hierarchical Deterministic wallets, aka HD Wallets, allow you create a long-lived backup that can restore addresses and keys generated after the backup was taken. Non-HD Wallets, such as bitcoin-qt in non-HD mode, must be backed up every time you generate a new address. If you restore an old backup from a non-hd wallet, you will lose the value of cryptocurrencies received after the backup was created.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kucoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bittrex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T19:05:41.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f49410c2f617fb53af8d3a3d91d03dfc38455015", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9aEDzFtmxWxK1mZM08sk_IOR69Pl39MDbxuozUw7iEKbg_6NgX_0b6m.apQKIynUa.CTIkr3ac6Q--", "site_full": "www.pinoyden.com.ph", "site": "pinoyden.com.ph", "site_section": "http://www.pinoyden.com.ph/rss/10", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "PINOYDEN", "title": "Re: AdbtcTop Easy to earn bitcoin-Low minimum Cashout + Latest proof", "title_full": "Re: AdbtcTop Easy to earn bitcoin-Low minimum Cashout + Latest proof", "published": "2018-05-13T18:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "PH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f49410c2f617fb53af8d3a3d91d03dfc38455015", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9aEDzFtmxWxK1mZM08sk_IOR69Pl39MDbxuozUw7iEKbg_6NgX_0b6m.apQKIynUa.CTIkr3ac6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-13T18:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Re: AdbtcTop Easy to earn bitcoin-Low minimum Cashout + Latest proof", "text": "AdbtcTop Easy to earn bitcoin-Low minimum Cashout + Latest proof - PINOYDEN AdbtcTop Easy to earn bitcoin-Low minimum Cashout + Latest proof ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T19:04:38.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "722158b624c053bd18802590071d7c859b540649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuayR6ajeoTrpol9mUhayiqb4dikFcPyR04hMaoOrdQNBg3gyXkHSsJOzWL8ffVrZgAg--", "site_full": "www.livetradingnews.com", "site": "livetradingnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.livetradingnews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Live Trading News", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin", "title_full": "This Week in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-13T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.livetradingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bitcoin-technical-analysis-218.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "722158b624c053bd18802590071d7c859b540649", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuayR6ajeoTrpol9mUhayiqb4dikFcPyR04hMaoOrdQNBg3gyXkHSsJOzWL8ffVrZgAg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shayne Heffernan", "published": "2018-05-13T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin", "text": "Follow on Facebook Subscribe by Email Print This Post\nThis week’s round-up features a colorful selection of bitcoin stories but we’ll start with the possible explanation for recent market dips. Most cryptocurrencies dropped in price over the period, following developments with depressing effect on traders. In Japan, Mt. Gox’s bitcoins stored in court ordered wallets have moved again, while in South Korea, the largest exchange Upbit has found itself under investigation for suspected fraud.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: “Social” Coins, Crypto Vending, Blockchain Mileage Markets React to Disturbing News from Japan and Korea\nThe prices of leading cryptocurrencies dropped this week, with some recovery across the board on Sunday. The negative trend was probably determined by some notable developments in Asia, powerful enough to influence the mood of traders. Just as Bitcoin (BTC) looked poised to storm the $10,000 psychological threshold, the ghost of notoriously hacked cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox reminded bitcoiners it isn’t done with them yet. Tokyo-based court appointed trustee of the remaining bitcoin to be distributed among creditors, Nobuaki Kobayashi, seems ready to flood the market , again. According to Blockchain.info, over 8,000 coins from two court ordered cold storage wallets have been recently shifted. As soon as the news broke, BTC prices plummeted.\nSouth Korean media reported that the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, is under investigation on suspicions of fraud. The exchange confirmed the news in a statement and tried to reassure its customers that their assets are kept securely, while “all transactions and withdrawals are operating normally.” Reports suggested that Upbit is suspected of transferring customer funds from their cryptocurrency exchange account to a representative or executive account. Acting on that information, Korean prosecutors have conducted search and seizure against the company, securing computer hard disks and accounting records. Upbit is currently the world’s fourth-largest crypto trading platform. China to Publish Monthly Crypto Report\nThe Chinese government has decided to keep a close eye on decentralized currencies, despite all crypto bans it has imposed so far. Beijing authorities are set to publish a regular monthly analysis of over two dozen crypto assets in the form of the new Global Public Chain Assessment Index. “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide,” according to a government press release. Almost 30 cryptos will be analyzed. The coins included in the index are expected to conform to certain standards like having an independent main chain and an open block browser.\nChina is also working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic. Initially the blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards, but the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future. Localbitcoins Changes ToS to Comply With EU Law\nThe popular peer-to-peer exchange Localbitcoins has updated its Terms of Service (ToS) , noting that the changes have been introduced mainly due to regulations in the European Union. The new ToS of the Helsinki-based trading platform highlight certain identification requirements. In some situations users will be required to submit a copy of ID, although identity verification is not yet implemented as a mandatory procedure for all traders. The company has detailed some of the situations in which identification will be necessary. These include trading over certain volume limits, cases of account hacking/recovery, and fraud investigations. The new terms will be enforced on May 25. Facebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nThis week we also covered some interesting developments in our daily rubric “Bitcoin in Brief” . After introducing a ban on crypto-related ads earlier this year, social media giant Facebook is now considering creating its own cryptocurrency to facilitate on-platform payments, reports suggested. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the network is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies. The company announced recently it had formed a team tasked to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that can be utilized to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase. BCH-Powered Social Media Apps Launch New Features\nTwo popular Bitcoin Cash social media applications, Memo and Blockpress, have introduced new features on their platforms this week. Users can now upload pictures, video, and even torrent magnets found on the Pirate Bay. Memo has recently added a bunch of features like replies, emojis, and a counter for typing. Its programmers also added a ‘Topics’ section where people can discuss any topic trending on the application. On Thursday, the Memo development team added image and Youtube video support. Users can now upload a picture or their favorite Youtube video utilizing an on-chain BCH transaction.\nLast week, another BCH-powered social media application was launched – Blockpress . Just like Memo, the platform enables the ability to publish 77 characters via the Bitcoin Cash network. Its developer “Attila” said that after the May 15 BCH upgrade the Blockpress platform will provide the ability to upload much longer content. Currently, its users can add images to posts, a notification feed, community topics, and a sidebar of followed profiles on Blockpress. Bitcoin and the Carnal Temptations\nA bitcoin supporter hopes to replace New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned amid a sex scandal. Four women have recently complained about non-consensual physical violence by Schneiderman. Stock market lawyer and former stand-up comedian Manny Alicandro has announced his candidacy on the Republican ticket. He is described as bitcoin enthusiast and a crypto investor, who advises several blockchain startups. Alicandro’s campaign will highlight the current harsh regulation of bitcoin in the Empire State and may accept donations in bitcoin . He has been quoted as saying that he would like to see lighter rules for cryptocurrency businesses. Alicandro believes that New York’s Bitlicense regime is hurting jobs and stifling innovation.\nNY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned just hours after the news about the violent sex scandal broke. His administration was behind an investigation into the operations of bitcoin exchanges which was rebuked by representatives of the crypto industry like Kraken CEO Jessie Powell who sharply criticized the regulatory overreach of his office.\nThis week bitcoin and carnal pleasures were mentioned together more than once. Exotic dancer Brenna Sparks, featured in the article about a Las Vegas club where strippers accept bitcoin via QR tattoos, has published a blog post on an adult entertainment industry portal explaining the advantages of cryptocurrency to her colleagues. Noting that digital money can help with upholding privacy and fighting piracy, Brenna also points out the main advantage of cryptos like bitcoin – helping people in the business avoid paying almost 50% to middlemen.\nWhat are your thoughts on this week’s bitcoin topics?

And, there's even a bank ready to serve Iran when it comes knocking: according to Reuters, German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin.\nThat's right: bitcoin's money-laundering, capital-controls evading capabilities - the reason why we said it's going much, much higher back in September 2015 when it was just above $200 - are finally going mainstream. And not only that, but in one move it is disintermediating the multi-trillion industry behind private money creation known as \"banking.\"\nIt's therefore hardly a surprise that the company's motto is \"see no bank, hear no bank, speak no bank.\"\nAlbrecht's Bitbond uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to completely bypass the Swift international transfer system which has a monopoly and ultimate veto power on who is in - and isn't - in the global petrodollar club, to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nBut what about the risk of intermediary price fluctuations?\nThat, too, has been factored in as clients hold the loans in their choice cryptocurrency for only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitbond's novelty is that while bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, it never served as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. And judging by the company's rapid growth, there is more than enough demand for its services: Albrecht’s service, which has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013, employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. However, those amount are set to grow: in 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since. More importantly, not a single regulator has reached out to Albrecht to tell him to shut down his service, and for good reason: according to Bitnodes, adoption of bitcoin has been rapid in Germany, only trailing the U.S., based on the location of all the bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\nTags Business Finance", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T18:22:35.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fa8985a856ba8a7eaad1dc8f1111211e00bb5bf7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSQJBP19ZHf5rXh3sBGYOW1lGlCaDsofkF1kxGqNuHMNnhoY7zyP.g7itQR1vtkekNNws2RwjOfx0", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Name Shortages Of Bitcoin Clones Leaves Blockchain Developer No Choice But To Reluctantly Name His Fork ‘Bitcoin Polyester’", "title_full": "Name Shortages Of Bitcoin Clones Leaves Blockchain Developer No Choice But To Reluctantly Name His Fork ‘Bitcoin Polyester’", "published": "2018-05-13T17:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fa8985a856ba8a7eaad1dc8f1111211e00bb5bf7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSQJBP19ZHf5rXh3sBGYOW1lGlCaDsofkF1kxGqNuHMNnhoY7zyP.g7itQR1vtkekNNws2RwjOfx0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T17:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Name Shortages Of Bitcoin Clones Leaves Blockchain Developer No Choice But To Reluctantly Name His Fork ‘Bitcoin Polyester’", "text": "Name Shortages Of Bitcoin Clones Leaves Blockchain Developer No Choice But To Reluctantly Name His Fork 'Bitcoin Polyester'\n/u/skramzy\nsubmitted by /u/skramzy\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T17:47:59.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "562c86e55638063dc3800d1080a807f19deb73a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdT4IDIkFwXUmlJnS7eH6asvdKPy3JBseHmLFfntq0Q_.CwGEv3fnglP_3xg5sPYnuCg--", "site_full": "earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Earn Money", "title": "Free and simple next generation Bitcoin mining program.", "title_full": "Free and simple next generation Bitcoin mining program.", "published": "2018-05-13T17:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "562c86e55638063dc3800d1080a807f19deb73a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdT4IDIkFwXUmlJnS7eH6asvdKPy3JBseHmLFfntq0Q_.CwGEv3fnglP_3xg5sPYnuCg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "earn money (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T17:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free and simple next generation Bitcoin mining program.", "text": "This ad is from a PRO or GOLD HERCULIST member.

Albrecht says that Bitbond’s use of cryptocurrency will allow it to transfer money quicker and at a lower cost than standard banks.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” he told Reuters. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are . Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients who use Bitbond only hold onto the cryptocurrencies for a few minutes before they are exchanged for local currency. This ensures that clients won’t have to deal with the rather volatile cryptocurrency market.\nBitbond was founded in 2013 and has grown into an officially licensed bank with a large number of investors. Currently, Bitbond’s Berlin office employs 24 people from a dozen countries managing loans for about 100 clients. In total, the loans amount to about $1 million each month.\nAlbrecht says that the majority of his customers are small business owners or freelance workers who need a quick and affordable way to handle international loans. The loans are fairly small by the standards of most banks, and tend to be around $50,000 at the higher end of the scale.\nWhile Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans in the past, this is the first time that it has been used to facilitate international loans. It makes sense that Germany would be one of the first countries to attempt it, however. Adoption of Bitcoin has proceeded at a rapid rate within Germany. In terms of Bitcoin usage, it is second only to the United States.\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just now beginning to hit the mainstream, they still pose many risks not found in traditonal currencies. The largest is the simple fact that the various currencies tend to sharply fluctuate in value. This can make it risky as a long-term investment, but since Bitbond clients only hold the cryptocurrencies for a short amount of time, that risk is mitigated to some extent.\nFor more information about Bitcoin and the technology that makes it possible, check out our blockchain primer .

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic//File Photo\nBERLIN (Reuters) - German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin.\nBitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\nWriting by Laura Dubois,; Editing by Joseph Nasr and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n-- © Copyright Reuters 2018-05-14", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T02:13:59.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9adc85ddb230d8d69371f9d147adc65397316a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmboWHJzkcErC5UJnNROR1NU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin is the vehicle, we run it", "title_full": "bitcoin is the vehicle, we run it", "published": "2018-05-13T17:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.016, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f9adc85ddb230d8d69371f9d147adc65397316a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmboWHJzkcErC5UJnNROR1NU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vonnyaries", "published": "2018-05-13T17:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin is the vehicle, we run it", "text": "Quote: from: DPrillio on May 13, 2018, 08:48:21 AM Quote: from: vonnyaries on May 13, 2018, 08:13:00 AM in my opinion bitcoin is just a media currencies, the user is the holder and the owner of bitcoin, if the owner is doing good, bitcoin can help him to do good like donating people that need help, but if the owner is bad i think bitocin can help him to do bad too, like the money laundry and other criminal that use bitcoin. so conclusion is bad or good is become the user, not the media like bitcoin\nMy understanding of the subject is that the bitcoin is the vehicle and people is the one who make it run because as a virtual currency its main engine to make blockchain system run is the internet, the people or the holder and investor is the primary factor for making it alive, like its volatility or the market value changes.\nyes you are right that the people is makes the bitcoin is worked from the fisrt of bitcoin created, without poeple i think bitcoin is nothing and doesn't have the value, and i agree that bitcoin price and the popularity is because the holder, and investor that using bitcoin, and always check the price for getting their profit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T07:10:29.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e84782a24ae0cd924079aa676cfd0f63df1b0cf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va76IMhfkDHSsipn0OHlXvPuUWx7fjBFztX7oXr8E4XG2v4VQT_TgkARhM.f2gB52JMXe.BsxbwDPO02sEtyazfMB6L6X4rKlD9WRKomlpA5ISvnk6_NrML7VSC065XlP4qg--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions -

I think you are confusing this with a BIP 32 HD wallet, in which a master private key is used to derive the wallet's subsequent private keys (each of which will have its own uniqe bitcoin address). As a user, you do not have to worry about this, the wallet software will take care of input selection and transaction signing in the background for you. – chytrik Jan 11 at 5:37 I am able to generate multiple bitcoin addresses in Exodus, so I've been under the impression that any number of addresses can be made by hashing the public key. So all of these addresses go back to the one common key. Are you sure that each bitcoin address relates to a unique private key? Or were you referring to public keys? – Matt Jan 11 at 5:49 Multiple addresses aren't created by hashing a public key, this is a misunderstanding. A hash function is deterministic, so if you provide the same input more than once, you will receive the same output each time. That said, it occurs to me that you may be talking about an extended public key (xpub), which can be used to derive infinite child pub keys. Even in this case, you still need the extended private key (xpriv) that created the xpub key so that you can derive the child priv key of each child pub key. So each address still has a priv key of its own, that is required in order to spend – chytrik Jan 11 at 10:03 A BIP32 hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet works in this way, all addresses are derived from a master extended private key (xpriv key), but it is public/private key-pairs that you derive, not just addresses that are all controlled by a single private key.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients who use Bitbond only hold onto the cryptocurrencies for a few minutes before they are exchanged for local currency. This ensures that clients won’t have to deal with the rather volatile cryptocurrency market.\nBitbond was founded in 2013 and has grown into an officially licensed bank with a large number of investors. Currently, Bitbond’s Berlin office employs 24 people from a dozen countries managing loans for about 100 clients. In total, the loans amount to about $1 million each month.\nAlbrecht says that the majority of his customers are small business owners or freelance workers who need a quick and affordable way to handle internationalloans. The loans are fairly small by the standards of most banks, and tend to be around $50,000 at the higher end of the scale.\nWhile Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans in the past, this is the first time that it has been used to facilitate international loans. It makes sense that Germany would be one of the first countries to attempt it, however. Adoption of Bitcoin has proceeded at a rapid rate within Germany. In terms of Bitcoin usage, it is second only to the United States.\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just now beginning to hit the mainstream, they still pose many risks not found in traditonal currencies. The largest is the simple fact that the various currencies tend to sharply fluctuatein value. This can make it risky as a long-term investment, but since Bitbond clients only hold the cryptocurrencies for a short amount of time, that risk is mitigated to some extent.\nFor more information about Bitcoin and the technology that makes it possible, check out our blockchain primer .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-bitcoin/german-online-bank-uses-bitcoins-to-transfer-loans-idUSKBN1ID07Y?feedType=RSS&feedName=technologyNews", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-a-blockchain/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric brackett c", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitbond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T17:42:50.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c558e305baaf208cf05c1ee9e9571e2c804433c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTnkfmlvX6JaIWIYWnVhdkJT_lyl3z9qM5LhcYu8DZDKSh8NoPtnoLtzk7WfvlJHXNzOmgwns6oHS4W0A_V7p7Or5g_cfQHmLo-", "site_full": "almmello.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://almmello.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Alexandre's News", "title": "Forget Bitcoin for Now: Here's the Real Reason You Should Embrace Blockchain", "title_full": "Forget Bitcoin for Now: Here's the Real Reason You Should Embrace Blockchain", "published": "2018-05-13T17:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c558e305baaf208cf05c1ee9e9571e2c804433c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTnkfmlvX6JaIWIYWnVhdkJT_lyl3z9qM5LhcYu8DZDKSh8NoPtnoLtzk7WfvlJHXNzOmgwns6oHS4W0A_V7p7Or5g_cfQHmLo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandre M Mello (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T17:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Forget Bitcoin for Now: Here's the Real Reason You Should Embrace Blockchain", "text": "The basis for all business is supply and demand, but recent events have shown that supply can be more fragile than we might expect. For example, KFC's chicken shortages in the U.K. forced two-thirds of its 900 restaurants to close while the company worked to repair its delivery, via DHL. (And this was then followed by a gravy shortage .)\nUltimately, it turned out that those U.K. events were because of human error, not any lack of chicken. And that revelation only reinforced how critical excellent record-keeping and accountability are for maintaining supply chain integrity. But help is on the way: Fortunately, the supply world will soon be revolutionized by the innovative solution of blockchain.\nBlockchain: the next wave in supply chain management The most promising approach to robust supply-chain data is likely blockchain technology, a relatively new approach to digital record-keeping most famously associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin but applicable to many domains.\nRelated: 15 Crazy and Surprising Ways People Are Using Blockchain\nSharing is the secret to blockchain's robustness against tampering: Because everyone has a record of the information, there is no way any one person can alter data in the chain. The technology's distributed nature also means there is no central authority, so no one group controls that data.\nThese attractive features, of database security and distributed storage, are what's motivating the incorporation of blockchain into business operations. They're also the reasons blockchain will come to have the ring of trustworthiness in consumers' perceptions. That trust is critical to competing in today's marketplace.\nCompanies that lead in adopting blockchain will enjoy building that trust early in the process of its global adoption. So, are you in? Following are a few simple steps to move your company toward incorporating blockchain into your own operations:\n1. Don't adopt blockchain because it's the cool new thing but because it ensures trust. New technologies tend to stir up excitement, but that can also create a bandwagon effect in which companies wind up wasting resources on new tech just because they can.\nRelated: 12 Startups Utilizing Blockchain Technology in New Ways\nI'm seeing this pattern with blockchain, and it reminds me -- and others -- of the dotcom era. That thinking goes something like this: \"We're going to store data about transactions in the blockchain. Why? Because that's what's cool. \"\nBut that's never a good business reason. Instead, commit to adopting blockchain only if you need to ensure trust in your transactions through a verifiable and incorruptible system. Trust is ultimately about proof. Ask yourself, what exactly do you need to prove, and to whom do you need to prove it?\nFor example, if you have a massively long list of transactions that relate to your supply chain, is verifying every entry on that list important to your business? Or are you actually trying to prove just a fraction of that? To know exactly where you'll need provable data, do some thinking about supply chain issues and what blockchain can do for them.\nFortunately, there is no shortage of great resources to develop your understanding of blockchain. In my own education, I've found YouTube to be an excellent tutor. Several other resources I recommend include an overview of how blockchain will change the economy , a lesson about how it works and recent conference presentations on the technology.\n2. Know blockchain's current limitations: real-time transactions and scaling. It's fair to say that because of a glaring lack of speed, blockchain is not ready for real-time transactions. The transaction rates are unable to compete at the level seen by credit card companies or any domain with a very high rate of transactions -- essentially anything with an exchange.\nVitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, a popular cryptocurrency and alternative to bitcoin, has discussed in an online video how the peak capacity for Bitcoin is five transactions per second, with Ethereum nudging past it at six per second. But he then compares that to the much greater transaction capacity of Visa's network, which is capable of handling a blazing 56,000 transactions per second , as a spokesman told the MyBroadband blog.\nSpeed may come to blockchain in time, but for now, intense real-time applications have been ruled out. That limitation excludes many use cases, which allows you to focus a little more closely on what actually can work. The present limitations in the blockchain technology also pose inherent problems. Buterin also blogged about this issue , noting that with the milestone of Ethereum transactions having reached a million a day early in 2018, blockchain networks have been generally reaching the limits of their (current) capacity.\nRelated: More Than Just Bitcoin: Blockchain Has Value Across Multiple Industries\n3. Make sure you can tolerate working out some kinks with blockchain. Blockchain as a concept was born less than a decade ago, so it is still in the research and development stages. For that reason, if you're going to adopt it, be sure you can stomach some bumps in the road as the technology improves -- as well as the slew of variations and new offerings competing for your business. Things can get dizzying quickly.\nFor example, there isn't just one standard blockchain. Instead, there exist many types of what are now known as \"distributed ledger technologies,\" or DLTs. Although diversity in digital tools is a positive aspect for business, it also creates mental overhead in your choosing the right approach for your needs. Some DLTs are more suitable for certain kinds of programs, so it's important to do the research necessary to understand which is best for you.\nFinally, because blockchain is relatively new, press coverage and general buzz about it may swing wildly and is often driven by investor concerns or exaggeration -- regardless of what's happening with the technological progress.\nIn fact, a recent TechCrunch article even characterized it as having entered the \"valley of despair\" that is common to all change. The point, though, is that you should be careful to not get caught up in the buzz -- good or bad -- regarding blockchain, and instead stick closely to the technological facts. If your supply chain needs can benefit from tracking transactions with a new level of trust, then all that media chatter doesn't matter.\nThe blockchain future is arriving. Will you be ready? Expect to see more of your competitors offering and advertising a blockchain solution in the coming year. By being prepared, you can be part of a revolution in supply chain management, building trust in your brand and making product-tracing massively more efficient.\nWhether you create an in-house solution or outsource to today's cutting-edge consultants, this novel approach to accountability can make all the difference in your client satisfaction and brand recognition during 2018 and beyond.\nRelated:\nThis Techpreneur Shares Why India is one of the Hottest Market for Blockchain Startups\nForget Bitcoin for Now: Here's the Real Reason You Should Embrace Blockchain\nBlockchain Is Gaining Ground in Video-Streaming.

Investing time and methods on nearly anything relevant to Bitcoin requires entrepreneurship.Notwithstanding this, Bitcoin is not really made to be considered a deflationary Bitcoin currency. It is more accurate to say Bitcoin is meant to inflate in its early decades, and develop into secure in its afterwards several years.Bitcoin miners are neither ready to cheat by raising their very own reward nor method fraudulent transactions which could corrupt the Bitcoin community due to the fact all Bitcoin nodes would reject any block which contains invalid data as per the rules in the Bitcoin protocol.

As appended words to the Bitcoin name have been scooped up left and right, developers of potential forks aren’t left with much to work with. This rings especially true with recent ‘Bitcoin Polyester’ (BTCPLY) creator, Dennis Kwong.\n“You’re god damn right I’m pissed,” shouted Kwong. “I’ve been boning up on my blockchain dev for the last few years, and as soon as I’m ready to go live, I get dicked on all the names I had lined up. I guess it could be worse, I mean, could you imagine naming your coin something like VeChain? More like VaGine.”\nSenior BTCPLY Blockchain Developer, Gus Hammond, commented on the situation by casting doubt on the name’s ability to have them be taken seriously in such a competitive market.\n“It’s an unfortunate name, that’s for sure. I suggested to Dennis that we try out a few other names and see if they stick. Even though he claims to hates the name, he adamantly stated that polyester is the superior fabric type since it doesn’t wrinkle or collect lint. I guess I see how he can make that a parallel to our coin’s attributes, but it doesn’t really make sense to me. It honestly doesn’t even do anything different than Bitcoin except for a feature Dennis calls “Lintrolling”, where our address takes 0.1% of each successful BTCPLY transaction. I think he took the idea from Office Space, now that I think about it.”\nKwong expanded on Hammonds take of the situation.\n“Let me throw a few names out at you: Bitcoin Aluminum – structurally unsound and used to smoke drugs. No. Bitcoin Cedar – literally the worst type of tree. No. Bitcoin Glass, see Bitcoin Aluminum. Are you seeing a pattern? The obvious choice was Bitcoin Polyester, given the circumstances.”\n“Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Dark, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Cash,” Kwong listed off. “I thought of those names years ago. I’m considering suing Roger Ver over the trademark rights to Bitcoin Cash. Everybody’s suing him anyway, I might as well throw my name in the hat and see what happens.”\nHow do you think the name Bitcoin Polyester will go over? Let us know your thoughts.\nPhoto by Andre Francois on Unsplash Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://unsplash.com/search/photos/bitcoin?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText", "https://unsplash.com/photos/vBYVj-yycwQ?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kwong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gus hammond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis kwong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T00:20:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3cbe4f7dd3cb073203064f0861eb2409ab45bd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaEP5CzPU7LmMS8Z1YokbTBw5u6oDWNPs2iKzvMChOO4YkeUxiZU59o68X7sjx2mO.jAoJ.klQj5dvuN2UIvpKzg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "The 17 Millionth Bitcoin Is About to Be Mined: What It Means and Why It Matters", "title_full": "The 17 Millionth Bitcoin Is About to Be Mined: What It Means and Why It Matters : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-13T17:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d3cbe4f7dd3cb073203064f0861eb2409ab45bd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaEP5CzPU7LmMS8Z1YokbTBw5u6oDWNPs2iKzvMChOO4YkeUxiZU59o68X7sjx2mO.jAoJ.klQj5dvuN2UIvpKzg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MadgeConlon", "published": "2018-05-13T17:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "The 17 Millionth Bitcoin Is About to Be Mined: What It Means and Why It Matters", "text": "submitted by /u/MadgeConlon\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/17-millionth-bitcoin-mined-means-matters/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T12:17:18.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5e0c1574903c7dfe3d6227d3a6e6a193db2c5f25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqpj9ZvlwQB76ic01y8m1Ql.o_i_mk9H6m7zWKEgAtPCXn6U7afhHw9CUaA1SETOI9gbktcqY3zUUMpNJQbU9a_6LY6geMQ9k6ctT0NlaTngD_T8WjCypK7exTQa2B1Hp2VI.D0l3ESsA--", "site_full": "bits.aihosting.com", "site": "aihosting.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "German Bank Allows Users To Transfer Loans Anywhere In The World Using Bitcoin \"see no bank, hear no bank, speak no bank\" is their motto", "title_full": "German Bank Allows Users To Transfer Loans Anywhere In The World Using Bitcoin \"see no bank, hear no bank, speak no bank\" is their motto", "published": "2018-05-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/2018-05/Bitbond-2017-2.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e0c1574903c7dfe3d6227d3a6e6a193db2c5f25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqpj9ZvlwQB76ic01y8m1Ql.o_i_mk9H6m7zWKEgAtPCXn6U7afhHw9CUaA1SETOI9gbktcqY3zUUMpNJQbU9a_6LY6geMQ9k6ctT0NlaTngD_T8WjCypK7exTQa2B1Hp2VI.D0l3ESsA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "German Bank Allows Users To Transfer Loans Anywhere In The World Using Bitcoin \"see no bank, hear no bank, speak no bank\" is their motto", "text": "0 SHARES\nWith the US set to blacklist Iran from global dollar-based transactions, here's an idea for Tehran: use Bitcoin to make, and accept, payments from its trading partners. And, there's even a bank ready to serve Iran when it comes knocking: according to Reuters, German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin.\nThat's right: bitcoin's money-laundering, capital-controls evading capabilities - the reason why we said it's going much, much higher back in September 2015 when it was just above $200 - are finally going mainstream. And not only that, but in one move it is disintermediating the multi-trillion industry behind private money creation known as \"banking.\"\nIt's therefore hardly a surprise that the company's motto is \"see no bank, hear no bank, speak no bank.\"\nAlbrecht's Bitbond uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to completely bypass the Swift international transfer system which has a monopoly and ultimate veto power on who is in - and isn't - in the global petrodollar club, to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nBut what about the risk of intermediary price fluctuations?\nThat, too, has been factored in as clients hold the loans in their choice cryptocurrency for only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitbond's novelty is that while bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, it never served as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. And judging by the company's rapid growth, there is more than enough demand for its services: Albrecht’s service, which has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013, employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. However, those amount are set to grow: in 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since. More importantly, not a single regulator has reached out to Albrecht to tell him to shut down his service, and for good reason: according to Bitnodes, adoption of bitcoin has been rapid in Germany, only trailing the U.S., based on the location of all the bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.

Three months ago, Novogratz, Director of Galaxy Investment Partners announced that it has raised $ 250 million for an investment in the crypto currency with the name of Galaxy Digital. The New York-based company wants to be “Goldman Sachs of Crypto,” crypto-currency Assets to trade and manage, as well as Blockchain-Startups consulting services.\nOn Wednesday Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Capital Management, launched a collaboration with Bloomberg the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which is the some of the Top crypto-currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nIn an Interview with CNBC Novogratz explained the role that crypto-currencies will play in shaping our future and stressed how important it is for investors to delegate a portion of your portfolio to these digital assets. He claimed that investment in crypto currency “should not necessarily [made] because of all of the profits you will make”, but because “this [Blockchain] technology will tackle in the next two to four years, a lot of problems”.\n“I’m not saying that the decentralized Version of Uber will be Uber,” he added. “But it will be a challenge, and it has a real value.” Traditional financial institutions begin to engage\nNovogratz ‘bullish expectations are in accordance with the procedure, the start to take the majority of traditional financial institutions in recent times.

This is supposed to be starting in June of 2018 is ready for use.\nOf course, not everyone agrees with the wonders of Bitcoin. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet has criticized Bitcoin repeatedly, and even “rat poison in the square”. Novogratz rejected, however, the criticism of the Buffet with a shrug.\n“In many ways, this is a Millennium Generation-led Revolution … what I’ve found is that people with gray hair are much more sceptical”\nImage source: CB Insights", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blockchain mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hael novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galaxy digital capital management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs of crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galaxy investment partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galaxy digital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg galaxy crypto index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs group, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T17:42:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2219c07f16aeb36cbe9035872959677bfb3c5b82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46dNn50kkI3gGe53qztKb8ow--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "AutoIt - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-13T16:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2219c07f16aeb36cbe9035872959677bfb3c5b82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46dNn50kkI3gGe53qztKb8ow--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-13T16:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Bitcoin-crans", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW revolutional software for SEO/SMM\n1.

Roger Ver is a Hardcore to improve a proponent of Bitcoin Cash, a Hardfork of the Bitcoin Protocol, aiming speed and efficiency of the network.\nVer claims, Bitcoin to Cash [BCH] be the true Version of Bitcoin and Satoshi’s true Vision. The support for the Bitcoin Alternative, however, is shrunk, whereby the currency is currently on the fourth Position in a $ 23b.\nMany in the crypto world Ethereum to be seen as the digital currency that will overtake Bitcoin. This long-expected Event the flippening “(dt.”“the tilt”). Those who believe that the flippening will happen, keep Ethereum because of the superior technology, active development, and the sheer number of decentralized Apps based on the System, as reasons for a significant price increase.\nWith Mr. Verse a strong commitment to Bitcoin Cash his comments and his support for Ethereum have shocked many. In an Interview with The Independent he said:\n“I can see that it is happening and I think it is imminent,” said Mr. Ver to The Independent. “Ethereum could overtake Bitcoin by the end of the year, and Bitcoin Cash could do the same before 2020.”\nIn addition to the growth of Ethereum according to Ver investors because Bitcoins have inherent technological limitations are moving money elsewhere. The network had to contend in recent years with scaling problems, even if, in the meantime, improvements with SegWit were made.\nWhile Ethereum has less than half of the market capitalization of Bitcoin, the price of an Ether, at the time of writing, around 670 US dollars, significantly lower than that of Bitcoin, at 8500 U.S. dollars. This is because there are five times more Ethereum, as a Bitcoin market capitalization is calculated by taking the price of a coin will be multiplied by the total amount of coins.

Back then, the circulating supply was just over half of it maximum total, with approximately 11.14 million coins in circulation.\nThe price was just $116.07 USD, however, had just gained by approximately 40% in ten days – with the bounce comprising a recovering rally following the fallout from the early-2013 bubble that saw many Cypriots charge into the bitcoin markets seeking refuge from the harsh structural adjustment policies imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\nOf all fourteen cryptocurrency markets listed on Coinmarketcap on May 12, 2013, bitcoin has since far outperformed its rivals, gaining by approximately 7175% in the last five years. LTC Only Altcoin Still Ranked in Top Ten by Market Capitalization\nOf the markets listed on the 2013 snapshot, Litecoin is by far the altcoin with the largest market capitalization today (approximately $7.94 billion as of this writing). At the time of the snapshot, the then second largest cryptocurrency had a total market capitalization of just $59.1 million, and a circulating supply of roughly 17.5 million.\nAt the current prices of roughly $140.55, LTC has made gains of 4,083% during five years. Whilst Litecoin’s market dominance has since eroded, LTC is still the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – making it the best performing altcoin from May 12, 2013. Only 50% of Crypto Markets Are More Valuable Today Than They Were 5 Years Ago\nThe third highest performing crypto market since the snapshot is the then twelfth largest by market cap, Ixcoin . At the time of the snapshot, Ixcoin was priced at approximately $0.015. With IXC current trading for $0.193096, Ixcoin’s value has inflated by 1177% in the last 5 years. IXC’s capitalization has grown from $191,294 to approximately $4 million, ranking it 677th by market cap.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Peercoin was the third largest market by capitalization (approximately $4.72 million), with PPC trading for roughly $0.25. Currently priced at $2.56, PPC has since gained 924%. Peercoin has been among the most enduring of May 2013’s crypto markets, currently comprising the 198th largest market with a capitalization of $63.3 million.\nThe then fourth largest cryptocurrency, Namecoin , has offered investors a modest return of approximately 130% since the snapshot, gaining in price from $0.853 to $1.96. NMC’s is now the 309th largest market, having grown from a capitalization of $4.70 million to $28.8 million today.\nFeathercoin , the then ninth largest cryptocurrency market, has gained from $0.1256 to $0.169727 – a meager 35.1% increase in five years. Feathercoin is now the 278th largest market, with FTC’s capitalization growing from to $821,341 to $34 million.\nThe then seventh largest market, Novacoin , has gained by only 15.5% in five years, increasing in value from $3.54 to $4.09. NVC is now the 550th largest market with a capitalization, growing from almost $1 million to roughly $8.5 million. 46% of Altcoins Have Lost More Than 80% of Their Value\nNearly half of the altcoins included in the snapshot – many of which promised that they would change the world whilst making investors rich – have since lost more than 80% of their value.\nThe then fifth largest cryptocurrency market, Terracoin , has dropped nearly 81% from $0.4 to 0.164. It is ranked 694th by market cap, after gaining from approximately $1 million to $3.74 million.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Freicoin was the eighth largest crypto market with a capitalization of $882,374. Since then, FRC’s capitalization has actually shrunk to a meager $203,719 (approximately 24 BTC) – ranking it 1,152nd by market cap. The price has also decreased by 84.5%, falling from $0.0424 to $0.00658.\nThe market cap of the then eleventh ranked market, Mincoin , has also shrunk – dropping from $230,012 to $169,379 (approximately 20 BTC). Now ranked 1,170th, MNC has also shed nearly 83% of its value, with prices falling from $0.220779 to $0.037906. 23% of Altcoins Trading on the 12th of May, 2013 Now Appear Dead\nNearly a quarter of the altcoins included in the snapshot now appear dormant.\nData for the then sixth largest crypto market, Devcoin , stops on November 24th, 2017 – with the last recorded price of $0.000023 comprising an approximately 90% drop from $0.000223.\nThe most recent price for then tenth ranked market, CHNCoin , was recorded on boxing day last year – CHNCoin having then dropped by nearly 99% in five years, falling from $0.1 to just $0.001222.\nAnd lastly, but certainly not least, data for then thirteenth ranked market, BBQCoin , also ended on the 24th of November – with BBQ’s final price of $0.000458 comprising a 95% loss in value from $0.0091.\nWhat was your opinion of cryptocurrency in 2013?

When looking at a historic snapshot from May 12th, 2013, by far the best cryptocurrency purchase one could have made was bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend\nBTC Top Performing Market Since May 12th, 2013 According to the snapshot , bitcoin had a market capitalization of just 1.293 billion on the 12th of May, 2012. Back then, the circulating supply was just over half of it maximum total, with approximately 11.14 million coins in circulation.\nThe price was just $116.07 USD, however, had just gained by approximately 40% in ten days – with the bounce comprising a recovering rally following the fallout from the early-2013 bubble that saw many Cypriots charge into the bitcoin markets seeking refuge from the harsh structural adjustment policies imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\nOf all fourteen cryptocurrency markets listed on Coinmarketcap on May 12, 2013, bitcoin has since far outperformed its rivals, gaining by approximately 7175% in the last five years.\nLTC Only Altcoin Still Ranked in Top Ten by Market Capitalization Of the markets listed on the 2013 snapshot, Litecoin is by far the altcoin with the largest market capitalization today (approximately $7.94 billion as of this writing). At the time of the snapshot, the then second largest cryptocurrency had a total market capitalization of just $59.1 million, and a circulating supply of roughly 17.5 million.\nAt the current prices of roughly $140.55, LTC has made gains of 4,083% during five years. Whilst Litecoin's market dominance has since eroded, LTC is still the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – making it the best performing altcoin from May 12, 2013.\nOnly 50% of Crypto Markets Are More Valuable Today Than They Were 5 Years Ago The third highest performing crypto market since the snapshot is the then twelfth largest by market cap, Ixcoin . At the time of the snapshot, Ixcoin was priced at approximately $0.015. With IXC current trading for $0.193096, Ixcoin's value has inflated by 1177% in the last 5 years. IXC's capitalization has grown from $191,294 to approximately $4 million, ranking it 677th by market cap.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Peercoin was the third largest market by capitalization (approximately $4.72 million), with PPC trading for roughly $0.25. Currently priced at $2.56, PPC has since gained 924%. Peercoin has been among the most enduring of May 2013's crypto markets, currently comprising the 198th largest market with a capitalization of $63.3 million.\nThe then fourth largest cryptocurrency, Namecoin , has offered investors a modest return of approximately 130% since the snapshot, gaining in price from $0.853 to $1.96. NMC's is now the 309th largest market, having grown from a capitalization of $4.70 million to $28.8 million today.\nFeathercoin , the then ninth largest cryptocurrency market, has gained from $0.1256 to $0.169727 – a meager 35.1% increase in five years. Feathercoin is now the 278th largest market, with FTC's capitalization growing from to $821,341 to $34 million.\nThe then seventh largest market, Novacoin , has gained by only 15.5% in five years, increasing in value from $3.54 to $4.09. NVC is now the 550th largest market with a capitalization, growing from almost $1 million to roughly $8.5 million.\n46% of Altcoins Have Lost More Than 80% of Their Value Nearly half of the altcoins included in the snapshot – many of which promised that they would change the world whilst making investors rich – have since lost more than 80% of their value.\nThe then fifth largest cryptocurrency market, Terracoin , has dropped nearly 81% from $0.4 to 0.164. It is ranked 694th by market cap, after gaining from approximately $1 million to $3.74 million.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Freicoin was the eighth largest crypto market with a capitalization of $882,374. Since then, FRC's capitalization has actually shrunk to a meager $203,719 (approximately 24 BTC) – ranking it 1,152nd by market cap. The price has also decreased by 84.5%, falling from $0.0424 to $0.00658.\nThe market cap of the then eleventh ranked market, Mincoin , has also shrunk – dropping from $230,012 to $169,379 (approximately 20 BTC). Now ranked 1,170th, MNC has also shed nearly 83% of its value, with prices falling from $0.220779 to $0.037906.\n23% of Altcoins Trading on the 12th of May, 2013 Now Appear Dead Nearly a quarter of the altcoins included in the snapshot now appear dormant.\nData for the then sixth largest crypto market, Devcoin , stops on November 24th, 2017 – with the last recorded price of $0.000023 comprising an approximately 90% drop from $0.000223.\nThe most recent price for then tenth ranked market, CHNCoin , was recorded on boxing day last year – CHNCoin having then dropped by nearly 99% in five years, falling from $0.1 to just $0.001222.\nAnd lastly, but certainly not least, data for then thirteenth ranked market, BBQCoin , also ended on the 24th of November – with BBQ's final price of $0.000458 comprising a 95% loss in value from $0.0091.\nWhat was your opinion of cryptocurrency in 2013?

The conference will feature many expert speakers and presenters, including representatives from IBM and European Parliament.\nFocus on Regulation\nLately, cryptocurrency regulation has become one of the main topics discussed at local and global levels. For that reason, the Prague conference will focus on recent regulatory movements in Europe, featuring speeches from the likes of Dimitrios Psarrakis, the Capital Markets and FinTech Regulation Policy Advisor at European Parliament, and Guenther Dobrauz of PwC Legal Switzerland.\nPsarrakis will share his inside knowledge about the position of the authorities when it comes to cryptocurrencies, discussing potential future regulation and talking about the current stance of the European Parliament, central banks, and more. Guenther Dobrauz's presentation will focus on the role of cryptocurrencies, real changes they can bring to the current banking system, and the likelihood of cryptos taking over the role of fiat currencies.\nBlockchain Technology Application & Tokens\nApart from regulatory considerations, the Prague Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference will also focus on the application of blockchain technology moving forward. René Bostic from IBM Cloud will deliver a presentation explaining the latest research in this area and offering potential fields of application.\nSandris Murins of the German company Iconiq Lab will treat the guests with a presentation breaking down a detailed research of 200 different coins currently in the market and also touching upon the topic of AI tokenization. Stefano Virgilli of VOX ICO Consulting will deliver a presentation focused on cryptocurrency mining, explaining many relevant areas of the activity such as setting transaction costs, hash rate calculations, and more.\nAlongside these and many other expert speakers, the Prague conference will also provide excellent networking opportunities bringing a lot of value to everyone in the attendance, giving guests a chance not just to learn something new but also forge fresh partnerships for the future.
