And that fear, in terms of the digital currency known as Bitcoin, is often stoked by the very people who have the most reason to want it to fail.\nHearing their laundry list of concerns and warnings might dissuade you from even considering it as a possible enterprise for your small business. But that can lead to a mistake of omission instead of one of the commission, as you might end up losing ground to competitors who understand what a great benefit can be had from it.\nThere is a certain segment of the financial guard that wants nothing to do with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies of its ilk because these technologies have the potential to truly upset the status quo. As a matter of fact, these digital coins can disrupt the way that personal finance has been conducted for years upon years, so you can understand how those who prefer it the old way might not be too thrilled with its ascendance.\nIf you don’t believe it, use it yourself, or invest in it with the help of a trading robot like Bitcoin Trader and see the difference it can make. What you’ll find is that a lot of the fears are unfounded, and the old guard isn’t telling you the whole story.\nBitcoin is so useful because it allows people and businesses to conduct transactions without any third-party interceding. That means no bank or credit card fees to encroach upon the purity of the transaction.

The businessman was summoned at the ED office here and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government, they said. There are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he had been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating. The ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. It is alleged that about 8,000 investors had lost about Rs 2,000 crore by transacting in this scheme. The ED had filed its case based on an FIR of Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune police had arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier. Bhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals. The central agency has expanded its probe into the case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments. It is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state. Last year, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there were no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the RBI had not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies. The government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, saying they were like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection.

I often look to our bellwethers, Bitcoin(BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD), as signals for the larger crypto market.\nI wanted to see $7085 hold in bitcoin and $495 in Ethereum. On May 28, bitcoin hit $7075, a nominal break and ethereum $505. So far, those levels have held, and we appear to have set up bullishly. As long as they do, we have a very bullish setup - the five-wave pattern off the April lows, which suggests this wave ii we believe bottomed that proceeds a larger third wave rally.\nBelow are six-hour charts that show the expected extent of the coming rally, if these levels hold.\nSee the charts provided in this article in an expandable format.\nNow, let's take a look at the 15-minute chart again for an update.\nUnfortunately, ethereum, while it started in a 5 wave move off the lows, it did not hold key support for an impulsive third wave. So, as of Monday morning I am tracking the pattern as a diagonal, with the expectation that we have another high over Sunday night’s high at $628.\nIf we break down below $538, the probability is we’ll see the May 28 low give way.\nBitcoin did not get as far as ethereum did before dropping Sunday night, so it may be called a 1-2,i-ii, where ii is the second wave in a minor third wave. It is immediately bullish as long as $7375 holds.\nNote the green line on the charts. This is a key level on both, where we retrace .618 of the drop from the May highs. If impulsive over those levels, $8720 in bitcoin and $685 in ethereum, we'll have the strongest confirmation we can have without a direct breakout.\nI currently consider sentiment to be very doubtful to apathetic. The apathetic holder feels shocked that they’ve seen such a drawdown but feels trapped and certainly doesn’t have the money to buy more. The doubtful holder believes bitcoin is in a large-scale correction and will remain in it for many months.\nOne trader I follow called for a 1.5-year correction. Some analysts I watch are calling for bitcoin to go below $5000. While I can see that price level possible, I cannot see it as probable at this time. Granted, if the key levels I’m watching and call out above, actually break, I will look down. And, those levels are quite tight to price here, so we have an early warning.\nIt seems, anecdotally, that we have sentiment conditions ripe for a larger rally to begin. But price must prove.\nConclusion\nIn short, so far price has held over the bottoms struck on May 28. We are now tracking nominally higher support levels in both ethereum and bitcoin to serve as an early warning of failure. As long as support levels hold, we see the next degree third wave as ready to start.\nSee the charts provided in this article in an expandable format.\nRyan Wilday is a cryptocurrency analyst at ElliottWaveTrader.net , where he hosts the Cryptocurrency Trading premium subscription service.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/scharts/Charts-on-Bitcoin-BTC-USD-Ethereum-ETH-USD-201806041850.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan wilday", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T20:58:02.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "542b3128b03d860b34a84fd9d6b1423b4407ab7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVlT8m.xNywiyJI_A6v9Y1NZiIsfNnBy.kvdH0k92zdg6g0sJ6BC2SUJOw88dWpczYlUdrkvkI.i7mcsjwfZlcZXZNAS369mqrBpqY7xaOf.r6UWKSRet70bTlx5g7NewJQ--", "site_full": "www.dailypolitical.com", "site": "dailypolitical.com", "site_section": "http://www.dailypolitical.com//rss/", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "media"], "section_title": "Daily Political", "title": "Bitcoin Green (BITG) Market Capitalization Tops $18.65 Million", "title_full": "Bitcoin Green (BITG) Market Capitalization Tops $18.65 Million", "published": "2018-06-05T09:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2604.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "542b3128b03d860b34a84fd9d6b1423b4407ab7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVlT8m.xNywiyJI_A6v9Y1NZiIsfNnBy.kvdH0k92zdg6g0sJ6BC2SUJOw88dWpczYlUdrkvkI.i7mcsjwfZlcZXZNAS369mqrBpqY7xaOf.r6UWKSRet70bTlx5g7NewJQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stacy Sanders", "published": "2018-06-05T09:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Green (BITG) Market Capitalization Tops $18.65 Million", "text": "Tweet\nBitcoin Green (CURRENCY:BITG) traded down 2.5% against the U.S. dollar during the 24 hour period ending at 21:00 PM ET on June 4th.

Because of that article, I’m now inundated with all manner of questions about what hot cryptocurrency to pick, the best ICO, and how to make money with cryptocurrency, and a bunch of ‘how do I get rich from cryptocurrency’ type questions. In an attempt to deflect the hoard of questions and provide some basic answer to some of the new visitors, I’ve spent the past few days writing a brand new guide to answer all the questions I’m getting. Welcome to The Mega Ultimate Guide to Making Millions with Cryptocurrency ICO’s. This is the very first article I have written myself for my new site CryptoIncome.io at http://cryptoincome.io/ There’s a number of articles on this site, all aimed at new investors and beginners to the cryptocurrency market. However, those were written by my staff, but not me. I figure I myself need to step in here and write a few core articles for you guys to get this site going and provide real value to the public from someone who knows what they are doing in this space. So if you are interested in my own articles here, make sure to check out all articles by Ben Krypto at http://cryptoincome.io/author/benk/ .\nIf you have questions and want to discuss no bullshit, no shill cryptocurrency picks with other passionate investors, join the Crypto Income Telegram group at https://t.me/joinchat/GbWHDA-N03C_vyQ9hdscQQ . I like to think this is by far the most comprehensive guide on the topic of making filthy amounts of money with ICO’s. And yes, I can confirm it is indeed possible to make ludicrous money through ICO investing. Why? Because I’ve made millions with ICO’s. So I can confirm it is indeed possible. And I’m going to make millions more. Now, I don’t want to bog this whole article down by showing proof. But if you feel you need to see I’m not bullshitting on my claims, simply check out the article I wrote on AuthorityIncome 6 months ago at http://authorityincome.com/how-i-made-a-million-dollars-with-cryptocurrency/ where I wrote about how I made over a million dollars in just 3 weeks. And yes, I go to great length to show you proof that I’m not bullshitting. Since then it’s been 6 months and the market has gone up 10x and a lot of craziness has happened. So this article is written by someone who’s not just talking the talk but walking the walk. This everything I reasonably know about how to make money with ICO’s. My ICO handbook, as it were. And I’m going to only charge you the fair price of $4,999 to become rich. ….actually not, I’m giving it away to you for FREE. Because that’s what I like to do and because I’ve made so much money in crypto that I don’t need any of yours. So why would I do this when I can clearly take your money?\nBecause I can, that’s why. And I hate all the stupid you tube shills and self-made fakers out there trying to tell you guys what shitcoins to buy, right before they’ve loaded up on their coins to dump on their followers. Anyways, enough of that. Let’s talk how to make some money. To make money in the current crypto market, you just need to know one word. It’s called ‘ICO’ (Initial Coin Offering). Remember those words, because right now, that’s going to be your best friend. Mr ICO has been my very generous friend the past 7 months and has been gifting me with millions. And he can be your friend too. THE ICO GAME. ICO’s stand for ‘Initial Coin Offering‘ which is sort of like the cryptocurrency version of an IPO, minus the regulations (for now). ICOs are, at least in current market conditions, are the best way to make money with cryptocurrencies, hands down, feet first. I can’t say if the ICO gold rush will last for more than a few months and span the entire 2018 and beyond, but at least right now the market is red hot for ICO’s. I expect this to change within the next 3 to 6 months, so this guide may not be so relevant when those changes occur, either due to market sentiment, a market correction, or the implementation of regulations ICO across the world. So how can you make ridiculous amounts of money with cryptocurrency? Two ways. 1. Buy strong coins and hold them for months / years or, 2. ICO’s. My strategy has been the #2 option. Why the ICO? Simple.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben krypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T09:29:32.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "187af0519d8de5d1997450b2a32f0a8f9b5bc056", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vx79qQA0aPSFtmNnY1UZNmmgYvmuj99hXbxPRqAMzn0Jxi2R3ccMo2zMT4ti2JH_nCZQZPPSIhvnviy.xIL_Ay3", "site_full": "ledgergazette.com", "site": "ledgergazette.com", "site_section": "http://ledgergazette.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Ledger Gazette", "title": "First Bitcoin Trading 5.4% Lower Over Last Week (BIT)", "title_full": "First Bitcoin Trading 5.4% Lower Over Last Week (BIT)", "published": "2018-06-05T09:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1323.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "187af0519d8de5d1997450b2a32f0a8f9b5bc056", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vx79qQA0aPSFtmNnY1UZNmmgYvmuj99hXbxPRqAMzn0Jxi2R3ccMo2zMT4ti2JH_nCZQZPPSIhvnviy.xIL_Ay3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jennifer Salazar", "published": "2018-06-05T09:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "First Bitcoin Trading 5.4% Lower Over Last Week (BIT)", "text": "Posted by Jennifer Salazar on Jun 5th, 2018 // No Comments\nFirst Bitcoin (CURRENCY:BIT) traded down 21% against the U.S. dollar during the 24 hour period ending at 20:00 PM Eastern on May 28th.

PUBLISHED: 07:09, Tue, Jun 5, 2018 | UPDATED: 07:12, Tue, Jun 5, 2018 0\nSpeaking to CNBC , the technology guru said bitcoin could slowly go back up in value and compared the cryptocurrency to the internet bubble of the late 1990s.\nMr Wozniak said: “I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe that it’s going to happen but because I want it to be that way.\n“That is so pure thinking.\n“Bitcoin, because it’s regulated in its quantity, you get down to supply and demand.\n“And there’s more and more people who want it and demand it and there was a hype going on for a period and it went up to $20,000 then down, I don’t know where it is because I never track it. CNBC•GETTY Bitcoin news: Apple CEO hopes cryptocurrency will we world's single currency in ten years\n“But if the demand increases and it becomes more and more popular for more things and people start using it, there is no extra supply. It’s limited.\n“In terms of dollars bitcoin will go up and up overtime.\n“And it won’t happen fast, it may be sloppy at first and things that change so much in life take a very long time to change, they tend to go slowly.\n“We had a crash in the internet age and I see that going on with a lot of blockchain things including bitcoin itself right now.\n“Blockchain in all forms is so popular and being studied by so many people and in demand by so many companies to look into changing their businesses in the future, it may be long term. People have to have their mindset change Steve Wozniak\n“I do see it as a bubble in the sense there is a huge amount of interest in it right now, but things aren’t going to change that rapidly, that’s what the internet bubble was all about.”\nThe tech pioneer argued people will have to change their mindset just like they did when internet was introduced, to truly see the future of the blockchain technology.\nHe said: “People have to have their mindset change, culture and tradition and status quo and the way things are doesn’t change that rapidly when it’s that huge.”\nIn May, Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey declared his hope Bitcoin will continue to establish itself as a primary method of payments.\nHe said: \"I hope it will be bitcoin.

There was a break below a major bullish trend line with support at $1,140 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $1,070 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average to avoid more losses. Advertisements\nBitcoin cash price trimmed most of its gains against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is now below $1,140 and is struggling to hold the 100 hourly SMA. Advertisements Bitcoin Cash Price Support\nAfter trading above the $1,200 level, bitcoin cash price faced sellers against the US Dollar. The price formed a top at $1,209 and started a downside move. It broke a few important support near the $1,180 and $1,140 levels. Moreover, there was even a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,057 low to $1,209 high.\nThe slide was substantial as the price moved below the $1,100 support. More importantly, there was a break below a major bullish trend line with support at $1,140 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is currently trading just above the $1,070 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The stated $1,070 level already acted as a strong support once, which is why it holds a lot of importance. If the price fails to stay above $1,070 and the 100 hourly SMA, there could be more declines towards $1,040 and $1,000.\nLooking at the chart, the next major support sits near the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last leg from the $1,057 low to $1,209 high at $1,020. Therefore, the price must hold the 100 hourly SMA and $1,070 to avoid more slides.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slightly in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is moving lower towards the 30 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,070", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto |", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T09:12:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7432ca28fc70a2027cc42983d92a13ced63f9327", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC1e1gMAlRh6JvqSisZyQsGXs30BSUCw2WI48cBMTV1SKeNoG8044JG2Z4sV2x9ot6Zd0Z45MSmLhkBLGZkgjCaUIqtR7Ym0MJrU_T73gQdJ8", "site_full": "www.newsr.in", "site": "newsr.in", "site_section": "https://www.newsr.in/latest/Technology.htm", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Technology: newsR", "title": "A secretive Chicago trading firm has built a bitcoin platform that shows crypto is shaking off its scrappy roots", "title_full": "A secretive Chicago trading firm has built a bitcoin platform that shows crypto is shaking off its scrappy roots - newsR", "published": "2018-06-05T09:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.newsserve.net/700/i/20180605/1521-secretive-Chicago-trading-firm-has-built.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7432ca28fc70a2027cc42983d92a13ced63f9327", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC1e1gMAlRh6JvqSisZyQsGXs30BSUCw2WI48cBMTV1SKeNoG8044JG2Z4sV2x9ot6Zd0Z45MSmLhkBLGZkgjCaUIqtR7Ym0MJrU_T73gQdJ8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsr.in", "published": "2018-06-05T09:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A secretive Chicago trading firm has built a bitcoin platform that shows crypto is shaking off its scrappy roots", "text": "Milton Friedman\n 15 hours ago )\n· *Jump Trading, a Chicago-based firm, has built an OTC platform for electronic bitcoin trading, according to people familiar with the matter. *\n· *Its graphics user interface, or GUI, allows it to trade with counterparties electronically in a way that leaves a clear audit trail and records, rather than via phones or ... 👓 View full article", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.onenewspage.com/n/Technology/1zj8fyl8bc/secretive-Chicago-trading-firm-has-built.htm"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "milton friedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gui", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T04:31:08.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2b0a5605b389485f68785bcc0acac6a3583bc6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQjC5mASVQSiKX16BXEf2sVKW8Ehe40qkP48fIex52BsuXgU325RZl", "site_full": "hugopress.com", "site": "hugopress.com", "site_section": "https://hugopress.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Hugo Press", "title": "Global Bitcoin Market 2018 – 37coins, Airbitz, ANX, Bitwata, BIPS, Bitcoin Susse AG, Blockchain.info, Blockstream, CEX.IO, ChangeTip", "title_full": "Global Bitcoin Market 2018 – 37coins, Airbitz, ANX, Bitwata, BIPS, Bitcoin Susse AG, Blockchain.info, Blockstream, CEX.IO, ChangeTip", "published": "2018-06-05T08:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2b0a5605b389485f68785bcc0acac6a3583bc6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQjC5mASVQSiKX16BXEf2sVKW8Ehe40qkP48fIex52BsuXgU325RZl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Oscar", "published": "2018-06-05T08:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Global Bitcoin Market 2018 – 37coins, Airbitz, ANX, Bitwata, BIPS, Bitcoin Susse AG, Blockchain.info, Blockstream, CEX.IO, ChangeTip", "text": "Global Bitcoin Market 2018 – 37coins, Airbitz, ANX, Bitwata, BIPS, Bitcoin Susse AG, Blockchain.info, Blockstream, CEX.IO, ChangeTip By 0 1\n“Global Bitcoin Market Size, Status and Forecast 2025 provides Market information about industry Top Key Players, Countries, Type and Application.

At the current time, Bitcoin price trend still dominates the market trend.\nHowever, Bitcoin leading position seems to be doubtable as Altcoins have recorded a stronger rise recently and the market is less affected by Bitcoin. Instead of following the general price trend of bitcoin, many cryptocurrencies also start to follow their own trajectory.\nThis week, the altcoin works much better than both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The added value of the ERC20 tokens and the increasing demand for small cryptocurrencies of investors in the global market has proved that Crypto investors are more confident in betting their money on this market.\nSaxo Investment Bank from Danish, with its aim to focus on online trading and investment, has announced in a recent report that the capital inflows from organizations to the Crypto market will lead to a rise in prices for most of these currencies.\nIt's still too early to claim things. Bitcoin as of now is an average coin with a very big userbase making it one of the biggest established coins up to date. On the other hand, some altcoins are better than bitcoin. However, not all of them are crowdfunded and some, unfortunately even die because of poor crowdfunding. The altcoin industry is a survival of the fittest environment. If your altcoin is mediocre, don't expect to become big. Maybe in the future there will be an established coin from the altcoin industry, the possibilities are endless.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:22:57.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "058964a32082aa96d42eb214ff2eaefb21f9ac58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY8A1QtNzc_pOK8wyuBLqUY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What do you think about Bitcoin future?", "title_full": "What do you think about Bitcoin future?", "published": "2018-06-05T08:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.054, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "058964a32082aa96d42eb214ff2eaefb21f9ac58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY8A1QtNzc_pOK8wyuBLqUY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cherryfer", "published": "2018-06-05T08:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "What do you think about Bitcoin future?", "text": "Quote: from: uPrefer on June 04, 2018, 07:51:47 AM Talk\nBitcoin future is more adoption of people because of it's brilliant price we are experienced now of the worst situation of price but every now and then who knows we are amaze to the delightful amazing changes of Bitcoin. we are eager to get a good value but and i think before the end of 2018 The price value of bitcoin has change an going back to the higher price and I know that volume of user are come up and much more competitive because of current experienced like this.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T13:47:52.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "727c9babd69317398fc6b76180b0867f92110791", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfV0il9so_ijAxgX3SK6o7Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "How to get 1 bitcoin for free without attachments - a complete guide.", "title_full": "How to get 1 bitcoin for free without attachments - a complete guide.", "published": "2018-06-05T08:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "727c9babd69317398fc6b76180b0867f92110791", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfV0il9so_ijAxgX3SK6o7Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "uozer", "published": "2018-06-05T08:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to get 1 bitcoin for free without attachments - a complete guide.", "text": "The Topic of your Thread is zealously catching the attention of everyone that comes by.

Last month, he said that he believes the project could become the next Apple in terms of its status in the tech sector.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nThe post I Want Bitcoin to Be the World’s Single Currency: Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aNfu7ZVRsw7RpGnxMDSwKg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5a186d297efe8dd6b8c1902f6cd7e45a", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html", "https://www.ccn.com/apple-co-founder-wozniak-bitcoin-better-gold/", "https://www.ccn.com/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-lost-7-btc-to-scam-artist-with-stolen-credit-card/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/apple-co-founder-wozniak-bitcoin-better-gold/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-lost-7-btc-to-scam-artist-with-stolen-credit-card/", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-will-be-worlds-leading-currency-in-10-years-square-ceo-jack-dorsey/", "https://www.ccn.com/i-want-bitcoin-to-be-the-worlds-single-currency-apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak/&quot;", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/ethereum-could-be-the-next-apple-steve-wozniak/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-will-be-worlds-leading-currency-in-10-years-square-ceo-jack-dorsey/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/ethereum-could-be-the-next-apple-steve-wozniak/", "https://www.ccn.com/i-want-bitcoin-to-be-the-worlds-single-currency-apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve wozniak steve wozniak", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T03:37:10.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e0b8b51238ef29996a8c7bab7c5e9273eaf6a27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFQYIfJetSw7ll.Z0p3.J2VIYihqFpoKSZj_6FZZ0SPSyhFAsduhOayr7j9Bsti812AktFpn_4QJb", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Missoula County looks to limit Bitcoin operations", "title_full": "Missoula County looks to limit Bitcoin operations", "published": "2018-06-05T08:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/5b15d0e2710bc.image_-1024x576.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e0b8b51238ef29996a8c7bab7c5e9273eaf6a27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFQYIfJetSw7ll.Z0p3.J2VIYihqFpoKSZj_6FZZ0SPSyhFAsduhOayr7j9Bsti812AktFpn_4QJb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-06-05T08:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Missoula County looks to limit Bitcoin operations", "text": "Missoula County looks to limit Bitcoin operations by 0\nPrivacy Policy Jim Howard, the superintendent of Bonner School District, points to Spokane LLC’s bitcoin data center at the Bonner Mill in 2017.

On Monday, commissioners said they don’t know what action, if any, they’ll take on the measure.\nBut they hope that public comments made at the meeting will help chart a path forward amid concerns over noise, the amount of energy used by the cryptocurrency mining operations, and how that energy consumption could affect consumers. I want to hear the pros and cons,” Commissioner Cola Rowley said.\nThey’re worried it would limit expansion possibilities, and that it would regulate a particular type of business. “To be blunt, the potential for this interim zoning — they are significantly concerned with it,” Bowditch told the commissioners.\n“They’re worried about the breadth and authority to regulate businesses through zoning.” Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009, and is the most widely used. Mining involves using large blocks of computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, and successful miners are paid in cryptocurrency and listed on digital public transaction ledgers.

While the invention of Bitcoin may cast a little doubt on the certainty of taxes, death remains sadly inevitable. However, one consolation of mortality is the ability to pass on one’s values, knowledge and accumulated wealth to others.\nWhen it comes to passing the baton of wealth to loved ones or favored projects, even here some governments demand their cut. Estate or inheritance taxes are perhaps the most odious of all taxes, combining death and taxes into a single grim package and turning bereavement into a financial windfall for the state.\nFortunately, Bitcoin offers the opportunity to pass on wealth in an untaxed form, at least until legislators start drawing up crypto estate tax laws… So, while Bitcoin greatly aids the possibility of building multi-generational wealth, doing so effectively requires a well-formulated process and a degree of crypto-financial knowledge on the part of the inheritors. Planning\nDistributing crypto assets via a third party will only work if the executor of your instructions is able to perform the necessary actions. This means they’ll need two things: Access to all relevant private keys, passwords, seed phrases, exchange accounts, software or hardware wallets, and everything else needed to distribute your assets. Comprehensive knowledge of how to handle all the above.\nIf your chosen executor has incomplete access or lacks familiarity with cryptocurrency, a regrettable outcome is likely.\nThe steep cryptocurrency learning curve means that the traditional choice of executor – a trusted lawyer – is less than ideal (unless they’re familiar with crypto). While a lawyer should be tremendously helpful with the rest of your will, you should arrange the cryptocurrency distribution personally or entrust it to a reliable crypto expert.\nKeep in mind that if you don’t create a workable plan, it’s highly likely that the people you intend to receive your cryptocurrency will be completely unable to access it. Unlike traditional assets, a court has no power to distribute your cryptocurrency holdings should you pass on without a will in place. Unless you make some provision to share your private keys and passwords when you’re gone, your former coins will remain locked up forever. Key Considerations\nYour inheritors will only be able to access crypto assets which they know about it. This means you need to lay out a detailed “map” to where all your assets are held. The best way to do this is to compose a message to each of your heirs, describing all relevant assets and how to access them.\nKeep in mind that the message and any sensitive information which it contains (such as private keys, device locations and passwords) it contains, may be intercepted if sent via email or the postal service. Unless your intended heirs are familiar with public key cryptography as a means to securely transmit messages, it’s probably best to store your messages with a trusted executor or within a sealed safe, to be accessed only in the event of your passing.\nIn terms of assets, there are 5 major possibilities to consider: 1) Exchange Wallets\nAlthough far from the recommended storage method, coins you’re actively trading coins may be located on exchanges . In this case, case you’ll need to share the exchange’s name, URL and your login details with heirs.\nKeep in mind the necessity of also granting access to applicable 2 factor authentication devices. This means you’ll also need to share access info for any 2FA devices related to the exchange, such as the PIN for a phone or the login details to an email account.\nWarning: Phones which use facial recognition or fingerprint authentication for access control could be a major problem. While bypassing these measures is possible, it’s complex.\nIf contacted under normal circumstances, an exchange’s support staff should allow 2FA to be reset or bypassed, however this could prove to be a very troublesome process in the case of inheritance. Without a legally-enforceable will which explicitly states that inheritors have access to your account, an exchange’s support staff could deny your heir’s request to remove 2FA obstructions. 2) Hot Wallets\nWhile you can point heirs to wallets installed on your computer, phone or other devices, access to such devices may prove inconvenient method for distant heirs. Seed Phrase Backups\nFurther coins may be held in software wallets. Most modern wallets, including Bitcoin Core 0.16 and later versions, use a seed phrase for backup purposes rather than a wallet.dat file.\nA mnemonic or seed phrase is far easier and safer for your heirs to use to recover your coins. Seed phrases can be easily transcribed onto physical media which can be stored in a safe, vault or similar secure place. Paper seed phrase backups are a possibility but rather too easily damaged by fire, flood and the like. As a superior solution, we’d recommend the CryptoSteel or any other highly-resilient seed backup method. Engraving or stamping your own stainless steel plates can also work well.\nIf you encrypt your seed phrase with a password, as described in the BIP39 standard, ensure that you also record this password along with the phrase itself. Without this password, the seed phrase is useless. Wallet.dat Backups\nUnless you extract the private keys from the wallet.dat – something which requires a fair degree of technical competence and will prove burdensome to restore for heirs unfamiliar with crypto – then wallet.dat backup files need to be stored on digital media.\nDigital storage is risky, as all storage media (USB sticks, DVDs, hard drives, etc.) is fragile and unstable over a long timeframe. If your current Bitcoin or altcoin wallet(s) use a wallet.dat file, consider upgrading to an HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet which uses a seed phrase instead.\nFor a better understanding of Bitcoin wallets watch this video . 3) Online Wallet Backups\nOnline wallets are not ideal for storage of significant value, due to the custodial risks (i.e. the site also has access to your private key…). Online wallets will generally provide a seed phrase for backup purposes, which should be handled as described above in 2).\nWhile the seed phrase can be restored to any compatible Bitcoin wallet, heirs may find it easier to skip the restoration process and use the online wallet directly. In this case, you should provide access details as described in 1) above – keep in mind potential 2FA problems.\nAn online wallet should be treated the same as an exchange wallet; keep in mind the 2FA challenges. 4) Hardware Wallets\nWe regularly recommend hardware wallets for people wanting to securely store their cryptocurrency. Hardware wallets make it easy for newcomers to achieve a very high-security standard. This makes them ideal to transfer cryptocurrency to your heirs, particular those unfamiliar with crypto… The last thing you’d want is to leave a valuable amount of crypto to a loved one, only for it to get stolen due to unfamiliarity with proper security measures.\nBequeathing a hardware wallet is fairly easy, as it’s a physical device which can be placed in a safe. The hardware wallet’s PIN code and password (if set) should be transferred too. With this information, your heir can then use the hardware wallet directly.\nHowever, it’s not essential that the device itself, nor its PIN or password, be transferred to your inheritor. Provided you arrange for them to receive the hardware wallet’s seed phrase (which you should have securely backed up in any case, as a matter of priority), they’ll be able to restore any coins controlled by the device to any Bitcoin wallet of their choice.\nFor safety’s sake, it’s best for your heir to receive everything; device, PIN, password and most importantly, seed phrase. 5) Paper Wallets\nDue to the difficulty of securely creating and properly managing a paper wallet, this cold storage method is best left to experts. Unless your heir is very well-versed in the technical aspects of Bitcoin, we don’t recommend this method.\nThe major problem with paper wallets is that, in order to spend from them, you need to import the private key they hold into an online hot wallet. If less than the full amount contained by the paper wallet’s private key is then spent, the “change” will return to an address controlled by the hot wallet and unassociated with the address of the paper wallet.\nThe security of the paper wallet (assuming it was created properly and there was any security to begin with) will also be potentially compromised by entering the private into a hot wallet.\nPaper wallets are a deceptively simple means to leave money to an heir; just tell them where to find the paper wallet. However, in practice they’re likely to lead to problems for any heir who’s not a crypto expert. While you could leave detailed instructions on the proper use of paper wallets, it’s probably a lot easier to transfer your cold storage funds to a hardware wallet instead. Single vs. Multiple Heirs\nThe above guidelines will work best with a single heir or multiple heirs whose cooperation can be relied upon. In the case of multiple uncooperative heirs, the best approach will likely be to set aside the intended amount for each heir in separate wallets.\nIf you want an in-depth guide for planning your crypto inheritance you can also find dedicated guides on Amazon.

Price is at a crucial area of interest, though, and a bounce or break could determine the next long-term direction. If these support levels hold, bitcoin could bounce back to the swing high and resume the reversal. Bitcoin price is pulling back to an area of interest after breaking above a longer-term descending trend line.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This suggests that the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has fallen below the longer-term 200 SMA as an early indicator that bearish momentum is kicking in.\nRSI is indicating oversold conditions, though, so a bounce may be in order. Stochastic has already climbed out of the oversold area to show that buyers are ready to return. A larger pullback to the broken trend line closer to the 61.8% Fib may be the last line of defense for bulls, and a break below this could lead to a drop to the swing low.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin was off to a promising start for the week but it looks like bulls were unable to sustain the momentum as investor worries lingered. Not even remarks from Steve Wozniak on how bitcoin is the only digital gold were able to help. He cited:\nAll the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That's the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.\nStill, the dollar managed to recoup its losses in the latest US session, likely on the bounce in equities. Trump and Kim Jong-Un are still a go with their meeting on June 12 and this is giving dollar bulls optimism at the moment.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Return in Full Swing! appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T07:52:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "532b509fde79e7d6239b9a4ed8887ee1715e87f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY7muKyJ93NK2K1CPruRz3kFpgeVMzoHL9g4blTYD8iZeLSLjto7FImc6Iho579mWVQ--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: Can BCH/USD Hold 100 SMA?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: Can BCH/USD Hold 100 SMA?", "published": "2018-06-05T07:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "532b509fde79e7d6239b9a4ed8887ee1715e87f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY7muKyJ93NK2K1CPruRz3kFpgeVMzoHL9g4blTYD8iZeLSLjto7FImc6Iho579mWVQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T07:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: Can BCH/USD Hold 100 SMA?", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price started a downside correction from $1,200 and declined below $1,100 against the US Dollar. There was a break below a major bullish trend line with support at $1,140 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $1,070 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average to avoid more losses. Bitcoin cash price trimmed most of its gains against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is now below $1,140 and is struggling to hold the 100 hourly SMA.\nBitcoin Cash Price Support After trading above the $1,200 level , bitcoin cash price faced sellers against the US Dollar. The price formed a top at $1,209 and started a downside move. It broke a few important support near the $1,180 and $1,140 levels. Moreover, there was even a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,057 low to $1,209 high.\nThe slide was substantial as the price moved below the $1,100 support. More importantly, there was a break below a major bullish trend line with support at $1,140 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is currently trading just above the $1,070 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The stated $1,070 level already acted as a strong support once, which is why it holds a lot of importance. If the price fails to stay above $1,070 and the 100 hourly SMA, there could be more declines towards $1,040 and $1,000.\nLooking at the chart , the next major support sits near the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last leg from the $1,057 low to $1,209 high at $1,020. Therefore, the price must hold the 100 hourly SMA and $1,070 to avoid more slides.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slightly in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is moving lower towards the 30 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,070\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,140\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: Can BCH/USD Hold 100 SMA? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T07:52:35.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d90c8a0b43376b21288e0ffc40a45e1e0b718078", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtHV8I7684MJRzaGEelYraTZJLzYjDc71g1oIe_aB4yexf5tJaiUfRhQK6JTeekfmhnbREjkN2FXjQc230f7ug4bkfjmKXdRz8XFxPD_UTGVjA--", "site_full": "www.startup365.fr", "site": "startup365.fr", "site_section": "http://www.startup365.fr/feed/", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Startup 365", "title": "#Blockchain Russian Court Annuls Previous Decision to Block Bitcoin-Related Site", "title_full": "#Blockchain Russian Court Annuls Previous Decision to Block Bitcoin-Related Site", "published": "2018-06-05T07:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/528_aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9lMmVjYTUxZWY2ZWYzYmRkMDlhOGU1OWE4NmZkMmQxNC5qcGc=.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d90c8a0b43376b21288e0ffc40a45e1e0b718078", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtHV8I7684MJRzaGEelYraTZJLzYjDc71g1oIe_aB4yexf5tJaiUfRhQK6JTeekfmhnbREjkN2FXjQc230f7ug4bkfjmKXdRz8XFxPD_UTGVjA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Startup365", "published": "2018-06-05T07:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "#Blockchain Russian Court Annuls Previous Decision to Block Bitcoin-Related Site", "text": "#Blockchain Russian Court Annuls Previous Decision to Block Bitcoin-Related Site Posted on by Startup365\nA Russian Court has overturned a previous court’s decision to block crypto media website Bitcoininfo ahead of new crypto regulations\nfrom Cointelegraph.com News https://ift.tt/2Jh2Egf Russian Court Annuls Previous Decision to Block Bitcoin-Related Site This entry was posted in Blockchain News and tagged Cointelegraph.com News , Russian Court Annuls Previous Decision to Block Bitcoin-Related Site by Startup365 .

The proposed machine for purifying water has little, if anything, to do with blockchain, and the company refused to provide any precise details on how it would manufacture these machines. Based on this supposed solution to India’s water crisis, Aquaoin has been promoting an upcoming “crowd sale” of its cryptocurrency from 9 to 15 June—but the fact that several team members of the company have past links to questionable cryptocurrency schemes raises concerns about this crowd-funding campaign.\nInnovation through blockchain—the underlying technical structure of cryptocurrencies, including the first one ever, bitcoin—has been especially in vogue lately, with the technology being applied to solve problems in healthcare, insurance and finance, among other sectors. Blockchain allows users to store data in a secure digital record that is shared across a network of computers and continuously aggregated, which typically makes it impossible for any part of that data to be altered. But the blockchain-oriented aspect of Aquaoin’s plans has nothing to do with its promised silver bullet—the supposed “state-of-the-art” water-recycling machines.\nAquaoin seems to use vagueness and secrecy to its advantage. The company’s proposals are available on its website in a whitepaper —a document that functions as a pitch to potential investors—which explains its plans on “generating revenue to commission a Research and Development (R&D) infrastructure” to create the water-recycling machine. But there is no evidence revealed in the whitepaper, on Aquaoin’s website , or during my conversations with three of its members, to indicate that the company has conducted any substantial work on its project. Moreover, at least two of Aquaoin’s team members have links to fraudulent or dubious investment schemes, including those run by the bitcoin entrepreneur Amit Bhardwaj. It goes to show that despite recent steps that India has taken to punish and curb fraud with cryptocurrencies—such as Bhardwaj’s arrest, and the Reserve Bank of India’s imposition of restrictive regulations to banking transactions involving cryptocurrencies—crypto-related scams still pose risks to Indian investors.\nAquaoin is in the process of launching an initial coin offering, or ICO: a crowd-funding method where participants make investments using cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency as well as a computing platform on which anyone can release a cryptocurrency token—a unit of value that companies issue to investors in ICOs, similar to the first sale of shares of a company during its initial public offer. To purchase AQN—the token that Aquaoin is issuing, which is released on the ethereum platform—investors must pay in either bitcoin or ethereum. According to a roadmap on the company’s website , the upcoming crowd sale will be the third stage of its ICO, following the website launch on 22 April, and a “presale” conducted in the first week of May. It proposes to begin the distribution of its “supplies to India and countries of Southeast Asia” in September–December 2019.\nJohn David, the chief operating officer of Aquaoin, who is based in Malaysia, told me he was the founder and chief executive officer of two consultancy companies, Asia Blockchain Solutions and Cryptotech and Consultancy Limited, in which he helps educate and advise people about cryptocurrency. “The public may not be able to understand what to look for in an ICO,” he said. “This is where our services come in.” When I asked him how to identify scams, he mentioned plagiarism in whitepapers as an important indicator: “When we do a study, we even look at whether they copy the whitepaper from any other whitepaper.”\nHe claimed that Aquaoin’s whitepaper had undergone “a stringent screening by all the advisory.” But a cursory search of the text of Aquaoin’s whitepaper reveals that it is heavily plagiarised. It lifts substantial passages—on occasions, series of paragraphs— about India’s water crisis from several sources, including the Financial Express , the Indo-Asian News Service , SmartInvestor.in , Euromonitor International and the Times of India.\nAquaoin’s website lists the names and designations of ten members of the company, and an examination of this list, too, raises significant cause for concern. Not one of the ten members listed on Aquaoin’s website is a scientist or an expert in water-related issues. When I pressed Rai to tell me how much research had been done, he said “35, 40 percent”—but when I asked him to name the individual scientists and technologists behind the technological breakthroughs they were claiming, he said, “No no no, we cannot say.” He added that Aquaoin would release more information about its technology after the crowd sale. John David, confirming this, said, “If we let known this information much earlier, it is easy for even other competitors or other projects to compete or copy what we are doing.” It is unclear how releasing the names of individual scientists would jeopardise Aquaoin’s product.\nThe composition of Aquaoin’s advisory board is the primary concern. The media advisor Rai, for instance, has worked with Bhardwaj—whose fraudulent activities through the company Gainbitcoin I wrote about in the March 2017 cover story for The Caravan . This April, Indian authorities arrested Bhardwaj while he was absconding in Thailand. Most reports about Bhardwaj have pegged the total value of his scam at Rs 2,000 crore, but some go much higher; the Pune Mirror noted that investigators looking into Bhardwaj’s case had said he could have committed fraud worth Rs 35,000 crore. John David told me that Bhardwaj was not involved with Aquaoin. He said, “If those such people are involved, I think personally I may not want to be in this project.”\nRai was a promoter for Amit Bhardwaj’s MCAP, a fraudulent ICO that I reported on in August 2017 for The Caravan . To advertise the ICO, Bhardwaj wrote an e-book called Cryptocurrency for Beginners , for which he was able to get full-page ads published on the front pages of several national Indian newspapers. Almost a year ago, Rai posted a photograph of one of these ads from his LinkedIn account, writing an accompanying message saying that anyone looking to seek more information about MCAP should send him a message. In November 2017, the value of MCAP tokens crashed , leaving its investors holding crypto-assets worth almost nothing.\nPhotographs posted to Rai’s Facebook page in September 2017 show him and Bhardwaj sitting across from one another in an office in the Burj Khalifa—the tallest building in the world, located in Dubai, where Bhardwaj was living. According to an April 2018 report on the technology-news website Factor Daily, the Pune cyber-crime department investigating Bhardwaj’s case believes that he had bought office space in the skyscraper. In conversation, Rai insisted that the members listed on the Aquaoin website were only “service providers” of the company, while the founders remained behind the scenes. “Some two, three founders are there,” he said, though he refused to disclose their identities. One of them, he said, was a “very big man from the Dubai, Abu Dhabi” area.\nIn October 2017, Rai started his own cryptocurrency exchange—Ethxpay, registered by the ministry of corporate affairs as Etherex Infotech Private Limited. Of the 18 reviews on the Ethxpay Facebook page, six are one-star reviews that claim the exchange is a “fake” or “scam.” One of these reviewers is Shahnawaz Khan, a student at Aligarh Muslim University. Khan told me that he made an Ethxpay account in January, initially investing only a small amount of ethereum in order to gauge the site’s trustworthiness. Ethxpay’s site had allowed him to exchange his ethereum for other cryptocurrencies, he said, but “the problem started when I made a withdrawal request.” After it became clear his requests were not going through, he complained to Subharansh Rai and Ethxpay’s support staff, but the issue was not resolved. Rai stopped answering his calls, Khan said, and his Ethxpay account was blocked. “They are running a fake exchange to scam people,” Khan said. (He also showed me screenshots he had taken from his Ethxpay account in February.)\nWhen I asked Rai about circumstances under which Ethxpay might prohibit a user from withdrawing and cancel their account, he said there could be “N-number of reasons” for the exchange doing so. Perhaps, he said, a user’s Know Your Customer documents were not complete, or the company detected multiple accounts being created from the same IP address. He added, “I don’t think anyone can satisfy 100 percent of people.”\nAbhishek Bhandari, who is listed on Aquaoin’s website as its research-and-marketing advisor, was a director in Power Hashing—another company that I reported on for the cover story, which ran a questionable cryptocurrency investment scheme similar to Bhardwaj’s. When I met him in 2017, he described Power Hashing as a cryptocurrency consultancy and education service. When I later followed up with him after seeing major similarities between Gainbitcoin and Power Hashing’s business propositions, Bhandari did not respond to my messages. In the year since, numerous accounts and analyses have been posted online declaring Power Hashing to be a Ponzi scam, just like Gainbitcoin. There is no mention of Power Hashing anywhere on Bhandari’s LinkedIn page, which is directly linked to the Aquaoin website. In early June, when I asked Bhandari what happened to Power Hashing, he said, “Yeah it did not go well.” He claimed that he and his team had ended operations around a year ago.\nAquaoin’s policy advisor, Rakesh Shukla, has been an assistant director for the Associated Chambers of Commerce of India, or ASSOCHAM, which has previously held extremely bullish conferences on cryptocurrency, sponsored by Gainbitcoin and Power Hashing. In March last year, The Caravan published my report on one such conference , which prominently featured speakers from both companies. ASSOCHAM’s leadership has since taken a much more circumspect view on cryptocurrency—in December last year, its secretary general stated that, because cryptocurrency was so unregulated, ICOs should be banned in order to prevent frauds. The next month, however, Rakesh Shukla helped organise an ASSOCHAM conference on cryptocurrency , of which Ethxpay was a sponsor, and Subharansh Rai a speaker. Shukla did not respond to requests for an interview.\nWhen I asked John David about his team members’ previous association with dubious cryptocurrency schemes, he told me he had a “personal relationship” with Rai, and that he was “not so sure about the rest of them, with whatever programme they were with before.” He said, “I know Subharansh for quite some time, and I do know that he has been involved in certain kind of, what to say, schemes.” But he added, “I think we also have to look into the timeline of when these things happened.”\nIn early April this year, the RBI announced strict regulations to cryptocurrency , forbidding banks from providing services to any person or company dealing with digital currencies. Rai told me these regulations would not affect Aquaoin at all, because the company was registered in Singapore. “You don’t transact anything into INR, you don’t have any government processes, certifications you need.” Once their water-recycling machines came to market, he said—“then you go for any certifications, and you treat yourself as an FMCG”—fast-moving consumer goods—“industry, not a crypto industry.”\nBut Arvind Ravindranathan, a lawyer with the Technology Media and Telecom team at Nishith Desi Associates—India’s premier law firm for cryptocurrency-related matters—said otherwise. He told me that individuals who purchased AQN tokens by using Indian rupees after the introduction of these regulations “run the risk of having their accounts blocked” by their banks, as did individuals who were working for the company in India. Ravindranath emphasised that the regulations only empowered banks to enforce them, but could not lead to any other civil or criminal liability against individuals. Though Rai claimed that Aquaoin would evade any consequence from the RBI regulations, he also told me that they had reduced Ethxpay’s marketing push to almost “zero.” “We cannot do anything,” he said. “We do not have options to take bank transfers these days.”\nJohn David rued the RBI’s move; “Because of the government’s uncertainties in this area, a lot of the innovation is actually moving out from India,” he said. “I would say this is a real waste.” Referring to his consultancy services, he said, “I think this is what we need in India—a lot of forums, a lot of public trainings to help people understand not to get involved in scams, but to get involved in some genuine projects.”\nAria Thaker is a copy editor at The Caravan .

Trading with a moving average system is dependent on the traders preference. If you do not understand the best way you personally should be trading, you are likely setting yourself up for failure from the beginning. I recommend you read \"Trading for a Living\" Dr. Van K Tharpe\nThere are hundreds of books written on trading with moving averages. There is no rule that works 100% of the time. 10 and 21 is traditionally used by institutions, but that does not mean you can't be successful with a 20 or 30.\nYou need to play with a moving average combination that works for you, and your personal trading style. I highly recommend paper trading you strategy before trading live with actual Bitcoin.\nThe biggest thing you need to figure out, is what type of trader you are, and the frequency of trades you want to be taking. If you are a day trader the 1 and 15 min may be what you need. If you are looking for a trade maybe once a week, the 5 and 10 might work. If you are looking to take trades over the course of weeks, 10 and 20 on daily chart. If you want a few trades a year 50 and 150 daily. Trading all of these time frames, could be over whelming, and just result in losses.\nAny moving average combination can be used by any trader provided 1.) They are disciplined in the strategy 2.) Have back tested the strategy 3.) Have appropriate risk management\nIf you can not explain to someone exactly how your strategy approaches all three of the above points, you need to stop focusing on the moving average pair you are trading, and reevaluate what your trading strategy is.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "van k tharpe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T08:03:48.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f063c1ab5634ded92fa255049fa17184bb1f0e0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9x4zFn9cvQioC0JCxKsrSWMCP.1kbMzq9xhg4nRxTtnFYZ6Sg3IPJdL9i__2bE_yqzJIjDUS.bEmr9wwcUpg_mS4Jd8wsYqgI_4.Tl.mJlULUmLjuzglluVdH_biRl6eZf.2jfCSS70Q--", "site_full": "www.txwclp.org", "site": "txwclp.org", "site_section": "http://www.txwclp.org/feed", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Williamson County Libertarian Party", "title": "Ep. 1171 The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking", "title_full": "Ep. 1171 The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking", "published": "2018-06-05T07:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f063c1ab5634ded92fa255049fa17184bb1f0e0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9x4zFn9cvQioC0JCxKsrSWMCP.1kbMzq9xhg4nRxTtnFYZ6Sg3IPJdL9i__2bE_yqzJIjDUS.bEmr9wwcUpg_mS4Jd8wsYqgI_4.Tl.mJlULUmLjuzglluVdH_biRl6eZf.2jfCSS70Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rbutler", "published": "2018-06-05T07:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ep. 1171 The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking", "text": "Join Bob Murphy and me for our 2018 cruise , featuring special guests and tons of fun!

There was a break below a major bullish trend line with support at $1,140 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $1,070 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average to avoid more losses.\nBitcoin cash price trimmed most of its gains against the US Dollar. BCH\\/USD is now below $1,140 and is struggling to hold the 100 hourly SMA. Bitcoin Cash Price Support\nAfter trading above the $1,200 level , bitcoin cash price faced sellers against the US Dollar. The price formed a top at $1,209 and started a downside move. It broke a few important support near the $1,180 and $1,140 levels. Moreover, there was even a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,057 low to $1,209 high.\nThe slide was substantial as the price moved below the $1,100 support. More importantly, there was a break below a major bullish trend line with support at $1,140 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. The pair is currently trading just above the $1,070 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The stated $1,070 level already acted as a strong support once, which is why it holds a lot of importance. If the price fails to stay above $1,070 and the 100 hourly SMA, there could be more declines towards $1,040 and $1,000.\nLooking at the chart , the next major support sits near the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last leg from the $1,057 low to $1,209 high at $1,020. Therefore, the price must hold the 100 hourly SMA and $1,070 to avoid more slides.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is slightly in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is moving lower towards the 30 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $1,070\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,140\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: Can BCH\\/USD Hold 100 SMA? appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T19:59:01.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d819bfc15a7c8fbbd5737890602cae272f437fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNFoGnKfGDqO9AfnkybTiobps8RLQpI_2jqNPPKEsEUIlGVCVp1Su6hg84TZ3x21FUnLIepjeHzzelSxq0TyAbZU-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price recent", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price recent", "published": "2018-06-05T07:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d819bfc15a7c8fbbd5737890602cae272f437fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNFoGnKfGDqO9AfnkybTiobps8RLQpI_2jqNPPKEsEUIlGVCVp1Su6hg84TZ3x21FUnLIepjeHzzelSxq0TyAbZU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Jenn", "published": "2018-06-05T07:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price recent", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price recently broke out of a descending trend line and is pulling back for a retest. Price is at a crucial area of interest, though, and a bounce or break could determine the next long-term direction. If these support levels hold, bitcoin could bounce back to the swing high and resume the reversal.\nBitcoin price is pulling back to an area of interest after breaking above a longer-term descending trend line.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This suggests that the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has fallen below the longer-term 200 SMA as an early indicator that bearish momentum is kicking in.\nRSI is indicating oversold conditions, though, so a bounce may be in order. Stochastic has already climbed out of the oversold area to show that buyers are ready to return. A larger pullback to the broken trend line closer to the 61.8% Fib may be the last line of defense for bulls, and a break below this could lead to a drop to the swing low. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin was off to a promising start for the week but it looks like bulls were unable to sustain the momentum as investor worries lingered. Not even remarks from Steve Wozniak on how bitcoin is the only digital gold were able to help. He cited:\nAll the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin.

The development shows the company is seriously exploring the crypto market and is a sign that& market is maturing.& Cryptocurrencies are viewed by many evangelists as one of the most groundbreaking financial innovations of the modern age. But the way crypto trades looks like something out of an old school Wall Street flick.&\nFor the most part, trading firms are making multi-million dollar crypto trades over-the-phone, not electronically. DRW's crypto arm Cumberland uses Skype calls to conduct its bitcoin deal-making, Reuters reported .&\nBut Jump Trading, the Chicago-based firm, has built a platform that will allow it to take the other side of large crypto trades electronically with its counterparties, according to people familiar with the matter. The so-called graphic user interface or GUI allows those counterparties to interact with Jump on a desktop. It does not allow users to connect to external trading exchanges.&\nJump is known for its ultra high-speed trading strategies, but it's also been developing what it calls a \" lower frequency trading strategy .\" It's also known for its discretion, & with little information on the firm available on its website .\nThe new platform shows that Jump is taking the new market for cryptocurrencies seriously, according to a person familiar with the firm's thinking. Also, the firm believes that voice and chatroom environments don't leave a clear audit trail, the person said.&\nJump Capital, the venture capital firm affiliated with Jump Trading, has made crypto a focus for 2018, as previously reported by Business Insider .&\n\"GUI's are not unique,\" Michael Dunworth, the chief executive of Wyre, a blockchain tech company, told Business Insider. \"But it is impressive that Jump built it.\"\nThe move shows the cryptocurrency market is maturing in a similar way to the now multi-trillion dollar foreign exchange market, which in its earliest days saw trades conducted mostly over the phone, says John Spallanzani, a former FX trader at Sumitomo Mitsui who is now a portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners.&\n\"We used to call 20 banks at once for spot FX prices,\" Spallanzani, said of forex trading in the 1990s.&\n\"It's without doubt maturing just by the fact that there's so many OTC desk's out in the mix,\" Dunworth added.&\nKraken, the crypto exchange, set up an OTC desk in New York, Business Insider first reported . There's also Genesis Global Trading and itBit, the OTC run by Paxos.\nAt the same time, crypto-focused investment funds are opening up at a record-pace, according to new research by CryptoFundResearch. 61 new funds have launched in 2018, according to firm's research, bringing the total number above 366 globally. To be sure, such funds manage in total a paltry $5 billion, a fraction of the $3.2 trillion managed by the entire hedge fund industry.&\nSEE ALSO:& A stock exchange behemoth is quietly powering crypto markets across the world\nJoin the conversation about this story »\nNOW WATCH: THE KRISTIN LEMKAU INTERVIEW: JPMorgan Chase's CMO explains how she deals with disruption on two fronts at once, why she's moving some ad dollars back to TV, and why it matters what your credit card feels like", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:QXVau8BzmBE", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?i=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:V_sGLiPBpWU", "http://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-chase-cmo-kristin-lemkau-interview-2018-5", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?i=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:gIN9vFwOqvQ", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:qj6IDK7rITs", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:yIl2AUoC8zA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:7Q72WNTAKBA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=QXVau8BzmBE", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI", "http://www.businessinsider.com/jump-trading-is-making-crypto-a-big-focus-2018-4", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:V_sGLiPBpWU", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-otc/otc-crypto-market-flourishes-powered-by-skype-idUSKCN1H91P4", "http://www.jumptrading.com/apply.html?gh_jid=564222", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider/~4/zaFyI_aDVOg", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:cGdyc7Q-1BI", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:gIN9vFwOqvQ", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:tGaL7RtRf1M:bcOpcFrp8Mo", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=qj6IDK7rITs", "http://www.jumptrading.com/", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider/~3/zaFyI_aDVOg/a-secretive-chicago-trading-firm-has-built-a-bitcoin-platform-that-shows-crypto-is-shaking-off-its-scrappy-roots-2018-6", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=7Q72WNTAKBA", "http://www.businessinsider.com/a-secretive-chicago-trading-firm-has-built-a-bitcoin-platform-that-shows-crypto-is-shaking-off-its-scrappy-roots-2018-6#comments", "http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-veteran-leaves-credit-suisse-for-crypto-trading-desk-2018-4", "http://www.businessinsider.com/a-stock-exchange-behemoth-is-powering-crypto-markets-across-the-world-2018-6"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cumberland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T17:01:22.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28d01bb6b16394123831607b61c5d765ebc33f22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZmbRh3alYRv7VZBhQUpqqk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Why the price of bitcoin rapidly going down", "title_full": "Why the price of bitcoin rapidly going down", "published": "2018-06-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.083, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "28d01bb6b16394123831607b61c5d765ebc33f22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZmbRh3alYRv7VZBhQUpqqk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rapidleech", "published": "2018-06-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why the price of bitcoin rapidly going down", "text": "For real, that could be even scam ICOs undermining market a bit.

Yeah, i know this is wrong because education is more important to us and it can't be stealed from us, i'm still studying but my fees will be doubled on the next payment. But i believe this will end a good result. What do you think about this ? Your advice will be highly appreciated. Thanks!\nYou already take the most risky in your life because first of all you know that it is not good to invest your money in bitcoin instead of paying your school fees. We know that eventhough we invest our money in bitcoin we still do not know if it will be have a higher profit or not especially when they are people who wants to steal your money then everything sacrifices that you've that will be gone. Honestly this is a wrong idea and even me I don't really think that it is worth to take the risks especially when I know that there's a possibility where my money won't work on it or my money won't get a higher profit than my expectations though it is sad that you left your education just to invest your money for bitcoin without the assurance of return.

This was cited as a bad omen for bitcoin enthusiasts as the volume of searches for \"bitcoin,\" is often viewed as a \"proxy for potential new buyers,\" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.\nColas added that he \"was not a fan of buying bitcoin at current [price] levels\".\nThe total market cap of cryptocurrencies totalled about $337 billion, at the time of writing, to remain above last week's $329 billion.\nRipple XRP fell 2.25% to $0.64805 on the Poloniex exchange, while Ethereum fell 4.37% to $591.02.\nBitcoin Cash fell 6.53% to $1,093.50, while Litecoin fell 4.54% to $119.24.\nRelated Articles\nReports: Crypto Now Considered a Commodity on Indonesia’s Stock Exchange\nHitBTC: Japan Users Banned ‘Temporarily’ As Solution Planned For Q3 2018\nChina Central TV:

Bitcoin and other digital assets are deep in red .\nThe San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange has announced its plans to enter Japanese market in order to facilitate global cryptocurrency adoption. Currently, the company is operating in 32 countries and support USD, EUR, GBP, CAD and BTC for trading. Coinbase Asian presence is now limited to office in Singapore.\n“As part of our effort to accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrency, today we’re announcing the launch of Coinbase’s office in Japan…we plan to take a deliberate approach to our rollout in Japan, which means working hand-in-hand with the Japanese FSA [Financial Services Agency] to ensure compliance with local laws at every stage,” Vice President and General Manager Dan Romero commented.\nThe new office will be headed by Nao Kitazawa, a former investment banker at Morgan Stanley Japan and a member of an international law firm.\nLast year Japanese authorities introduced Payment Services Act, which requires all crypto exchanges in the country obtain FSA license. There are 16 fully licensed venues operating in the country with 16 more operating under special permission while their applications are processed.\nThe cryptocurrency market reaction has been muted as all major coins resumed the downside after a short-lived recovery attempt on the weekend. Bitcoin, the largest and the most popular digital coin, is down 3.7% on daily basis, trading at $7,400 handle at the time of writing. The coin broke below the short-term trendline while the renewed selling pressure threatens to take the coin back to $7,000 handle where new buyers are likely to appear.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "japa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dan romero", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial services agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T08:33:26.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1be6f8abeb656b56e8a903ec543d8dca1b10f12b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSEQcbfn917DbdlprACAzIQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "What do you do when bitcoin and altcoin is down ?", "title_full": "What do you do when bitcoin and altcoin is down ?", "published": "2018-06-05T06:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1be6f8abeb656b56e8a903ec543d8dca1b10f12b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSEQcbfn917DbdlprACAzIQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tom14cat14", "published": "2018-06-05T06:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "What do you do when bitcoin and altcoin is down ?", "text": "Quote: from: islakevin on March 25, 2018, 03:50:07 PM What do you do when bitcoin and altcoin is down ? especially your holdings.\nWhen I see bear market with the down trend I go to the bar and take a beer and I Hold cuz I know this is the best movement.

I buy in what Jack Dorsey states, not really that I always believe it is going to take place, but because I want it to be like that, that’s so pure thinking, Wozniak was quoted as saying by CNBC on Monday.\nWozniak was interviewed throughout the Money 20/20 conference, which will be taking place this week at Amsterdam. He talked favorably about the facet of cryptocurrency that restricts the number of coins which could exist – but stressed that he is not an investor, but rather a supportive technologist. The Apple co creator also indicated his support for bitcoin in contrast to other cryptocurrencies, saying that only bitcoin is pure electronic gold.and I completely buy into that.” . Each of the others have a tendency to give up a few of the facets of bitcoin, he went on to state.

Last year growth has began in mid of July and hope so the trend begins this year as well. At least there should be a double growth hitting minimum $30K by end of December 2018. The blood path is really a good chance to buy as much as we can. Wish to utilize this situation and gather coins.\nWe've been waiting for bitcoin to get back to $10,000 but it seems tired and can't move forward as of now. If about the last year's growth, there has been good movement by June and the rest was followed with positive actions. We can't think of anything right now but as long as bitcoin isn't reaching new high it's still a good time to buy no matter what happens, we're all hoping it will come up again.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T03:55:50.103+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "071ff123f51e5f572b30ab1a5fa0916514058a75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaAJxaiFQxZqDue5l6AtstM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Investing!", "title_full": "Bitcoin Investing!", "published": "2018-06-05T06:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.107, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "071ff123f51e5f572b30ab1a5fa0916514058a75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaAJxaiFQxZqDue5l6AtstM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "abonti", "published": "2018-06-05T06:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Investing!", "text": "I think it is right time to invest bitcoin .because it is very good bitcoin investment. and it is very beneficial invest. because now bitcoin price lower, because of the technology digital currency.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T10:20:50.037+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14a25cc28736c9bc894b9eac0fed6142f65e1db5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqadZylDAia8X4UAfvS96sXXF.d.bsaZiSlwsVehXt0yGIkRnGUUrGOr_.90nWsFEr3vlfI9M4zZqBc49m8Auah_KbqDkMEu_Is", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Monero Maximalism -

Jun 4, 2018 Jun 5, 2018\n(CNN) - Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, so-called cryptocurrency has grown in popularity.\nIt's virtual money, not something you keep in a wallet. At least, not the kind of wallet you keep in your pocket.\nWhat is Bitcoin, and should you invest in digital money in general?\nEssentially a series of computer code, cryptocurrency is digital money you can use to buy anything from a cup of coffee to a luxury car.\n“Things don’t have to be tangible to have value,” points out Brandon Mintz, the CEO of Bitcoin Depot, a Bitcoin ATM operator.\nHe notes that in the digital age, most peoples’ money exists as nothing more than numbers on a screen anyway.\n\"We look at our Paypal account, and there's a number on our screen that money is still there,” he said. “Same thing with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\"\nThis payment method cuts out the bank. Instead, it's peer to peer, person to person. And transactions are done through digital exchanges.\nMany early investors who bought Bitcoins for a few dollars have made million-dollar profits.\n\"Last year you saw the price go up from below $1,000 to nearly $20,000. So of course, you can use it as a way to make money on the increase of the price,\" Mintz said.\nBut some analysts say crypto is too volatile, with prices rising and falling very suddenly, often without rhyme or reason.\nBut others, like Mintz, disagree.\n\"There's much more money to be made and this is something that's going to stick around for the long term,\" he said.\nIf you want to dive in, here's one tip: Don't invest more money than you're willing to lose.\n\"People are taking a loan out on their house and putting all that into crypto and then the price crashed,\" Mintz noted.\nAnother thing to consider is security. Find a reliable source to buy crypto.\n\"The valuation of cryptocurrency is virtually unlimited,” Mintz said. “We may have a million dollar Bitcoin one day.\"\nCopyright 2018 CNN.

Bitcoin-Related Site June 5, 2018 315 The City Court of St. Petersburg , Russia has overturned the District Court’s previous decision to block crypto media website Bitcoininfo.ru, local news outlet TASS reports June 4. The District Court’s judgement was handed down in July 2016 in compliance with a ban on crypto-related information sources, as digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) were not legal in country. As TASS reports, the new decision was enacted after the Supreme Court of Russia referred the case for consideration to the St. Petersburg City Court, following a complaint action from the owner of Bitcoininfo. “The St. Petersburg City Court overturned the District Court’s decision that recognized the information placed on the website Bitcoininfo.ru as prohibited for viewing.” The press service of the Court also reported that in July 2016 the St. Petersburg Vyborg District Court banned the website per the application of local prosecutors. The case was considered by the court without the website owners present. According to Bitcoininfo’s representative, the application process was unilaterally initiated by prosecutors without involving the website owners and without requesting the removal of content that was considered illegal. He also noted that the City Court refused to accept a request for appeal after the ban was enacted. Per the case file, local prosecutors requested a ban on the website because it contained information about cryptocurrencies, which are “outside of government control,”“facilitate growth of the shadow economy,” and “do not have specific consumer properties.” Earlier this year the City Court of St. Petersburg, annulled a trial court’s previous decision to ban 40 Bitcoin-related websites in the Russian Federation. The ban was initiated because the sites were “spreading information” about digital currency that “is not backed by any real asset and does not provide information about its owners.” The court’s decision precedes an upcoming crypto regulatory framework that is scheduled for July 1 by decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The framework is supported by the Russian State Duma’s Committee for Legislative Work and includes a bill “On Digital Financial Assets” which was released in March of this year.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-municipal-court-in-st-petersburg-rules-to-unblock-40-bitcoin-related-websites", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-state-duma-considers-law-on-digital-financial-assets-echoes-us-regulations", "http://tass.ru/ekonomika/5261085", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-vladimir-putin-signals-obligatory-cryptocurrency-regulation-will-begin-july-1", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/russias-digital-economy-bill-supported-by-state-duma-committee-in-move-towards-crypto-regulation", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/saint-petersburg", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/russia"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoininfo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "st. petersburg vyborg district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg city court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoininfo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:56:17.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6ea511e22c5fb39d792598631b00a32e02f2db9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaMmU4jV9Elli7WfL0oMbRo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Shopping with bitcoin", "title_full": "Shopping with bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-05T05:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b6ea511e22c5fb39d792598631b00a32e02f2db9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaMmU4jV9Elli7WfL0oMbRo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "john_nautica", "published": "2018-06-05T05:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Shopping with bitcoin", "text": "shopping with bitcoin is something I never thought of.

But they hope that public comments made at the meeting will help chart a path forward amid concerns over noise, the amount of energy used by the cryptocurrency mining operations, and how that energy consumption could affect consumers.\nEVE BYRON\nhttp://missoulian.com/news/local/mis ... top-story-1\nNo reader comments so far.

Have you tried this: blog.btc.com/… – MCCCS Oct 21 '17 at 7:43 I have not tried that yet, thank you. Before I do that though, I'm under the impression it's important to change addresses with my btc for security reasons. Then after that's done use the private key of the old address to claim my BCH using the previous addresses' key in a new wallet. Since I asked this question, I managed to figure out how to export from mycelium to coinomi but I was shocked to see a 6$ fee in the coinomi wallet. I figured this isn't a transaction it would be fee-less. I'm looking at other wallets now and still trying to figure it out. – hortstu Oct 21 '17 at 16:53", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blog.btc.com/how-to-recover-your-trapped-bitcoin-cash-from-other-wallets-24b929543f26"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T06:24:37.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a65a57d7649f5e29a009c4a260e863a55079057", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17S3iUKSDeYaj2bAwNHnthfq5pAZHtNgsL07vSCkUPa8_VJwtjzPrqqz8-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-05T05:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a65a57d7649f5e29a009c4a260e863a55079057", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17S3iUKSDeYaj2bAwNHnthfq5pAZHtNgsL07vSCkUPa8_VJwtjzPrqqz8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T05:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 5.
