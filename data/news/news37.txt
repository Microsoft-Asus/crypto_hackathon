The codebase will be available for public testing on DevNet, so enthusiasts worldwide can get a taste of what is to come, and contribute to the ongoing development of the platform.\n5th June 2018, Lons-le-Saunier, France – Yes, this is the moment most of you have been waiting for – the release date of the new ARK Core v2 codebase for public testing on DevNet (ARK’s public test network). This is not a MainNet release, only for their testing DevNet, but the code for v2 will finally be available for the world to see, test and contribute to.\n“We have completely rewritten our core to make it faster, more scalable, more modular, easier to work with and some great new features. Such as Dynamic Fees and Multisig support. This rewrite has been months in the making and we are very proud to show the world what the next level of DPoS can do!” – ARK Co-Founder Travis Walker\nAlthough most of you are familiar with ARK’s motto “ ARK Gives No Dates ”, this latest release needs coordination with those running DevNet delegates and relay nodes. Anyone running a DevNet node needs to be on board and prepared prior to release. Before we tell you the date, let’s review the steps that will occur during the upcoming months.\n1. Release of ARK Core v2 Codebase\nFirst, ARK will release the ARK Core v2 code on their public GitHub repository. This will be accompanied by a detailed blog post on the date specified for public release. The repository will be available at: http://github.com/arkecosystem/ark-core\nThe current ARK Node codebase will as such become deprecated, not maintained and replaced with the new ARK Core v2 repository.\n2. Preparations and installation of ARK Core on DevNet\nNext, the community and delegates who are running v1 DevNet nodes on the current codebase (ARK Node) will need to update their servers with ARK Core v2. Don’t worry, ARK will release a detailed guide on how to install/replace your current ARK Node on DevNet. It will be much simpler to install the new Core and will now support different Operating Systems (including Windows). Be prepared for many new features to test!\nWith this, public testing of ARK Core v2 will begin! Test it thoroughly, try the most unimaginable of things, stress it, attacking the whole dev network, catch every issue you can, report bugs, provide improvements to the code, … and the end result will be a truly stable foundation for MainNet release. But who are we kidding, DevNet is where all the fun will be at so make sure you join in!\nNote that the first iteration of the new ARK Core will be 100% backwards compatible (no new transaction types that are detailed in AIP-11). You will still be able to run your old ARK Node on DevNet, but ARK of course want you to switch to new code as soon as possible and help test it.\n3. Transition from DevNet to MainNet\nAfter DevNet testing is complete, ARK will provide another date announcing transition of the ARK Core v2 to MainNet. From ARK gives no dates to ARK gives two dates, they know this is a new concept too.\nPredicting a date for MainNet at this time is highly unlikely as it all depends on how the testing on DevNet will go — on how many things that need to be modified, fixed and improved. Running on an internally controlled TestNet is a different beast from a live environment with real parameters and in a more distributed manner.\n4. AIP-11 Hardfork\nAIP-11 types (timelock, multipayments, IPFS, delegate resignation) will be part of a hardfork that will occur after we get our initial v2 release running on the MainNet. AIP-11 will require all delegates to update in order for the network to switch and support the new transaction. This hardfork will NOT be backwards compatible (and again it will be tested beforehand on DevNet).\nThe timing of the AIP-11 hardfork also depends on when ARK get the initial ARK Core v2 update onto MainNet. ARK expect to start testing the hardfork as soon as possible on DevNet after v2 is running on MainNet. So batten down the hatches, furl those sails … all hands on deck as the ARK is prepared for stormy seas as the voyage continues….\nThe ARK Core v2 codebase will become available on: Thursday, the 14th of June 2018, https://ark.io/countdown\nTo learn more about the ARK project visit these links:\nWebsite- https://ark.io", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://github.com/arkecosystem/ark-core", "https://ark.io/countdown"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "travis walker al", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lons-le-saunier", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T22:23:02.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa86bb40061d783e9bfbf16175651f1bab4037fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR__x4vRpGLZ_nFLp.JvD3bn07m7Oqd.f8SHW_IYgOZljmk7rkmzBdG_00nlrgDLeHhOjR3ntKm5ZWZ0Yneop1gpafMiZIe7nk69qbwbUXgXQ--", "site_full": "kopitiambot.com", "site": "kopitiambot.com", "site_section": "https://kopitiambot.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "Kopitiam Bot", "title": "Watch Tim Draper ‘rap’ about Bitcoin at #TNW2018", "title_full": "Watch Tim Draper ‘rap’ about Bitcoin at #TNW2018", "published": "2018-06-05T16:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/kopitiambot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/d55a936ec44ac7d55bfd9a99f912875097a5b55b-10.png?fit=800%2C400&amp;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa86bb40061d783e9bfbf16175651f1bab4037fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR__x4vRpGLZ_nFLp.JvD3bn07m7Oqd.f8SHW_IYgOZljmk7rkmzBdG_00nlrgDLeHhOjR3ntKm5ZWZ0Yneop1gpafMiZIe7nk69qbwbUXgXQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kopitiambot", "published": "2018-06-05T16:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Watch Tim Draper ‘rap’ about Bitcoin at #TNW2018", "text": "(Source: thenextweb.com )\nTim Draper, American venture capital investor and a known name in the cryptocurrency industry, was speaking at the TNW Conference last month when he did something that confirmed his position as the biggest Bitcoin nerd of all.\nJustina Lee from Bloomberg was interviewing Draper, when she asked her final question: “How will blockchain change the world?”. Draper responded, “Well, okay. Here, I have got to go to my notes.” Donning his signature Bitcoin tie , Draper whipped up his phone and – to the amusement of the audience – started spitting some fire rhymes.\nLee was so impressed by Draper’s performance, that she later wrote an article about it on Bloomberg . But it seems Motherboard’s Jordan Pearson wasn’t happy with Lee calling whatever Draper performed a “rap.”\n“I am convinced that this bizarre display is not a rap. It’s barely singing. Really, it is just totally, completely strange,” Pearson wrote . “To my ear, it lies somewhere between a schoolteacher reading a book to children very slowly, slam poetry, and frankly just very bad singing.”\nI will leave it up to you to watch the video and decide whether Draper’s performance qualifies as “rap” or “noise,” but as far as I am concerned — I haven’t been able to stop myself from humming Draper’s lyrics ever since I first listened to them. “I am a Bitcoin hustle…I am a blockchain bustle…Get your hustle going, flex your crypto muscle, yaaay!”\nIf you want to watch the whole

#money\nThe public’s perception is something that is very important to the cryptocurrency community. A few years ago the few conferences, which discussed cryptocurrency were mainly Anarcho capitalists and Libertarians. The earliest conventions and events mainly talked about Bitcoin and the Free market in general. In recent times however, the conferences and topics have become incredibly more diverse and intense. You can also meet people with many differing views. In fact nowadays Anarcho Capitalists and Libertarians make up about 20-30% of the people attending the events. Those who have tasted power, want to always be in control\nThe banks have never had a problem with gold existing, as long as people still used fiat currency. That way they could still retain control of the money supply and in doing so they could keep their grip on the governments. That is easily achieved, when they manipulate interest rates and increase or decrease the money supply. This has been true ever since the banking cartels have started ruining economies and countries. As Nathan Rothschild said:\n“I care not which puppet sits on the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply.”\nDigital gold. The term is rather new term and it basically means that a digital currency is based on mass units of gold. From 1873 to 1933 these were exchangeable for gold on demand in the US. Bitcoin was meant as a peer-to-peer cash, which is what Satoshi Nakamoto outlined for it and even wrote the title for it in his white paper. Bitcoin may never fulfill that purpose. In the event it becomes a form of digital gold, there will be be a competitor. The need for digital cash has never been greater.\nIn recent times many people have begun questioning Bitcoin. Massive censorship has started in the Reddit Bitcoin forum. Anyone who as much as went against what the Bitcoin core people were talking was instantly censored. Hardcore censorship doesn’t sit well with the peer-to-peer free market currency, which many people thought Bitcoin was. It’s very peculiar how the second someone speaks out against Bitcoin, they instantly get a horde of sock puppet trolls on their platforms. Many Youtubers, bloggers and even financial analysts have reported a great increase in dislikes in comments or reviews after they state a position, which criticizes Bitcoin. If the institutions which hold the world hostage view you as an enemy, you are on the right path\nThere is definitely a sort of war going on with this entire concept. The fact that there is a lot of censorship, there are paid trolls on the Bitcoin core site, doesn’t sit well with people, who value the idea of the free market peer-to-peer currency. The globalists have an incentive to move Bitcoin away from being that. Blockstream itself has a massive motive to do that. They’ve raised over 60 million in venture capital from globalist entities such as AXA Insurance. Companies like this tie very well into the whole globalist financial system and their entire business model works if Bitcoin is slow and expensive. The incentives are eye gouging.\nOpinions can differ on this subject can differ. The thing which cannot be denied is that the banks want in on the cryptocurrency craze. The grasp of banks and globalists on freedom is always tightening. We can build the future, by learning from the past. If our past has taught us something, it’s that banks will not allow competition or progress.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "anarcho capitalists", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T16:42:37.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b19f1e4cf2a7f6984750d50f343cdb8455209f67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJP3rwsqMmo.z8IxFqsZNgSHpzI8YLRrRtuKmNxqgOn4fnvk8Et5v6WAgADFpWkf09lG6CtpYKNc0M6YrPL8eYgqaL9gDsUrnYVGroCgBhpG7mT8MDLzWncaH39kCfnA_6", "site_full": "onehallyu.com", "site": "onehallyu.com", "site_section": "https://onehallyu.com/forum/6-current-news-events/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Current News &amp; Events - OneHallyu", "title": "Apple founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency", "title_full": "Apple founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency - Current News & Events - OneHallyu", "published": "2018-06-05T16:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://onehallyu.com//public/style_images/master/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15761, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b19f1e4cf2a7f6984750d50f343cdb8455209f67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpMfouZbcTsqM3wju51VzJP3rwsqMmo.z8IxFqsZNgSHpzI8YLRrRtuKmNxqgOn4fnvk8Et5v6WAgADFpWkf09lG6CtpYKNc0M6YrPL8eYgqaL9gDsUrnYVGroCgBhpG7mT8MDLzWncaH39kCfnA_6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "VerySappy", "published": "2018-06-05T16:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency", "text": "Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple © Aly Song / Reuters\nTech legend Steve Wozniak says he is attracted to the “purity” of the idea that people around the world could one day share a single currency, despite being separated by national borders.

He's about as eccentric as imagined, defiantly taking on his government through the issuance of a proprietary, local money. It was a way to get out from under gouging state-backed banks. Close to half a decade later, and after a crackdown, his little hamlet is thriving as a result of tapping the digital universe to cure their monetary ills.\nAlso read: DOJ Crypto Investigation Tanks Prices, Fundstrat Welcomes Adult Supervision\nRussian Farmer Living the Crypto Revolution \"I don't want to expand because it will bring obligations I'm not ready for. I'm not ready to save the world or even Russia, I want to be comfortable and I want to share this comfort with the community,\" Mikhail Shlyapnikov told CNN Money . The expansion he speaks of revolves around his personal economic odyssey spurred by banking cartels and their double digit interest premiums on access to capital, Russian rubles.\nMikhail Shlyapnikov Колио́ново (Kolionovo) is little over an hour by car from Moscow. That was just enough space for Mr. Shlyapnikov to hospice a cancer diagnosis. It's a farming village, population probably around a couple dozen. It was a chance to escape city life. That was nearly a decade ago, and almost immediately the iconoclast former banker set about changing things.\nMr. Shlyapnikov explained, \"I didn't want to suffocate and be a slave of the banks. So I had to invent my own money. And I did it. I'm my own bank, government, regulator.\" Indeed, around 2010 he led the charge to stop politicians entering the hamlet, insisting they prove mental fitness. Only a few years later, he launched his \"kolion\" to purposefully usurp the ruble.\nCrypto's Bright Russian Farming Future Kolion in its 2014 iteration was paper. That was all it took for his arrest, as a Russian court deemed kolion illegal about a year later. Spring of last year, undeterred, Mr. Shlyapnikov seized on initial coin offering (ICO) mania, raising half a million dollars. \"We now have about $2 million in kolions because its value has jumped since the ICO,\" he noted . \"This way we can attract real money into the business.\"\nThe village's crypto has 500 bitcoin backing it in reserve, almost $4 million worth. Kolions aren't mined, and no fiat is paired with it. Instead, Kolionovoians can earn it through a concept he calls 'plowing,' which involves trading labor in exchange. Kolions can also be purchased with other, more established cryptos.\nHis vision has turned out to be fortuitous. Russian economic prospects can be seen as immediately bleak: the country faces growing sanction levies on top of sometime contracting markets. The village and its neighbors, who both are incorporating the crypto into their daily lives more and more, are effectively insulated from wild downturns. Such was not the case only a few short years ago.\nIs this the model for crypto's future?

As the first exchange regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to offer a Bitcoin contract (in 2014), Nadex is expanding the choice of contract duration and size in response to member requests, as part of its ongoing efforts to lead in the cryptocurrency space.\nThe new Mini-Bitcoin Spread contract is a month-long contract with a tick value of $0.01 per point of the underlying Bitcoin index.\nThe existing Bitcoin Spread has a one-week duration and a larger tick value of $0.10 per point of the underlying index.\nBoth contracts are cash-settled in US Dollars with funds held by Nadex's CFTC-regulated clearinghouse. Based on the TeraBit Index SM published by TeraExchange, the Bitcoin and Mini-Bitcoin Spreads are more affordable and flexible in many cases than owning Bitcoin outright.\nUnlike unregulated cryptocurrency vendors, Nadex offers market participants the security of trading on a CFTC-regulated exchange, with the opportunity to trade contracts based on other markets as well, including stock index futures, commodities, forex, and economic numbers.\n\"With the Mini-Bitcoin contract, we're continuing our practice of responding to customer demand. Many of our traders love the cryptocurrency markets and gave us great feedback on what they needed from us to be able to trade the Bitcoin market their way,\" said Nadex CEO, Timothy McDermott. \"So we're building a range of cryptocurrency products that give traders more choice and flexibility to day trade or take a position in Bitcoin on the long and short side.\"\nAbout Nadex (North American Derivatives Exchange ™)\nNadex is the first and largest CFTC-regulated online exchange in the U.S offering binary options and spreads to individual traders seeking a trusted and secure way to participate in the markets. Member funds are segregated and held in top-tier US banks. Using Nadex's online and mobile platforms, traders can trade short-term price movements in the most heavily traded currency, commodity, stock index, and cryptocurrency markets, as well as economic events, with intraday, daily and weekly contracts.To learn more about Nadex, please visit https://nadex.com .

For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\nWILL THESE STATES WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nMaine is not expected to introduce sports betting any time soon.\n“I would say we were behind the eight ball and that’s not uncommon for Maine to be that way,” said state Rep. Donald G. Marean, R-Hollis, who also serves as vice chairman of the U.S. Trotting Association.\nMilton Champion, executive director of the state’s Gambling Control Board, said there is no sports-betting legislation pending in Maine.\nNext year will probably be a different story, however.\nState Rep. Louis Luchini, D-Ellsworth, said he anticipates multiple bills on sports betting will be introduced during the 2019 legislative session.\n“In my view under the current law, Maine would have to pass a law to expressly legalize sports betting,” Luchini said.\nCharlie McIntyre, executive director of the New Hampshire Lottery and chair of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries’ (NASPL) government relations committee said that NASPL has been wanting to participate in an open dialogue on sports betting and wanted the lotteries to have the ability to incorporate sports betting though there are no indications that this will be happening any time soon.\nVermont probably won't be offering sports betting any time soon.\nThe Vermont Legislature has no pending bills related to sports gambling, and legislative action seems unlikely in the near future.\n\"I don't know of anybody who is pushing for this in Vermont,\" said Danny Rachek, executive director of the Vermont Lottery.\nNeedless-to-say, Florida gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald g. marean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milton champion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis luchini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa world cup online from maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa world cup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gambling control board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. trotting association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T16:57:47.063+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ede5b6912ecae2b77a94afdfa9cd05143b136700", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_TeNkHpyovK1kpBXSJkx11dCN39cdsa9fy.HWy7wjbGk2jsNe91PpxbZfAmlgvymtdvW8bTzd9Yk9iJ4x3r35HlQA3FJZgKq9ZBl0BrS8q3LCybm99mkIHcvaopfQiKyZE.QLQUHyReg--", "site_full": "www.rttnews.com", "site": "rttnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.rttnews.com/RSS/ForexTopStory.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "education"], "section_title": "RTT - Forex Top Story", "title": "Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak Wants Bitcoin To Be Single Global Currency", "title_full": "Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak Wants Bitcoin To Be Single Global Currency", "published": "2018-06-05T15:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2018/june/steve-june5-lt.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ede5b6912ecae2b77a94afdfa9cd05143b136700", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_TeNkHpyovK1kpBXSJkx11dCN39cdsa9fy.HWy7wjbGk2jsNe91PpxbZfAmlgvymtdvW8bTzd9Yk9iJ4x3r35HlQA3FJZgKq9ZBl0BrS8q3LCybm99mkIHcvaopfQiKyZE.QLQUHyReg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T15:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak Wants Bitcoin To Be Single Global Currency", "text": "Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak Wants Bitcoin To Be Single Global Currency 6/5/2018 8:56 AM ET\nSteve Wozniak, Apple co-founder, wants to see Bitcoin as the single global currency, echoing comments made by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey recently.\n\"I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,\" Wozniak told CNBC on the sidelines of a financial conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\nBitcoin will become the global currency for payments after overtaking the dollar's dominant place within a decade, Dorsey had said in March in an interview to the UK's Times newspaper.\nIn May, however, Dorsey said the internet was set to have a native currency.

Getty•CNBC Bitcoin price: Ripple CEO says bitcoin blockchain is \"quite slow\" By the end of this year I have every confidence that major banks will use Xrapid as a liquidity tool Brad Garlinghouse\n“But, you know, we also need to continue to grow that ecosystem, grow the liquidity and it all comes back to if we are solving a real problem for real customers.\n“There are so many different examples in this space - there’s ICOs where I don’t really understand the problem the token is solving.\n“Those are ones where I’m very sceptical about what that looks like.”\nMr Garlinghouse has previously said the new cryptocurrency is focused on working with banks and other institutions to “dramatically improve” the way money moves globally.\nRipple is both a transaction network and crypto token XRP, created to be the go-to cryptocurrency for banks and global money transfers.\nRipple is the third biggest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin and ethereum.\nMost recently, Ripple has been linked with a deal with the Bank of America, which is the latest world bank to jump into the cryptocurrency market.\nThe deal will help make the Bank of America more accessible to the average consumer, opening up accounts for Ripple traders who otherwise may not have been able to use one.\nThe Ripple CEO also said bitcoin is not the “panacea” to solve problems that people assumed it would be. He said: “Instead, you're seeing specialisations of different kind of ledgers, different kinds of blockchains.”\nMr Garlinghouse said bitcoin blockchain is “quite slow”, whereas Ripple transactions are a “thousand times faster”.\nXRP rose 1.6 percent to trade at $0.664503 as of 13:10 on Tuesday, according to coingecko.

In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\nWILL THESE STATES WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nThe Connecticut General Assembly has balked at the idea of being able to bet sports online.\nBetting by smartphone is a concept that needs deeper study and public input, legislative leaders said this past Friday.\n\"A special session does not lend itself to something so complicated,\" said House Majority Leader Matt Ritter, D-Hartford. \"How do you verify age? How does it work when you go across the border? Are there daily limits?\"\n\"We really need to have the capacity for a full public hearing process and have it vetted. Unlike other issues, there's not necessarily a deadline that is required of us to act,\" said Deputy House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford. \"I think generally all the caucuses are concerned. I don't believe there is one caucus saying we should bring it up.\"\nConnecticut Governor Gov. Dannel P. Malloy believes the state legislature is open to sports betting at its brick and mortar casinos but may be resistant to online gambling.\n\"I think that the tribal nations are in a position to deal with reality, and if the reality is the legislature is not going to take up online gaming separate and apart from whatever is required from sports betting, that's the situation,\" Malloy said.\nRhode Island, while unlikely to implement sports betting this year, is certainly open to it with the state lottery likely to control most, if not all, aspects once they are ready to pull the switch.\nMassachusetts anticipates sports betting to be available next year (2019).\nFrom MassLive :\nRep. Joseph Wagner, chairman of the Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies, told WGBY-TV's \"Connecting Point\" that he and House Speaker Robert DeLeo have had \"a number of conversations\" about sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last month that states can decide on their own whether to allow wagers.\nDeLeo has already said that it would be \"difficult\" to see the House taking action on sports betting before formal sessions end July 31.\n\"The approach here is to move this to the front burner but to not move so quickly that we get it wrong,\" Wagner, a Chicopee Democrat, said. He added, \"It won't be taken up perhaps for formal action in this [session] but the work will begin immediately. The work has already begun.\"\nNeedless-to-say, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/06/mass_sports_betting_bill_could.html", "http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt ritter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa world cup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rhode island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-hartford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T16:57:48.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ab009088210bcf26f91c66218070fb57ab9c86b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pDcRxcKDqs7uEYpZMYnAN4ekvlAFrWurf5m.x3ab0QGzJSNCi0ANqxR.wq.UVZSupXGmWHG048yyC.zL9qUdeyIJfXD_VbTMGt.GBGPuytI7GNtQfammq3odXGTNEvBfG_fBiLveViSqtKzzS.3XWkU-", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "https://www.medium.com/feed/tag/apple", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Apple on Medium", "title": "Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Hopes Bitcoin Will Become the De Facto Global Currency", "title_full": "Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Hopes Bitcoin Will Become the De Facto Global Currency", "published": "2018-06-05T15:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ab009088210bcf26f91c66218070fb57ab9c86b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pDcRxcKDqs7uEYpZMYnAN4ekvlAFrWurf5m.x3ab0QGzJSNCi0ANqxR.wq.UVZSupXGmWHG048yyC.zL9qUdeyIJfXD_VbTMGt.GBGPuytI7GNtQfammq3odXGTNEvBfG_fBiLveViSqtKzzS.3XWkU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tokens24.com", "published": "2018-06-05T15:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Hopes Bitcoin Will Become the De Facto Global Currency", "text": "Jun 5 Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Hopes Bitcoin Will Become the De Facto Global Currency Jack Dorsey co-founder and CEO of Twitter, founder, and CEO of Square , a mobile digital payment processor, recently said that he believes that Bitcoin could become the de facto global currency.

By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: June 5, 2018 1:07 PM Raj Kundra with Shilpa Shetty. (Source: PTI)\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday summoned Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra at their Mumbai office in connection with an alleged bitcoin scam, news agency ANI reported. Kundra was reportedly summoned by ED for his alleged links with fraudster Amit Bhardwaj. There is still no official confirmation on the role of Raj Kundra in this case. Touted as a bitcoin entrepreneur, Bhardwaj allegedly duped more than 8,000 people to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore from across the country. He was arrested at the Delhi Airport in April this year. He had introduced India’s first online marketplace accepting bitcoin in 2014 and also owns a couple of bitcoin mining operations such as Gain Bitcoin and GB Miners. Kundra allegedly promoted one of the platforms held by Bhardwaj, reported India Today.\nBhardwaj had reportedly incorporated a multi-level marketing scam by luring investors to offer him bitcoins in lieu of higher returns. He had introduced a contract valid for 18 months, offering a return of 10%. Bhardwaj also promised to facilitate the bitcoin mining hardware to investors following which they can mine their own bitcoins.\nFailing to get them any returns, Bhardwaj fled the country and was later located by the Pune police in Bangkok. Seven others were also arrested with him.\nThis isn’t the first time when Kundra has landed in trouble. He had earlier admitted to placing bets in the Indian Premier League and has been serving a life ban from all cricket-related activities. In March, he filed a petition in Supreme Court challenging the ban. Rajasthan Royals, a franchise he co-owns, was also banned for two years and made a comeback in the recently-concluded IPL season.\nEarlier this year, Kundra had accused actor Sachiin Joshi of non-payment of dues. Kundra had alleged that Joshi had bought a team in Indian Poker League (a tournament started by Raj Kundra) but his cheque for Rs. 40 lakh had bounced. Meanwhile, Sachiin accused Raj of ‘rigging the tournament’ because of which, he backed out.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress", "https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T10:40:25.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce103c2c1076cda8e619348c3d3a20b8b810271b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmejhfOa96tY5WLmk3XB.mNE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "[BTC FORK] [BITFINEX] Bitcoin Interest - Decentralized Savings - Join Now", "title_full": "[ANN] [BTC FORK] [BITFINEX] Bitcoin Interest - Decentralized Savings - Join Now", "published": "2018-06-05T15:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce103c2c1076cda8e619348c3d3a20b8b810271b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmejhfOa96tY5WLmk3XB.mNE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Real-Duke", "published": "2018-06-05T15:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "[BTC FORK] [BITFINEX] Bitcoin Interest - Decentralized Savings - Join Now", "text": "Whats happen?\nCode: Bitcoin Interest (BCI) $5,04 USD (50,92%)\nIs it real or only pump and dump while the whole market is coming down", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T21:47:54.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c212b463c95e63d06de3e60fc6e2ac46938d9e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpqdGQ0aeDGhsF4hr7BZ.6OZpgcxIBBek_3uhnLq3632Cr3Y9U41IB.rmXRvbummcNr_bqMd.v8vnL1w__QSttO6ecRGUbuCuIt0A1Adb4ozaLLbrSW_BtgrpD5G0ksYna37qFIrG7CA--", "site_full": "cryptomining-blog.com", "site": "cryptomining-blog.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoinschannel.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins Channel", "title": "GMO Miner B2 is an Upcoming 24 THS 7nm Japanese ASIC Miner for Bitcoin", "title_full": "GMO Miner B2 is an Upcoming 24 THS 7nm Japanese ASIC Miner for Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-05T15:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoinschannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gmo-miner-b2-asic-bitcoin-580x407-300x211.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 39963, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0c212b463c95e63d06de3e60fc6e2ac46938d9e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpqdGQ0aeDGhsF4hr7BZ.6OZpgcxIBBek_3uhnLq3632Cr3Y9U41IB.rmXRvbummcNr_bqMd.v8vnL1w__QSttO6ecRGUbuCuIt0A1Adb4ozaLLbrSW_BtgrpD5G0ksYna37qFIrG7CA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "writer", "published": "2018-06-05T15:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "GMO Miner B2 is an Upcoming 24 THS 7nm Japanese ASIC Miner for Bitcoin", "text": "GMO Miner B2 is an Upcoming 24 THS 7nm Japanese ASIC Miner for Bitcoin Date: in: Altcoin 6 Views\nThe Japanese company GMO Internet Group that has announced plans to get into crypto currency miners a couple of months ago is apparently getting ready to start producing the first 7nm Bitcoin ASIC mining chips (GMO 72b).

Jun 5 Meet the Professor who created a Virtual Currency that Predated Bitcoin Emin Gün Sirer of Cornell on Problems & Potential of Blockchain Photo by Chris Liverani on Unsplash Emin Gün Sirer is a computer science professor at Cornell University and co-director of The Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) . Sirer created a P2P proof-of-work digital currency (Karma) that preceded Bitcoin by six years, has played a significant role in the development of core consensus protocols, and has previously alerted the cryptocurrency community of previously-undetected security flaws in various protocols. I spoke with Sirer in his office about increasing blockchain adoption in the general public and how groups within the crypto-space have changed their ideas around the immutability of code as these systems continue to evolve to solve real social needs and issues. Sirer talked about his concerns about the low level of decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the enormously wasteful energy consumption of proof-of-work systems, and about a pseudonymous-published whitepaper about a new class of consensus mechanisms that could make blockchains much more efficient. He also spoke about hurdles to widespread public of blockchain tech and how he hopes blockchain projects will directly address the opaque business practices and existing entities that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Aaron Fernando: To start, I want to get into your background — the stuff that got you interested in this field in the first place. Emin Gün Sirer: My foray into cryptocurrencies started with peer-to-peer systems. Around the time when Napster came out, there was a big problem in how to construct healthy peer-to-peer systems. It appeared that most people would just join the swarm of people sharing things. But they would take, and they would not give. That’s very common in human societies, that’s what people do. And so there were lots of different solutions to this problem, it’s called leeching. It’s a technical term, but you know amount the wider population it’s known as The Tragedy of the Commons: when you take things from society without contributing back in return. So, BitTorrent was a response to this. In BitTorrent, there’s a barter economy. You give me a block and I’ll give you a block. My solution was, look BitTorrent may or may not work. It’s much better if we give people a currency. So, whet don’t I invent a currency that can be created out of the thin air — it’s worthless — but you can use it for swapping blocks. So to get a block, you have to pay me in this currency and then to get the currency you have to provide blocks to other people. That’s what begat a system called Karma. It has proof-of work. It came six years before Satoshi did. “What is being referred to as the blockchain revolution is really the process of figuring out how to make computers work in a setting where people distrust each other.” So I was quite early in this space at that time and I’ve always been interested in self-organizing systems, peer-to-peer systems and so forth. Karma was very early and, of course, Bitcoin came along and when Bitcoin came along, my initial reaction was let’s take a look at this, let’s see what’s going on, let’s understand at its security properties. So we did this work with Ittay Eyal, [titled] Selfish Mining and I found that a lot of the things that people say about Bitcoin were not true. It wasn’t secure under the conditions that they thought it was secure. And we characterized when it’s secure what had to be done to keep it secure and we also gave them patches against people who might do selfish mining. And then I worked on security and scalability and so forth. The rest is a ton of work that happened afterwards. So that’s my early foray into this. What specifically got you involved and interested in the currency usage? Because that’s one of the many things you can do with a blockchain but it seems like your focus tends to trend toward the currency and financial services. I guess it does. So here’s what we see: computers came onto the scene maybe thirty, forty years ago in mass. They’ve been around for longer than that, but [that’s when] they were accessible to a wider audience. And they made inroads into various different industries and sectors. They made inroads into science. All of the physicists were using computers before anybody else. But business did not really adopt them and Wall Street really did not adopt them. If you look at the history of banking, ok fine, they have databases. But they didn’t really know how to make connected machines work. So what is being referred to as [the] blockchain revolution  — it’s really that process of figuring out how to make computers work in a setting where people distrust each other. That’s an amazingly powerful idea in a very challenging space. I find myself drawn to it because it’s challenging, it’s difficult, it’s nuanced, lots of things can go wrong and there are lots of glutches and counterintuitive results. If you just design something by gut feeling, it will not work. Also, we all lived through the 2008 crisis… That made everybody into, necessarily, and expert in the economy. You had to figure out, Oh my God, credit default swaps are something that is affecting me on a daily basis, and it’s changing the way I have to do things . Bitcoin was a reaction to the craziness of those times, [with] the way it dealt with money supply, and so forth. For me, at a personal level, yeah it piqued my interest in, “What’s happening? Can we build financial systems that are more transparent, that are more easy to audit, and can we built a better finance structure that’s built with a different aesthetic?” I’d like to go on a slight bit of a tangent, and this is important. There are multiple different ways of doing things in computer science. And these ways… the only way to describe it is ‘ aesthetics’ is the right word. You can build really complex, clunky monolithic, closed software — and we have systems like this. The most well-known one (people who are over the age of 60 will know this ) iss an operating system called Multics . It’s clunky, it’s big, and it did everything. You want it to do something, you told it, it would do it for you. And then, there is this other aesthetic, exemplified by a system called Unix. That’s where everything is a small tool, they mesh together, you could see the output of every tool and you could check things and so forth. “…they can’t self-govern. It’s not clear they know what they’re doing at all.” So part of what’s going on is that that second aesthetic being brought to bear to Wall Street. These guys were building really complex, really opaque structures. Nobody could tell what the hell was going on behind the scenes, except on the occasions they fail. If you look back, on average every eight years these guys fail. There’s an actual crisis in the market every eight years, in some portion of it. It’s actually more frequent, when you look at the smaller crises. It’s like multiple a year. Undoubtedly. If you start looking across countries, absolutely. So it’s incredibly complex, they can’t self-govern. it’s not clear they know what they’re doing at all. They themselves will admit that they have these cycles — these boom and bust cycles — and it’s very difficult to keep tabs on what’s happening. Anything that we can do, as technologists, to make this process as opened-up to the common person — provide some accountability, provide some transparency — that’s a good thing to do. Regarding, behavioral incentives: I pay a lot of attention to the crypto world, but also the sharing economy/ new economy and I’m seeing very, very different ideas about what motivates a person, in both. I find that with one world, the view is very altruistic and that doesn’t tell the whole story. And in the other, it’s very profit-driven and that also doesn’t tell the whole story. Exactly. The nice thing about the profit-driven one is that if you have an idea there that makes sense, then there’s somebody who’s going to jump in and try to implement it — so adoption is very, very quick there. But as you can see, they don’t always lead to good societal outcomes. Tragedies of the Commons, you have people exit scamming, and lots of fraud in that space. On the flipside, in the sharing economy — the new economy and the entire set of values exemplified by the local currency movement — they are supremely nice… in that they are trying to maximize societal welfare. That’s a good thing, but they don’t always get traction because, how do you actually get going? They have a bootstrapping problem. They find it difficult to raise money. So those two worlds are kind of at opposites. Deep down, the underlying ethos is different. In one, you have these highly individualistic, highly profit-driven people and they want to make money and that’s the prime objective for them. And on the other, you have the exact opposite type of people. They want to make the world a better place and they don’t care about personal monetary compensation, typically. But at the intersection of these two worlds are fantastic ideas. If you can come up with something that is easy to bootstrap, that does have some incentives built in for the people operating the schemes, and also makes the world a better place — then we’re talking. And we’re beginning to see such projects. There are some built on the Ethereum platform for microlending for example, or for identity management, or for a bunch of other things like this that are maybe a little to primitive, a little too early, or a little to basic a building block yet, as opposed to a complete product. “In the early days of cryptocurrencies, we had a lot of people proselytizing about how these systems are immutable, unchangeable… As we saw with various different blockchain projects when humans decide that these things are not serving them, they change them.” We take Augur and Gnosis — prediction markets. They could go the wrong way. They could go towards betting parlors, which I think would not be a good outcome. Anybody who’s seen a gambling addict knows that that’s bad. On the other hand, they could go exactly the right way and provide insurance against bad events that is easily priced; they give you a way to hedge portfolios, they give you an advanced class of derivatives that are not available on any other platform. Identity on the blockchain is an interesting thing. Again, there you could end up losing control of your personal information. Or we could build systems that don’t reveal who you are except prove that you possess a property. So there’s nothing personally trackable about you, but a website can know that you’re over the age of 25 or whatever it is. A car insurance company can know exactly what bracket you’re in without knowing precisely who you are. So at the intersection of these two worlds are very nice projects and I’m hoping that these two worlds collide in just the right way to produce things that are good for society, that are good examplars of blockchain technology, and provide some incentives for the operators to stay in business. In its current state, what do you think needs to happen — and maybe isn’t happening — to provide the groundwork for adoption by non-technical people? That’s a great question. Almost everybody else you’ll talk to will tell you, “Oh it has to be more useable. We have to have wallets that make it easier.” That’s all true. But let me tell you about two things that they will not tell you that I think are essential. Number one: the architecture of these systems is incredibly complicated. Therefore, I don’t believe it’s a matter of just [putting] a thin veneer in front of the user. I don’t think the usability problem stems from the lack of bad wallet software — which we have. We have bad wallets. But I don’t think we can possibly have good wallets over the systems that exist today. They’re too complicated. You definitely need to understand the concept of mempool if you’re going to be dealing with bitcoin. You can’t just pay with bitcoin. It might look like you did, but at the end of the day, somebody will check to see if your transaction was committed into the blockchain or whether it got stuck in the mempool  — that’s a phrase, and every bitcoin user knows what that phrase means because they have to. It’s part of the architecture. There’s no using bitcoin without knowing it. So that’s problem number one: the architecture has to get simplified. Problem number two is the social frameworks — the social architecture around these systems has to change. That current social architecture right now, is based on hodling. It’s based on holding your coin and riding its inevitable rise to the moon and finding other people to buy into your coin and getting rich by selling to them and so forth. That’s a terrible way to be and the sooner we get out of that mode the better. You had mentioned something in an interview that when you talk about the real value of a currency, that the value really comes from the community that uses it. What might happen when there are many communities using many different things and they might not agree on what’s valuable? Sure, I think that all of these systems that people build are human-serving systems. Especially in the early days of cryptocurrencies, we had a lot of people proselytizing about how these systems are immutable, unchangeable. That their algorithms are baked into them and cannot change — and therefore you have some assurance. None of those narratives are actually true. As we saw with various different blockchain projects that when humans decide that these things are not serving them, they change them. The 21 million limit in Bitcoin got blown through when people started making forks of Bitcoin. So there are many more than 21 million sum total tokens going by the name Bitcoin right now. What, really, then is the constant that you can rely on? What is that you have assurance in? That assurance comes not from any software but from the community itself. If there’s a community out there with your shared beliefs about how this money should be governed, those shared beliefs are what you can count on. Those and those alone, nothing else. It is not the software that protects you. It’s the community. The security of the coin is really something that emerges out of the community itself. So that, I think, is the most critical thing to realize about these things: communities are essential. They are what give rise to various incentive structures. A community that’s healthy will have a number of striated tasks and lots of capable people following out those tasks — developers, proselytizers, merchants, various different service providers, and so forth — as with any currency system. There is a lot of infrastructure out there for you to have the green dollar in your back pocket. Same with cryptocurrency. For you to be able to pay at a website, a lot of things have to be there in the background. There have to be educational materials for people who do development. There have to be a healthy dev community. There have to be multiple dev communities so you’re not at the mercy of a single dev community controlling everything you do, and so on and so forth. Those are essential, and very few cryptocurrencies actually possess those properties right now. It’s less than three. In your blog, you mention that sometimes you may have to call out mistakes that may be made in zeal, especially around adoption and things like that. Is there any trend you find worrisome in any of the ecosystems today? There are many, and I could pick on quite a few. Let’s pick on, as of today what I’ve been thinking about — and quite a bit for the last few weeks — is the energy consumption in proof-of-work systems. I think one of the reasons the local currency movement has shied away from coins like bitcoin and other proof-of-work based coins is that they are not sustainable. They end up consuming a lot of energy. How much energy? Well, Bitcoin’s consumption alone is the same as all of Denmark’s. If you want to visualize exactly what that is, it’s about two giant nuclear reactor’s worth. And it’s not the case that the energy used for Bitcoin comes from sustainable sources, exclusively, anyway. So some people have said that this is a way for China to export coal over the internet. They burn the coal in China, they pollute the air there, they mine/ manufacture these Bitcoins that they sell to westerners who then use it for hodling or whatever else it is that they’re doing. Yeah exactly, it’s where the electricity is subsidized, usually. Right, some of it comes from surplus hydroelectric power that they have in the Sichuan Province and that’s fine. But undoubtedly, some of it comes from other sources — dirty sources of electricity that they just have and don’t know what to do with. So these are not… this is not a good way to run any system and these miners are not really providing a high degree of decentralization. We did a recent study that was published in the last nine months or so that examined decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum. It found that Bitcoin has, essentially — roughly speaking — about nineteen mining entities. Pools and solo miners combined. So, nineteen of them is almost nothing. It’s not very hard to take those nineteen people and — the task that any one of these folks is carrying out is nothing that different from what you would be carrying out without any of the hardware. We can build systems for nineteen people to cooperate and they will sequence transactions and validate them just as well as they do with mining hardware. So all that hardware is some kind of a race among the miners themselves, but the sum total decentralization they bring to bear is only nineteen. And three of them make up the majority of the hash power. So you’re really buying into what in Bitcoin parlance is called three out of nineteen multisig. If those three people accept your transaction, then you’re in. And if they don’t, then you’re kinda out. (Sorry, I’m mistaken, I should’ve said four out of nineteen multisig for Bitcoin. It’s three out of eleven for Ethereum.) So the numbers are pitifully small, and we don’t get much decentralization, and the impact on the environment is huge so we very much need technologies that can make this entire process green. So there are a lot of consensus mechanisms out there that are in the works… No, there are not. There are many different whitepapers floating around but all of it comes down to two different approaches, plus a new one that was unveiled last week and I had a hand in the unveiling, so let me tell you a little bit about this. “It describes three protocols: Snowflake, Snowball, Avalanche and they have a very curious property. They combine the best of Nakamoto consensus with the best of classical.” There are only two classes of consensus protocols out there. One of them is called classical consensus , and it was developed by people like Leslie Lamport and Barbara Liskov , both of whom have Turing Awards. In classical consensus, the core protocols work by defining who’s in the system — who’s a validator, who’s making decisions — and then agreeing when they’ve made a decision. They have a bunch of protocols deciding for exactly when a decision is committed. They’re very fast, but as ­­­­I said they require that we know who’s participating. So they’re not usable for open currencies like Bitcoin, but they are used for permissioned blockchains. All of these company-oriented sector-based efforts — for example, when people talk about putting a supply chain on a blockchain — they are typically talking about using a permissioned blockchain, using one of these protocols. So that’s one approach. There are many different names that it goes under — HyperLedger, Tendermint, DPoS, Delegated Proof of Stake, Proof of Stake — all of these different approaches fall under that category. And on the other side, you have Nakamoto consensus , invented by Satoshi himself. Satoshi does not have a Turing Award, but he has about $10 billion worth of coins so he’s well-compensated if he should ever go and claim his coins. So those are the only two, or those were the only two until last week [May 16, 2018] when a new paper was released and it came out with a third way of doing things. The paper is called “ From Snowflake to Avalanche ” and it describes three protocols: Snowflake, Snowball, Avalanche and they have a very curious property. They combine the best of Nakamoto consensus with the best of classical. In Nakamoto Consensus, of course, it’s all open. Anybody can join. You don’t need to get permission because I don’t need to know who’s participating in the system. Nobody needs to know. You just kind of solve a crypto puzzle and you end up owning some coins. So that’s lovely about Nakamoto Consensus, except it’s not green, it’s not sustainable. There are also inherent performance limitations. These blocks need to come only so often — say, every ten minutes — which means that your transaction is not in the ledger for ten minutes. And there’s a particular throughput, for Bitcoin it’s only three transactions per second. So this new protocol family — from Snowflake to Avalanche — upends all of this. It says, “Look, we can combine the best of the two. We can give you quick finality, high performance, without having to know who all is in the system, but we approximately agree that’s great. We don’t need to precisely agree.” We can make it work without any of this non-sustainable proof-of-work mining. We don’t have to burn energy if there’s no decision to be made. It’s a quiescent protocol. So this, I think, is groundbreaking and it’s completely going to change the scene in two years to come. So the thing I was leading up to with that question was also that… so let’s say there is this technical ability to make the consensus protocol really great — so if Bitcoin is still the most hyped-up currency and then people push up the demand for it, won’t it just continue with proof-of-work and continue to burn through? Yeah, so essentially the question here is, what benefits are there to be had from… three sources. One, being the first mover. Second having the mine share that Bitcoin has collected over the eight years of its existence — and we all contributed to that. We all worked really hard. I mean, I translated Bitcoin wallet software to my own native language, Turkish. We went and gave talks. I briefed politicians, many different ones on different occasions. So we worked hard to get this thing accepted and into the public’s mind. So we pushed for Bitcoin and Bitcoin is enjoying the fruits of all of that labor. And so you might ask, “Is this going to continue forever?” And of course the third thing is, “What are the economies of scale?” If everybody is using Bitcoin, aren’t you better off if you use Bitcoin yourself? “…there is nothing about Bitcoin that makes it a good store of value. That line of narrative is incredibly dangerous.” There’s this thing called Metcalf’s Law, which says that the value of a system like this is n-squared the number of participants. So you have n people using the system, the value that can get generated is n-squared . This is called a law and Metcalf postulated it. It’s not a law. There’s no proof of it — it’s just a conjecture. Every indication is that the conjecture is false, that you do not have n-squared interactions in a universe of n people. You are not as likely to interact with everybody else in the system. You will typically go through certain channels and those channels become choke points. There are power laws in effect where some people are people that everybody interacts [with], everybody buys from Amazon these days, right? So people go to those kinds of merchants and you don’t necessarily go and exchange money with your next-door-neighbor. I don’t believe that the third one is an issue — that is, I don’t believe that it’s n-squared. We have seen Bitcoin and get bigger as a result of the division, so that tells us that that’s not true — that n-squared is not true. If that were true, then by dividing up into two small systems, you would have a net loss, but instead we had an increase in the market cap of Bitcoin after division. So, that says Metcalf’s Law is completely wrong and so then there are two sources — technical reasons for why the first two issues (the mine share and so forth) might alter and will send people going to other points. Bitcoin itself is technically very hard to use right now. It’s incredibly limited in its scale and its performance and when the network is congested, the fees go sky-high. People have paid hundreds of dollars to do a transaction in a timely fashion. That’s not a useable system. So we need to make these things incredibly efficient, not like this. I just want to play Devil’s Advocate for a second, because with the community currency stuff, there’s this distinction between a store of value currency and a means of exchange currency. Not in my mind. Well, functionally, there has been historically. Ok, I’m all ears. For instance you can… there have been a few instances in history when you could equip a currency with something called demurrage . You might know negative interest but there are ways to do it — even non-technical ways like putting a physical stamp on it. That speeds up circulation. But you could have this situation in which the demand continues to rise and the valuation continues to rise and then it won’t be the transactional velocity that keeps it continuation. It could just be this idea that, “Well, it’s going to continue to rise,” and then that could be made true, simply because of that belief. Ok, so let me very clearly try to delineate why the store of value narrative is incredibly dangerous when applied to cryptocurrencies. Everything you said about past forms of money and past forms of money and past stores of value is true. There are things that are universally valued, that you know there exist a constant level of demand, so you can treat them as a source of value. It’s like if you have grain tucked away some place in safe storage, you know how much demand is going to be there for it, year after year. So that can provide you that safety net — the value you can trade that for is pretty much set. When it comes to these online currencies, they’re really all a bunch of funny numbers. There is nothing inherently valuable about them. Nobody will want any of these funny numbers and all of the these funny numbers are fungible — they are about the same. So if you have Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash vs. whatever else, those things are not all that different from each other in the function they serve . So there is nothing about Bitcoin that makes it a good store of value. That line of narrative is incredibly dangerous. It has been used to sell Bitcoin to the masses who don’t understand where that value is going to come from. That value can only come from other people buying into the system. And so what you’re really doing is you’re betting on somebody else coming in. You’re betting on riding the adoption curve upwards. At some point, there will be no more people to jump into this system and it’s very, very similar to an inadvertent pyramid scheme — without a single beneficiary. So essentially what’s going on is in a distributed, decentralized fashion, these people are trying to jump into the coin early to benefit from people who jump in late. That’s no good way to make money. It’s not societally good, it doesn’t produce actually value in a tangible form, it doesn’t make anybody’s life better. These coins are useful when you can send them across the internet, when they serve as a payment mechanism. The coin that you hold and don’t spend — can’t spend (or can’t spend without paying exorbitant fees) is a worthless coin. That’s what we saw with Bitcoin over the course of the last year. When the fees went up, as we predicted they would, people stopped using Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s dominance dropped because people did not want to pay those extreme fees. Its folly to invest in these things because they are seen as valuable. There’s nothing that makes them inherently valued. What do you see as the non-financial use-cases that are most primed to take hold, and what ones are you most interested in and excited about? I mostly work at the infrastructure layer, so I’m application agnostic. So when I do research, most of my research is something that is applicable to all blockchains across the board. But having said that, I am most excited about blockchain applications in insurance, because insurance companies are opaque, monolithic beings and they tend to go under. You can’t really see what’s going on inside them. The regulation around them is cantankerous to say the least. So that is ready to be disrupted. Those monoliths will find themselves facing an existential crisis unless they adapt. I’m also very excited about this new idea that we are calling autonomous blockchains , where two people can engage in secure communications and secure data sharing without recourse to a public blockchain — without having to make any of the information public and without a private blockchain, either, without having to designate third-parties to hold their data. So you and I, or me and anybody else who is part of the system can start running nodes that we ourselves cannot tamper with. That provides the necessary basis for trust. That provides auditability and transparency that we seek in blockchains.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.initc3.org/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport", "https://unsplash.com/@chrisliverani?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral", "https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03998", "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUy4jh5mGNZvLkjies1RWM4YuvJh5o2FYopNPVYwrRVGV", "http://creativecommons.org/ns#", "http://community-currency.info/en/glossary/demurrage/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emin gün sirer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unsplash emin gün sirer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sirer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris liverani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cornell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornell university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T16:11:40.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b56a295788514b152704208b42fbce7d50253395", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMChmXmHvQZojE_f56rzqOKnr0z6pV5pRmt1vBIw.5yK53Gzlzf3XDxKDMb9Tf7GMiiHxdONUesnBXEXxDXK9fSY0W7UCGr1ve4KJ476QdMWB", "site_full": "www.thelincolnianonline.com", "site": "thelincolnianonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thelincolnianonline.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Lincolnian Online", "title": "Super Bitcoin Reaches Market Capitalization of $0.00 (CRYPTO:SBTC)", "title_full": "Super Bitcoin Reaches Market Capitalization of $0.00 (CRYPTO:SBTC)", "published": "2018-06-05T15:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2282.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b56a295788514b152704208b42fbce7d50253395", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMChmXmHvQZojE_f56rzqOKnr0z6pV5pRmt1vBIw.5yK53Gzlzf3XDxKDMb9Tf7GMiiHxdONUesnBXEXxDXK9fSY0W7UCGr1ve4KJ476QdMWB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dante Gardener", "published": "2018-06-05T15:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Super Bitcoin Reaches Market Capitalization of $0.00 (CRYPTO:SBTC)", "text": "Super Bitcoin Reaches Market Capitalization of $0.00 (CRYPTO:SBTC) Posted by Dante Gardener | Jun 5th, 2018\nSuper Bitcoin (CURRENCY:SBTC) traded 2.3% higher against the dollar during the one day period ending at 8:00 AM E.T. on May 13th.

So it’s important to consider the true profitability of your venture before choosing your next mining rig. Mining can be a great way to enter the cryptomarket if done correctly. But many a newbie miner has rushed in only to learn from expensive, career-ending mistakes. Avoid these all-too-common errors and start mining cryptocurrency the right way. Market Value\nOne of the most important factors in determining the overall profitability of your mining venture is the market value of Bitcoin. Remember, Bitcoin is volatile and any drop in market value can have a serious effect on your mining profitability. In 2011, you could mine 100 BTC using nothing more than your home CPU. Bitcoin Market Value\nOf course, the mining sector wasn’t overly saturated yet and BTC was going for around $2 a coin. Fast-forward to today’s mining situation and you can quickly see the competition has increased equivalent to the rise in BTC’s market value.\nToday, you need to be prepared to make a sizable investment in Bitcoin mining hardware if you want to mine BTC. Mining Difficulty\nThe BTC blockchain mining difficulty is manipulated to reflect the computing power of the network and ensure it coincides with the preferred network block time. The difficulty of the BTC blockchain is adjusted every 2,016 blocks based on the time it took to find the previous 2,016 blocks.\nIdeally, the network should average one block every 10 minutes, or 2,016 blocks every two weeks.\nBlock times have been a hot issue in the crypto community. Bitcoin Cash started as an exact copy of BTC but with a larger block size. This hard fork of the BTC network has spawned endless debates about the validity of Bitcoin Cash. It has also ushered in a new age of BTC hard forks . Electricity Costs\nOne of the most important factors to consider when investing in Bitcoin mining hardware is your electricity costs. The Proof-of-Work computations require extensive amounts of processing power to be used in the calculations. This results in high electricity consumption by mining rigs. These costs can quickly gobble up your profits and leave you singing the crypto blues.\nLow-cost or even renewable energy should be a big part of your mining strategy. Large mining facilities are built in remote regions of the world that can provide access to cheap power and natural cool air.\nMining rigs give off a lot of heat when they’re in operation and ventilation must be accounted for when determining your overall electrical costs. Bitcoin Mining Hardware Costs\nYou better be prepared to make a serious investment if you’re considering entering the mining sector. ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Chip) mining rigs will provide you with the best results, but they’ll also set you back over $1,000. The best ASIC rigs can go for $5,000 and up.\nASIC Miners are More Efficient\nGPU (Graphic Processing Unit) mining rigs are significantly cheaper, but they don’t compare to ASIC rigs in terms of results. That being said, you can still get decent returns using a GPU miner, you just need to join a mining pool.\nMining pools such as Minergate combine the computing power of every user on their platform. This evens the mining playing field against huge mega-mining operations. The block rewards are split between all of the parties involved in the pool according to their contributions.\nGPU processors are difficult to find at the moment because of all of the hype surrounding BTC mining. You can expect to search pretty hard to find an available and fairly priced GPU online.\nThe good news is, unlike ASIC rigs, GPU rigs can mine multiple cryptocurrencies, as they are not preprogrammed to any hash in particular. This gives the flexibility to alter the coins you mine according to the profitability of the coin.\nGPU GeForce Card Mining Fees\nMining fees are used to incentivize miners. These fees are paid every time BTC is sent through the blockchain. Miners are a critical part of the BTC ecosystem and mining fees ensure that the BTC network continues to have a large hash rate, which keeps the network secure.\nMining fees motivate miners to include a transaction in the block. Once the number of BTC that has been mined reaches 21 million, or the total amount of BTC, mining fees will be the primary source of revenue for BTC miners moving forward.\nYou can expect to see some mining fee adjustments made at that time to ensure that becoming a network node continues to be lucrative. Block Rewards\nBlock rewards are given to the node that successfully completes the Proof-of-Work algorithm first. The BTC block reward system is designed to halve every 210,000 blocks. Currently, the reward is 12.5 blocks.\nOriginally, a miner would have earned 50 BTC per block. At today’s BTC market value, that’s a pretty penny.\nUsing the current block size and difficulty, block rewards are reduced every four years. There are currently 17,055,038 BTC in circulation out of the total 21,000,000 to be mined. This leaves only 3,944,963 BTC left to mine.\nAt the current rate, you can expect the last BTC to be mined on May 28th, 2020. Transaction Fees\nTransaction fees have been a serious concern for miners since 2016. In the early days of BTC, you could send a BTC for pennies and it would arrive almost instantaneously. Now, due to the scalability issues plaguing the network, you can expect to pay much more to send your BTC.\nThese transaction fees can have a negative effect on your bottom line and must be taken into consideration in your overall mining strategy and whether to purchase bitcoin mining hardware. Bitcoin Mining Hardware – Is it Worth It?\nThe answer to this question is it depends on where you live and what level of investment you’re willing to make. You may find that you live close to a renewable energy source and therefore, can run the most powerful mining rigs possible without killing your profits on electricity.\nExamine the points in this guide and be sure to configure a BTC mining business structure that works for you.\nWhat do you guys think?

Really, it is just totally, completely strange,” Pearson wrote . “ To my ear, it lies somewhere between a schoolteacher reading a book to children very slowly, slam poetry, and frankly just very bad singing.”\nI will leave it up to you to watch the video and decide whether Draper’s performance qualifies as “rap” or “noise,” but as far as I am concerned — I haven’t been able to stop myself from humming Draper’s lyrics ever since I first listened to them. “I am a Bitcoin hustle…I am a blockchain bustle…Get your hustle going, flex your crypto muscle, yaaay!”\nIf you want to watch the whole video of Draper’s interview, you can see it here: Published June 5, 2018 — 12:15 UTC June 5, 2018 — 12:15 UTC Show comments ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evkz9j/craig-wright-walk-out-conference-taiwan-jack-liao", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIkGX0VEVCQ", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-25/billionaire-draper-turns-into-mc-crypto-to-extol-bitcoin-virtues"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim draper", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justina lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neer varshney tim draper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "draper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan pearson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T16:01:47.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3b6f35fc338202637686624efd8a6b312a83a0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo1odQW3rElXTybRqSdxdFOh6jCyQsNA_t01uVf_huXPQUSYNS_kEQZOXLwBJTaannhArbl.I5JFVELnMOQhPC__Np7XD77qWI-", "site_full": "thegrid.soup.io", "site": "soup.io", "site_section": "http://theGRID.soup.io/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "theGRID", "title": "Watch Tim Draper ‘rap’ about Bitcoin at #TNW2018", "title_full": "Watch Tim Draper ‘rap’ about Bitcoin at #TNW2018", "published": "2018-06-05T15:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://asset-a.soupcdn.com/asset/14387/5517_ae68.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9200, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3b6f35fc338202637686624efd8a6b312a83a0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo1odQW3rElXTybRqSdxdFOh6jCyQsNA_t01uVf_huXPQUSYNS_kEQZOXLwBJTaannhArbl.I5JFVELnMOQhPC__Np7XD77qWI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T15:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Watch Tim Draper ‘rap’ about Bitcoin at #TNW2018", "text": " 12:15 Watch Tim Draper ‘rap’ about Bitcoin at #TNW2018 # Don't be the product, buy the product!

Now his name is being dragged in the Rs 2000 Crore Bitcoin scam that is currently being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).\nAlso Read: Kareena Kapoor BLASTS Feminists For Their Non-stop Lecture, Says She's A Feminist In The RIGHT WAY\nAs per reports, Raj Kundra's name popped up when the main accused of the Bitcoin scam, Amit Bharadwaj was being interrogated by the ED. Raj Kundra has now been summoned for further questioning. Those who were dealing with bitcoins worth Rs 1 Crore or more were sent notices by the Income Tax Department recently, and the names were also forwarded to Enforcement Directorate.\nThe Enforcement Directorate immediately initiated possible money laundering and fraud. They started the investigation by questioning most of the people who were mentioned in the list. Also, the nature of ED's questioning of Raj Kundra is not yet clear. It is reported that many names of Bollywood celebrities might crop up during further investigations by the ED.\nApart from the IPL betting and Bitcoin scam, Raj Kundra was also involved in a Twitter brawl with Sachin Joshi and they called each other, a fraud. Raj Kundra had started the Indian Poker League and called out Sachin Joshi over non-payment of dues of Rs 40 Lakh. However, Sachin Joshi accused Raj Kundra of rigging the tournament and the Twitter fight went on for days.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "akshay kumar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amit bharadwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kareena kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "indian premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajasthan royals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "income tax department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T15:19:55.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68fc2f555c705aef9b051d7433a0b2c3fc24d7ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUgcfw28le1JSZ_IxC0riwQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin and retirement - how do you see your future?", "title_full": "Bitcoin and retirement - how do you see your future?", "published": "2018-06-05T15:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68fc2f555c705aef9b051d7433a0b2c3fc24d7ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUgcfw28le1JSZ_IxC0riwQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aso118", "published": "2018-06-05T15:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin and retirement - how do you see your future?", "text": "Quote: from: CrazeCoinz on June 02, 2018, 10:11:54 AM I will not take a gamble for my retirement in this high risk investment.

Wozniak explained that he used blockchain to make secure payments while travelling abroad.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions,” said Wozniak, who also owns two ether crypto coins.\nHe announced recently that he has sold all but one bitcoin. The world’s top digital currency was trading at $7,454 on Tuesday.\nCurrently, there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, but Wozniak says that bitcoin is the only one that remains “pure” because others have had to give up some of the aspects that makes bitcoin what it is.\n“Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control.

The interest has somewhat dampened since the precipitous drop in January 2018, but the questions still linger.\nThe currency, and the multitude of other cryptocurrencies that have sprung up, relies on blockchain technology, a computerized ledger system that processes transactions (completed blocks) via secured wallets and keys.\nThe three biggest differences between cryptocurrencies and traditional government-issued currency are: Cryptocurrencies are digital and stored on a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies have zero government oversight. Bitcoin supply is limited or defined based on mining, unlike government-issued currency, which governments can print more of or shrink supply based on demand.\nIf you are not mining bitcoin, the purchase process is similar to valuing and purchasing art, which is one of the reasons the government treats bitcoin as property for tax purposes. The value of cryptocurrency is pure supply and demand and is based on an individual transaction at an exchange with your standard currency. With bitcoin, exchanges at any given moment in time can vary greatly. Advertisement Issues for 401(k) sponsors and participants.\nHow can a plan offer bitcoin to their participants? Currently, no mutual fund, collective investment fund or ETF in the United States has a fund exclusively invested in bitcoin or cryptocurrency.\nSince a vast majority of 401(k) plans use these types of funds to trade daily for participants, bitcoin will not be a mainstream investment option. It is possible to purchase bitcoin futures on certain exchanges, however these can only be accessed by brokerage accounts that permit purchases in these exchanges.\nMany plan sponsors that offer brokerage accounts restrict purchases to mainstream investments, such as mutual funds, ETFs and the major stock exchanges. Taking this down a different road, bitcoin owners store and track the bitcoin in wallets. A plan sponsor generally holds one position of each security on behalf of all participants. That means someone must hold the password for the wallet, which could be the plan sponsor or their selected recordkeeping service provider.\nThink about the difficulties of trading between a mutual fund and a bitcoin wallet. There is no market close on bitcoin like there is with mutual funds, nor is there one recognized price or trading price. Advertisement The fiduciary element.\nHowever, the greater consideration for plan fiduciaries is they must act as in the best interest of plan participants. The question a fiduciary must ask: Do they want to permit investments that are not regulated in any way, shape or form by any government? One can argue the futures exchange is regulated, it is, but the underlying investment is not.\nHere’s another way to look at this from a fiduciary perspective. Traditional investments, such as bank or money market accounts, have protections by the FDIC. Investments in brokerage accounts or mutual funds whereby assets go missing are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). Both the FDIC and SIPC have maximum protection per investor (the investor in a 401(k) plan is the plan, not the participant). See Also: The Bitcoin Bubble Will Burst, Just Wait\nBitcoin has zero protection for the investor in the event of fraud or a heist of your wallet. In addition, your bitcoin wallet has one password that is super long, and there is no password reset. If that password is ever lost, your bitcoin is lost! This is wide open for fraud at the 401(k) level, as to who should hold the password for the plan.\nTaking it a step further, what if plan sponsors permitted each participant to have their own wallet and then they lost their wallet? In a litigious society, you know where this is going. An estimated 25% of bitcoins that were in circulation — $18 billion in value — are unrecoverable because of lost keys or wallets. Advertisement\nAs fiduciaries, plan sponsors will be reluctant to offer a cryptocurrency as an investment option because of the volatility, lack of risk analysis, lack of government oversight and the hassle factor involved in administration.\nBitcoin is available for investment with your monies outside of a company plan. For example, you can already access it through a self-directed IRA , which could be a good option as it encourages investors to do this outside their 401(k) with IRA or after-tax monies. Since sponsors of 401(k) plans face potential litigation from participants related to their fiduciary responsibility, you will most likely not see bitcoin as an investment option until there is government oversight and efficient trading platforms within a 401(k) plan.

But the big story, without a doubt, is Woz’s undying commitment to the idea of bitcoin. Advertisements\nAlso Read: Crypto Point-of-Sale Devices Begin Roll-Out in Indonesia Despite Ban Apple Co-Founder’s High Hopes for Bitcoin\nSteve Wozniak, the genius co-founder of Apple Computers, has once again spoken about his fascination with the tech and principles of bitcoin. “Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions,” he told CNBC. “Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that,” Woz added. Okex’s New Exchange Traded Tracker (ETT)\nOkex, the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes. It includes six coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS, and OKB) and requires USDT to subscribe. The minimum subscription for the instruments is 100 units.\nA couple of days ago, we reported that Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on an index of ten assets. Bitoasis Resumes Dirham Transactions\nLast month, Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitoasis enacted a suspension of deposits and withdrawals in UAE dirhams. This Monday, without explaining what was the cause of the issue, the company announced that transactions are reinstated. In a letter to its clients, quoted by Arabian Business , Bitoasis apologized for the inconvenience and said that now “users can deposit and withdraw their funds in AED as usual, without any interruption.”\n“In light of the recent inconsistency of service across our payment options, we will be revising and updating the options available to our customers on the platform to ensure continuity of our services,” the Bitoasis statement continued. “We will be notifying our customers with the update on our new payment options soon.” Myetherwallet Attack Blamed on Russian Hackers, Uneducated Users\nMyetherwallet (MEW), the web’s most popular client-side ethereum wallet, has been compromised by a DNS attack on April 24, 2018. Today the team behind the wallet issued a response to the event, further explaining what happened and detailing the steps taken to prevent its reoccurrence.\nThey say that the attack was carried out by a native Russian speaker, which was able to phish only about $150,000 worth of ether from MEW users. They quote Internet Security experts as explaining that the “financial resources required for such an attack likely exceeds the amount of funds taken.”\nThe team added that it is a lack of safety education that led some clients to fall for the fraud. “We hope that from this experience, every single person who interacts with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain will understand how important self-education is. In the end, you and only you are responsible for your security.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news? Is bitcoin going to be the world’s single currency in ten years?

This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nA rising window occurred (where the top of the previous shadow is below the bottom of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bullish trend. There have been 24 rising windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current rising window even more bullish.\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 81.9450. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a buy 2 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 39.73. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 45 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -47. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a buy 3 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 16 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed up 58.854 at 7,490.527.

The cryptocurrency that will be accepted currently is LCGC (Life Care Global Coin) which are issued by Hong Kong based business GCM in partnership with Lotte.\n“We plan to continue expanding our services and technology platform to enable many people in Korea to enjoy excellent medical services and help overseas patients easily access Korean medical services,” the hospital said.\nIn order to solve the problem of slow transaction speed of cryptocurrency, KMP Healthcare will only support LCGC initially, but they plan to add more cryptocurrency in the future.\nCryptocurrencies are legal in South Korea.

Experts claim that the reason for this recent downfall is the high electricity consumption and usage of natural resources for mining of bitcoins.\nIn the initial days of bitcoin, mining was comparatively simple, everyday usage laptops were being used for mining bitcoins and the reward was very good too. With the mainstream adoption of bitcoin, things have changed. Nowadays, high powered gaming laptops are used as the mining tools which are expensive and consume way too much electricity. This high electricity consumption will lead to depletion of energy resources for normal daily life errands and hence it can drastically impact the economy of a country. Some governments around the world are deeming bitcoin mining illegal for the same reason.\nIf the world continues to mine bitcoins at this pace (100,000 miners are expected to be out there mining bitcoins only), we will soon be facing depletion and a gradual shortage of electrical energy. Although, many alternatives are being introduced to mine bitcoins through solar energy and other natural resources but these are not adopted in the mainstream.\nAs Bitcoin continues to decline, people are becoming skeptical when it comes to investment. But there are people like John McAfee who believes bitcoin will reach $1M in value by 2020 and Tim Draper who believes bitcoin will be $250,000 by 2025 .\nOwing to these believers and endorsers of bitcoins, the rate of mining is only seeing a surge. Only time will tell if these miners will reap fruits of profit by investing heavily on these mining rigs. × TechJuice for Browser : Get breaking news notifications on your browser.

Think Brisbane International Airport Jun 5, 2018\nBrisbane International Airport is now accepting Dash, ETH, Bitcoin, Monero, and Doge as a form of payment billing itself as the first airport to proudly accept cryptocurrency. Every store inside the airport is now accepting cryptocurrency. One can also see the live transaction on their website and travelers from all over the world are testing the same.\nPayments are made easy with the use of an app with no hardware requirement, and payments are done by just scanning the QR code from this app. World first crypto-friendly airport\nCaleb Yeoh, CEO of Travelbybit said to Nugget’s news channel:\n” blockchain technology has the ability to make transactions and global commerce a lot more efficient and a lot more transparent, the payments are close to instant and there are no exchange rate fees and there are no bank fees”.\nA representative from Brisbane International said:\n“for us its really important passengers choice and how they want to interact with an agent about their journey, as well as helping our retailers maintain relevance and resilience against the threat of online shopping. Supporting local startup talent and reinvesting into the big community is big for us and then finally what we can learn from it.”\nThe third busiest airstrip in the country now encourages individuals traveling to Brisbane or South East Queensland in Australia to spend cryptocurrency at the airport. This comes as a result of the partnership between Brisbane Airport Corporations [BAC] and Australian payment provider ‘travelbybit’. BAC also aims to learn about the cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions so it can possibly help further operations within the international airport.\nThe BAC representative also said:\n“we’re happy to partner with Caleb and help our retailers explore this brave new world of cryptocurrency. A lot of businesses have come to us asking how do we accept crypto and this has in turn attracted a lot of businesses for us.”\nA Twitter user commenting about the display board at counters said:\n“Good job.

Reports have surfaced that Raj Kundra has been alleged to have links with Amit Bhardwaj, who has been accused of $300 Mn bitcoin scam.\nThe reports said that Raj Kundra was questioned in connection with the above-mentioned scam that the ED is probing at the moment and his name has cropped up during Amit Bharadwaj’s interrogation.\nEven though there has been no official confirmation on the role of Raj Kundra in the case, it has been alleged that Raj Kundra promoted one of the platforms held by Bhardwaj. Amit Bhardwaj: $300 Mn Bitcoin Scamster\nThe Economic Offences Wing (EOW) and Cyber Cell of the Pune police, on April 5, informed that they had arrested the alleged cryptocurrency scamster, Amit Bhardwaj, in connection with $300 Mn Bitcoin scam.\nThe complaint was registered under Sections 406, 420 and 34, including the Information Act 4 and 5 and the MPID Act 3 . Another police complaint was registered at the Nigdi police station.\nAt the time, the police informed that before Bhardwaj’s arrest, seven people — including Hemant Vishwas, Hemant Babasaheb Chavan, Ajay Tanaji Saheb, Pankaj Srinandkishore and Chandrakant Bhope — had been arrested in the scam. Recently, Darwin Labs founders Sahil Baghla (former Bluegape founder) and Nikunj Jain (former Frankly.me founder and an angel investor) had been arrested in connection with Amit Bhardwaj.\nThe scam came to light when, in July last year, Zakhil Suresh, a GainBitcoin investor, had started a petition on change.org . Signed by more than a thousand people, the petition appealed for Bhardwaj’s arrest for alleged fraudulent schemes.\nSince then, hundreds of people claimed that it takes just a couple of minutes to invest in GainBitcoin. However, “you need to wait for months and months but you won’t be able to withdraw your money back”.\nIn 2016, Amit Bhardwaj had established a slew of startups which were dealing with all the aspects of cryptocurrencies – mining, exchange, wallet, research and development, and MLM schemes.\nThese include AmazeMiners, GB Miners, GainBitcoin and CoinBank under the parent company Amaze Mining And Blockchain Research Ltd, registered in Hong Kong. He had even gone on to coin a new cryptocurrency, MCAP. Raj Kundra And The Controversies\nThis isn’t the first time that Kundra has been found on the wrong side of the court, as he had admitted to placing bets in IPL (Indian Premier League) and has been serving a life ban from all cricket-related activities. However, in March, Raj Kundra filed a petition in Supreme Court challenging the ban. Post his bets, Rajasthan Royals, a franchise he co-owns, was also banned for two years and returned in this year’s IPL.\nAlso, Raj Kundra had also accused actor Sachiin Joshi of non-payment of dues. He had alleged that Joshi had bought a team in Indian Poker League (a tournament started by Raj Kundra) but his cheque for (INR 40 lakh) had bounced. At the same time, Sachiin accused Kundra of ‘rigging the tournament’ because of which, he backed out.\nAs cryptocurrency firms, enthusiasts and organisations moved various courts against the RBI circular dated April 6 , the Supreme Court (SC) of India, upon hearing a related case, has directed to club all the petitions pending across various courts in this regard and has scheduled next hearing for July 20.\nFurther, RBI’s grace period to banks – dealing with cryptocurrency entities – is set to end next month, the scams like those of Amit Bhardwaj have kept the government and authorities on toes.

By June 5, 2018\nBy Jayant Singhal\nThe ‘Application’, just launched by a Scottish hospital as a unit to help in the rehab process of people who have been indulged in the activity of trading cryptocurrencies a lot, seems to be drawing a lot of attention.\nApparently, the boundless growth of cryptocurrencies and its mainstream adoption tends to coincide with its proponent’s view that the trade of cryptocurrencies (with many other digital currencies) is rather similar to a bet on the future.\nIts development would push the pace for the decentralised technological advancements that would surely ruin the current system of banking, payments & fiat currencies.\nNevertheless, gambling would still be gambling, doesn’t matter if it is based on some kind of rational or adaptive expectations.\nLike all its other forms, it could have a severe impact on the health and could be strongly addictive in nature.\nCryptocurrency = Gambling\nIn light of this scheme, the Scottish hospital, Castle Craig has launched a rehabilitation program that would aid the people addicted to indulging themselves in the exchange of cryptocurrencies like bitcoins, ethereum, etc. to a damn sight extent.\n“ Cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a ‘high’ when they buy or trade a winning currency ,” said Castle Craig Hospital in a press release. “ This can be exciting but also addictive and, like gambling addiction, can be financially disastrous .”\nCastle Craig seems to have developed a comprehensive set of questions that could test whether you are an addict or not, and to what extent your craze for such trading activities is justifiable in terms of your health conditions.\nAs soon as the bitcoin witnessed three consecutive downfall streaks; from its crest in December 2017, it has lost 62%, and since Jan 7, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrency bundles has slumped around $500 billion (Coinmarketcap data suggests), the news about the launch of this application-cum-program was already in the air.\nRead More: Laxmicoin, India’s First Own Digital Cryptocurrency: Here’s All That You Need To Know\nAccording to the hospital authorities, such an addiction is more prevalent amongst youngsters, or among those usually indulging in the environment that promotes the aroma of gambling and its intricacies; like the betting shops, casinos, etc.\nDr. Marks Griffiths who is a professor of behavioural addiction at Nottingham Trent University has reasoned that this addiction is similar to the one observed in other kinds of gambling activities. The hospital also seems to be flooded with the inquiries across the globe regarding this rehab program.\nImage Credits: Google Images", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jayant singhal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "castle craig", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T18:38:52.077+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "148b89f20bf5a1444838c78f4691e038a6d85124", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSdW4lVsxx9SM3xhjXR6T.ydH3cpS5FjyOPqLcUR07GILIrCgpKL1j1NBiX71mGgPufFdBkyKRstB", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Payment gateway that pays me back in Bitcoin", "title_full": "Payment gateway that pays me back in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-05T14:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "148b89f20bf5a1444838c78f4691e038a6d85124", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSdW4lVsxx9SM3xhjXR6T.ydH3cpS5FjyOPqLcUR07GILIrCgpKL1j1NBiX71mGgPufFdBkyKRstB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T14:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Payment gateway that pays me back in Bitcoin", "text": "Payment gateway that pays me back in Bitcoin\n/u/ilhyeongquinn\nHello there,\nI'm looking for some kind of payment gateway that allows my clients to pay with their credit cards and that pays me back directly in Bitcoin.\nDoes anybody know something reliable that would be capable of doing that ?\nThank you\nsubmitted by /u/ilhyeongquinn\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T14:22:29.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf1af951470feb535a3b0909f04df3a525b15d61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3OSYnYmcftF5m3GIM3rc2kMNSiCVn2rrdyw9MchI38R4VI6sbZ2H1fYyyF81_EwixmP6ahigEfhvAIf9oB7aj", "site_full": "www.rt.com", "site": "rt.com", "site_section": "https://www.rt.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RT - Daily news", "title": "Apple founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency", "title_full": "Apple founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency", "published": "2018-06-05T14:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2018.06/article/5b166c42fc7e9397328b4600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 538, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 3}}}, "uuid": "bf1af951470feb535a3b0909f04df3a525b15d61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3OSYnYmcftF5m3GIM3rc2kMNSiCVn2rrdyw9MchI38R4VI6sbZ2H1fYyyF81_EwixmP6ahigEfhvAIf9oB7aj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "RT", "published": "2018-06-05T14:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency", "text": "Apple founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency Published time: 5 Jun, 2018 11:20 Get short URL Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple © Aly Song / Reuters Tech legend Steve Wozniak says he is attracted to the “purity” of the idea that people around the world could one day share a single currency, despite being separated by national borders.\nHe echoed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who recently said that he believes bitcoin will become the single currency worldwide.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak told CNBC on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 conference in Amsterdam.

All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control.

Just I haven't seen any option to enable this in the Antminer GUI. This maybe due to the fact that if was probably academic anyway as solo mining will not generate any coins for you anymore.
