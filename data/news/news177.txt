All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be bought or sold on these cryptocurrency exchanges: CoinTiger, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinone, OTCBTC, CoinBene, Bithumb, IDAX, OKEx, Bittrex, Octaex, Paribu, Trade By Trade, LakeBTC, DragonEX, HitBTC, Hotbit, Kucoin, BCEX, CoinsBank, Livecoin, Omicrex, Simex, GDAX, fex, Upbit, BitMEX, Negocie Coins, C2CX, Gemini, Bibox, CEX.IO, BitForex, WEX, Exmo, EXX, OEX, OOOBTC, BTCBOX, Exrates, BitBay, Cobinhood, Iquant, Coinrail, itBit, Coinsuper, BTCC, Coinroom, Korbit, Coinhub, Huobi, TOPBTC, YoBit, Gate.io, Ethfinex, Binance, Fisco, BtcTrade.im, Tidex, Luno, Fatbtc, Neraex, Zaif, Bit-Z, Bitbank, Kraken, RightBTC, Sistemkoin, xBTCe, ZB.COM, GOPAX, CoinEgg, bitFlyer, CoinEx Market, Poloniex, Bitinka, B2BX, Quoine and Lbank.

If you stacked the pizza boxes you can get for that many Bitcoins today, they’d rise to outer space.\nAt today’s price near $8,200 per Bitcoin, you could get about 6.5 million $12.50 pizzas. If you stacked those pizza boxes, they’d climb almost 200 miles (300 kilometers) into the air, according to data from Forex Time, a foreign exchange broker. Its animated infographic marks the landmarks crossed by the boxes — Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, Mount Everest, a passenger airplane — before shooting into space. Bitcoin isn’t quite getting to the moon, but close.\nAs Bitcoin’s value soared over the years, the developer who made the initial purchase, Laszlo Hanyecz, became a legend in the crypto space and beyond. He’ll forever be known as the guy who forked over assets now valued at $82 million, for pizza. Earlier this year Hanyecz replicated his move using the Lightning Network, a technology that runs parallel to Bitcoin’s blockchain and aims to speed up transactions.\nBitcoin Pizza Day has become a reminder of how much the coin’s price has skyrocketed even after the slump from the record of almost $20,000 last year. The largest cryptocurrency was worth pennies at the time of the first pizza purchase.\n© 2018 Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "burj khalifa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forex time", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "moon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount everest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T10:37:27.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc4cdab273d6ec7e07fb6a636039894dd79e008e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeIny.tkMnEb7ND1JuXvKSw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin, better payment system ?", "title_full": "Bitcoin, better payment system ?", "published": "2018-05-23T01:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.11, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc4cdab273d6ec7e07fb6a636039894dd79e008e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeIny.tkMnEb7ND1JuXvKSw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BossMacko", "published": "2018-05-23T01:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, better payment system ?", "text": "Speaking of experience i can say that Bitcoin is a better payment system not only Bitcoin as long as its crypto currency because payment using crypto is effectively convenient unlike the other way around.

The ad, ran by Dave Min , targets Brian Forde’s donors, calling them “Bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nFile this under: Entertainment for people who hate Democrats.\nA screenshot from the ad.\nMin, A former SEC attorney, who was also an aide for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, ran the ad which – among others – targeted Forde, an Obama-era White House cryptocurrency guru and former head of MIT’s cryptocurrency initiative.\nForde may very well be the first — or at least one of the earliest — American politicians to come out of the crypto-closet and openly accept donations in the form of cryptocurrency. Which makes Min one of the fist politicians to run anti-Bitcoin ads against an opponent.\nWe contacted Forde, who told us:\nWe’ve raised more than $130,000 at crypto.forde.com in response to his sensationalist and wildly inaccurate attacks on me, my supporters, and a technology he clearly does not understand. We’ll use this support to promote our positive message to elect a representative who believes in science, technology, and evidence-based policymaking.\nAs far as we can tell, there’s absolutely no truth to the allegation that one of Forde’s donors said anything remotely close to the language in the attack ad. A report from Axios indicates that Min’s campaign manager feels the language is warranted because Forde accepted donations from a board member of The Bitcoin Foundation, Brock Pierce:\nPierce, while extremely controversial, has never publicly said he opposes “cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking” — but Min’s campaign apparently believes the statement is fair because Bitcoin Foundation opposes certain regulations that could, in theory, make such things more difficult.\nForde responded to the attack in a Facebook post , saying he’d “rather fight for our progressive values than with fellow Democrats, and stay united in our goal of defeating Rep. Mimi Walters and her wholescale endorsement of the dangerous and irrational Trump agenda.”\nWe also reached out to Min, but didn’t immediately receive a response.\nNo matter what your politics are, the tired rhetoric that only criminals use Bitcoin has become borderline bigotry. Criminals use Bitcoin, but not quite as much as they use cash — according to experts . Criminals also use hammers, cars, and AR-15s, but those items don’t seem to be associated with them in the same way cryptocurrency is.\nIt stands to reason, for Min, that being branded a Luddite in a California Congressional district might hurt his campaign’s chances of success.\nAs for Forde, the attack ad may have actually helped his campaign. Cryptocurrency blogger Kiki Shirr, of dyorffs.org , yesterday attended an event celebrating his recent fundraising success.\nShe told TNW:\nThe overall feeling of the night was that none of the honest business innovators in the room wanted to see a Congressperson take office who thought they were no more than human traffickers and drug dealers–and bitcoin and ether donations poured into the Forde wallet as a result.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.axios.com/bitcoin-battle-california-election-dave-mim-brian-forde-525322bf-3198-40b5-8fb5-5fb9d8d2b4f7.html", "https://discover.coinsquare.io/investing/less-than-one-percent-bitcoins-originate-illicit-activity/", "https://www.forde.com/", "https://www.davemin.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/Forde/photos/pcb.1224056571063087/1224056534396424", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/05/22/california-congressional-candidate-goes-after-fellow-democrat-with-anti-bitcoin-attack-ad/", "https://thenextweb.com/topic/bitcoin/", "http://dyorffs.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave min", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "california congressional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T01:37:27.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0ffba03d961979c8cacf01bb38e67770989007a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPsbZglufIwNs.X9Akti5a9aQVjrkZJQSrWFebiQ3LV_pzK.TumS4HT8XpBhPAg6HRO0F7lyqG7WuB2.ESAFqc48-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "The Vin Armani Show (5/21/18) -

Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc , a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier , looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company , not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nLAN network cables plugged into a Bitcoin mining computer server are pictured in Bitminer Factory in Florence, Italy, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier , is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand – especially for high-end machines – was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n“Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n“Investors are always looking for crypto ‘ picks and shovels ‘, and that’s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alun john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T03:13:55.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50d8f73647560f210bdfcd8fc9fd93cab0d04a4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqajc4FxGoczTKCfdtQNf4aI9Gul76qCuI6s8PcNbzoLE87gmVcM8EPfpH6aCUPTbwJbPR79MgKkRTYKHfq76Om2g--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : CryptoCurrency", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating the $80 Million Pizza Order", "title_full": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating the $80 Million Pizza Order : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-23T01:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50d8f73647560f210bdfcd8fc9fd93cab0d04a4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqajc4FxGoczTKCfdtQNf4aI9Gul76qCuI6s8PcNbzoLE87gmVcM8EPfpH6aCUPTbwJbPR79MgKkRTYKHfq76Om2g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kretic13", "published": "2018-05-23T01:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating the $80 Million Pizza Order", "text": "submitted by /u/Kretic13\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-20-million-pizza-order/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T21:16:42.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2f26bc9b17901058efeb77fdc5a61704e09f9b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSo3HRBLUhqWiH1YmP7qLxlo3Pzig3ygf5eRxdTJNfns1.fmFqQkJ7BnL4AP2SyJvNYXuMIiwJTdmg--", "site_full": "thenewsunit.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://thenewsunit.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The News UNIT", "title": "BITCOIN and CRYPTOCURRENCIES CHARTS REVEAL A SUPER-CRYPTO CRASH", "title_full": "BITCOIN and CRYPTOCURRENCIES CHARTS REVEAL A SUPER-CRYPTO CRASH", "published": "2018-05-23T01:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2f26bc9b17901058efeb77fdc5a61704e09f9b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSo3HRBLUhqWiH1YmP7qLxlo3Pzig3ygf5eRxdTJNfns1.fmFqQkJ7BnL4AP2SyJvNYXuMIiwJTdmg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The News UNIT (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T01:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN and CRYPTOCURRENCIES CHARTS REVEAL A SUPER-CRYPTO CRASH", "text": "SUPER-CRYPTO CRASH IMMINENT\nJsnip4 and all the CRYPTO-PSYCHICS actually caused it\nIt is the WRATH OF GOD on CRYPTOCURRENCY\nTHE BEAST OF BITCOIN or 666\nThis AUDITION involving the creation of BITCOIN and other BLOCKCHAIN CRYPTOCURRENCIES is now ending in a COMPLETE AND UTTER DISASTER.

And, truth be told, CNBC has been showing the decentralized cryptocurrency an inordinate amount of love lately. A segment by a popular analyst, where he forecasts even bigger things for BCH, only added fuel to some trolls' fire. Chairman Mow is not amused.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash\nCNBC Predicts Bitcoin Cash to Moon, and Soon Wednesday in the US is known colloquially as Hump Day, the point at which the weekend seems closer. It's also the day more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tuning in to CNBC's Fast Money program, a self described \"post-market show,\" hosted by Melissa Lee with contributions from well regarded traders.\nTrader Brian Kelly , founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, was asked to detail just why it is he's so bullish on bitcoin cash. In introducing his plasma-fronted segment, Ms. Lee read what appears to be a month-long trend, describing bitcoin cash as having \"vanquished\" the likes of bitcoin core (BTC), down 5%, litecoin down 9%, and ripple down 21% while BCH remained positive at 6% price growth.\nMr. Kelly asked viewers to simply look at what he refers to as catalyst factors, aspects of a digital asset, no matter what the asset, that might have caused it to gain traction in price going forward. In the case of bitcoin cash, Mr. Kelly cheered the latest development among its mining community to pool portions of rewards toward building a fund for future development. He compared it to an app store where devs pile on uses for a smartphone previously unthought of or dreamed of but not implemented. BCH, he insisted, wasn't the only project to do something like this, and he even managed to sandwich in the word \"potentially\" when describing price prospects.\nHe also equated more on-chain development with potential use cases, and use cases, then, with, well, usability and appeal to more people in the eventual hope of more adoption. Curiously he described the mining community's latest move as a kind of cartelization, though benevolent, words and phrases that immediately rile most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He acknowledged it, however, as a potential negative.\nLet the Market Decide Ultimately it all comes down to the market, Mr. Kelly noted. He turned to charting, where over the past year or so BCH has followed the broader crypto market with incredible highs back in late 2017, a precipitous drop in 2018, and a recent stabilization if not slight uptick. Drawing a horizontal line across the screen, Mr. Kelly described bitcoin cash as mostly holding support levels for the moment, a good sign. He called his squibbles and markings \"a good looking chart\" and a \"place I want to buy.\"\nMs. Lee then peppered Mr. Kelly with questions from viewers. Asked if he was in to bitcoin cash for the long term, he turned diplomatic. He reminded viewers he was a trader, moving in and out of positions quickly. He wants to invest in the coin that eventually becomes the global currency, living up to crypto hype. For now, Mr. Kelly said, bitcoin core (BTC) has a massive network effect advantage, but that could change.\nYet another viewer asked if Mr. Kelly had ever actually used BCH to buy something, and if not then what is its use? Mr. Kelly said he had not used bitcoin cash, but that his interest is only in its speculative value. He did say he'd used bitcoin core to buy things and to send money, and so he understands its ultimate power. The final question in the segment got Mr. Kelly laughing, as a person asked if he was indeed Roger Ver. When Ms. Lee effectively ended the spot, she was keen to emphasize CNBC and her program take exactly no money to promote anything on the show, and how no one has any connection to BCH beyond an investment.\nThe strangest reaction by far came from BTC ambassador Samson Mow. Mr. Mow's personality in the debate between BTC and BCH is often dismissive, above-it-all. He knows, you don't, and you simply need to get in line. Humorless. Uncharitable. Superior. That's all excusable, and there's always been such an element in tech (the more obnoxious sort tend to come from Silicon Valley), but his reaction to the CNBC segment described above places him in rarified air. With a picture of a shadowy figure behind bars, Chairman Mow typed, \"Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I'll add them to the Moment.\" That's right, a lower-level crypto spokesperson is advocating use of jail to punish opinions different from his.

Service Highlights ‘No Intermediaries’ The initiative, which Banco Masventas (BMV) launched May 22nd, is the result of a partnership with local blockchain financial services startup Bitex. Once payments begin being sent, BMV will likely become the world’s first banking institution to actively leverage Bitcoin as an international payments standard. The move is a conspicuous move away from extant options such as the SWIFT clearing network, which has seen multiple failures and security problems in recent years. “The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” a dedicated information page on the bank’s website states. The service will initially roll out to 50 countries, with payment timeframes reduced to 24 hours. Outpacing the Rest If it proves to be successful, Argentina would significantly outstep progress with cryptocurrencies by its neighbors, while the country’s domestic banking sector has been preparing for closer integration for some time. In April, an event dubbed ‘ Bitcoin Day ’ in the capital, Buenos Aires, saw participants approve the supportive environment around Bitcoin, contrasting it with the prohibitive stance taken by authorities in countries such as Chile . Changes in legislation have also resulted in operators pledging to install thousands of Bitcoin ATMs throughout Argentina this year. Earlier this month meanwhile, Brazil’s largest asset management company moved to launch an over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading platform, highlighting a wish to target institutional investor money. Blockchain-based payments are also gaining traction with banks, with Santander becoming the first to launch the facility for customers in several jurisdictions, including Brazil, in April via a partnership with Ripple. “Transfers to Europe can be made on the same day and we are aiming to deliver instant transfers across several markets by the summer,” the bank said in a statement .

One source places current resistance levels at $8,600, which bitcoin was previously unable to break. The currency rose to the $8,500 mark 48 hours ago, but has incurred subsequent drops ever since. In addition, bitcoin has also failed to sustain previous support levels at $8,300, thus leading to the most recent drop. Tom Lee of Fundstrat (whom we’ve discussed in our last two price articles) is again in the news . He’s sticking to his guns and insists bitcoin will reach $25,000 by the end of 2018. However, he is clarifying his words by saying that bitcoin does not need to experience price hikes “every day” to reach this goal. In an interview with CNBC , Lee explained: “We have to keep in mind that Bitcoin at $8,000 and Bitcoin, let’s say we think it can reach $25,000. It does not require Bitcoin to go up every day until the end of the year. Remember – the ten best days account for all the return of Bitcoin. If you didn’t own Bitcoin for ten days each year, you lost 25 percent a year since 2010.” At press time, support levels for the currency have fallen to roughly $8,150, and more bear trends are expected in the coming days. Should things move further in this direction, bitcoin could fall to $8,000 even, though a reversal might see it swinging towards $9,300. However, worst case scenario would see bitcoin dropping to as low as $7,969, with a mid-point average of $8,300. In other words, the currency could wind up staying as it is for some time. Today is Bitcoin Pizza Day , and this could potentially push the currency’s publicity a little further. Approximately eight years ago, a computer programmer allegedly paid around 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas. Today, those coins would be worth more than $80 million. Hence, May 22 has since become a “national holiday” for bitcoin and pizza enthusiasts alike. In an interview with The New York Times , Laszlo Hanyecz – the programmer who purchased the pies with crypto – says he has no regrets about the situation. “It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” he stated. A Twitter account is providing 24-hour updates regarding how much the pizzas would have cost today based on the latest bitcoin prices. Cryptocurrency news platform Coindesk has also released its own Bitcoin Pizza Day price tracker. The event is likely to give bitcoin a few pushes along the way, though the big move enthusiasts need to witness is further acceptance amongst retail clients, which has been relatively slow. Many merchants refuse to accept bitcoin due its ongoing volatility. According to one Morgan Stanley analyst: “The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is striking.” The good news, however, is that we are continuing to witness stronger institutional capital entering the crypto-space via Wall Street and major brokers. Perhaps this is the doorway bitcoin needs to solidify its presence in the retail world.

No other date, save for January 3, 2009 when Satoshi mined the genesis block, is more symbolic. It was on May 22, 2010 that Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Eight years on, the occasion has become part of bitcoin’s mythology. Also read: Ross Ulbricht Continues to Fight for Freedom With Supreme Court Petition Remembering the $83 Million Pizza On May 18 2009, Laszlo posted a thread on the Bitcointalk forum entitled “Pizza for bitcoins?” In it, he explained: “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!” Laszlo then went on to list his favorite toppings, before specifying “just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that”. Within days he had a buyer and the deal went through on May 22. The event is symbolic, not so much for the value of those 10,000 BTC today, but because it marked one of the first public instances of bitcoin being used as a means of payment. The pizza thread, like the value of BTC, has since grown and grown, and today runs to 73 pages, having been viewed around 750,000 times. Pizza Wallets and Pizza Moon Missions Every year on May 22 the bitcoin community now competes to despatch the best pizza tweets and branded products, all tied to that then-minor but now massive day in 2010 when bitcoin proved its worth. It hasn’t stopped proving it ever since. To mark the occasion today, Bitstamp has calculated how far $83m of pizzas would stretch, using the following formula: 10,000 BTC * 8,400 USD (1 BTC) = 84 million USD 84 million USD / 15 USD (1 pizza price) = 5.6 million pizzas 5.6 million pizzas * 14 inches (diameter of a large pizza) = 1237 miles 1237 miles / 248 miles (average altitude of the ISS) = 4.9 PIZZA TO THE MOON: In 2010, a Florida man bought two large pizzas for 10.000 #Bitcoin . Today, this could buy you enough pizzas to get to the International Space Station five times. #whenmoon Happy #BitcoinPizzaDay ! #BTC #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/OuPeXC93CM — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) May 22, 2018 Hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger has gone one better, creating a limited edition Pizza Day Nano S. Just 1,337 of the units will be issued, each coming in a special Laszlo’s Pizza box complete with a sachet of red chilli pepper oil, for those who like to spice up their cold storage. As for the man who made this infamous anniversary come about, history records that Laszlo sold most of his bitcoins at around $1 apiece but, having contributed to its early source code, and done his bit to ensure real world adoption, he regrets nothing. In the crypto community, Laszlo Hanyecz’s actions will always be the ultimate “Florida man” story, destined to be commemorated faithfully every May 22 forevermore.

Today I will proffer two more: censorship and propaganda were allowed to run rampant; miners didn’t understand their power and responsibility. Last Friday, Coingeek.com held a fantastic conference in Hong Kong on the topic of blockchain commerce. The conference concluded with a panel discussion featuring 3 of the most well-known thought leaders in the Bitcoin Cash community: Roger Ver, Dr. Craig Wright, and Jihan Wu. Each of them said something important that pertains to these topics. Also read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 3 Bitcoin Cash Avoiding Censorship Censorship is an obvious barrier to an educated community and is motivated by a desire to control the narrative. Thus, it goes hand-in-hand with propaganda and the active promotion of mis information. In Hong Kong, Roger shared that his biggest mistake was underestimating how effective censorship can be. He explained why: while established community members can easily dismiss misinformation, newcomers cannot. And since the community is a fast-growing one, the misinformed newcomers become a majority. You can read more about the history of censorship in Bitcoin here. Mindful Miners In a recent “AMA” , former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn pointed out that historically, BTC miners haven’t been rational economic actors. He said they’ve been incapable of disobeying the authority of the devs. But we may be turning the corner on this. At the Coingeek conference, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu expressed that the miners have learned from previous mistakes, and are starting to take more responsibility for understanding the protocol and making intelligent decisions. In the past, miners have followed Bitcoin Core almost unconditionally — perhaps overly fearful of “breaking” the network should their guidance not be followed to the letter. While its sensible to consult experts for their opinions, Bitcoin is not on the same order of complexity as nuclear engineering. (Incidentally, nuclear engineering has been the very metaphor used to incorrectly suggest that the community should abandon independent thinking and blindly follow developers). Bitcoin is an Economic System One of the thematic ideas presented by Dr. Wright in Hong Kong (and in previous talks) is that Bitcoin is NOT a cryptographic system. It’s an economic system that happens to use cryptography. This is the kind of revelation that’s obvious after you hear it expressed so succinctly. In my own words, it means that Bitcoin’s economic incentives are the foundation of what makes Bitcoin work. The cryptography is secondary to that. The economics are the “what” and the cryptography is the “how”. If you investigate one of Bitcoin’s predecessors, Wei Dai’s b-money , you may be surprised at how similar it is to Bitcoin. The one major element that’s missing is the set of economic incentives. Miners, Users, and the Public Discourse Miners and users have a symbiotic relationship. Users don’t have a network without miners, and miners don’t have economic incentive without users. In theory, miners are rewarded by providing the network that users want. But what if the miners don’t know what users want because the public discussion is being censored and brigaded with propaganda? What if they’re listening to the devs instead of the users, or they simply don’t understand enough about Bitcoin to make good choices? Unfortunately, miners can participate in the system and earn rewards for securing the network without understanding anything about Bitcoin. But its quite dangerous for miners to be ignorant because they’re the ones directly responsible for making the bottom line decisions about consensus rules. It’s therefore really encouraging to hear that miners are much more educated and involved than they were several years ago. The Role of Developers In the (flawed) Bitcoin Core paradigm, Bitcoin developers were the wizards and rulers. They handed down the proclamations from their ivory towers for the users and miners to follow. If you didn’t like it, you were told you could “fork off”, even as those developers denied they wielded influence over the protocol. In the actual economic model of Bitcoin, miners set the consensus rules with the ultimate consent of the users who give economic value to the system. Developers, although important, serve a tertiary role and are not directly part of the incentive model. Development Funding If developer groups need to compete (as we discussed in a previous article), then the obvious question is “what incentivizes that competition?” In the past, this has been a conundrum. How can we make sure there’s enough development resources and talent in a free, open-source software project? Yet, if we look honestly at the incentive model of Bitcoin, the answer is clear: it’s ultimately the miners’ responsibility to pay for the software they are going to run. Maybe that means mining pools directly sponsor development teams (which seems to be something that’s been irrationally shamed or presented as a conflict of interest) …Or maybe it means miners should formulate some kind of system to donate a portion of the block rewards to protocol advancement, as was proposed in a recent strategy meeting . Conclusion Bitcoin Cash is on the right track and will stay on the right track by following these 5 principles: Knowledge and education must be valued and promoted. Understanding Bitcoin is not the exclusive realm of wizards. Bitcoin (BCH) is peer to peer electronic cash. Anyone can send money to anyone else in the world, quickly, cheaply, reliably, and without permission. We can disagree on many things as long as we agree on this. We must never allow censorship, because we know propaganda and misinformation are sure to quickly follow. There needs to be multiple independent teams of developers and multiple protocol implementations. No one group should have control of the protocol. The mining community must be engaged, informed, and willing to make logical decisions that align with their own economic interests. What are your thoughts on educating the BCH community?

May 23, 2018 64 Bitcoin Pizza Day is celebrated annually by the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community – marking an important, yet comical milestone for the virtual currency. 8 years ago, a user paid for two pizzas using Bitcoin, in what is hailed as the first ever instance that the cryptocurrency was used to pay for goods. The moment is immortalized online in a Bitcointalk.org forum , where a programmer called Laszlo Hanyecz confirmed that he’d bought two pizza for 10,000 BTC from Papa John’s Pizza in America. Hanyecz had initially solicited users in the forum to deliver two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, with a number of users offering to buy the pizzas online for him. Eventually a teenager named Jeremy Sturdivant , nicknamed Jercos, accepted the Bitcoin and sent Hanyecz two pizzas from Papa John’s. On 22 May 2010, Hanyecz announced that he’d accomplished his outlandish goal. At the time, as pointed out by another user in the thread, 1 Bitcoin was worth around 0.0041 meaning Hanyecz’ 10,000 BTC were worth a lowly $41. Today, the original value of a single Bitcoin pizza, $20.5, would cost you 0.0025 BTC, a staggering display of how much the value of the cryptocurrency has grown in the space of 8 years. Can I buy pizza with Bitcoin today? Services like PizzaForCoins , which was founded in 2013 , accept various cryptocurrencies as payment, and then place orders on behalf of customers online. Egifter also offer customers an gift card that can be bought with Bitcoin – allowing users to then order pizza online through Domino’s Pizza and Papa John’s . Clearly, the legacy left by Hanyecz’s original purchase has had a long lasting effect. Restaurants around America also accept Bitcoin as a payment method. A website called Bitcoinrestaurants has a database of 83 locations where you can settle your bill using Bitcoin. There are also reports that Subway branches in Buenos Aires, Argentina also accept Bitcoin. Yes, it’s a big deal On the surface, Bitcoin Pizza Day seems like a fun, quirky day for the crypto community to celebrate. However, the impact of that fateful transaction has shaped the cryptocurrency world forever. Even Ledger, a well known producer of cryptocurrency hardware wallets, launched a commemorative range of its Limited Edition Ledger Nano S . Hanyecz gave the company his blessing, while touting the importance of good storage practices for Bitcoin users: “Bitcoin was just a fun hobby project for me 8 years ago. When I paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas I had no idea that Bitcoin would eventually become as popular as it is today, with people using it for real world transactions every day.” Once again, Hanyecz’s pizza purchase is hailed as the first ever Bitcoin transaction for real-world goods, paving the way for the use of the cryptocurrency by users around the world. Today, there are an average of 198,878 Bitcoin transactions per day. Lightning pizza Hanyecz is still actively involved in the cryptocurrency community and made headlines in February 2018, reliving his original Bitcoin transaction by buying two pizzas using the Lightning Network . The programmer explained how he opened up payment channel with a friend in London, who then subcontracted the delivery – by paying for it himself – to a local shop. As Hanyecz describes, his latest foray explores a new technology that hopes to reduce transactions times and costs on the Bitcoin network: “So is there any point to doing this instead of an on chain transaction? For what I described here, probably not. The goal was just to play around with c-lightning and do something more than shuffling a few satoshi back and forth. Maybe eventually pizza shops will have their own lightning nodes and I can open channels to them directly.” Hanyecz statement is reminiscent of his 2010 experiment – where he was simply wanted to “say that I paid for a pizza in Bitcoins”. That original curiosity paved the way for Bitcoin becoming a revolutionary way for people to transact in a trustless, decentralized way. Only time will tell if the 2018 Lightning Pizza transaction will become a watershed moment for the second layer payment protocol.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-21427505", "https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/j5e4pg/remembering-that-time-a-dude-unknowingly-spent-dollar20-million-on-two-pizzas", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/001044.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/explained/lightning-network-explained", "http://bitcoinrestaurants.net/", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195", "https://www.egifter.com/bitcoin/papa-johns-gift-card-bitcoin", "https://blockchain.info/charts", "https://pizzaforcoins.com/#", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-bitcoin-pizza-day-can-teach-us-today", "http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-8-surprising-places-where-you-can-use-2017-10?IR=T#zynga-7", "https://www.ledger.fr/2018/05/22/bitcoin-pizza-day-ledger-nano-s-limited-edition/", "https://www.egifter.com/bitcoin/dominos-pizza-gift-card-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin piz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy sturdivant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papa john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jercos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papa john’s pizza", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:38:23.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bae2d804dbcfe8994415aa1a5081e175d419768", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUhFFH623m4ofUPRw4yx1Xs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What is the reason why we really need Bitcoin?", "title_full": "What is the reason why we really need Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-23T01:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bae2d804dbcfe8994415aa1a5081e175d419768", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUhFFH623m4ofUPRw4yx1Xs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dianajane", "published": "2018-05-23T01:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is the reason why we really need Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: Sofiasoff on May 21, 2018, 07:11:49 AM Why do we really need Bitcoin?\nI am a secretive and confidential escapee.

He believed that Bitcoin is like some monetary experiments in history, which eventually ended with failure.\nBesides, Davis, a senior economist at Vanguard Group, wrote to ETF.com that Bitcoin currency is not a kind of currency, because it is too fluctuant to reserve. Therefore, bitcoin probably be worthless one day.\nAdditionally, Chinese e-commerce giant, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma declared at the 2nd World Smart Conference in Tianjin that bitcoin is a bubble, and he will out of touch with bitcoin because he does not know bitcoin worth .\nThe same with many people who are not optimistic about Bitcoin, Jack Ma is positive about blockchain technology. Although most people are buying and selling blockchains, he said that it is not a bubble. Jack Ma claimed that blockchain is not a gold mine, but a solution to solve the problems of data, privacy and security. The real value of blockchain is its ability to provide guarantees, rather than its ability to make money.\nSome people think that oyster may catch up with bitcoin in 2018.

Largely an experiment to see what value, if any, bitcoin had, Hanyecz, a programmer who now works at GoRuck, a backpack startup, offered 10,000 bitcoins via an online forum to anyone who could bring him two Papa John’s pizzas.\nLegend has it a fellow programmer in London accepted the offer, placed a call to Hanyecz’s local Papa John’s delivery joint in Jacksonville, Florida, and paid for the pizzas witha credit card. Hanyecz sent over the bitcoins, the pizza was delivered, and a small but important piece of history was made.\nPrior to Hanyecz's purchase, bitcoin was basically worthless, or by some accounts worth about $0.008 cents. But no one had ever actually spent a bitcoin before, so the prices were largely based on theoretical value. What Hanyecz did was help jumpstart the pricing of bitcoin, which is now selling for $8,229 each, making those pizzas worth more than $80 million.\nNow the 36-year-old Hanyecz has reemerged as a leader of sorts, exercising his own personal brand of activism in a number of ways, including convincing his employer, online apparel and gear startup GoRuck, to start accepting bitcoin effective immediately.\n“We are about to start the bitcoin pizza party at GoRuck,” Hanyecz tells Forbes . “To celebrate we are accepting bitcoin as a payment method starting today.”\nBitcoin transactions for the Jacksonville-based startup are being priced in U.S. dollars but will be paid in bitcoin based on the current Coinbase/GDAX exchange rate. Importantly, the transactions are being conducted “on-chain,” which means they join other bitcoin transactions that are waiting to be processed at a relatively slow rate of about seven transactions per second, compared with Visa, which can handle 24,000 transactions per second.\nThese and other obstacles have prevented bitcoin from catching on as a form of payment. If fact, since the early days of promise that bitcoin would be used to actually buy things, a number influential early supporters including Valve, Stripe and Reddit have ceased accepting the cryptocurrency.\nBut Hanyecz hasn't given up on his vision of bitcoin being used to buy things. In addition to launching a podcast today explaining why he thinks bitcoin can still be used as a form of payment, he’s continued making purchases of his own. Earlier this year, he used a promising new bitcoin technology called Lightning to purchase two more pizzas for himself and his children. In February he published a detailed breakdown of that experiment, which was designed to prove that Lightning could speed up transactions by moving them “off-chain” and dramatically increasing the potential transaction volume. Hanyecz tells Forbes he believes Lightning has the potential to replace credit cards for payments by opening up special payment channels that connect counterparties without having to log every transaction on the actual blockchain. Detractors of Lightning, however, are concerned the technology could amount to a centralization of transactions in pools of off-chain currency.\nRegardless of whether the technology is ever adopted by bitcoin on a larger scale, Hanyecz says he’s content with the current on-chain solutions and his own small place in history.\nSince that first Bitcoin Pizza Day, his name has been documented alongside such legendary figures as Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, and Hal Finney, the programmer who is credited with receiving the first bitcoin transaction.\n“Bitcoin has just been a hobby on the side,” Hanyecz says. “It’s a great achievement for me to be able to bring my bitcoin knowledge to work and accept it as payment on our production website.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://news.goruck.com/from-hq/laszlo-and-bitcoin-pizza-day/", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/001044.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T20:05:37.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "925baf734d0d10ea86cf8886adc6da1d450b1688", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9DYT627iGtYJ20XiWvy47.HlQ1kHOXlLfQVOh8OEh4Ck73xKcc5EH4RbA50YM.Z9BGNuUGL0a0Ag--", "site_full": "www.carigold.com", "site": "carigold.com", "site_section": "http://www.carigold.com/portal/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=305", "site_categories": ["investing", "non_standard_content", "finance", "adult"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies - CariGold Forum", "title": "BİTCOİN STAR Airdrop!!!!", "title_full": "BİTCOİN STAR Airdrop!!!! - CariGold Forum", "published": "2018-05-23T00:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29476, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "925baf734d0d10ea86cf8886adc6da1d450b1688", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9DYT627iGtYJ20XiWvy47.HlQ1kHOXlLfQVOh8OEh4Ck73xKcc5EH4RbA50YM.Z9BGNuUGL0a0Ag--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "brahimi", "published": "2018-05-23T00:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "BİTCOİN STAR Airdrop!!!!", "text": "1.

A few days later, Hanyecz was successful. He bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins from Jeremy Sturdivant, whose username was \"jercos.\" On May 22, 2010, Hanyecz posted on Bitcointalk forum,\n\"I just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza. Thanks, jercos!\"\nAs of this writing, 10,000 bitcoins equals USD $82,000,000. But when Hanyecz performed this transaction, he may have been unaware of its significance.\nSince then, Bitcoin has faced innumerable challenges. Governments and influential financial leaders have attacked Bitcoin relentlessly throughout its existence.\nScandals involving nefarious people using Bitcoin have often occupied the world press. Moreover, technical issues, including scalability and expensive transaction fees, have led the crypto community into a terrible civil war.\nHowever, Bitcoin has shown great resiliency and has successfully confronted all these challenges. Therefore, it remains the most successful ever currency.\nFor example, new technological improvements such as SegWit, Lightning Network, and Atomic Multi-Path Payments over Lightning, and now Bitcoin Core 0.16.0, are solving Bitcoin's scalability and transaction fee issues.\nIn this regard, Hanyecz made another spectacular contribution to the development of the cryptocurrency by buying a pizza again on February 25, 2018. However, this time, he performed the transaction via Lightning Network. Hanyecz, reported this transaction as follows:\nI paid bitcoin using the lightning network, and he arranged for a pizza to be delivered to me. In this trade, my friend is just a middleman that is taking the risk of accepting lightning payments, but it demonstrates the basic premise of how this works for everyday transactions. It could just as well be the pizza shop accepting the payment directly with their own lightning node.\nThe Transaction That Changed the World\nIndeed, the first-ever Bitcoin transaction changed the world of finances. Last year Bitcoin, escorted by futures trading contracts, entered into the circle of mainstream finance. This milestone event was formalized by the CBOE Global Markets' launch of Bitcoin futures contracts, on December 10, 2017, easing the way to the cryptocurrency market for institutional investors' trillions of dollars.\nAs a result, big banks and financial institutions are now aiming to trade Bitcoin. For example, according to Amber Baldet, former J.P Morgan executive, big banks will soon start trading cryptocurrencies. In a recent interview with CNBC, Baldet said, \"I think it is coming sooner than people probably think.\"\nGoldman Sachs might also be on the path of start trading Bitcoin. The New York Times writes :\nBut Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most storied name in finance, is bucking the risks and moving ahead with plans to set up what appears to be the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank.\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin exchanges, such as Coinbase and Ivy Koin are moving to obtain bank licenses.

Witnesses said a Toyota Corolla pulled up nearby and the teenager was dragged in and driven away. “We are investigating a case of kidnapping that happened on Sunday in Witbank. There was a demand that was made that the parents should deposit cash in bitcoins,” the police spokesman Leonard Hlathi said on Tuesday. Local media said the ransom note was left at the scene.“This is a kidnapping … We demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child’s safe release – non-negotiable,” the note reportedly read.\nThe first deadline for payment of part of the ransom passed on Monday night. In the note, the kidnappers threatened to kill the boy if their demands were not met. A police official said boy’s parents were “going through trauma”. “They don’t even know what this bitcoin is. They’re devastated and you can see they’re worried and asking themselves: ‘Where’s our son?” local media quoted the official as saying. The boy’s mother made an emotional appeal on Tuesday, pleading with the kidnappers to “bring back [her] son”. Police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, although it is usually wealthy businesspeople who are targeted. The latest case appears to be the first ransom demand in made for a cryptocurrency in the country. In December 2017, an employee at a cryptocurrency exchange in Ukraine was released by kidnappers after a ransom of more than $1m worth of bitcoins was paid.

And, truth be told, CNBC has been showing the decentralized cryptocurrency an inordinate amount of love lately. A segment by a popular analyst, where he forecasts even bigger things for BCH, only added fuel to some trolls’ fire. Chairman Mow is not amused.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash CNBC Predicts Bitcoin Cash to Moon, and Soon\nWednesday in the US is known colloquially as Hump Day, the point at which the weekend seems closer. It’s also the day more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tuning in to CNBC’s Fast Money program, a self described “post-market show,” hosted by Melissa Lee with contributions from well regarded traders.\nTrader Brian Kelly , founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, was asked to detail just why it is he’s so bullish on bitcoin cash. In introducing his plasma-fronted segment, Ms. Lee read what appears to be a month-long trend, describing bitcoin cash as having “vanquished” the likes of bitcoin core (BTC), down 5%, litecoin down 9%, and ripple down 21% while BCH remained positive at 6% price growth.\nMr. Kelly asked viewers to simply look at what he refers to as catalyst factors, aspects of a digital asset, no matter what the asset, that might have caused it to gain traction in price going forward. In the case of bitcoin cash, Mr. Kelly cheered the latest development among its mining community to pool portions of rewards toward building a fund for future development. He compared it to an app store where devs pile on uses for a smartphone previously unthought of or dreamed of but not implemented. BCH, he insisted, wasn’t the only project to do something like this, and he even managed to sandwich in the word “potentially” when describing price prospects.\nHe also equated more on-chain development with potential use cases, and use cases, then, with, well, usability and appeal to more people in the eventual hope of more adoption. Curiously he described the mining community’s latest move as a kind of cartelization, though benevolent, words and phrases that immediately rile most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He acknowledged it, however, as a potential negative. Let the Market Decide\nUltimately it all comes down to the market, Mr. Kelly noted. He turned to charting, where over the past year or so BCH has followed the broader crypto market with incredible highs back in late 2017, a precipitous drop in 2018, and a recent stabilization if not slight uptick. Drawing a horizontal line across the screen, Mr. Kelly described bitcoin cash as mostly holding support levels for the moment, a good sign. He called his squibbles and markings “a good looking chart” and a “place I want to buy.”\nMs. Lee then peppered Mr. Kelly with questions from viewers. Asked if he was in to bitcoin cash for the long term, he turned diplomatic. He reminded viewers he was a trader, moving in and out of positions quickly. He wants to invest in the coin that eventually becomes the global currency, living up to crypto hype. For now, Mr. Kelly said, bitcoin core (BTC) has a massive network effect advantage, but that could change.\nYet another viewer asked if Mr. Kelly had ever actually used BCH to buy something, and if not then what is its use? Mr. Kelly said he had not used bitcoin cash, but that his interest is only in its speculative value. He did say he’d used bitcoin core to buy things and to send money, and so he understands its ultimate power. The final question in the segment got Mr. Kelly laughing, as a person asked if he was indeed Roger Ver. When Ms. Lee effectively ended the spot, she was keen to emphasize CNBC and her program take exactly no money to promote anything on the show, and how no one has any connection to BCH beyond an investment.\nThe strangest reaction by far came from BTC ambassador Samson Mow. Mr. Mow’s personality in the debate between BTC and BCH is often dismissive, above-it-all. He knows, you don’t, and you simply need to get in line. Humorless. Uncharitable. Superior.

With a picture of a shadowy figure behind bars, Chairman Mow typed, “Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment.” That’s right, a lower-level crypto spokesperson is advocating use of jail to punish opinions different from his.

franchise of Entrepreneur Media. Blockchain is the technology that supports the use of bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that is making central banks and governments nervous, and it is true that the latter are not sure whether to ban bitcoin, or embrace it, or hope it will vanish as another ephemeral hype. But blockchain is nowadays more than the technology that ensures the authenticity of bitcoin.\nIt did start that way, but it has acquired new uses, opened new opportunities and charted new vistas. Let’s start with the beginnings, which always fascinate as they seem to tell the origin of the idea, the initial thinking behind the spark of genius, before the invention takes a life of its own and flourishes into an infinity of uses. These “foundational moments”, as cultural critics would call them, can show us the intent behind the invention of bitcoin.\nSimply put, bitcoin is a digital currency set up to function without a central bank or entity to regulate it. The transactions are validated by nodal points spread over a network of computers called “miners,” using crypto-mathematical formulas, which once solved will allow the “miners” to win more bitcoins. In just a few words, individuals (using computers) solve complex mathematical questions to validate the currency, and are related to each other via a secured and unchangeable chain of blocks, which makes tampering with the authenticity of the currency almost impossible. The system, which was put together by a person or a group of people called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to sustain and secure bitcoin, is blockchain.\nThe blocks in blockchain are knots containing encrypted information, as well as a reference to the date of the creation, and the name of the previous block to which the current block is related in a chained manner. Any change to the chain will not overwrite the existing information, but will be added as a new block, after it has been validated by all the other blocks in the network. But there was another beginning.\nAs in all beginnings, the beginning keeps receding since with revolutionary ideas, like blockchain, there is no perfect beginning- in fact, all beginnings are perfect (or imperfect) in their own way. In 1997, way before the advent of bitcoin, Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer, set up the technological and legal basis for “smart contracts”- the contracts that can be authenticated and validated through secure protocols without a need for lawyers or notaries or other third parties.

And, truth be told, CNBC has been showing the decentralized cryptocurrency an inordinate amount of love lately. A segment by a popular analyst, where he forecasts even bigger things for BCH, only added fuel to some trolls’ fire. Chairman Mow is not amused.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash CNBC Predicts Bitcoin Cash to Moon, and Soon\nWednesday in the US is known colloquially as Hump Day, the point at which the weekend seems closer. It’s also the day more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tuning in to CNBC’s Fast Money program, a self described “post-market show,” hosted by Melissa Lee with contributions from well regarded traders.\nTrader Brian Kelly , founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, was asked to detail just why it is he’s so bullish on bitcoin cash. In introducing his plasma-fronted segment, Ms. Lee read what appears to be a month-long trend, describing bitcoin cash as having “vanquished” the likes of bitcoin core (BTC), down 5%, litecoin down 9%, and ripple down 21% while BCH remained positive at 6% price growth.\nMr. Kelly asked viewers to simply look at what he refers to as catalyst factors, aspects of a digital asset, no matter what the asset, that might have caused it to gain traction in price going forward. In the case of bitcoin cash, Mr. Kelly cheered the latest development among its mining community to pool portions of rewards toward building a fund for future development. He compared it to an app store where devs pile on uses for a smartphone previously unthought of or dreamed of but not implemented. BCH, he insisted, wasn’t the only project to do something like this, and he even managed to sandwich in the word “potentially” when describing price prospects.\nHe also equated more on-chain development with potential use cases, and use cases, then, with, well, usability and appeal to more people in the eventual hope of more adoption. Curiously he described the mining community’s latest move as a kind of cartelization, though benevolent, words and phrases that immediately rile most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He acknowledged it, however, as a potential negative. Let the Market Decide\nUltimately it all comes down to the market, Mr. Kelly noted. He turned to charting, where over the past year or so BCH has followed the broader crypto market with incredible highs back in late 2017, a precipitous drop in 2018, and a recent stabilization if not slight uptick. Drawing a horizontal line across the screen, Mr. Kelly described bitcoin cash as mostly holding support levels for the moment, a good sign. He called his squibbles and markings “a good looking chart” and a “place I want to buy.”\nMs. Lee then peppered Mr. Kelly with questions from viewers. Asked if he was in to bitcoin cash for the long term, he turned diplomatic. He reminded viewers he was a trader, moving in and out of positions quickly. He wants to invest in the coin that eventually becomes the global currency, living up to crypto hype. For now, Mr. Kelly said, bitcoin core (BTC) has a massive network effect advantage, but that could change.\nYet another viewer asked if Mr. Kelly had ever actually used BCH to buy something, and if not then what is its use? Mr. Kelly said he had not used bitcoin cash, but that his interest is only in its speculative value. He did say he’d used bitcoin core to buy things and to send money, and so he understands its ultimate power. The final question in the segment got Mr. Kelly laughing, as a person asked if he was indeed Roger Ver. When Ms. Lee effectively ended the spot, she was keen to emphasize CNBC and her program take exactly no money to promote anything on the show, and how no one has any connection to BCH beyond an investment.\nThe strangest reaction by far came from BTC ambassador Samson Mow. Mr. Mow’s personality in the debate between BTC and BCH is often dismissive, above-it-all. He knows, you don’t, and you simply need to get in line. Humorless. Uncharitable. Superior.

and panel were on the defensive during a recent broadcast, as some viewers accused the network of shilling for bitcoin cash (BCH). And, truth be told, CNBC has been showing the decentralized cryptocurrency an inordinate amount of love lately. A segment by a popular analyst, where he forecasts even bigger things for BCH, only added fuel to some trolls’ fire. Chairman Mow is not amused.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash CNBC Predicts Bitcoin Cash to Moon, and Soon\nWednesday in the US is known colloquially as Hump Day, the point at which the weekend seems closer. It’s also the day more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tuning in to CNBC’s Fast Money program, a self described “post-market show,” hosted by Melissa Lee with contributions from well regarded traders.\nTrader Brian Kelly , founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, was asked to detail just why it is he’s so bullish on bitcoin cash. In introducing his plasma-fronted segment, Ms. Lee read what appears to be a month-long trend, describing bitcoin cash as having “vanquished” the likes of bitcoin core (BTC), down 5%, litecoin down 9%, and ripple down 21% while BCH remained positive at 6% price growth.\nMr. Kelly asked viewers to simply look at what he refers to as catalyst factors, aspects of a digital asset, no matter what the asset, that might have caused it to gain traction in price going forward. In the case of bitcoin cash, Mr. Kelly cheered the latest development among its mining community to pool portions of rewards toward building a fund for future development. He compared it to an app store where devs pile on uses for a smartphone previously unthought of or dreamed of but not implemented. BCH, he insisted, wasn’t the only project to do something like this, and he even managed to sandwich in the word “potentially” when describing price prospects.\nHe also equated more on-chain development with potential use cases, and use cases, then, with, well, usability and appeal to more people in the eventual hope of more adoption. Curiously he described the mining community’s latest move as a kind of cartelization, though benevolent, words and phrases that immediately rile most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He acknowledged it, however, as a potential negative. Let the Market Decide\nUltimately it all comes down to the market, Mr. Kelly noted. He turned to charting, where over the past year or so BCH has followed the broader crypto market with incredible highs back in late 2017, a precipitous drop in 2018, and a recent stabilization if not slight uptick. Drawing a horizontal line across the screen, Mr. Kelly described bitcoin cash as mostly holding support levels for the moment, a good sign. He called his squibbles and markings “a good looking chart” and a “place I want to buy.”\nMs. Lee then peppered Mr. Kelly with questions from viewers. Asked if he was in to bitcoin cash for the long term, he turned diplomatic. He reminded viewers he was a trader, moving in and out of positions quickly. He wants to invest in the coin that eventually becomes the global currency, living up to crypto hype. For now, Mr. Kelly said, bitcoin core (BTC) has a massive network effect advantage, but that could change.\nYet another viewer asked if Mr. Kelly had ever actually used BCH to buy something, and if not then what is its use? Mr. Kelly said he had not used bitcoin cash, but that his interest is only in its speculative value. He did say he’d used bitcoin core to buy things and to send money, and so he understands its ultimate power. The final question in the segment got Mr. Kelly laughing, as a person asked if he was indeed Roger Ver. When Ms. Lee effectively ended the spot, she was keen to emphasize CNBC and her program take exactly no money to promote anything on the show, and how no one has any connection to BCH beyond an investment.\nThe strangest reaction by far came from BTC ambassador Samson Mow. Mr. Mow’s personality in the debate between BTC and BCH is often dismissive, above-it-all. He knows, you don’t, and you simply need to get in line. Humorless. Uncharitable. Superior. That’s all excusable, and there’s always been such an element in tech (the more obnoxious sort tend to come from Silicon Valley), but his reaction to the CNBC segment described above places him in rarified air. With a picture of a shadowy figure behind bars, Chairman Mow typed, “Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment.” That’s right, a lower-level crypto spokesperson is advocating use of jail to punish opinions different from his. Yikes.\nAre you excited about BCH adoption and innovation?

The official website for Bitcoin is bitcoin.org .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain.

To her, “It makes great common sense,” and that is the future of real estate.\n“I’m being very optimistic because, as a long-term play, it’s perfectly suited for real estate transactions,” the great investor said in an interview with MONEY.\nCorcan believes home selling will soon be linked more to cryptocurrency, and that many houses would be purchased using bitcoin as time goes on. Her reason is simple.\nBitcoin is “peer-to-peer, with no central anything, and that’s why it’s so powerful,” she argued. “The main idea is to eliminate the middle guy.”\nIn the same line, she is hopeful that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will eliminate the need for banks.\n“I really don’t expect banks to be around 10 years from now unless they change their model,” she opined.\n“I don’t see why it’s going to be needed if Bitcoin does what I believe it’s going to do.”\nAlthough, cryptocurrency has not gotten a wide acceptance, effort is ongoing to make it well known and accepted by banks and world’s governments, however, its representation in real estate is minute until recently, when it was made known that some real estate companies are demanding bitcoin as means of payment.\nCorcoran, is a great investor in real estate. She sold New York City real estate agency, which she founded in 2001, for $66 million.

Davis resorted to the conventional “blockchain not bitcoin” argument, claiming that the most dominant cryptocurrency has no use case.\n“I’m enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes bitcoin possible. In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero,” said Davis.\nBitcoin has many use cases. Xapo, the Swiss-based cryptocurrency wallet and vault service provider, stores more than $10 billion worth of bitcoin in its cold wallets managed offline in safe Swiss vaults. According to Bloomberg, more customers have stored bitcoin in Xapo’s vault than 5,670 banks in the US.\nThe primary use case of bitcoin, due to its fungibility, transportability, security, and decentralized nature, is an efficient store of value. It protects and stores wealth better than traditional assets and stores of value, such as gold.\nHence, the claim of Davis that bitcoin does not have a use case is evidently invalid, given that it is already being used as a store of value and has been used as a digital currency since its launch in 2009.\nArgument 2: No Cash Flows and no Fundamental Value Major cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols like Ethereum are worth many billions of dollars. However, Davis claimed that unlike stocks and bonds, blockchain protocols do not issue interest payments or dividends for investors and as such, their value cannot be justified. He added that the underlying economic activity of countries can justify traditional assets like fiat currency. Davis said:\n“The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use.”\nThe basis of the argument of Davis uses an assumption that every economy and government around the world can remain strong and solid. But, such an assumption is simply not realistic. Venezuela is a prime example of an economy that has turned into turmoil due to government corruption.\nWhen the national currency of a country falls, there exists no other alternative except decentralized financial networks and autonomous systems. As the Venezuelan bolivar, the country’s national currency, lost all of its value because of hyperinflation, local residents and citizens turned towards bitcoin as the only form of sound money available to the country’s people.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim buckley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trillion vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:28:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "559863212dc1f9af172d1cc9c5521d38c68a6903", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZT2_LELHx1XEsUv5SiZNGQAtHlmUC3rggRcO.lamTMVcnRIUrs.ffM4", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Crypto Investment Manager Touts 3 Catalysts for Bitcoin Cash Bull Run", "title_full": "Crypto Investment Manager Touts 3 Catalysts for Bitcoin Cash Bull Run", "published": "2018-05-23T00:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "559863212dc1f9af172d1cc9c5521d38c68a6903", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZT2_LELHx1XEsUv5SiZNGQAtHlmUC3rggRcO.lamTMVcnRIUrs.ffM4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T00:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto Investment Manager Touts 3 Catalysts for Bitcoin Cash Bull Run", "text": "Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nCryptocurrency portfolio manager Brian Kelly has been touting Bitcoin Cash for weeks, and now he’s doubling down on his bullish call. Bitcoin Cash outperformed other leading digital currencies, the latter of which have taken it on the chin in recent weeks.\nThe Bitcoin Cash price advanced 6% over the last month compared to declines of 5%, 9% and 11% for bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple, respectively. Kelly on CNBC made the case for Bitcoin Cash.\nKelly, the founder of investment firm BKCM, believes that Bitcoin Cash has more room to run, and he’s outlined the catalysts for the bullish outlook.\n“Proposed development fund” “Could give cryptocurrency more use cases” “Highlights centralization of miners” To take each of the catalysts in more detail, miners of Bitcoin Cash in recent days announced a new development fund that will be comprised of a percentage of the bounty they receive from creating new coins. The funds in the new portfolio will be directed toward the development of new technology “on top of Bitcoin Cash,” Kelly explained, adding that it’s akin to an App Store for the blockchain.\n“That potentially could give value to Bitcoin Cash,” said Kelly, adding that it’s not the only blockchain project doing something like this.\nThe development fund leads to the second catalyst, which involves developers using the new blockchain technology to create more use cases for bitcoin cash. “To the extent that usefulness translates into value, that could be a positive for Bitcoin Cash,” he said.\nNext, the development fund reflects “centralization of the miners,” which Kelly admits bucks the trend for cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, this could prove to be a negative but for now, the mission behind the development fund appears to be a good one.\nAs for the market, Kelly points to an uptrend in BCH that’s strengthened by the fact that it has been able to hold support. The technicals for BCH coupled with the catalysts he outlined led to his bullish call: “For me, that’s a place that I want to buy,” he said.\nSource: CNBC Not So Fast? CNBC’s Fast Money took some tweets from viewers, one of which asked Kelly if he was actually early bitcoin backer Roger Ver. Ver, who is also known as “Bitcoin Jesus”, is a proponent of Bitcoin Cash over bitcoin core.\nCNBC said they get a number of tweets basically accusing the business network of performing pump-and-dump schemes. One such accusation come from a Twitter user by Samson Mow, who Mow said Kelly has since blocked –\nMeanwhile, CNBC host Melissa Lee responded on the air broadly to any accusations, saying: “That is absolutely not the case. We do not take any payments to promote anything on this show. Nothing.”\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cryptocurre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bkcm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:28:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "243afc47b22c4968d71f131f2c115f6721b23c4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZS.w.JitI9gAl9m5HDbvDrlLg__pPSU7jIzreTX4yceQA--", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!", "title_full": "Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!", "published": "2018-05-23T00:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "243afc47b22c4968d71f131f2c115f6721b23c4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZS.w.JitI9gAl9m5HDbvDrlLg__pPSU7jIzreTX4yceQA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T00:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!", "text": "Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nToday, May 22, marks the eighth annual Bitcoin Pizza Day, commemorating an important milestone in the journey to mainstream bitcoin adoption.\nOn this day in 2010, Florida-based programmer and early cryptocurrency enthusiast Laszlo Hanyecz enshrined his name in bitcoin lore by paying someone 10,000 bitcoins to order him two pizzas from his local Papa John’s restaurant. The purchase is believed to have been the first time that bitcoin was used in a real-world transaction. Today, those coins are worth nearly $82 million.\nSource: BitcoinTalk “It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz famously said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times. “No one knew it was going to get so big.”\nHanyecz later christened the nascent Lightning Network (LN) with a similar purchase, though it cost him just 0.00649 BTC (~$53) this time around.\nIf you’re lucky, you can commemorate Bitcoin Pizza Day at a restaurant that accepts bitcoin directly (CoinMap curates a non-exhaustive list). Don’t worry, the going rate is no longer 10,000 BTC.\nIf not, you can use your BTC to purchase a gift card to your favorite pizza restaurant. Gyft and eGifter are two popular gift card providers that accept bitcoin — and the latter is currently running a sale on Dominos gift cards.\nIt was still a bit early for pizza in the Western Hemisphere at the time of writing, but cryptocurrency users on the other half of the globe have already shared pictures of their celebratory slices across social media.\nCryptocurrency trading platform and brokerage firm eToro sent a “literal bitcoin pizza” to the offices of financial publication Business Insider UK.\nSatoshi Labs, meanwhile, celebrated with a pineapple-and-jalapeno topped pie — a recipe it dubiously described as Satoshi’s true vision.\nCryptocurrency hardware wallet manufacture Ledger even released a special “pizza day” edition of its classic Nano S wallet, which is limited to 1,337 units.\nMuch has changed over the past eight years. The bitcoin community has exploded in size — and experienced contentious debates about the future of the protocol, not to mention the wider ecosystem. But while arguments over blocksize, ASIC mining, and initial coin offerings may frequently divide us, Bitcoin Pizza Day provides us with an opportunity to focus on what unites us — a passion for cryptocurrency and a love of good pizza.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcointalk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:28:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad0dcd30ab87f908dcf0bdecec1e1aab53f25d72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhAA8gl_vX2SLq.L82TSPdf8-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-23T00:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad0dcd30ab87f908dcf0bdecec1e1aab53f25d72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhAA8gl_vX2SLq.L82TSPdf8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-23T00:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 22, 2018 WEB Bitcoin Is Not for the Faint of Heart American Institute for Economic Research Edward Peter Stringham is President of the American Institute for Economic Research, Davis Professor of Economic Organizations and Innovation at ...

Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling for gains above $8,500 following concerns over increased regulation according to Naeem Aslam , chief market analyst at Think Markets: “The recent selloff has come from the news out of China that the ICO [ initial coin offering ] market is still very active and there are fears that China will further increase the strict regulation.” In a report issued by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the government reiterated its position against “certain risks that cannot be ignored” in regards to ICOs, pyramid schemes, and fraudulent behavior. The report compares the current climate to the early days of the internet, advising the public against “excessive speculation” and “false propaganda.” In addition to regulatory fears, hype surrounding a possible rally following Blockchain Week and the Consensus conference in New York was proven to be a dud. Co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee, who is famous for his bullish predictions on BTC price, admitted that his prediction of a post-conference rally was wrong. While gains above $8,500 are difficult to maintain, $8,000 support is still holding. According to Market Watch , as a the range tightens, the probability of a breakout is growing. For almost six weeks, BTC has traded between $7,800 and $10,000. At press time BTC is trading at $8,095 and has decreased by 4.25 percent over a 24 hour period. Ethereum (ETH) is is also down, trading at $653.79 down 6 percent over a 24 hour period at press time. Last week, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak compared Ethereum to Apple, saying it, “interests [him] because it can do things and because it’s a platform.”\nAltcoins are also all trading in the red. Litecoin (LTC) is down by 3.74 percent over 24 hour period at $129.78, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has lost 7.48 percent to $1,145. Also over a 24 hour period, both EOS and Ripple (XRP) are down 6.42 and 3.24 percent and are trading at $12.60 and $0.65, respectively.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin+cash", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/eos", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/fundstrats-lee-admits-poor-prediction-of-bitcoin-rally-still-expects-25k-price-by-year-end", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/steve-wozniak-compares-ethereum-to-apple-at-vienna-conference", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/mining-will-propel-bitcoin-price-to-36k-in-2019-says-latest-fundstrat-research", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/xrp", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-struggles-for-gains-as-range-tightens-2018-05-22", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/litecoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-fails-to-accomplish-predicted-rally-following-nyc-crypto-conference", "https://coinmarketcap.com/", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-it-ministry-2017-saw-peak-investment-in-domestic-blockchain-industry"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "naeem aslam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "possible new regulatory pressure bitcoin price struggles after blockchain week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T01:31:18.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a249b6dc20410e705d463dbb123e15a791a1c3c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8yAdItcljtFSxGbk3A641Q105xytVJZgkLsIpnN4ymhnWPaVO3fUCmmR.C6nx878_ZkxtgpZ1R0lQCluGGpcaqiYzmPvSBodarAT321WbRLbVd5pxx72TzrCOYcN_YnJjmWryzyx6QSweQCHTr8KEePol50MmsZn9McO27I0x34Q7Dlb3iHzoQaVq1doNiXJc-", "site_full": "www.adelaidenow.com.au", "site": "adelaidenow.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/markets", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Financial Markets &amp; ASX News | Stock Market News | The Advertiser", "title": "Bitcoin: The Papa John’s pizza slice now worth over $5m", "title_full": "Bitcoin: The Papa John’s pizza slice now worth over $5m | Adelaide Now", "published": "2018-05-23T00:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b75102139483360db40811c749657a12", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22379, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a249b6dc20410e705d463dbb123e15a791a1c3c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8yAdItcljtFSxGbk3A641Q105xytVJZgkLsIpnN4ymhnWPaVO3fUCmmR.C6nx878_ZkxtgpZ1R0lQCluGGpcaqiYzmPvSBodarAT321WbRLbVd5pxx72TzrCOYcN_YnJjmWryzyx6QSweQCHTr8KEePol50MmsZn9McO27I0x34Q7Dlb3iHzoQaVq1doNiXJc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adelaidenow.com.au", "published": "2018-05-23T00:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: The Papa John’s pizza slice now worth over $5m", "text": "WE ALL know pizza is one of life’s greatest pleasures.\nBut what if someone told you a lone slice was now worth over $5 million?\nIn 2010, a man named Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two large Papa John’s pizzas online.\nHe paid for them using 10,000 bitcoins — the equivalent of around $40 at the time — in what is now widely believed to be the world’s first bitcoin purchase.\n“I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas. like maybe two large ones so I have some left over for the next day,” he wrote in a bitcoin talk forum. “I like having leftover pizza to nibble on later.

You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!”\nAnother forum user took him up on the offer, and a deal was struck: 10,000 bitcoins were sent in exchange for two Papa John’s pizzas.\nSince then, the price of bitcoin has skyrocketed, meaning the value of those two humble pizzas has increased astronomically.\nHow much would they be worth now?
