Among them is a feature of the traditional financial markets, the Exchange Traded Fund ( ETF ), which allows investors to track and invest in multiple assets using a single over-laying product.\nETFs a Popular Product Similarly, a Bitcoin ETF allows institutional investors to trade the price movements of the pioneer cryptocurrency, without possessing any actual bitcoin. The offering has proven to be popular in Sweden and Germany, which allow investors to invest in a derivative of the digital asset.\nHowever, U.S. based digital ETFs haven't enjoyed similar success, with a popular ETF offering shutting its doors to investors on May 18, 2018.\nArk's BTC Futures Losing Sheen In April 2018, Ark Innovation's Bitcoin futures product ( ARKK ) bagged the \"ETF of the Year\" award. The firm was true to its promise of serving up access to the disruptive digital asset and often held the top spot in BTC holdings. Moreover, the firm's bitcoin allocation at ARKK was always between six percent and ten percent.\nCurrently, only the ARK Web x.0 ETF ( ARKW ) rivals ARKK, with the firm making huge profits in 2017. The Bitcoin Investment Trust ( GBTC ), which was used to access bitcoin, was a significant driver behind both these funds' returns last year.\nAs shown in the chart below, the ARKK and ARKW were each up more than 87 percent in 2017, and the GBTC recording a rise of 1,550 percent:\n( Source : CNBC )\nHowever, bitcoin is fast losing out its center of attention at ARKK and ARKW, with the pioneer digital currency now only making up .5 percent and .6 percent of the indices respectively. As per reports, the cutting out of bitcoin at these firms started out earlier in 2018 and can be attributed to rising tax concerns and regulations as the driving force behind the decision.\nAnother factor to have led to this decision was poor performance, such as the massive drop in 2018 after bitcoin's all-time-high price of $19,000 in December 2017. GBTC already faces a 37 percent drop.\nHowever, if the performance of GBTC would increase in the coming months, any improvement in the value of bitcoin will reflect in their allocation. ARK was undoubtedly earning profits on its earlier allocation, and the trimming only began when the prices began to struggle.\nThe post Ark ETF Sells Most of Its Bitcoin Due to Poor Performance and Regulation appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moreove", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin etf", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T22:39:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "511c6addf6e174e25efbc7baf771b03f3f47e630", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY_t35D1p50O90e0oz_z605xp6PIPjliUUzVYkrSYLl084QKvdOy0gzNKK5VZLE2Eug--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Watch Out BitPay: CoinGate Uses Bitcoin Lightning Payments To Zap Competition", "title_full": "Watch Out BitPay: CoinGate Uses Bitcoin Lightning Payments To Zap Competition", "published": "2018-05-21T22:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "511c6addf6e174e25efbc7baf771b03f3f47e630", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY_t35D1p50O90e0oz_z605xp6PIPjliUUzVYkrSYLl084QKvdOy0gzNKK5VZLE2Eug--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T22:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Watch Out BitPay: CoinGate Uses Bitcoin Lightning Payments To Zap Competition", "text": "Lithuanian cryptocurrency payment processor CoinGate has become one of the first industry businesses to offer Lightning Network (LN) settlements for Bitcoin.\nCoinGate: LN 'Without Doubt Most Awaited Bitcoin Network Upgrade' In a post on Reddit, CoinGate, which has operated since 2014 but saw over half its transaction volume this year , confirmed it was operating LN in a \"sandbox environment\" while \"intense testing\" continues.\n\"Lightning Network is the next major technological innovation in the Bitcoin space.

A new research paper has highlighted the growing problem as major cryptocurrencies seek to solve it.\nBitcoin's Energy Crisis Explored According to the figures, the amount of energy used for each transaction could run a dishwasher for a year.\nAlex de Vries wrote: \"With the Bitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, this means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018.\" This doesn't mean that Bitcoin transactions couldn't be processed without high amounts of energy, it's just that there are a lot of miners. Currently , miners earn about $100 per transaction.\nDigiconomist estimates the consumption of electricity by Bitcoin Miners in its Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BEXI). According to its data, Bitcoin uses 67.91 TWh annually which is just greater than Chile, ranked 40th in the world at 66 TWh. They estimate that the amount of electricity used per transaction is higher at 929 kWh which would be the equivalent of running three dishwashers for a year. The main issue is that the figures are rising at a much steeper rate and have been since September 2017.\nBEXI has to work backwards to calculate the energy used. It starts with how much money the miners are making and works out how much they probably spend on electricity. Then they consider the price of electricity and estimate how much is used. It does rely on several assumptions but it would be much harder to contact all Bitcoin miners and ask how much electricity they use.\nWill the Lightning Network Help? The Lightning Network will take Bitcoin transactions off-chain by setting up channels between users. Transactions between them will occur and only be recorded on the blockchain when the channel is closed. This will reduce the number of transactions that nodes will have to confirm and in doing so, will reduce the energy required for maintaining the network.\nHowever, the majority of electricity used is for Bitcoin mining where computers generate hashes that fulfil a set of criteria. Reducing the number of transactions on the blockchain is unlikely to affect how many miners there are. Bitcoin transactions have halved since December but the mining difficulty has doubled , indicating there is twice as much mining equipment being used. This means that the Lightning Network will only be able to solve some of the problem.\nIn reality, the best bet for Bitcoin, using Proof-of-Work, is using renewable energy, as highlighted in a response to the paper. The International Energy Agency said that renewable energy is set to grow 40% by 2022 and highlighted that renewables are dominant in new energy sources being created. Iceland has already shown how it can work as it runs on 100% renewable energy. In essence, renewable electricity allows the Bitcoin Network to run without changing its underlying structure.\nOther ways of solving the problem include moving to Proof-of-Stake as Ethereum is doing. Digiconomist estimate that Ethereum uses about a third of the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin. NewsBTC reported on the recent publication of the code for Casper. The move is likely to reduce electricity usage significantly, but the question is whether or not the network will remain secure.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post How Will Bitcoin Solve Its Energy Consumption Problem? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin miners", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T22:39:40.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7f6323b56fd6ad8e4a4b02012b7d06ddb888f1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_fC7Xa7LgwBboPV8AbIribrYgM_9i5rN_14pTRdFUHqpflupdwTTJyApR4JmUZItE4OpEM5tE3DziSHra8bo1xRFZFdYwProY-", "site_full": "www.jdsupra.com", "site": "jdsupra.com", "site_section": "http://www.jdsupra.com/resources/syndication/docsRSSfeed.aspx?ftype=FinanceBanking&premium=1", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "legal_issues"], "section_title": "Finance & Banking RSS Feed | JD Supra Law News", "title": "Can I Secure a Loan with Bitcoin?

And so the attempt of governments to have control over the crypto system is a big threat for them because the chance for profit may also be compromised. The plot to take control and manipulate the crypto market may be in its infancy. Something we need to prepare ourselves for incase it matures.\nYeah, the government is gradually entering the crypto world when they know that this is a place where too many underground forces exist and acts out of control, violates the law, if they can manage and control the success, they can eliminate a lot of crime then they can get great benefit from the taxation of users. And we, the people who are making a living from bitcoin every day, we lose part of the profits and we are monitored by the government, that was not a fun thing too, even if the government is not satisfied, they can lock down all activities related to Bitcoin, we will lose everything and become unemployed, that is really scary\nI have no issue about the governments regulations for cryp specially taxation because i believe that it was every humans obligation to the governments that if you make earning part of that must turn to the administration so both parties will benefits and besides the tax payers only giving what is their participation for economy..\nWhats affected about this are those engaged in criminal or illegal activities", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T17:56:28.054+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12fa2faa1e3b0b5a6f6206f134d99660f46c09e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5c2dT8Jxa4qgXI3I.UgxWqsP73iuTpf7ajX.ZsfpuYuKSFPzrG4gYjEy0RdvbovRI__UcCo2T5dK9ooBICdkknW8qz2WOMuIc-", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH] – Inching along – Sentiment Analysis – May 21", "title_full": "Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH] – Inching along – Sentiment Analysis – May 21", "published": "2018-05-21T22:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12fa2faa1e3b0b5a6f6206f134d99660f46c09e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5c2dT8Jxa4qgXI3I.UgxWqsP73iuTpf7ajX.ZsfpuYuKSFPzrG4gYjEy0RdvbovRI__UcCo2T5dK9ooBICdkknW8qz2WOMuIc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-05-21T22:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH] – Inching along – Sentiment Analysis – May 21", "text": "Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH] – Inching along – Sentiment Analysis – May 21 May 22, 2018\nThe past week has been a snail crawl in terms of crypto prices. Nothing really moved until yesterday when Tron [TRX] showed signs of life with a quick bounce. It has been climbing ever since and has is currently trading at $0.082 to a token with a huge 18% jump in the past 24 hours.\nThe past hour has been huge as well with a 3% jump in prices in a move that could topple even Stellar Lumens [XLM] for Tron to take the 8th position.\nA sudden spurt of action was witnessed at 15:51 UTC when the market all across the board jumped by ~4-5% with heavy trading volumes across multiple exchanges.\nThe Sentiment Analysis segment is the aggregation of sentiments from across the market which includes investors, traders, miners, journalists and skeptics alike. These people were interviewed for coin specific opinionated comments and the hand-picked quotes which are written below are either extreme in emotion or inculcate strong data points which might be relevant.\nBitcoin [BTC]\nYesterday at 15:48 UTC, Bitcoin was still trading at $8354 to a token. Within a matter of minutes, there was a huge spike across the tokens and BTC jumped from $8354 to $8549 in a matter of 16 minutes. This jump also triggered a mega bull run for Tron, Bytom, and Ontology who are currently at press time witnessing an 18%, 19% and 12% respectively.\nTariq Khan, a Bitcoin miner with a 1000 TH/s portfolio says,\n“People are so emotionally vested, they can’t think straight. A few days ago we almost hit $10K and everyone was jumping as if we crossed $20K, last week we went down to 8000 and people started crying as if we hit $2000 again. I expect sideways trading for some more time. The massive bull run like we experienced in Nov and Dec last year would require a massive buying pressure.”\nPaulie Faber, a cryptocurrency trader from 2012 says,\n“No more Bitcoin wizards? Where are the psychics’ homies? Media is all about technical analysis which doesn’t tell you shit. I’ve literally gone through thousands of youtube videos with most of them predicting a break above $13K after the recent 9900 price. I have lost faith in Bitcoin honestly. I would consider BTC a more stable currency. Invest in smaller or recent projects which might give you more returns. Expecting BTC to be undramatic for the next couple of weeks”\nChristian Bino, a developer currently working out of Seoul says,\n“Look for the technology. If they have a strong team, strong Github updates, strong philosophy and vision then you can be sure that these projects will definitely go 3x or 4x given the adoption. Bitcoin is king and undoubtedly will remain king for some more time. I suggest everyone to use BTC as a base currency to trade everything else. Even if you are a miner, honestly you won’t be making profits till BTC heads above $15K.”\nTo conclude, a mere 56% of the BTC respondents were optimistic about any positive price action for Bitcoin. They believe Bitcoin could go back to $10K or above within the next month. The other 44% believe Bitcoin isn’t heading anywhere and although long-term Bitcoin might go back and beyond $20K, the short-term trading will be sideways.\nEthereum [ETH]:\nEthereum [ETH] was trading at $717 to a token with a market cap of $71 billion and comfortably still holding its 2nd position in terms of market cap. ETH saw a minor 1.52% gain in the past 24 hours a slightly lesser gain than other cryptos in comparison.\nMarlon Taylor, a developer who uses ETH to accept payments says,\n“My business runs on ETH, we have clients who only pay in ETH. Crypto businesses around the world favor Ethereum to Bitcoin because of its confirmation times and ease. The sudden drop last month came as a shock but right now we are back at a comfortable 700 range. Don’t expect ETH to be a crazy return coin, this is the mothership. It’s stable and reliable. Would still expect it to break $1000 soon.”\nLuke Roger, a fraud analyst at BNY says,\n“Ethereum will lose popularity soon. The only reason it survived is because of ICOs. We will soon see a new era with EOS which has a 2-second finality and capability of thousands of more transactions per second. Once the bull run resumes, ETH could break the recent highs again.

The last time its value was above that figure was March.\nDespite the recent price falls, predictions for bitcoin continue to be positive, particularly from those within the cryptocurrency space.\nYou do not have access to view this Atom.

The currency has stayed above the $8,000 mark, but it is struggling to keep itself above that total. Gains on the currency have also been minimal at best.\nBitcoin attempted to get past the $8,500 mark earlier in the week. But even then, the bitcoin price continued to drop. The currency would get back to that value during the middle part of Sunday, but it had actually gotten down from that threshold from the earlier part of the week. This came in spite of the event being a prominent occasion where people discussed the future of the blockchain system and how it can work for many intentions.\nWhat About the Event?\nThe Consensus 2018 event was the largest-attended version of the annual blockchain conference , with nearly 8,000 people attending it with a ticket cost of $2,000 each. The event was held in the Manhattan borough of New York.\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey spoke at the event. He stated that he is hoping for the industry to grow, but he also feels that some kind of native currency has to grow to create a consistent market. He is uncertain if the bitcoin will be that currency or if something else should be used instead.\nHTC also revealed additional information on its blockchain-powered smartphone called the Exodus. The design of the Exodus entails personal data working on the decentralized blockchain to keep one’s content secure. All Exodus phones on the market would serve as nodes for the blockchain.\nThe Consensus 2018 event also included many other smaller speeches and events for ticket-holders. Rapper Snoop Dogg even performed a private show at one of the venues in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. Many events cost hundreds of dollars for people to enter into and were not a part of the main admission cost.\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin made headlines at the event by not showing up. Buterin was unhappy with how the Consensus event had tickets that were so expensive. He also said on Twitter that CoinDesk often tries to trap people who are being interviewed with gotcha questions and that the group does not work well with off the record quotes.\nOther Currencies\nThe bitcoin was not the only currency to have experienced struggles in the past week even with the conference going forward. Most other major currencies have expressed similar trends where they struggled to catch up in value during Consensus but were able to get back and move forward.\nEthereum was able to move back forward in value, in particular. The currency had fallen under the $725 mark before Consensus and had struggled to get back into the range, but it had been catching up in the past few days following the event. This was in spite of Ethereum and other similar currencies not having as much attention paid to them as the bitcoin, although the bitcoin does still continue to be vital in the field.

HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group's investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd.\nHandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through \"contactless\" means once users' mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality).\nHandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: \"Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender's mobile device close to the recipient's device. That's why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.\"\nHandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using \"handle\" names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip.\nHandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy \"contactless\" payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nHandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: \"In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.\"\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: \"For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\"\nnChain's deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes: Increasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality.\nThe BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low.

CoinGate: LN ‘Without Doubt Most Awaited Bitcoin Network Upgrade’\nIn a post on Reddit, CoinGate, which has operated since 2014 but saw over half its transaction volume this year , confirmed it was operating LN in a “sandbox environment” while “intense testing” continues.\n“Lightning Network is the next major technological innovation in the Bitcoin space. Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network,” officials wrote.\n…In the meantime, we are preparing to run pilot integrations in live environment with a select group of merchants that wish to join us in becoming early adopters of this exciting tech.\nA lesser-known payment processor, CoinGate has sought to adhere to the latest technological innovations and best practices in Bitcoin, batching transactions since 2015 and implementing SegWit support in December last year.\nBy Contrast, larger operators such as BitPay and Coinbase have become known for the slow rate with which they adopt new technology.\nDespite only existing as a Bitcoin mainnet implementation since the start of 2018, LN has meanwhile already attracted a considerable number of ardent supporters , both business and private. Lightning Crosses 2000 Nodes\nCoinGate joins a select few to provide support for the protocol, which remains in a testing phase without guarantees of funds security.\nIn February, Bitcoinist reported , Blockstream opened a dedicated LN shop, a move which at the time attracted criticism due to Lightning’s volatile – or experimental – nature.\nFor its sandbox effort, CoinGate has appealed for test users to accept Bitcoin payments, while acknowledging the technology’s potential pitfalls.\n“[T]here will be bugs, both in the Lightning Network itself, and in our implementation of it; this is expected, and the reason we are publishing this post is precisely to get community feedback and squash those bugs before releasing the Lightning Network in the live environment,” the Reddit post adds.\nLast week, LN passed 2000 reachable nodes, while current network capacity is just over $163,000. At the same time, a comparison surfaced which drew attention to the considerable cost savings merchants can gain using Lightning over credit card payments.\nWhat do you think about CoinGate accepting Lightning Network payments?

A new research paper has highlighted the growing problem as major cryptocurrencies seek to solve it. Bitcoin’s Energy Crisis Explored\nAccording to the figures, the amount of energy used for each transaction could run a dishwasher for a year.\nAlex de Vries wrote: “With the Bitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, this means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018.” This doesn’t mean that Bitcoin transactions couldn’t be processed without high amounts of energy, it’s just that there are a lot of miners. Currently , miners earn about $100 per transaction.\nDigiconomist estimates the consumption of electricity by Bitcoin Miners in its Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BEXI). According to its data, Bitcoin uses 67.91 TWh annually which is just greater than Chile, ranked 40th in the world at 66 TWh. They estimate that the amount of electricity used per transaction is higher at 929 kWh which would be the equivalent of running three dishwashers for a year. The main issue is that the figures are rising at a much steeper rate and have been since September 2017.\nBEXI has to work backwards to calculate the energy used. It starts with how much money the miners are making and works out how much they probably spend on electricity. Then they consider the price of electricity and estimate how much is used. It does rely on several assumptions but it would be much harder to contact all Bitcoin miners and ask how much electricity they use. Will the Lightning Network Help?\nThe Lightning Network will take Bitcoin transactions off-chain by setting up channels between users. Transactions between them will occur and only be recorded on the blockchain when the channel is closed. This will reduce the number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain but there won’t be a significant reduction in energy use because nodes use very little energy to process transactions.\nThe majority of electricity used is for Bitcoin mining where computers generate hashes that fulfil a set of criteria. Reducing the number of transactions on the blockchain is unlikely to affect how many miners there are. Bitcoin transactions have halved since December but the mining difficulty has doubled , indicating there is twice as much mining equipment being used. This means that the Lightning Network will only be able to solve some of the problem.\nIn reality, the best bet for Bitcoin, using Proof-of-Work, is using renewable energy, as highlighted in a response to the paper. The International Energy Agency said that renewable energy is set to grow 40% by 2022 and highlighted that renewables are dominant in new energy sources being created. Iceland has already shown how it can work as it runs on 100% renewable energy. In essence, renewable electricity allows the Bitcoin Network to run without changing its underlying structure.\nOther ways of solving the problem include moving to Proof-of-Stake as Ethereum is doing. Digiconomist estimate that Ethereum uses about a third of the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin. NewsBTC reported on the recent publication of the code for Casper. The move is likely to reduce electricity usage significantly, but the question is whether or not the network will remain secure. Featured image from Shutterstock.

The price rose to above $8,500 above the resistance at the 50-day moving average (MA). Coindesk analysis Coindesk's recent technical analysis of the present situation notes that although the bearish trend of last week seems to have run out of steam over the weekend the rally was based on low volume and so may run out of steam as well. The four-hour chart shows an inverse head and shoulders breakout. This indicate a reversal of the short-term bullish trend. The daily chart shows a bullish reversal. The 5-day and 10-day moving averages also are no longer sloping downward and hence do not signal a bearish bias. The signs are that bitcoin could again rally to test the $9,000 level this week. However, the bullish case is weakened by volume data. High volume tends to be bullish and low volume bearish. The trading volume of bitcoin (BTC) has been declining even as the price went up. Over the weekend, trading volume on all exchanges was only $5 billion the lowest level since April 11. The weekend rally may not be sustainable. Coindesk's outlook The article's conclusion is: \"BTC rally lacks substance (low volumes), hence the outlook is likely neutral, despite the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout (4-hour chart) and the bullish doji reversal (daily chart). A failure to hold above $8,475 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) would revive the bearish view and allow a drop to Friday's low of $7,925. On the higher side, only a high volume move above the 100-day moving average, currently seen at $8,857, would open the doors to $10,000.\" Present situation The bitcoin price opened today above the $8,500 level at $8,520 . Since reaching a high of $8,566 the price has fallen to a low of $8,325. At 19:27 UTC the price was only marginally off the low at $8,343.10. While there a still more than four hours left in the day, the price could still go back to over $8,500 but right now it looks as if bitcoin will close below the $8,000 level no doubt a bearish sign according to the Coindesk analysis. The present price of bitcoin can be found here. Bitcoin not the only loser last week While bitcoin as the largest cryptocoin stole the limelight last week as it dropped 3.6 percent during the week it still did not do as bad as other well-known coins such as bitcoin cash (BCH) and EOS that both had double-digit losses. Others such as Zilliqa (ZIL) lost almost 20 percent the biggest loser among the top 25 currencies by capitalization. A Coindesk article has a graph showing losses and gains. Gainers, which were few, included zcash which rose 50 percent topping the list of winners as it was listed on a new exchange.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/price/", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-back-above-8500-but-does-rally-have-legs/", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-took-a-hit-last-week-but-these-cryptos-fared-worse/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ken hanly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T22:25:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7da940f2aefbbd6e0cd81b020ac40c0b248718c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrIOAmlYEQZbs73rXmli6Tdq3DVv6Zp93qEHoKik6OsOZnrW1aqOpJ2VMEI7gk14XXdcyajczMH2qn_.gGeO8HbUjcZ18fwKwF7mP18QhqUFveSdmVOrjI7", "site_full": "globalknock.com", "site": "globalknock.com", "site_section": "http://globalknock.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "GlobalKnock | all the latest news", "title": "Bitcoin is an energy hog: New numbers suggest how big a problem it is", "title_full": "Bitcoin is an energy hog: New numbers suggest how big a problem it is", "published": "2018-05-21T21:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7da940f2aefbbd6e0cd81b020ac40c0b248718c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrIOAmlYEQZbs73rXmli6Tdq3DVv6Zp93qEHoKik6OsOZnrW1aqOpJ2VMEI7gk14XXdcyajczMH2qn_.gGeO8HbUjcZ18fwKwF7mP18QhqUFveSdmVOrjI7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ultimate", "published": "2018-05-21T21:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is an energy hog: New numbers suggest how big a problem it is", "text": "Facebook This post has already been read 9 times!\nBitcoin miners will guzzle more electricity this year than some countries do, according to new numbers from a leading researcher. And while some critics take issue with these figures, few disagree that the digital currency’s energy use is a problem that’s only getting bigger.\nEconomist Alex de Vries studies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which were invented in 2008 by an anonymous computer programmer . Bitcoin allows people to buy and sell things directly from each other without the use of intermediaries, like banks or currencies controlled and manipulated by governments. Is bitcoin an environmental hazard?\nBitcoins are exchanged along a public digital ledger, known as a blockchain, where every move is tracked and verified by computers doing complex mathematical calculations, called hashes. Those willing to lend a hand in verifying the transactions and building the blockchain are rewarded with bitcoins.\nIf it sounds complicated, that’s because it is. It’s also hard work.\nDe Vries estimates that globally, computers on the bitcoin network are currently crunching 26 quintillion hashes — that’s 26,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 — every second of every day.\nBitmain, by far the biggest player in the bitcoin world, has locations where tens of thousands of computers are mining at the same time.(Qilai Shen/Bloomberg)\nIt takes quite a bit of computational power to pull that off, and de Vries is among those taking a stab at figuring out just how much energy is used in conducting all that work, publishing his latest survey — the first peer-reviewed research on the topic — in the scientific energy journal Joule .\nBy his math, computers hashing for bitcoins — known as “miners” — are currently using at least 2.5 gigawatts of power, and are on track to collectively suck up more than three times that by the end of this year. That’s more than Ireland, Austria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and most Canadian provinces each use in a year. READ MORE:: 'Small-minded' initiatives that undermine our values a concern, Governor General says ‘It is growing fast’\nDe Vries also estimates the industry’s voracious appetite for juice has doubled in the past six months, possibly due to new interest in bitcoin — their price spiked to just under $20,000 each at the end of last year — but also because energy-consumption growth is baked in: the supply of undiscovered bitcoins is dwindling so it takes more work to find those left.\nIn the early days, it was comparatively easy to find a bitcoin, as there were fewer miners competing for the work. Mining could be done by hobbyists using personal computers. But as the digital currency’s popularity — and value — has skyrocketed, the increased complexity of the blockchain requires more energy and computing power to solve equations, and now there’s specialized computing farms mining for bitcoin.\nBy de Vries’ math, a single bitcoin transaction uses as much electricity as a typical Canadian home would consume in a month — and there are 200,000 transactions being processed each day.\n“Bitcoin has a big problem,” de Vries wrote. “And it is growing fast.”\nBut de Vries’ numbers and methodology are not without their critics. The economist comes up with his estimates by assuming most large-scale miners are using the most energy-efficient devices possible, then factors in how many machines are known to be in use and the cost of electricity where these machines are known to be clustered.\nHe admits he’s taking educated guesses, partly because many bitcoin miners operate in relative secrecy.\nResearcher and economist Alex de Vries has been charting his best guess at bitcoin’s electricity usage on Twitter at @DigiEconomist for more than a year now.(Alex de Vries) READ MORE:: How Harvey cleanup bill could cost Trump his border wall but save his presidency\nStanford University lecturer Jonathan Koomey says de Vries’ work makes far too many leaps of logic, which results in assumptions that are likely wildly out of step with reality.\n“We know there’s a lot of electricity used and we know there’s rapid growth,” Koomey said in an interview. “But nobody has been in these facilities and we don’t have information on the servers themselves.”\nThe 800-pound gorilla of the bitcoin world is a Chinese company called Bitmain , which has huge operations in Mongolia and remote parts of China. Bitmain is a fascinating player as the company both mines for bitcoin itself, but also sells mining equipment to others. Canadian couple invests $100K to build backyard bitcoin mine\nTheir most efficient model, known as an Antminer S9, has the computational power of about a half-million PlayStation 3 gaming consoles, but uses as much wattage as a dishwasher in the process, according to de Vries.\nIt’s not hard to imagine how 20,000 of those devices — as one of Bitmain’s locations in Mongolia is believed to have — would net an eye-watering electricity bill.\nIndividual bitcoin-mining machines, such as these, have large demands for energy, partly because of the heat that they emit.(Glen Kugelstadt/CBC)\nIt’s also not hard to understand why many of the largest mining facilities are set up in cold-weather places with a steady supply of cheap power, such as Manitoba, Quebec and Iceland . “Rational agents would undertake mining while the marginal costs are lower,” de Vries said.\nWe still don’t know exactly how much power they’re using or how much they pay for it.\nDe Vries admits his work is only meant to be a starting off point for future research. “I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That’s actually quite debatable,” he said. READ MORE:: After 4 years of waiting, her alleged abuser was finally brought to trial—then charges were stayed\n“We don’t really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started.”\nBut Koomey argues it’s classic scaremongering to worry about the electricity use of new technologies. Twenty years ago, he recalls that the media was full of stories about how internet usage was growing too rapidly , and reportedly destined to consume as much as half of all electricity in the world.\n“I’ve seen this happen over and over,” said Koomey. “That was bunk, [so] people shouldn’t jump to conclusions.”\n“To be clear, [bitcoin mining] is a big user of electricity and growing rapidly,” he said. “But we need to be careful to not to overhype the problem.”\nKoomey said he puts more stead in the work of Marc Bevand, another researcher who suggests de Vries is overestimating bitcoin’s power consumption, possibly by twice as much. ( Bevand has published a detailed criticism of de Vries’ work online. ) ‘Digital versions of Beanie Babies’\nRegardless of the electrical toll, some argue any amount of time and effort that is going into the mining of bitcoin is a fruitless folly.\nAndreas Park, a finance professor at the University of Toronto, likens the digital currency to a major fad of the 1990s.\n“Bitcoin, such as it is, has little-to-no use. So we are effectively using our planet’s resources to secure people’s digital versions of Beanie Babies,” he told CBC News in an email.\n“I am a fan of decentralization and blockchains, but I sincerely hope that we find mathematically and economically sound alternative approaches soon that replace this waste of resources.” You may also like", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bitcoin-mine-canada-1.4436149", "http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/net-energy-studies.html", "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-tuesday-january-2-2018-1.4469360/is-bitcoin-an-environmental-hazard-1.4469361", "https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-canada-1.4543319", "http://blog.zorinaq.com/serious-faults-in-beci/", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bitcoin-energy-iceland-1.4532930", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bitcoin-virtual-currency-hitting-the-mainstream-1.1312022", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-cryptocurrency-quebec-manitoba-mining-1.4484307", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://globalknock.com/bitcoin-is-an-energy-hog-new-numbers-suggest-how-big-a-problem-it-is/&t=Bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T00:48:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41ea7a8a651117aa27a908b61f8fe28a867914ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmc3fJRxfG4HtVg37LOkj_ck-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=217.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Collectibles", "title": "[INVITE ONLY RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE IN 19.0 BITCOIN COMIC BOOK", "title_full": "[INVITE ONLY RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM IN A GOOD MOOD 19.0 BITCOIN COMIC BOOK", "published": "2018-05-21T21:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41ea7a8a651117aa27a908b61f8fe28a867914ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmc3fJRxfG4HtVg37LOkj_ck-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "krogothmanhattan", "published": "2018-05-21T21:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "[INVITE ONLY RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE IN 19.0 BITCOIN COMIC BOOK", "text": "OK...this is going to be different!

The market works improperly, and it should be revitalised. The reason for it is not only the fact that people wait to get profits, but the fact that there are not much things you can do now, except drugs and trading. This has to be changed before btc can go up to $20k and maybe more\nThis is how deflationary coins work. At start the number of coins increases because of the emission.

As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future.\nSauter and McGill are also participating lawyers in the Digital Currency & Ledger Defense Coalition (DCLDC), a coalition of lawyers and academics whose collaborated effort focuses on understanding the regulatory and legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to protect individual constitutional rights and civil liberties in connection with regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny.\nFor a large financial institution such as ICE or Goldman Sachs, figuring out how to develop a cryptocurrency trading platform is a potentially complicated analysis that begins with the question of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. If a cryptocurrency is deemed a security by the Howey test , “there are a lot more regulatory requirements,” according to McGill.\nWhile many people agree, including Peter Van Valkenburgh , director of research at the Coin Center, that the Howey test can act as the ultimate clarifier of which cryptocurrency is a security and which is not; the distinction is also important for another reason. Ultimately, the Howey test gives guidance in which regulatory agency polices which cryptocurrency. At this point, securities fall under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. Non-security cryptocurrencies — or commodities until proven otherwise — are in the realm of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While this is obvious to anyone who can remember each agency’s full name, the distinction is also important because each agency has taken a different approach to policing cryptocurrency.\nThe SEC has gone after what McGill called “ low-hanging fruit .” These are the “pump-and-dump” ICOs that are scams or otherwise illegitimate in their offerings to investors. And, at least with ICOs, both agencies appeared to be on the same page in January 2018. More recently, the SEC has created a fake ICO . The token, aptly named HoweyCoin, is being used as a way to demonstrate potential signs of fraud in ICOs to cryptocurrency investors.\nOutside of the SEC’s scam scrubbing, Sauter and McGill have also seen regulator behavior that is not exactly encouraging for private sector participants:\n\"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) say they want to have an active dialogue with industry participants to understand the latest trends and developments. Unfortunately, we see a lot of regulators initiating those conversations with industry players by way of subpoena. Whenever you receive a subpoena from a regulator, you have to be concerned that it could be a lead-in to an enforcement action. This dynamic doesn't exactly promote a free and healthy exchange of ideas,” said McGill.\nCFTC: The Prevailing Bitcoin Regulator? In late April, SEC Chairman Clayton said bitcoin is not a security. According to both McGill and Sauter, because bitcoin will not likely be classified as a security, larger financial institutions like CME, CBOE, Goldman Sachs and now ICE are able to move forward with giving their clients exposure.\nNot being a security also means that the CFTC is the federal agency that most often acts as a watchdog over bitcoin transactions. But it is also not the only one. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has become involved in some bitcoin futures trading in pursuit of acts of perjury and obstruction of justice .\nEven if it is the prevailing regulator, how the CFTC will handle bad actors and fraud in bitcoin transactions is still up for debate. In the last year, there have been more aggressive actions such as CFTC v. McDonnell (CabbageTech) and, outside of cryptocurrencies, the CFTC’s prerogative to cut down on fraud and market manipulation ( Monex ). This could be evidence that there will likely be a crackdown on certain types of short-term trading behavior.\n“An underlying concern of the CFTC is that there are a number of people who can fairly easily impact prices with their trading. It makes it very difficult to regulate markets,” said Sauter, “but innovation is happening in futures and derivatives markets.”\nSpeaking toward how Bitcoin law will develop in the U.S., Sauter stated that industry cases which reach the court of appeals will be the ones that will ultimately shape U.S. regulation by either correcting case decision errors or clarifying and interpreting the law itself.\nContract Swaps Aren’t New or Unregulated If reports that ICE is considering using a model of trading bitcoin with swap contracts, this type of trading would remain under the regulatory realm of the CFTC. Furthermore, it would also decrease transaction speed.\nSwaps are a type of derivative contract where two parties trade based on a notional principal amount. Generally, one of these amounts is fixed while the other is variable, commonly based on an interest rate, floating currency exchange rate or index price. Swaps do not normally trade on exchanges but instead are over-the-counter contracts between different organizations. Sauter and McGill suggested that ICE would likely use an interest rate swap, though they are most likely still figuring out what they will pin bitcoin prices to.\n\"Using the swap mechanism allows ICE to position themselves squarely under CFTC regulations, but getting that regulatory certainty looks like it will come at the cost of speed,” said McGill. “One of the ideas behind bitcoin and other digital currencies that made them so attractive as a concept was the idea that market participants could securely transact with one another almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. But, if you have to create a swap product with a one-day settlement period to get regulatory clarity, then you lose a lot of what made digital currencies attractive in the first place.\"\n“Bitcoin swaps aren’t entirely novel, either,” pointed out Sauter.\nTeraExchange began offering Bitcoin-based swaps in 2014. And, since launching its derivatives swap option in October 2017 after CFTC approval, LedgerX is reported to have increased their trading volume sevenfold.\nSauter stated that one reason why regulators have not moved more quickly to establish clear law around Bitcoin is that there still remains debate and uncertainty about regulators, the CFTC in particular, to police the markets.\n“One way regulators and institutional players are dealing with this is to move trading to regulated derivatives markets, be it swaps, futures or options,” said Sauter. “When that happens, the CFTC has a much more direct line of access to the markets and market participants. That's part of the reason why we're seeing such innovation happening in the derivatives markets.”\nAnother reason Sauter proposes for the interest in Bitcoin derivatives is that they are a much easier route by which big financial institution players can get involved. “Institutional investors often have strict requirements concerning the types of markets and products they can trade, and they tend to like the idea of trading in markets that they know are being policed and that offer remedies in the event problems arise.”\nHow Decentralized Proprietary Trading Could Be Affected The implications of the rise in bitcoin-based swap contracts also means that the instantaneous transaction, so highly placed in the early value of bitcoin, might be a thing of the past for more mainstream investors to gain less-risky exposure. However, as McGill pointed out, “A lot of that early speed and eliminating transaction fees comes at the cost of added risk.”\nIt can be assumed that any cryptocurrency trader that is familiar with Mt. Gox is well aware of the risks associated with trading on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. Still, for some, the risks are worth it.\n“Some of this will just be decided by the market,” said Sauter. “Plenty of investors are weighing the risk of maybe not getting their money back when they need to unwind a trade. Traders who don’t want to deal with this will opt-into these trading platforms run by accredited institutional investors.”\n\"There's clearly more risk in operating on less regulated and decentralized exchanges,” said McGill. “There may well be more lucrative opportunities as well, but there are all sorts of risks — including insider fraud — that a lot of traders want to avoid.”\nBy this estimation, bitcoin futures have brought the attention of regulators and that will inevitably alter the current space, whether making it more regulated or diversified remains to be seen.\n\"CME bitcoin futures acted as the canary in the coal mine. From a regulatory perspective, it will be interesting to see if some of the fast-and-loose trading techniques that were being deployed on the nascent cryptocurrency exchanges carry over to the more mature and tightly regulated markets operated by CME and ICE,” said McGill. “Certainly, you're going to get more players in the mix, and that alone will probably translate into more enforcement activity by CME and government regulators.\"\nWeighing the risks of unregulated and decentralized exchanges draws back to the fundamental conflict that has been revolving around the cryptocurrency space since the Bitcoin white paper was first issued.\nWill bitcoin remain truly decentralized or will the desire to hedge against risk lead the majority of traders to accredited and regulated institutions? For many who are invested in bitcoin, not just for profit, but also ideological reasons, the answer appears obvious. Yet whether these Bitcoiners are early adopters of a movement or no more than fringe factions will be decided by the market. It would appear that less regulated and decentralized exchanges still need to develop strategies to match the greater security legacy financial institutions are championing to bring to cryptocurrency.\n\"From a regulatory point of view, the idea of decentralized exchanges pose some interesting jurisdictional questions,” said McGill. “Ultimately, U.S. regulators tend to be less concerned about physical location and more focused on whether the activity interacts with and impacts U.S. commerce. I don't think the notion of decentralizing an exchange will translate to immunity from regulators, but it has the potential to create a lot of headaches for regulators.\"\nAnother factor in ICE and other legacy institutions hopping into bitcoin trading is an increase in the space’s technological innovation brought by increased competition.\n\"Now you're going to have the most sophisticated trading companies in the world trading in these products at an algorithmic level, which will substantially increase the volume of trading activity,\" said McGill.\n“You’re going to get more players in the mix and probably many of those will have less regulatory experience and perhaps as a result more enforcement cases,” said Sauter.\nOn New Competition and Shorting Though the involvement for big U.S.-based financial players will certainly affect the market, established cryptocurrency exchanges are optimistic about the future.\nTendai Musakwa, director of marketing at the Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange, BTCC, believes that exchanges like BTCC “will remain the go-to cryptocurrency market for retail clients for the foreseeable future.”\n“We specifically designed our USD exchange to be accessible, drawing on our seven years’ experience operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange to create an effortless crypto trading experience. “\nMusakwa also pointed out that many legacy financial exchanges will have “high barriers of entry and inaccessible or confusing user interfaces.” Citing “real-person 24/7 customer support and deposit options such as credit cards,” he believes that cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to create value that institutional exchanges are unable to offer. “In addition, legacy fiat exchanges are geographically bound, while exchanges like BTCC offer customers worldwide easy access to BTC/USD trading.”\nAdded to this, Sauter attested that there are still many more regulatory hurdles for institutional exchanges — many of which have not yet been created. For instance, “even if an exchange is authorized, investment companies and broker dealers and issuers of ICOs must become accredited before they can move forward.”\nThe ICE has also indicated that plans for such a platform could dissolve at anytime based on the unregulated changes in cryptocurrency market. Another institutional player, CEO of Nasdaq Adena Friedman told CNBC that Nasdaq would be open for bitcoin trading when “people are ready for a more regulated market.”\n“It’s going to be a more balanced marketplace going forward,” stated McGill. “It would be a shame that, in the process, a lot of what has drawn people into cryptocurrency could be lost in the shuffle due to new regulation.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nRead Article Full The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation : https://ift.tt/2GDjMe7", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kobre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben sauter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave mcgill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sauter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcgill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital currency & ledger defense coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T06:57:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5411168a96da277e6a948d5d3309e9dcfd11080", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwKXYDgQ_GCEk52vRRGGhaGE_hKC5GKtHvBWD7_W6H82o6UT3qX96OJGWgkWhM7c.XGLL2DwWCSCXuRJapcyD7KnzonAE3llHPCCMZ_px2SZ4qlNJGz1wqdKfH9hhe4K2uCFFKNSFqm7g--", "site_full": "forimmediaterelease.net", "site": "forimmediaterelease.net", "site_section": "http://forimmediaterelease.net/rsslatest.xml", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "forimmediaterelease.net", "title": "nChain Acquires Majority Stake in HandCash Wallet for Bitcoin Cash | forimmediaterelease.net", "title_full": "nChain Acquires Majority Stake in HandCash Wallet for Bitcoin Cash | forimmediaterelease.net", "published": "2018-05-21T21:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY02076&#038;sd=2018-05-21", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5411168a96da277e6a948d5d3309e9dcfd11080", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwKXYDgQ_GCEk52vRRGGhaGE_hKC5GKtHvBWD7_W6H82o6UT3qX96OJGWgkWhM7c.XGLL2DwWCSCXuRJapcyD7KnzonAE3llHPCCMZ_px2SZ4qlNJGz1wqdKfH9hhe4K2uCFFKNSFqm7g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T21:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "nChain Acquires Majority Stake in HandCash Wallet for Bitcoin Cash | forimmediaterelease.net", "text": "May 21, 2018 | By forimmediaterele | Filed in: Press Releases .\nTravel & Tourism Industry release:\nLONDON , May 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ — nChain Group, the leading blockchain research and development group, has closed deal terms to acquire a majority stake in HandCash. HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group’s investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd.\nHandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through “contactless” means once users’ mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality).\nHandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: “Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender’s mobile device close to the recipient’s device. That’s why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.”\nHandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using “handle” names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip.\nHandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy “contactless” payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nHandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: “In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.”\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: “For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.”\nnChain’s deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes: Increasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality.\nThe BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)’s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low. The upgrade validates HandCash’s vision in creating its wallet product for Bitcoin Cash.\nWebsite: nChain.comTwitter: @nChainGlobal\nABOUT NCHAIN GROUP: The nChain Group is the global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies.

As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future.\nSauter and McGill are also participating lawyers in the Digital Currency & Ledger Defense Coalition (DCLDC), a coalition of lawyers and academics whose collaborated effort focuses on understanding the regulatory and legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to protect individual constitutional rights and civil liberties in connection with regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny.\nFor a large financial institution such as ICE or Goldman Sachs, figuring out how to develop a cryptocurrency trading platform is a potentially complicated analysis that begins with the question of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. If a cryptocurrency is deemed a security by the Howey test , “there are a lot more regulatory requirements,” according to McGill.\nWhile many people agree, including Peter Van Valkenburgh , director of research at the Coin Center, that the Howey test can act as the ultimate clarifier of which cryptocurrency is a security and which is not; the distinction is also important for another reason. Ultimately, the Howey test gives guidance in which regulatory agency polices which cryptocurrency. At this point, securities fall under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. Non-security cryptocurrencies — or commodities until proven otherwise — are in the realm of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While this is obvious to anyone who can remember each agency’s full name, the distinction is also important because each agency has taken a different approach to policing cryptocurrency.\nThe SEC has gone after what McGill called “ low-hanging fruit .” These are the “pump-and-dump” ICOs that are scams or otherwise illegitimate in their offerings to investors. And, at least with ICOs, both agencies appeared to be on the same page in January 2018. More recently, the SEC has created a fake ICO . The token, aptly named HoweyCoin, is being used as a way to demonstrate potential signs of fraud in ICOs to cryptocurrency investors.\nOutside of the SEC’s scam scrubbing, Sauter and McGill have also seen regulator behavior that is not exactly encouraging for private sector participants:\n\"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) say they want to have an active dialogue with industry participants to understand the latest trends and developments. Unfortunately, we see a lot of regulators initiating those conversations with industry players by way of subpoena. Whenever you receive a subpoena from a regulator, you have to be concerned that it could be a lead-in to an enforcement action. This dynamic doesn't exactly promote a free and healthy exchange of ideas,” said McGill. CFTC: The Prevailing Bitcoin Regulator?\nIn late April, SEC Chairman Clayton said bitcoin is not a security. According to both McGill and Sauter, because bitcoin will not likely be classified as a security, larger financial institutions like CME, CBOE, Goldman Sachs and now ICE are able to move forward with giving their clients exposure.\nNot being a security also means that the CFTC is the federal agency that most often acts as a watchdog over bitcoin transactions. But it is also not the only one. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has become involved in some bitcoin futures trading in pursuit of acts of perjury and obstruction of justice .\nEven if it is the prevailing regulator, how the CFTC will handle bad actors and fraud in bitcoin transactions is still up for debate. In the last year, there have been more aggressive actions such as CFTC v. McDonnell (CabbageTech) and, outside of cryptocurrencies, the CFTC’s prerogative to cut down on fraud and market manipulation ( Monex ). This could be evidence that there will likely be a crackdown on certain types of short-term trading behavior.\n“An underlying concern of the CFTC is that there are a number of people who can fairly easily impact prices with their trading. It makes it very difficult to regulate markets,” said Sauter, “but innovation is happening in futures and derivatives markets.”\nSpeaking toward how Bitcoin law will develop in the U.S., Sauter stated that industry cases which reach the court of appeals will be the ones that will ultimately shape U.S. regulation by either correcting case decision errors or clarifying and interpreting the law itself. Contract Swaps Aren’t New or Unregulated\nIf reports that ICE is considering using a model of trading bitcoin with swap contracts, this type of trading would remain under the regulatory realm of the CFTC. Furthermore, it would also decrease transaction speed.\nSwaps are a type of derivative contract where two parties trade based on a notional principal amount. Generally, one of these amounts is fixed while the other is variable, commonly based on an interest rate, floating currency exchange rate or index price. Swaps do not normally trade on exchanges but instead are over-the-counter contracts between different organizations. Sauter and McGill suggested that ICE would likely use an interest rate swap, though they are most likely still figuring out what they will pin bitcoin prices to.\n\"Using the swap mechanism allows ICE to position themselves squarely under CFTC regulations, but getting that regulatory certainty looks like it will come at the cost of speed,” said McGill. “One of the ideas behind bitcoin and other digital currencies that made them so attractive as a concept was the idea that market participants could securely transact with one another almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. But, if you have to create a swap product with a one-day settlement period to get regulatory clarity, then you lose a lot of what made digital currencies attractive in the first place.\"\n“Bitcoin swaps aren’t entirely novel, either,” pointed out Sauter.\nTeraExchange began offering Bitcoin-based swaps in 2014. And, since launching its derivatives swap option in October 2017 after CFTC approval, LedgerX is reported to have increased their trading volume sevenfold.\nSauter stated that one reason why regulators have not moved more quickly to establish clear law around Bitcoin is that there still remains debate and uncertainty about regulators, the CFTC in particular, to police the markets.\n“One way regulators and institutional players are dealing with this is to move trading to regulated derivatives markets, be it swaps, futures or options,” said Sauter. “When that happens, the CFTC has a much more direct line of access to the markets and market participants. That's part of the reason why we're seeing such innovation happening in the derivatives markets.”\nAnother reason Sauter proposes for the interest in Bitcoin derivatives is that they are a much easier route by which big financial institution players can get involved. “Institutional investors often have strict requirements concerning the types of markets and products they can trade, and they tend to like the idea of trading in markets that they know are being policed and that offer remedies in the event problems arise.” How Decentralized Proprietary Trading Could Be Affected\nThe implications of the rise in bitcoin-based swap contracts also means that the instantaneous transaction, so highly placed in the early value of bitcoin, might be a thing of the past for more mainstream investors to gain less-risky exposure. However, as McGill pointed out, “A lot of that early speed and eliminating transaction fees comes at the cost of added risk.”\nIt can be assumed that any cryptocurrency trader that is familiar with Mt. Gox is well aware of the risks associated with trading on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. Still, for some, the risks are worth it.\n“Some of this will just be decided by the market,” said Sauter. “Plenty of investors are weighing the risk of maybe not getting their money back when they need to unwind a trade. Traders who don’t want to deal with this will opt-into these trading platforms run by accredited institutional investors.”\n\"There's clearly more risk in operating on less regulated and decentralized exchanges,” said McGill. “There may well be more lucrative opportunities as well, but there are all sorts of risks — including insider fraud — that a lot of traders want to avoid.”\nBy this estimation, bitcoin futures have brought the attention of regulators and that will inevitably alter the current space, whether making it more regulated or diversified remains to be seen.\n\"CME bitcoin futures acted as the canary in the coal mine. From a regulatory perspective, it will be interesting to see if some of the fast-and-loose trading techniques that were being deployed on the nascent cryptocurrency exchanges carry over to the more mature and tightly regulated markets operated by CME and ICE,” said McGill. “Certainly, you're going to get more players in the mix, and that alone will probably translate into more enforcement activity by CME and government regulators.\"\nWeighing the risks of unregulated and decentralized exchanges draws back to the fundamental conflict that has been revolving around the cryptocurrency space since the Bitcoin white paper was first issued.\nWill bitcoin remain truly decentralized or will the desire to hedge against risk lead the majority of traders to accredited and regulated institutions? For many who are invested in bitcoin, not just for profit, but also ideological reasons, the answer appears obvious. Yet whether these Bitcoiners are early adopters of a movement or no more than fringe factions will be decided by the market. It would appear that less regulated and decentralized exchanges still need to develop strategies to match the greater security legacy financial institutions are championing to bring to cryptocurrency.\n\"From a regulatory point of view, the idea of decentralized exchanges pose some interesting jurisdictional questions,” said McGill. “Ultimately, U.S. regulators tend to be less concerned about physical location and more focused on whether the activity interacts with and impacts U.S. commerce. I don't think the notion of decentralizing an exchange will translate to immunity from regulators, but it has the potential to create a lot of headaches for regulators.\"\nAnother factor in ICE and other legacy institutions hopping into bitcoin trading is an increase in the space’s technological innovation brought by increased competition.\n\"Now you're going to have the most sophisticated trading companies in the world trading in these products at an algorithmic level, which will substantially increase the volume of trading activity,\" said McGill.\n“You’re going to get more players in the mix and probably many of those will have less regulatory experience and perhaps as a result more enforcement cases,” said Sauter. On New Competition and Shorting\nThough the involvement for big U.S.-based financial players will certainly affect the market, established cryptocurrency exchanges are optimistic about the future.\nTendai Musakwa, director of marketing at the Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange, BTCC, believes that exchanges like BTCC “will remain the go-to cryptocurrency market for retail clients for the foreseeable future.”\n“We specifically designed our USD exchange to be accessible, drawing on our seven years’ experience operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange to create an effortless crypto trading experience. “\nMusakwa also pointed out that many legacy financial exchanges will have “high barriers of entry and inaccessible or confusing user interfaces.” Citing “real-person 24/7 customer support and deposit options such as credit cards,” he believes that cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to create value that institutional exchanges are unable to offer. “In addition, legacy fiat exchanges are geographically bound, while exchanges like BTCC offer customers worldwide easy access to BTC/USD trading.”\nAdded to this, Sauter attested that there are still many more regulatory hurdles for institutional exchanges — many of which have not yet been created. For instance, “even if an exchange is authorized, investment companies and broker dealers and issuers of ICOs must become accredited before they can move forward.”\nThe ICE has also indicated that plans for such a platform could dissolve at anytime based on the unregulated changes in cryptocurrency market. Another institutional player, CEO of Nasdaq Adena Friedman told CNBC that Nasdaq would be open for bitcoin trading when “people are ready for a more regulated market.”\n“It’s going to be a more balanced marketplace going forward,” stated McGill. “It would be a shame that, in the process, a lot of what has drawn people into cryptocurrency could be lost in the shuffle due to new regulation.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : bitcoinmagazine.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

by The New York Times (NYT) and Bitcoin Magazine , Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is developing an online trading platform that would allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future.\nSauter and McGill are also participating lawyers in the Digital Currency & Ledger Defense Coalition (DCLDC), a coalition of lawyers and academics whose collaborated effort focuses on understanding the regulatory and legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to protect individual constitutional rights and civil liberties in connection with regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny.\nFor a large financial institution such as ICE or Goldman Sachs, figuring out how to develop a cryptocurrency trading platform is a potentially complicated analysis that begins with the question of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. If a cryptocurrency is deemed a security by the Howey test , \"there are a lot more regulatory requirements,\" according to McGill.\nWhile many people agree, including Peter Van Valkenburgh , director of research at the Coin Center, that the Howey test can act as the ultimate clarifier of which cryptocurrency is a security and which is not; the distinction is also important for another reason. Ultimately, the Howey test gives guidance in which regulatory agency polices which cryptocurrency. At this point, securities fall under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) jurisdiction. Non-security cryptocurrencies — or commodities until proven otherwise — are in the realm of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While this is obvious to anyone who can remember each agency's full name, the distinction is also important because each agency has taken a different approach to policing cryptocurrency.\nThe SEC has gone after what McGill called \" low-hanging fruit .\" These are the \"pump-and-dump\" ICOs that are scams or otherwise illegitimate in their offerings to investors. And, at least with ICOs, both agencies appeared to be on the same page in January 2018. More recently, the SEC has created a fake ICO . The token, aptly named HoweyCoin, is being used as a way to demonstrate potential signs of fraud in ICOs to cryptocurrency investors.\nOutside of the SEC's scam scrubbing, Sauter and McGill have also seen regulator behavior that is not exactly encouraging for private sector participants:\n\"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) say they want to have an active dialogue with industry participants to understand the latest trends and developments. Unfortunately, we see a lot of regulators initiating those conversations with industry players by way of subpoena. Whenever you receive a subpoena from a regulator, you have to be concerned that it could be a lead-in to an enforcement action. This dynamic doesn't exactly promote a free and healthy exchange of ideas,\" said McGill.\nCFTC: The Prevailing Bitcoin Regulator? In late April, SEC Chairman Clayton said bitcoin is not a security. According to both McGill and Sauter, because bitcoin will not likely be classified as a security, larger financial institutions like CME, CBOE, Goldman Sachs and now ICE are able to move forward with giving their clients exposure.\nNot being a security also means that the CFTC is the federal agency that most often acts as a watchdog over bitcoin transactions. But it is also not the only one. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has become involved in some bitcoin futures trading in pursuit of acts of perjury and obstruction of justice .\nEven if it is the prevailing regulator, how the CFTC will handle bad actors and fraud in bitcoin transactions is still up for debate. In the last year, there have been more aggressive actions such as CFTC v. McDonnell (CabbageTech) and, outside of cryptocurrencies, the CFTC's prerogative to cut down on fraud and market manipulation ( Monex ). This could be evidence that there will likely be a crackdown on certain types of short-term trading behavior.\n\"An underlying concern of the CFTC is that there are a number of people who can fairly easily impact prices with their trading. It makes it very difficult to regulate markets,\" said Sauter, \"but innovation is happening in futures and derivatives markets.\"\nSpeaking toward how Bitcoin law will develop in the U.S., Sauter stated that industry cases which reach the court of appeals will be the ones that will ultimately shape U.S. regulation by either correcting case decision errors or clarifying and interpreting the law itself.\nContract Swaps Aren't New or Unregulated If reports that ICE is considering using a model of trading bitcoin with swap contracts, this type of trading would remain under the regulatory realm of the CFTC. Furthermore, it would also decrease transaction speed.\nSwaps are a type of derivative contract where two parties trade based on a notional principal amount. Generally, one of these amounts is fixed while the other is variable, commonly based on an interest rate, floating currency exchange rate or index price. Swaps do not normally trade on exchanges but instead are over-the-counter contracts between different organizations. Sauter and McGill suggested that ICE would likely use an interest rate swap, though they are most likely still figuring out what they will pin bitcoin prices to.\n\"Using the swap mechanism allows ICE to position themselves squarely under CFTC regulations, but getting that regulatory certainty looks like it will come at the cost of speed,\" said McGill. \"One of the ideas behind bitcoin and other digital currencies that made them so attractive as a concept was the idea that market participants could securely transact with one another almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. But, if you have to create a swap product with a one-day settlement period to get regulatory clarity, then you lose a lot of what made digital currencies attractive in the first place.\"\n\"Bitcoin swaps aren't entirely novel, either,\" pointed out Sauter.\nTeraExchange began offering Bitcoin-based swaps in 2014. And, since launching its derivatives swap option in October 2017 after CFTC approval, LedgerX is reported to have increased their trading volume sevenfold.\nSauter stated that one reason why regulators have not moved more quickly to establish clear law around Bitcoin is that there still remains debate and uncertainty about regulators, the CFTC in particular, to police the markets.\n\"One way regulators and institutional players are dealing with this is to move trading to regulated derivatives markets, be it swaps, futures or options,\" said Sauter. \"When that happens, the CFTC has a much more direct line of access to the markets and market participants. That's part of the reason why we're seeing such innovation happening in the derivatives markets.\"\nAnother reason Sauter proposes for the interest in Bitcoin derivatives is that they are a much easier route by which big financial institution players can get involved. \"Institutional investors often have strict requirements concerning the types of markets and products they can trade, and they tend to like the idea of trading in markets that they know are being policed and that offer remedies in the event problems arise.\"\nHow Decentralized Proprietary Trading Could Be Affected The implications of the rise in bitcoin-based swap contracts also means that the instantaneous transaction, so highly placed in the early value of bitcoin, might be a thing of the past for more mainstream investors to gain less-risky exposure. However, as McGill pointed out, \"A lot of that early speed and eliminating transaction fees comes at the cost of added risk.\"\nIt can be assumed that any cryptocurrency trader that is familiar with Mt. Gox is well aware of the risks associated with trading on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. Still, for some, the risks are worth it.\n\"Some of this will just be decided by the market,\" said Sauter. \"Plenty of investors are weighing the risk of maybe not getting their money back when they need to unwind a trade. Traders who don't want to deal with this will opt-into these trading platforms run by accredited institutional investors.\"\n\"There's clearly more risk in operating on less regulated and decentralized exchanges,\" said McGill. \"There may well be more lucrative opportunities as well, but there are all sorts of risks — including insider fraud — that a lot of traders want to avoid.\"\nBy this estimation, bitcoin futures have brought the attention of regulators and that will inevitably alter the current space, whether making it more regulated or diversified remains to be seen.\n\"CME bitcoin futures acted as the canary in the coal mine. From a regulatory perspective, it will be interesting to see if some of the fast-and-loose trading techniques that were being deployed on the nascent cryptocurrency exchanges carry over to the more mature and tightly regulated markets operated by CME and ICE,\" said McGill. \"Certainly, you're going to get more players in the mix, and that alone will probably translate into more enforcement activity by CME and government regulators.\"\nWeighing the risks of unregulated and decentralized exchanges draws back to the fundamental conflict that has been revolving around the cryptocurrency space since the Bitcoin white paper was first issued.\nWill bitcoin remain truly decentralized or will the desire to hedge against risk lead the majority of traders to accredited and regulated institutions? For many who are invested in bitcoin, not just for profit, but also ideological reasons, the answer appears obvious. Yet whether these Bitcoiners are early adopters of a movement or no more than fringe factions will be decided by the market. It would appear that less regulated and decentralized exchanges still need to develop strategies to match the greater security legacy financial institutions are championing to bring to cryptocurrency.\n\"From a regulatory point of view, the idea of decentralized exchanges pose some interesting jurisdictional questions,\" said McGill. \"Ultimately, U.S. regulators tend to be less concerned about physical location and more focused on whether the activity interacts with and impacts U.S. commerce. I don't think the notion of decentralizing an exchange will translate to immunity from regulators, but it has the potential to create a lot of headaches for regulators.\"\nAnother factor in ICE and other legacy institutions hopping into bitcoin trading is an increase in the space's technological innovation brought by increased competition.\n\"Now you're going to have the most sophisticated trading companies in the world trading in these products at an algorithmic level, which will substantially increase the volume of trading activity,\" said McGill.\n\"You're going to get more players in the mix and probably many of those will have less regulatory experience and perhaps as a result more enforcement cases,\" said Sauter.\nOn New Competition and Shorting Though the involvement for big U.S.-based financial players will certainly affect the market, established cryptocurrency exchanges are optimistic about the future.\nTendai Musakwa, director of marketing at the Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange, BTCC, believes that exchanges like BTCC \"will remain the go-to cryptocurrency market for retail clients for the foreseeable future.\"\n\"We specifically designed our USD exchange to be accessible, drawing on our seven years' experience operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange to create an effortless crypto trading experience. \"\nMusakwa also pointed out that many legacy financial exchanges will have \"high barriers of entry and inaccessible or confusing user interfaces.\" Citing \"real-person 24/7 customer support and deposit options such as credit cards,\" he believes that cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to create value that institutional exchanges are unable to offer. \"In addition, legacy fiat exchanges are geographically bound, while exchanges like BTCC offer customers worldwide easy access to BTC/USD trading.\"\nAdded to this, Sauter attested that there are still many more regulatory hurdles for institutional exchanges — many of which have not yet been created. For instance, \"even if an exchange is authorized, investment companies and broker dealers and issuers of ICOs must become accredited before they can move forward.\"\nThe ICE has also indicated that plans for such a platform could dissolve at anytime based on the unregulated changes in cryptocurrency market. Another institutional player, CEO of Nasdaq Adena Friedman told CNBC that Nasdaq would be open for bitcoin trading when \"people are ready for a more regulated market.\"\n\"It's going to be a more balanced marketplace going forward,\" stated McGill. \"It would be a shame that, in the process, a lot of what has drawn people into cryptocurrency could be lost in the shuffle due to new regulation.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group’s investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd.\nHandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through “contactless” means once users’ mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality).\nHandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: “Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender’s mobile device close to the recipient’s device. That’s why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.”\nHandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using “handle” names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip.\nHandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy “contactless” payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nHandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: “In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.”\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: “For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.”\nnChain’s deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes: Increasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality.\nThe BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)’s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low.

HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group’s investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd.\nHandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through “contactless” means once users’ mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality).\nHandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: “Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender’s mobile device close to the recipient’s device. That’s why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.”\nHandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using “handle” names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip.\nHandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy “contactless” payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nHandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: “In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.”\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: “For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.”\nnChain’s deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes: Increasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality.\nThe BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)’s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low. The upgrade validates HandCash’s vision in creating its wallet product for Bitcoin Cash.\nWebsite: nChain.com Twitter: @nChainGlobal\nABOUT NCHAIN GROUP: The nChain Group is the global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies.

Miners often make use of huge computing energy, and a substantial amount of competitors is concerned in Bitcoin mining. Computers work to resolve complicated mathematical issues. The competing miners even have a prospect to earn Bitcoins within the course of, by simply fixing the issue. Although, problem ranges of those issues have gotten intense day-to-day. Transactions on the Bitcoin community are relentless and relentless, and protecting monitor of these transactions is pretty systematic. Bitcoin community retains it methodical, as throughout a given time span, all transactions are collected in a block. The miners are alleged to validate transactions, and every thing is listed in a general ledger, which is just a group of blocks, termed as blockchain. Blockchain truly holds the important thing to the main points of any transaction made throughout numerous Bitcoin addresses.\nBitcoin integration into folks’s lives is essentially the most coveted factor proper now.

That’s what Warren Buffet thinks.\nWrong. Bitcoin has Cashflow.\nimage courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nWhere is the Cashflow? Lending to Margin-Traders at Exchanges\nHard Forks\nArbitrage of the Basis (Contango or Backwardation) of Bitcoin Futures at BitMEX , OKEX, CME & CBOT\nI only treat Lending at Exchanges for now. (I might treat income from HFs and Arbitrage of the Basis in a follow-up piece.)\nLending at Exchanges Lending Bitcoin\nYou can lend your Bitcoin to margin traders at BitMEX , Poloniex and Bitfinex. Annual compounded rates of over a million percent have been available in the past and this writer has lent at those rates. I provide evidence of that 1,000,000 % below.\nAt time of writing (20 May 2018) 50,000 Bitcoin with a value of $415 million are out on loan at Bitfinex at 0.01% Daily / 3.6% Annualised (compounded).\nLending USD\nYou can lend USD as well as Bitcoin to margin traders at Bitfinex. The exchange works like a bank In Real Life pumped on steroids. In Real Life saving rates average about 1% annually in the advanced economies of the OECD. (E.g. Japan 0.1%, Germany 0.1%, UK 1.9%, US 2.35%.) In the Bitcoin world annualised USD rates of 30%-100% are often available, particularly when the market is bullish. How is this possible? Traders at Bitfinex wishing to buy Bitcoin on leverage need to borrow USD to do so. It is the other users of the exchange who lend them these dollars. But USD is in short supply at Bitfinex when the Bitcoin market is optimistic because most users want to be holding Bitcoin not dollars to benefit from the price appreciation.\nAt time of writing USD with value $720 million are being lent out at Bitfinex at 0.065% Daily / 26% Annualised (compounded).\nWhen the Bitcoin market is bullish then USD rates tend to exceed Bitcoin rates. (Margin traders need to borrow USD to finance their BTCUSD Longs.) When the market is bearish the BTC rate exceeds the USD rate as traders need to borrow Bitcoin to Short it.\nSource BFXData.com . See how Rates on USD lending (Blue line) are lower in 2018 than in 2017 as result of bear Bitcoin market in 2018. A Daily rate of 0.1% equates to an annual compounded rate of 44%. Bitfinexed is like a savings bank on steroids.\nI want to focus on Bitcoin lending and demonstrate that Bitcoin has cashflow. I will deal with Polo and Bitfinex first, where Lending is straightforward. Lending Bitcoin at BitMEX often offers the best rates, but it is a little tricky.\nLending at Poloniex You can lend BTC to margin traders at Polo who are going Long on ALTBTC positions with leverage. (They need to borrow BTC to pay for the ALT positions.) There is no USD Lending market at Polo.\nWhen Alts are pumping you will get a great Lending rate; rates will be modest when Altcoin markets are quiet of falling. Rates can go batshit when there is volatility incoming. A daily rate of 0.1593% seen in the table below is 79% compounded annualised.\nPoloniex BTC Lending rate - you need to scroll down to see where the first sizeable loans are offered. People gearing up to buy alts. pic.twitter.com/kYiDREIYMh\n— BambouClub (@BambouClub) June 15, 2017 Rates exploded in the run-up to the Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork on 1 August 2017. The reason was every man and his dog moved their BTC off the exchanges into cold storage to ensure they received their Bitcoin Cash. So there was very little Supply of Bitcoin available for Lending.\nLeading up to the fork, 'annualized' Bitcoin interest rate range was 329% - 3,678% (based on daily rates of 0.4-1.0%) #BIBOR @RyanRadloff pic.twitter.com/u3PPoEm62P\n— Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) August 4, 2017 BTC lending rate at Poloniex now 0.4906% daily, 500% annual. This should be a case study in Economics textbooks one day. pic.twitter.com/ijFifVyLCr\n— BambouClub (@BambouClub) July 29, 2017 Lent 4 BTC at Polo at 1 million % APR for 60 days just before Fork. Interest payments are now 0.53 BTC = 6.46 $BCH at 0.082.\n54 days to go.\n— BambouClub (@BambouClub) August 5, 2017 Zooming out, we can see that pronounced effect of thr Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork on 1 August 2017. (Data is from Bitfinex but the point stands.)\nSource BFXData.com . See how Rates on BTC lending (Blue line) exploded at 1 August 2017. And see how BTC lending rate is highish in Feb and March 2018 as ascendant bears borrowed BTC to short. A Daily rate of 0.05% equates to an annual compounded rate of 20%.\nHow to earn this interest at Poloniex? It’s easy. Move BTC to your Polo Lending Wallet and offer them for Loan under the Lending tab. You need to set an Amount, a Duration, and a Rate. Set a rate that is in line with the market as seen in Loan Offers . If you try for too high a rate your Offer will not get filled. You can ignore the Loan Demands table.\nLending at Bitfinex Lending is called Funding at Bitfinex. (And confusingly, Funding at Kraken means Deposits and Withdrawals.)\na. You can lend BTC to fund margin traders at Bitfinex who are going Long on ALTBTC positions with leverage.\nb. Bitfinex also offers BTCUSD margin trading (unlike Polo) so you can lend BTC to those going Short on BTCUSD . (They need to possess BTC to sell it.)\nc. You can also lend USD to traders going Long on BTCUSD and ALTUSD.\nUSD rates at Bitfinex tend to dwarf those available In Real Life.\nYou can currently earn a fortune lending USD at Bitfinex.\nDaily Rate: 0.24273%\nAnnualised rate: 146.95 % p.a. pic.twitter.com/feJZDQ7uTn\n— BambouClub (@BambouClub) October 14, 2017 So, how to lend at Bitfinex? Again, it’s easy. Move BTC or USD to your Funding Wallet. Then go to the Funding Tab and make your Loan Offers, setting an Amount, a Period and a Rate.\nWhen a BTC offer is accepted by a margin trader, the BTC in your funding wallet will be used by the trader to sell bitcoins (open a position). When the trader completes a trade by closing the position, they buy BTC which is returned to your wallet.\nUse the Auto-Renew feature to avoid a lot of donkey work. More info. on Funding at Bitfinex .\nThere are great stats available on Bitfinex Funding .\nYou can also lend ALTS at Bitfinex. (You lend them to margin traders shorting them.)\nSo at time of writing (20 May 2018) $720 million are being lent out at Daily 0.065% / 26% annualised, and 50,000 Bitcoin with value of $415 million at 0.01% Daily / 3.6% annualised.\nLending at BitMEX Rates for Funding at BitMEX are often the highest in the crypto space. It is not so straightforward as lending at Poloniex and Bitfinex.\nWhen net sentiment in the XBTUSD market is bullish, you earn funding income by shorting the XBTUSD Swap contract. (Shorting Bitcoin essentially means you are holding a USD position.) This was the case for most of 2017.\nWhen net sentiment in the XBTUSD market is bearish, you earn funding by going Long the XBTUSD Swap. Ths has applied to most of 2018.\nA few things to note when the objective is purely to maximise funding income:\nFunding fees and rebates apply to the XBTUSD Swap contract only. There is no Funding of the Bitcoin Futures contracts.\nUse small Leverage to avoid getting Liquidated.\nYou must ensure your overall BitMEX portfolio (BTC in Wallet, BTC exposed in positions) is delta-neutral, i.e. unaffected by moves in XBTUSD. You need to use the Bitcoin Futures contract to hedge your XBTUSD Swap position to achieve this.\nHow to find out if you should go Long or Short to get the Funding?\nThe Funding Rate for the current 8-hour Session is displayed in the Contract Details box bottom-left.\nPositive Funding Rate means Longs pay Shorts.\nHover over the box to see Predicted Funding Rate for next Session.\nThe Funding History page shows the history.\nInterest is paid every 8 hour period, so 3 times a day. At 4am UTC then at midday UTC and then at 8PM UTC.\nWhen you are shorting Bitcoin your position (Unrealised PNL) will change according to price of Bitcoin, until you close your short, at which point you will turn it into a Realised PNL. But your interest payments will be realised (Realised PNL) every 8 hours and come into your account.\nWhe you are comfortable with shorting with 1x leverage, you can try 2x. Shorting on 2x allows you to keep some of your Bitcoin in cold storage, so you are exposed to less counterparty risk to BitMEX. Watch the market and add extra margin if the price gets near to your Liquidation price to avoid Liquidation.\nMore detail on this trade in this essay: XBTUSD The Philosopher’s Stone and Earning Interest Income on XBTUSD with Minimised Risk .\nCheck the Market for Lending You can keep an eye on daily and annual rates at CryptoLend and at CoinLend .\nRates (Daily) at 19 May 2018.\nRates (Annual compounded) at 19 May 2018.\nBitMEX often offers the best BTC Lending rates in the crypto space.

HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group's investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd. HandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through \"contactless\" means once users' mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality). HandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: \"Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender's mobile device close to the recipient's device. That's why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.\" HandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using \"handle\" names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip. HandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy \"contactless\" payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash. HandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: \"In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.\" nChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: \"For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\" nChain's deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes: Increasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality. The BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low. The upgrade validates HandCash's vision in creating its wallet product for Bitcoin Cash.

in HandCash Wallet for Bitcoin Cash News provided by 14:13 ET Share this article\nLONDON , May 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- nChain Group, the leading blockchain research and development group, has closed deal terms to acquire a majority stake in HandCash. HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group's investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd.\nHandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through \"contactless\" means once users' mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality).\nHandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: \"Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender's mobile device close to the recipient's device. That's why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.\"\nHandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using \"handle\" names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip.\nHandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy \"contactless\" payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nHandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: \"In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.\"\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: \"For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\"\nnChain's deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes: Increasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality.\nThe BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low.

HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group's investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd. HandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through \"contactless\" means once users' mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality). HandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: \"Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender's mobile device close to the recipient's device. That's why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.\" HandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using \"handle\" names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip. HandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy \"contactless\" payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash. HandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: \"In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.\" nChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: \"For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\" nChain's deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes: Increasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality. The BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low. The upgrade validates HandCash's vision in creating its wallet product for Bitcoin Cash.

As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future.\nSauter and McGill are also participating lawyers in the Digital Currency & Ledger Defense Coalition (DCLDC), a coalition of lawyers and academics whose collaborated effort focuses on understanding the regulatory and legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to protect individual constitutional rights and civil liberties in connection with regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny.\nFor a large financial institution such as ICE or Goldman Sachs, figuring out how to develop a cryptocurrency trading platform is a potentially complicated analysis that begins with the question of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. If a cryptocurrency is deemed a security by the Howey test , “there are a lot more regulatory requirements,” according to McGill.\nWhile many people agree, including Peter Van Valkenburgh , director of research at the Coin Center, that the Howey test can act as the ultimate clarifier of which cryptocurrency is a security and which is not; the distinction is also important for another reason. Ultimately, the Howey test gives guidance on which regulatory agency polices which cryptocurrency. At this point, securities fall under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. Non-security cryptocurrencies — or commodities until proven otherwise — are in the realm of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While this is obvious to anyone who can remember each agency’s full name, the distinction is also important because each agency has taken a different approach to policing cryptocurrency.\nThe SEC has gone after what McGill called “ low-hanging fruit .” These are the “pump-and-dump” ICOs that are scams or otherwise illegitimate in their offerings to investors. And, at least with ICOs, both agencies appeared to be on the same page in January 2018. More recently, the SEC has created a fake ICO . The token, aptly named HoweyCoin, is being used as a way to demonstrate potential signs of fraud in ICOs to cryptocurrency investors.\nOutside of the SEC’s scam scrubbing, Sauter and McGill have also seen regulator behavior that is not exactly encouraging for private sector participants:\n“The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) say they want to have an active dialogue with industry participants to understand the latest trends and developments. Unfortunately, we see a lot of regulators initiating those conversations with industry players by way of subpoena. Whenever you receive a subpoena from a regulator, you have to be concerned that it could be a lead-in to an enforcement action. This dynamic doesn’t exactly promote a free and healthy exchange of ideas,” said McGill. CFTC: The Prevailing Bitcoin Regulator?\nIn late April, SEC Chairman Clayton said bitcoin is not a security. According to both McGill and Sauter, because bitcoin will not likely be classified as a security, larger financial institutions like CME, CBOE, Goldman Sachs and now ICE are able to move forward with giving their clients exposure.\nNot being a security also means that the CFTC is the federal agency that most often acts as a watchdog over bitcoin transactions. But it is also not the only one. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has become involved in some bitcoin futures trading in pursuit of acts of perjury and obstruction of justice .\nEven if it is the prevailing regulator, how the CFTC will handle bad actors and fraud in bitcoin transactions is still up for debate. In the last year, there have been more aggressive actions such as CFTC v. McDonnell (CabbageTech) and, outside of cryptocurrencies, the CFTC’s prerogative to cut down on fraud and market manipulation ( Monex ). This could be evidence that there will likely be a crackdown on certain types of short-term trading behavior.\n“An underlying concern of the CFTC is that there are a number of people who can fairly easily impact prices with their trading. It makes it very difficult to regulate markets,” said Sauter, “but innovation is happening in futures and derivatives markets.”\nSpeaking toward how Bitcoin law will develop in the U.S., Sauter stated that industry cases which reach the court of appeals will be the ones that will ultimately shape U.S. regulation by either correcting case decision errors or clarifying and interpreting the law itself. Contract Swaps Aren’t New or Unregulated\nIf reports that ICE is considering using a model of trading bitcoin with swap contracts, this type of trading would remain under the regulatory realm of the CFTC. Furthermore, it would also decrease transaction speed.\nSwaps are a type of derivative contract where two parties trade based on a notional principal amount. Generally, one of these amounts is fixed while the other is variable, commonly based on an interest rate, floating currency exchange rate or index price. Swaps do not normally trade on exchanges but instead are over-the-counter contracts between different organizations. Sauter and McGill suggested that ICE would likely use an interest rate swap, though they are most likely still figuring out what they will pin bitcoin prices to.\n“Using the swap mechanism allows ICE to position themselves squarely under CFTC regulations, but getting that regulatory certainty looks like it will come at the cost of speed,” said McGill. “One of the ideas behind bitcoin and other digital currencies that made them so attractive as a concept was the idea that market participants could securely transact with one another almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. But, if you have to create a swap product with a one-day settlement period to get regulatory clarity, then you lose a lot of what made digital currencies attractive in the first place.”\n“Bitcoin swaps aren’t entirely novel, either,” pointed out Sauter.\nTeraExchange began offering Bitcoin-based swaps in 2014. And, since launching its derivatives swap option in October 2017 after CFTC approval, LedgerX is reported to have increased their trading volume sevenfold.\nSauter stated that one reason why regulators have not moved more quickly to establish clear law around Bitcoin is that there still remains debate and uncertainty about regulators, the CFTC in particular, to police the markets.\n“One way regulators and institutional players are dealing with this is to move trading to regulated derivatives markets, be it swaps, futures or options,” said Sauter. “When that happens, the CFTC has a much more direct line of access to the markets and market participants. That’s part of the reason why we’re seeing such innovation happening in the derivatives markets.”\nAnother reason Sauter proposes for the interest in Bitcoin derivatives is that they are a much easier route by which big financial institution players can get involved. “Institutional investors often have strict requirements concerning the types of markets and products they can trade, and they tend to like the idea of trading in markets that they know are being policed and that offer remedies in the event problems arise.” How Decentralized Proprietary Trading Could Be Affected\nThe implications of the rise in bitcoin-based swap contracts also means that the instantaneous transaction, so highly placed in the early value of bitcoin, might be a thing of the past for more mainstream investors to gain less-risky exposure. However, as McGill pointed out, “A lot of that early speed and eliminating transaction fees comes at the cost of added risk.”\nIt can be assumed that any cryptocurrency trader that is familiar with Mt. Gox is well aware of the risks associated with trading on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. Still, for some, the risks are worth it.\n“Some of this will just be decided by the market,” said Sauter. “Plenty of investors are weighing the risk of maybe not getting their money back when they need to unwind a trade. Traders who don’t want to deal with this will opt-into these trading platforms run by accredited institutional investors.”\n“There’s clearly more risk in operating on less regulated and decentralized exchanges,” said McGill. “There may well be more lucrative opportunities as well, but there are all sorts of risks — including insider fraud — that a lot of traders want to avoid.”\nBy this estimation, bitcoin futures have brought the attention of regulators and that will inevitably alter the current space, whether making it more regulated or diversified remains to be seen.\n“CME bitcoin futures acted as the canary in the coal mine. From a regulatory perspective, it will be interesting to see if some of the fast-and-loose trading techniques that were being deployed on the nascent cryptocurrency exchanges carry over to the more mature and tightly regulated markets operated by CME and ICE,” said McGill. “Certainly, you’re going to get more players in the mix, and that alone will probably translate into more enforcement activity by CME and government regulators.”\nWeighing the risks of unregulated and decentralized exchanges draws back to the fundamental conflict that has been revolving around the cryptocurrency space since the Bitcoin white paper was first issued.\nWill bitcoin remain truly decentralized or will the desire to hedge against risk lead the majority of traders to accredited and regulated institutions? For many who are invested in bitcoin, not just for profit, but also ideological reasons, the answer appears obvious. Yet whether these Bitcoiners are early adopters of a movement or no more than fringe factions will be decided by the market. It would appear that less regulated and decentralized exchanges still need to develop strategies to match the greater security legacy financial institutions are championing to bring to cryptocurrency.\n“From a regulatory point of view, the idea of decentralized exchanges pose some interesting jurisdictional questions,” said McGill. “Ultimately, U.S. regulators tend to be less concerned about physical location and more focused on whether the activity interacts with and impacts U.S. commerce. I don’t think the notion of decentralizing an exchange will translate to immunity from regulators, but it has the potential to create a lot of headaches for regulators.”\nAnother factor in ICE and other legacy institutions hopping into bitcoin trading is an increase in the space’s technological innovation brought by increased competition.\n“Now you’re going to have the most sophisticated trading companies in the world trading in these products at an algorithmic level, which will substantially increase the volume of trading activity,” said McGill.\n“You’re going to get more players in the mix and probably many of those will have less regulatory experience and perhaps as a result more enforcement cases,” said Sauter. On New Competition and Shorting\nThough the involvement for big U.S.-based financial players will certainly affect the market, established cryptocurrency exchanges are optimistic about the future.\nTendai Musakwa, director of marketing at the Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange, BTCC, believes that exchanges like BTCC “will remain the go-to cryptocurrency market for retail clients for the foreseeable future.”\n“We specifically designed our USD exchange to be accessible, drawing on our seven years’ experience operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange to create an effortless crypto trading experience. “\nMusakwa also pointed out that many legacy financial exchanges will have “high barriers of entry and inaccessible or confusing user interfaces.” Citing “real-person 24/7 customer support and deposit options such as credit cards,” he believes that cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to create value that institutional exchanges are unable to offer. “In addition, legacy fiat exchanges are geographically bound, while exchanges like BTCC offer customers worldwide easy access to BTC/USD trading.”\nAdded to this, Sauter attested that there are still many more regulatory hurdles for institutional exchanges — many of which have not yet been created. For instance, “even if an exchange is authorized, investment companies and broker dealers and issuers of ICOs must become accredited before they can move forward.”\nThe ICE has also indicated that plans for such a platform could dissolve at anytime based on the unregulated changes in cryptocurrency market. Another institutional player, CEO of Nasdaq Adena Friedman told CNBC that Nasdaq would be open for bitcoin trading when “people are ready for a more regulated market.”\n“It’s going to be a more balanced marketplace going forward,” stated McGill. “It would be a shame that, in the process, a lot of what has drawn people into cryptocurrency could be lost in the shuffle due to new regulation.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coincenter.org/link/the-sec-and-cftc-are-taking-the-right-approach-to-ico-scams", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/digital-currency-derivatives-exchanges-prepare-for-regulation-after-cftc-bitcoin-ruling-1443197199/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/", "https://www.howeycoins.com/index.html#about", "https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7675-18", "https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alert-public-companies-making-ico-related", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-02-07/coin-center-s-van-valkenburgh-on-regulating-cryptocurrencies-video", "https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/operator-bitcoin-investment-platform-charged-perjury-and-obstruction-justice", "http://www.dcldc.org/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/nyt-report-parent-company-nyse-planning-bitcoin-exchange/", "https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7609-17", "https://exchange.btcc.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/federal-government-approves-regulation-request-ledgerx/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kobre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben sauter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave mcgill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sauter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcgill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital currency & ledger defense coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T23:49:51.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19b2c13120b13f7747bb9847e3b00681e2ec3249", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA6E5nNZAaUZzQPBkw_awCufTNjm7uxj1RWpG2pKrxY1zvjk9BfN2CpS8pf0miHABdiYVWAEX_4mjtNfQsrgJ3473H2hPFm2Kgc-", "site_full": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Magazine", "title": "The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation", "title_full": "The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation", "published": "2018-05-21T21:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/ICE_trading.max-800x800.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 78582, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19b2c13120b13f7747bb9847e3b00681e2ec3249", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA6E5nNZAaUZzQPBkw_awCufTNjm7uxj1RWpG2pKrxY1zvjk9BfN2CpS8pf0miHABdiYVWAEX_4mjtNfQsrgJ3473H2hPFm2Kgc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Hollerith", "published": "2018-05-21T21:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation", "text": "05.21.18 2:08 PM The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation\nAs reported earlier by The New York Times (NYT) and Bitcoin Magazine , Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is developing an online trading platform that would allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly.

It makes it very difficult to regulate markets,” said Sauter, “but innovation is happening in futures and derivatives markets.”\nSpeaking toward how Bitcoin law will develop in the U.S., Sauter stated that industry cases which reach the court of appeals will be the ones that will ultimately shape U.S. regulation by either correcting case decision errors or clarifying and interpreting the law itself. Contract Swaps Aren’t New or Unregulated\nIf reports that ICE is considering using a model of trading bitcoin with swap contracts, this type of trading would remain under the regulatory realm of the CFTC. Furthermore, it would also decrease transaction speed.\nSwaps are a type of derivative contract where two parties trade based on a notional principal amount. Generally, one of these amounts is fixed while the other is variable, commonly based on an interest rate, floating currency exchange rate or index price. Swaps do not normally trade on exchanges but instead are over-the-counter contracts between different organizations. Sauter and McGill suggested that ICE would likely use an interest rate swap, though they are most likely still figuring out what they will pin bitcoin prices to.\n\"Using the swap mechanism allows ICE to position themselves squarely under CFTC regulations, but getting that regulatory certainty looks like it will come at the cost of speed,” said McGill. “One of the ideas behind bitcoin and other digital currencies that made them so attractive as a concept was the idea that market participants could securely transact with one another almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. But, if you have to create a swap product with a one-day settlement period to get regulatory clarity, then you lose a lot of what made digital currencies attractive in the first place.\"\n“Bitcoin swaps aren’t entirely novel, either,” pointed out Sauter.\nTeraExchange began offering Bitcoin-based swaps in 2014. And, since launching its derivatives swap option in October 2017 after CFTC approval, LedgerX is reported to have increased their trading volume sevenfold.\nSauter stated that one reason why regulators have not moved more quickly to establish clear law around Bitcoin is that there still remains debate and uncertainty about regulators, the CFTC in particular, to police the markets.\n“One way regulators and institutional players are dealing with this is to move trading to regulated derivatives markets, be it swaps, futures or options,” said Sauter. “When that happens, the CFTC has a much more direct line of access to the markets and market participants. That's part of the reason why we're seeing such innovation happening in the derivatives markets.”\nAnother reason Sauter proposes for the interest in Bitcoin derivatives is that they are a much easier route by which big financial institution players can get involved. “Institutional investors often have strict requirements concerning the types of markets and products they can trade, and they tend to like the idea of trading in markets that they know are being policed and that offer remedies in the event problems arise.” How Decentralized Proprietary Trading Could Be Affected\nThe implications of the rise in bitcoin-based swap contracts also means that the instantaneous transaction, so highly placed in the early value of bitcoin, might be a thing of the past for more mainstream investors to gain less-risky exposure. However, as McGill pointed out, “A lot of that early speed and eliminating transaction fees comes at the cost of added risk.”\nIt can be assumed that any cryptocurrency trader that is familiar with Mt. Gox is well aware of the risks associated with trading on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. Still, for some, the risks are worth it.\n“Some of this will just be decided by the market,” said Sauter. “Plenty of investors are weighing the risk of maybe not getting their money back when they need to unwind a trade. Traders who don’t want to deal with this will opt-into these trading platforms run by accredited institutional investors.”\n\"There's clearly more risk in operating on less regulated and decentralized exchanges,” said McGill. “There may well be more lucrative opportunities as well, but there are all sorts of risks — including insider fraud — that a lot of traders want to avoid.”\nBy this estimation, bitcoin futures have brought the attention of regulators and that will inevitably alter the current space, whether making it more regulated or diversified remains to be seen.\n\"CME bitcoin futures acted as the canary in the coal mine. From a regulatory perspective, it will be interesting to see if some of the fast-and-loose trading techniques that were being deployed on the nascent cryptocurrency exchanges carry over to the more mature and tightly regulated markets operated by CME and ICE,” said McGill. “Certainly, you're going to get more players in the mix, and that alone will probably translate into more enforcement activity by CME and government regulators.\"\nWeighing the risks of unregulated and decentralized exchanges draws back to the fundamental conflict that has been revolving around the cryptocurrency space since the Bitcoin white paper was first issued.\nWill bitcoin remain truly decentralized or will the desire to hedge against risk lead the majority of traders to accredited and regulated institutions? For many who are invested in bitcoin, not just for profit, but also ideological reasons, the answer appears obvious. Yet whether these Bitcoiners are early adopters of a movement or no more than fringe factions will be decided by the market. It would appear that less regulated and decentralized exchanges still need to develop strategies to match the greater security legacy financial institutions are championing to bring to cryptocurrency.\n\"From a regulatory point of view, the idea of decentralized exchanges pose some interesting jurisdictional questions,” said McGill. “Ultimately, U.S. regulators tend to be less concerned about physical location and more focused on whether the activity interacts with and impacts U.S. commerce. I don't think the notion of decentralizing an exchange will translate to immunity from regulators, but it has the potential to create a lot of headaches for regulators.\"\nAnother factor in ICE and other legacy institutions hopping into bitcoin trading is an increase in the space’s technological innovation brought by increased competition.\n\"Now you're going to have the most sophisticated trading companies in the world trading in these products at an algorithmic level, which will substantially increase the volume of trading activity,\" said McGill.\n“You’re going to get more players in the mix and probably many of those will have less regulatory experience and perhaps as a result more enforcement cases,” said Sauter. On New Competition and Shorting\nThough the involvement for big U.S.-based financial players will certainly affect the market, established cryptocurrency exchanges are optimistic about the future.\nTendai Musakwa, director of marketing at the Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange, BTCC, believes that exchanges like BTCC “will remain the go-to cryptocurrency market for retail clients for the foreseeable future.”\n“We specifically designed our USD exchange to be accessible, drawing on our seven years’ experience operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange to create an effortless crypto trading experience. “\nMusakwa also pointed out that many legacy financial exchanges will have “high barriers of entry and inaccessible or confusing user interfaces.” Citing “real-person 24/7 customer support and deposit options such as credit cards,” he believes that cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to create value that institutional exchanges are unable to offer. “In addition, legacy fiat exchanges are geographically bound, while exchanges like BTCC offer customers worldwide easy access to BTC/USD trading.”\nAdded to this, Sauter attested that there are still many more regulatory hurdles for institutional exchanges — many of which have not yet been created. For instance, “even if an exchange is authorized, investment companies and broker dealers and issuers of ICOs must become accredited before they can move forward.”\nThe ICE has also indicated that plans for such a platform could dissolve at anytime based on the unregulated changes in cryptocurrency market. Another institutional player, CEO of Nasdaq Adena Friedman told CNBC that Nasdaq would be open for bitcoin trading when “people are ready for a more regulated market.”\n“It’s going to be a more balanced marketplace going forward,” stated McGill. “It would be a shame that, in the process, a lot of what has drawn people into cryptocurrency could be lost in the shuffle due to new regulation.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coincenter.org/link/the-sec-and-cftc-are-taking-the-right-approach-to-ico-scams", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp", "https://www.howeycoins.com/index.html#about", "https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7675-18", "https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alert-public-companies-making-ico-related", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-02-07/coin-center-s-van-valkenburgh-on-regulating-cryptocurrencies-video", "https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/operator-bitcoin-investment-platform-charged-perjury-and-obstruction-justice", "http://www.dcldc.org/", "https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7609-17", "https://exchange.btcc.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kobre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben sauter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave mcgill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sauter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcgill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital currency & ledger defense coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T21:25:15.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "711c6cc917da2c48dc108d9094ff1ea6623265f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhCSCNrrRRaH2z06LDyjdIAI-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-21T21:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "711c6cc917da2c48dc108d9094ff1ea6623265f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhCSCNrrRRaH2z06LDyjdIAI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T21:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 21, 2018 NEWS The Bitcoin Cash Route to Success Irish Tech News But one cryptocurrency that has been persistent during this market crisis is Bitcoin Cash.

Think about it, if it was easy to recover lost bitcoin \"passwords\", then that would be a huge flaw that a lot of hackers can exploit. Using bitcoin and it's advantages also comes with risks, and this is one of them. It's your money anyway, why would you be so careless with your password.\nI absolutely agree with this. The point is why even own a password and store it carefully if it can be retrieved in a 'jiffy'. This will certainly be a compromise to the originality and purpose of the blockchain advantage.
