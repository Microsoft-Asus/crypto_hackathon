Now that we have done that. If we bteak down below the bottom of the candle , I think we go to $8,000, possibly $6,800, and maybe even $6,000. It certainly looks as if we are rolling over now. The US dollar fell in the forex market. So, you can't blame this on dollar strength anymore.\nBitcoin/JPY — Bitcoin fell against the yen as well, I think a breakdown below this daily candle sends this market down to 900,000 possibly 800,000, and then 700,000. I am not interested in buying until we get above this area and then maybe we reach 1.1, and the 1.25 million yen level.\n© Prabhu for Forex Videos , 2018. | Permalink | No comment | Add to del.icio.us\nPost tags: Bitcoin , Cryptocurrency , technical analysis\nFeed enhanced by Better Feed from Ozh ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prabhu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ozh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forex videos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T13:46:56.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "146e23f62df747999bf4cc8dc184fe11d9ec1124", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXGAc79l1qiDYuPDDnwxpRRGT7qqnLcyju_ez.Mu.mkBe.vZz0Rgw4fYGQH59zuuPnXpJ3DxC5Lwj84mk_cTIzwaFR5QXpDBAhBCZlpVAIGsQfijcKF0sp", "site_full": "www.listocks.com", "site": "listocks.com", "site_section": "http://www.listocks.com/feed", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Top Stocks To Buy For 2018", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Close to Flat as Broader Crypto Market Mixed", "title_full": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Close to Flat as Broader Crypto Market Mixed", "published": "2018-05-14T13:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "146e23f62df747999bf4cc8dc184fe11d9ec1124", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXGAc79l1qiDYuPDDnwxpRRGT7qqnLcyju_ez.Mu.mkBe.vZz0Rgw4fYGQH59zuuPnXpJ3DxC5Lwj84mk_cTIzwaFR5QXpDBAhBCZlpVAIGsQfijcKF0sp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-14T13:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Close to Flat as Broader Crypto Market Mixed", "text": "Comparing HTG Molecular Diagnostics (HTGM) and Its Competitors 2018-05-14 11:39:38\nHTG Molecular Diagnostics (NASDAQ: HTGM) is one of 24 public companies in the “Analytical instruments” industry, but how does it weigh in compared to its peers?

As the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market value traded in a narrow band, many of the largest market cap digital assets traded into the red.\nHere’s what you need to know in cryptocurrency for Thursday, May 10.\nBuffett Disciple Calls Out the Oracle of Omaha\nChamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who has called himself a Warren Buffett “disciple,” has come out against Buffett’s pessimistic views on cryptocurrencies. Palihapitiya told CNBC that, despite his respect for the Oracle of Omaha, he thinks Buffett missed the mark on cryptocurrencies. According to Palihapitiya, “Something like bitcoin is really important because it is not correlated to the rest of the market.” Palihapitiya continued on Buffett, adding that, “Not everybody is right all the time,” and noting that bitcoin is outside Buffett’s “circle of competence.” Buffett most recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared,” and has before likened it to a gamble instead of an investment.\nCrypto Could ‘Fuel a New Internet’\nAlexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit, said bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have the power to “fuel a potential new internet,” even with their volatile trading nature. Ohanian, who made the comments as a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, posed the notion of crypto as a “store of value not backed by a single country.” The founder said the real utility in something like bitcoin is extending financial inclusion to the underserved, primarily in undeveloped countries. “For so many people in the world to have that security of knowing what’s yours is yours – because [cryptocurrency] is now digital, it can be transferred with you wherever you are going – is actually pretty empowering,” Ohanian said.\nKODAKCoin to Launch This Month\nAfter a number of delays, Eastman Kodak Co. (KODK) announced that its KODAKCoin will begin fundraising later this month. The offering of KODAKCoin, which will come in the form of a Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs) sale, will start May 21 for a limited number of accredited investors. Kodak is seeking to raise $50 million in the fundraising, which will be carried out by WENN Digital. Kodak first announced the coin and its planned offering in January. “Our goal with this offering is utmost security and transparency, working to bring digital tokens to investors by adhering to industry best practices and in a manner that we hope instils public confidence in the crypto space,” said WENN, according to Coindesk.\nRobinhood to Expand Crypto\nMobile stock trading app Robinhood announced that it has completed a $363 million series D funding round that will allow the platform to expand its current cryptocurrency trading capabilities nationwide by the end of 2018. This funding round values the company at $5.6 billion and was led by DST Global with Iconiq, Capital G, Sequoia Capital and KPCB. Robinhood’s cryptocurrency trading is currently available in 10 states in the U.S., but the company said this funding will allow it to expand to the other 40 in the country as soon as it receives requisite licensing. The funds from this most recent series will go toward product expansion, infrastructure and operations and expanding the team, Robinhood added. This entry was posted in Best Stocks on by admin .

The downward targets are set at the price of $8.172 and at the price of $7.986.\nSupport/Resistance", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:30:35.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3eabb48306e870c532f50217023dbf99e4173ecc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYZG7J_puPbWLSJczLENIiM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "title_full": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-14T13:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3eabb48306e870c532f50217023dbf99e4173ecc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYZG7J_puPbWLSJczLENIiM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jcumins", "published": "2018-05-14T13:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "text": "very sorry for those who this situation happened. they missed a huge chance to get rich and become rich cryptocurrencies", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T12:10:33.046+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "311a27275f84a186b9b1aeb8c377bad429ad885e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTfWUxJ2K2KH9X1SpU8XK.Iwj97fQn79VN4gfls89ph7rbqfwnuWyTMnU9iSH2f2XGMh6eAjtJyZ5hFSnd5SqukXeE2uhW9aXFla_QxqOr3liqykmjWMyG.Zw1JIOhryXAIj8JEt4Fw5h05H5sLjnBQ.023RnTb2GFhq6ULhgynThrc0cAQKD5Y9Yg7wnjwyXcu41h9TRYzmnN54EJqqNHVynmlHcXWnN_VFw3gU4_iPVIKU9WevCWfIKBzaRj6QFo-", "site_full": "www.openpr.com", "site": "openpr.com", "site_section": "http://openpr.com/rss.php?cat=3", "site_categories": ["marketing", "financial_news", "finance", "business"], "section_title": "openPR.com - New Public Relations: Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance", "title": "Digital Currency: Market to Witness Comprehensive Growth by Top Global Leader-Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Factom, MaidSafeCoin, Peercoin", "title_full": "Digital Currency: Market to Witness Comprehensive Growth by Top Global Leader-Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Factom, MaidSafeCoin, Peercoin", "published": "2018-05-14T13:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 43086, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "311a27275f84a186b9b1aeb8c377bad429ad885e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTfWUxJ2K2KH9X1SpU8XK.Iwj97fQn79VN4gfls89ph7rbqfwnuWyTMnU9iSH2f2XGMh6eAjtJyZ5hFSnd5SqukXeE2uhW9aXFla_QxqOr3liqykmjWMyG.Zw1JIOhryXAIj8JEt4Fw5h05H5sLjnBQ.023RnTb2GFhq6ULhgynThrc0cAQKD5Y9Yg7wnjwyXcu41h9TRYzmnN54EJqqNHVynmlHcXWnN_VFw3gU4_iPVIKU9WevCWfIKBzaRj6QFo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "QY Research Groups", "published": "2018-05-14T13:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Digital Currency: Market to Witness Comprehensive Growth by Top Global Leader-Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Factom, MaidSafeCoin, Peercoin", "text": "· Southeast Asia· IndiaThe report provides a detailed overview of the industry including both qualitative and quantitative information.

The company has so far allowed lending and borrowing of loans in Bitcoin.\nThe company is now using Bitcoin to facilitate international transfer of fiat loans as well, Reuters reports .\nThe loaned amount will be transferred to the borrower using the Bitcoin’s blockchain, only to be converted back to their country’s currency as soon as the transaction is processed.\nUsing Bitcoin to transfer the loans will purportedly make the transfer of loan quicker and cheaper in comparison to the existing transfer means.\nCurrently, most of the world’s banking institutions rely on the SWIFT network to facilitate international transactions, but that comes with several shortcomings.\nUsers end up paying several fees for each transaction they make through the network. These include transaction fees levied by the correspondent and recipient banks, and currency exchange rates charged by the banks.\nIt is also worth noting that SWIFT doesn’t actually enable the transfer of money, but only allows secure communication about payment orders between the banks.\nAt the time of its launch, SWIFT had revolutionized international transactions with its Bank Identified Codes (BICs), now popularly called ‘SWIFT codes’, which made transactions a lot securer and faster.\nWith blockchain technology, there’s a promise to make this process further efficient.\nIn fact, the Ripple Transaction Protocol associated with the world’s third largest cryptocurrency Ripple , was developed as a blockchain-based alternative to SWIFT — however researchers have cast doubts on the long-term efficacy of its protocol.\nTransactions with cryptocurrencies can be made in a manner of seconds without huge transaction fees involved. There’s only one intermediary that needs to be paid, which are the miners confirming the transaction.\nBitbond’s development of a marketplace that relies on Bitcoin to transfer loans in fiat is interesting, but even Bitcoin currently suffers from high transaction fees and longer time span for processing the transactions.\nThe successful implementation of Lightening Network can change this, or other cryptocurrencies can be explored as a means for facilitating the transactions.

The bitcoin was supposed to be used as currency to buy and sell things the same way we do with our dollar.\nThe first use of BTC was done when the guy bought pizza for 10K BTC . That was the thing which should have been continued today also. No matter what how much you pay for pizza in those early days, it could have been few satoshi's today but it could have worked just fine.\nThe status of the BTC has now turned to commodity. The commodity which is being traded globally for the own profit and to run the different industries. This is getting ridiculous day by day as replica of it coming out of the forks.\nThis Should have been the Future:\nBitcoin is ebbing used as currency in 2009-2010. Government see that its popularity is growing day by day and it could be of could use in the financial sectors, lets implement the blockchain in our banks!\nBitcoin earns the legal status\nBitcoin gets widespread across the globe and rest of the country follow the same and thus the nationwide legal status turns into the global legal tender!\nPeople start using the BTC for trading daily life needs with help of bitcoin.\nThere are no creation of million BTC addresses daily but the only one unique address per head per bank account!\nNo exchangers are being created but only handy smart phone apps and PC wallets to store the coins linked with bank chain.\nBitcoin smoothly shifts in the market capitalism and keeps going upwards slowly but steadily. The value rises and it gets cheaper to use for daily needs.\nGlobal financial advisor think about minted coins to be formed physically with unique barcodes printed on them.\nFirst appearance of the BTC in the global market!\nYes, that seems to me perfect.

Bitcoin cash prices also fell to around US$1,383, a drop of about 16% over the past seven days.\nBch chart\nBit cash remains stable, with the smallest decline being the second of the 15 largest cryptocurrencies. The rest of the cryptocurrencies have fallen by 20% or more (excluding BTC and ETH). As market prices rebounded, the market began to pick up, and some people predict that BCH will soon become one of the top three cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin cash is expected to conduct a second network upgrade on May 15th. This upgrade will have a significant impact on the value of BCH. This upgrade has two key points. The first point is that the size of the block is increased to 32MB, which will allow BCH to have a faster transaction speed and reduce transaction costs. The second point is the addition of OP_Codes, which will add smart contract and tokenization capabilities to the bitcoin cash blockchain.\nSmart contract capabilities have always been the highlight of Ethereum. Through it, thousands of blockchain items, additional cryptocurrencies and initial coin products start to start. The implementation of smart contracts will place BCH and ETH at the same level. Jimmy Nguyen, CEO of nChain Group, stated: “Restoring certain OP_Codes using the bitcoin scripting language will bring advanced technical capabilities to the Bitcoin cash network. In calculations, the operation code is an automatic operation that indicates what operations must be performed. The language section.Restored OP_Codes will enable tagging and smart contracts to be executed on the BCH blockchain.With future upgrades to the bitcoin cash network, more advanced features will become possible.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://citicoins.com/bitcoin-cash"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T15:21:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3730b579690cdf707da76dec080a118484ffa3d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46C3hsjJM201efTSKE1UzTPw--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=11", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Otros Lenguajes de Programacion - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!", "title_full": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program! - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-14T13:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3730b579690cdf707da76dec080a118484ffa3d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46C3hsjJM201efTSKE1UzTPw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-14T13:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!", "text": " software complex for SEO/SMM\nBitcoin was crashed with XEvil program! , How to earn money with captchas bypass: it's very easy! , XEvil 4.0 + BitcoinMarkets = PROFIT! , XEvil 4.0 + any SEO/SMM software = PROFIT!\n can break more\nI'm shocked!

Subsequent reports in the media state that South Korea’s financial regulators, including the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), have launched an investigation into potential liquidity issues at Upbit.\nAccording to Business Korea , prosecutors suspect that the company sold more cryptocurrencies than the amount it had reported. The FSS has previously warned that such a practice will be considered illegal for crypto exchanges.\nThe publication also said that the prosecutors had secured computer hard disks and accounting books of the company and planned to investigate whether Lee Suk-woo, representative of the company behind Upbit, was involved in the matter.\nThe cryptocurrency market experienced a sharp sell-off after the Friday news, wiping out tens of billions of dollars in market capitalisation . Bitcoin hit $8,223.50, on Saturday, its lowest price level since April 20.

The government has also revised the country's tax code to add crypto taxation. Sellers of digital tokens will face a fine or even jail time if they fail to register with the regulator within 90 days. Technical picture on Bitcoin looks bearish.\nTrading recommendations:\nAccording to the H1 time - frame, I found that price broke bearish flag in the background, which is a sign that sellers are in control. I also found that MACD oscillator started to turn bearish, which is another sign of weakness. My advice is to watch for potential selling opportunities.

It’s like a distributed database, that millions of computers (often called nodes) around the world have access to and are constantly updating.\nAll data put into the blockchain must be verified and cannot be corrupted or deleted.\nMarcus is leading a team of around 11 employees working on blockchain at the social network. A representative at the company has said the team will be exploring many different applications.\nRumours about a Facebook-branded virtual currency have been swirling for a while. Earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would be studying cryptocurrencies and decentralising technologies like blockchain as part of his plans to improve Facebook.\nAt the time, he said : “There are important counter-trends to this – like encryption and cryptocurrency – that take power from centralised systems and put it back into people’s hands.\n“I’m interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.”\nAnd Facebook using cryptocurrency for payments makes sense. There are billions of people around the world that use the social media both for work and in their free-time. Report: Google is working on its own blockchain technology\nFacebook has made a lot of its money from advertising; selling ads for products to these two billion users. The company would stand to gain if it allowed people to directly make payments for these products, using its own infrastructure based on the blockchain.\nBefore then, the company has a lot of work to do. The sources told Cheddar that it's likely Facebook will need to make acquisitions in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space in order to develop its own virtual currency.\nAnd, it’s going to take a while. Marcus told CNBC earlier this year that as payments using cryptocurrency are expensive and slow at the moment, a lot of issues need to be fixed first before Facebook will do anything.\nWith companies like Google moving further into the blockchain space, Facebook needs to get a move on.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/zuck?lst=583299461%3A4%3A1526286940", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/why-facebook-is-not-rushing-into-crypto-according-to-david-marcus.html", "https://cheddar.com/videos/facebook-plans-to-create-its-own-cryptocurrency"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marcus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david marcus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "evening standard facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T16:39:03.064+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "826d97f7f9a0245e590c3da6a0cab3ca9cabc000", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZKkupA6FvaKMfcg4ZiOVM4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin Price To $36K in 2019 - Expert Research", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price To $36K in 2019 - Expert Research", "published": "2018-05-14T13:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.063, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "826d97f7f9a0245e590c3da6a0cab3ca9cabc000", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZKkupA6FvaKMfcg4ZiOVM4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pursuer", "published": "2018-05-14T13:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price To $36K in 2019 - Expert Research", "text": "unfortunately there are so many of these \"experts\" with their speculations about bitcoin these days on both sides and both group are usually making guesses about things they do not understand. some say it will fall because it is in a bear market and it is a bubble and some others like this are saying it will rise to a big amount just because it was rising and the adoption is increasing.\nin the end I do not think we will see the same huge rise this year but we will have a rise because the correction has been over for some time now and people have been accumulating bitcoin ever since.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T09:57:26.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0326d96bbd8b1fee484656e24b90310dd9a26449", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRGIhDwb2oP349p92xynzoh4YoZrlHWFSzIjwl7DeEkWASmg6cxM1DyV20YN7M_mFaFxnbAZhyobYnD63Q4V2Mw.Tde2_8FRyeYtrYHvJXwh5NhOZGq8VTNkY09AuwKocX98jYyu6ziMzsmBXSXXlMQ", "site_full": "www.sgtreport.com", "site": "sgtreport.com", "site_section": "http://sgtreport.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "SGT Report", "title": "German Bank Allows Users To Transfer Loans Anywhere In The World Using Bitcoin", "title_full": "German Bank Allows Users To Transfer Loans Anywhere In The World Using Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-14T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/styles/inline_image_desktop/public/inline-images/albrect.jpg?itok=Ts07bZX6", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0326d96bbd8b1fee484656e24b90310dd9a26449", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRGIhDwb2oP349p92xynzoh4YoZrlHWFSzIjwl7DeEkWASmg6cxM1DyV20YN7M_mFaFxnbAZhyobYnD63Q4V2Mw.Tde2_8FRyeYtrYHvJXwh5NhOZGq8VTNkY09AuwKocX98jYyu6ziMzsmBXSXXlMQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SGT", "published": "2018-05-14T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "German Bank Allows Users To Transfer Loans Anywhere In The World Using Bitcoin", "text": "German Bank Allows Users To Transfer Loans Anywhere In The World Using Bitcoin By\nfrom ZeroHedge :\nWith the US set to blacklist Iran from global dollar-based transactions, here’s an idea for Tehran: use Bitcoin to make, and accept, payments from its trading partners. And, there’s even a bank ready to serve Iran when it comes knocking: according to Reuters, German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin.\nThat’s right: bitcoin’s money-laundering, capital-controls evading capabilities – the reason why we said it’s going much, much higher back in September 2015 when it was just above $200 – are finally going mainstream. And not only that, but in one move it is disintermediating the multi-trillion industry behind private money creation known as “banking.”\nIt’s therefore hardly a surprise that the company’s motto is “see no bank, hear no bank, speak no bank.”\nAlbrecht’s Bitbond uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to completely bypass the Swift international transfer system which has a monopoly and ultimate veto power on who is in – and isn’t – in the global petrodollar club, to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nBut what about the risk of intermediary price fluctuations?\nThat, too, has been factored in as clients hold the loans in their choice cryptocurrency for only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitbond’s novelty is that while bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, it never served as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. And judging by the company’s rapid growth, there is more than enough demand for its services: Albrecht’s service, which has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013, employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-13/german-bank-allows-users-transfer-loans-anywhere-world-using-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T15:01:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c22cecdfb24349132ab080d12a15404756f9b143", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf2q0mo7aHA5QBKYtUuwGT2PiSTehOS_SkH4EcIj8Q7wsEW9uuD34CBNFCK5XkBITQm4lhxq9BmQ2n.PGJksfYVUFe3tecRdNFbsDQoaUNBDOgMArquDcYRM-", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/news/feed/", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "News – CCN", "title": "Cryptocurrency Market Drops $9 Billion, Bitcoin and Major Currencies Remain Volatile", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency Market Drops $9 Billion, Bitcoin and Major Currencies Remain Volatile", "published": "2018-05-14T12:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Roller-coaster-vertical.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c22cecdfb24349132ab080d12a15404756f9b143", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf2q0mo7aHA5QBKYtUuwGT2PiSTehOS_SkH4EcIj8Q7wsEW9uuD34CBNFCK5XkBITQm4lhxq9BmQ2n.PGJksfYVUFe3tecRdNFbsDQoaUNBDOgMArquDcYRM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joseph Young", "published": "2018-05-14T12:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency Market Drops $9 Billion, Bitcoin and Major Currencies Remain Volatile", "text": "Cryptocurrency Market Drops $9 Billion, Bitcoin and Major Currencies Remain Volatile Advertisement\nThe cryptocurrency market has dropped $9 billion over the past 24 hours after demonstrating a $30 billion increase in valuation from $370 to $400 billion. Bitcoin Struggle at $8,500\nThe bitcoin price has struggled to surpass the $8,500 mark on throughout May 14, even after surpassing $8,700 on May 13. The market started to recover as the bitcoin price rebounded to the $8,500 and tokens like Ontology (ONT) recorded gains in the 20 to 30 percent region, but the market failed to sustain momentum at the $400 billion mark.\nIn an interview with The Express, cryptocurrency analyst and researcher Matthew Newton stated that major banks have already invested heavily in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, and the entire cryptocurrency market, echoing a similar stance as Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at $364 billion investment firm Federated Investors.\nIn the short to mid-term, Newton emphasized that the entrance of banks could trigger institutional demand for cryptocurrency to rise, allowing the market to recover to its previous levels.\n“Despite some initial posturing, the reality is most big banks have already invested significant amounts in research and development into blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies themselves. It will still take time for institutional investors to fully come around – and the fact that Goldman won’t be buying or selling actual coins suggest some scepticism remains – but there’s a growing acceptance that these assets are here to stay,” said Newton.\nMany traders believe that the Blockchain Week in New York marked by the start of Consensus 2018 will help the bitcoin price recover and the market to rebound. Over the past week, the market has not been able to record any major movement on the upside and if the bitcoin price remains below the $8,500 mark, it is likely that other major cryptocurrencies and tokens will continue to slump throughout the week.\nBut, if bitcoin can secure the $8,800 support level and eye a move towards $9,500 by the end of the week, the cryptocurrency market could experience a surge in volume and inflow of new capital.\nAlready, the volume of the market has increased to around $21 billion, up by more than $5 billion since May 11. Depending on the volume, the bitcoin price could regain momentum and move towards the $8,800 mark or test the $8,000 resistance level in the short-term. Tokens\nSeveral tokens such as Salt, Ontology, and Storm have been able to record major gains against both bitcoin and US dollar over the past week. Considering that tokens experience intensified movements on both the upside and downside, the value of most tokens will depend on the short-term trend of bitcoin and Ethereum.\nWith the bitcoin dominance index below 37 percent, it is evident that tokens and other small cryptocurrencies have started to outperform major digital assets.

Anarchico: libertà dal potere dei tiranni. Cattolico: la libertà dei figli di Dio è un dono universale. May 14 Bitcoin and the Tip of the Iceberg Most articles on cryptocurrencies refer to mysterious miners, crooks and criminals, and their building of fortunes. I’d like to skip these technical and folkloristic details — however intriguing they might be for those who can’t help sticking their noses into morbid curiosities — and try to propose a wider perspective to contextualize the cryptocurrency phenomenon. Information Technology radically changed our society in the last twenty years. So the Bitcoin phenomenon can be properly understood only within the wider context of digitization. It is the tip of the iceberg in a new scenario where very few corporations control key services such as: telecommunications, logistics, retail distribution, citizen identification and profiling (once known as classified filing), cartography and geolocation of every activity in the state. RMS Titanic departing Southampton on 10 April 1912 A new form of deterritorialized citizenship has quickly established itself on a global scale in parallel with old analog state bureaucracies. The old bureaucracies are slow, inefficient and clearly inadequate to the task of managing an increasingly accelerated society. People are easily frightened by change, and our fear is fuelled by the notion that too much power may be granted to these private enterprises. Governments claim to defend our privacy with byzantine regulations in an almost ludicrous way — as when they introduced annoying cookie consent notices. We tend to forget, however, that governments are the first to violate our privacy. They have access to our bank accounts, monitor and keep files on us. They want their citizens to be subdued taxpayers, while companies simply want potential clients to buy products and services. Nevertheless many fear that nation states — giants with clay feet who should protect us from oppression and abuse — may crumble as a result of this technological upheaval. It is primarily in rich countries where people are scared; where economic certainties of the past cannot be taken for granted any longer. We tend to forget that our prosperity was achieved by a partition of wealth generated by capitalism and colonialism. Thanks to unique historical circumstances produced by the Cold War between Russia and America, wealth was redistributed more equitably than usual. Similar to what happened during the French Revolution, the same privileges are now being invoked by the world’s poorest who threaten the borders of this new version of the old Versailles, called Europe. Europe also is where old bureaucracies are trying to create a transnational political power that hopefully can represent a model for a globalised world — a planetary government against potential future wars caused by global warming, or food and demographic crises. Europe currently is witnessing the loss of power and monetary sovereignty by old nation states. We can understand the role played by Bitcoin, a private digital currency that is not controlled by any government, only by taking into account these developments. Instead of reducing our discussion to digital gossip and curiosity for a new technology, why don’t we start treating Bitcoin as a crucial piece of the puzzle whose solution could provide a guide for political and social opportunities of globalised humanity? The first block of the Blockchain (the transaction database of the Bitcoin protocol) contained the following message: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” On 3 September, 2009 the London Times ran a cover story on the instability of the fractional reserve banking system. Whoever may be hiding behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, by quoting the title of that specific cover story, probably had a twofold purpose: to demonstrate that the Blockchain was not created prior to the article’s release date, and to express worry over a self-proclaimed capitalist system that was caving in to a bank bailout. This in itself is a precious detail in the interpretation of something that cannot be deduced in simple technological terms. To highlight the inventors’ intention we should emphasize two further elements underpinning its functioning: distributed consensus and social scalability, both leading to a real change of paradigm (a topic that deserves a separate article). It goes without saying that the myth of a Nation State is fading away. A new world government is waiting (without much hope) for its founding fathers. Some enormously large corporations are colonizing the new digital space basically unfettered. Will they soon invent a new mythology to justify and legitimize their power? Can we define technological progress as a myth in itself? Do we trust its invulnerability? Meanwhile, a few intrepid libertarian heroes opposed to centralized power have discovered something in the digital sphere that is scarce and is not duplicable — the exact equivalent of gold, which in the physical domain gave rise to all historical monetary systems. In the face of a malfunctioning political system and an all-too-slow bureaucracy that is clumsily steering its Titanic against the iceberg of digitization, a group of libertarians specializing in cryptography are providing hope. Will Bitcoin preserve some of our individual freedom against old and new centralized powers that are vying for global supremacy?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://creativecommons.org/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southam", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T13:13:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f3553691c5c32ce05dcf92e178f38f9b7e0a145e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyZWWt1fkZVQYtJeHVkMC6IJCdHnKSV1xvS_g9hFiBMMwwTMhwN6FnBb21q9vzAfTsz1I26pyzKm0ZCKFuHNmM_N4veT7sY4y3ZUqsMRjnjVw--", "site_full": "prsync.com", "site": "prsync.com", "site_section": "http://prsync.com/rss/latest", "site_categories": ["marketing", "financial_news", "finance", "business"], "section_title": "PR sync (Latest)", "title": "How Bitcoins and other Cryptocurrencies are taxed in UK", "title_full": "How Bitcoins and other Cryptocurrencies are taxed in UK", "published": "2018-05-14T12:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17518, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3553691c5c32ce05dcf92e178f38f9b7e0a145e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyZWWt1fkZVQYtJeHVkMC6IJCdHnKSV1xvS_g9hFiBMMwwTMhwN6FnBb21q9vzAfTsz1I26pyzKm0ZCKFuHNmM_N4veT7sY4y3ZUqsMRjnjVw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T12:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Bitcoins and other Cryptocurrencies are taxed in UK", "text": "Submitted by Vidit Agarwal .

The app will allow users to pair their phones with goTenna's portable antennas in order to broadcast transactions.\ngoTenna produces consumer-grade hardware to facilitate mesh networking - a concept that echoes much of the decentralization ethos that we see across the cryptocurrency domain - which operates by allowing peers to connect directly to one another for the purpose of routing packets, sidestepping the need to rely on an ISP or cell tower.\n\"What will happen when these massive centralized networks fail due to natural disasters, as they did after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, or due to some kind of outside cybersecurity attack? What will happen when providers decide to crank up prices just because they can?\" said Rich Myers, goTenna's Decentralized Applications Engineer.\n\"Mesh networks are the only legitimate alternative to these traditional centralized communication networks. They are completely decentralized and democratized, leaving the power of communication in the hands of the people. Beyond that, they are much more resilient to unforeseen disasters - the only thing these networks need to function is a mesh networking device paired with a smartphone.\"\nFor its part, Samourai Wallet has been focusing on censorship resistance and privacy-oriented tools since it began in 2015. With features such as direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets, it has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions.\nSamourai has been curating Mule.tools , an R&D initiative to further reinforce the censorship-resistant properties of the Bitcoin blockchain and also published the code for Pony Direct , a proof-of-concept app for broadcasting transactions over SMS in January.\n\"We believe one of the most fundamental value propositions that bitcoin provides is censorship resistance,\" SW, the CEO of Samourai, told Bitcoin Magazine . \"The freedom to transact freely and without permission is not a freedom to take lightly, or give up without a fight. We saw the open internet transform into a walled garden, captured by regulatory and corporate interest working together - and largely aided by red-herrings like 'net-neutrality.'\n\"The tools we are building arm the little guy - the individual - with the tools they need to level the playing field against the inevitable overstepping of bounds by hostile actors, oppressive regimes and overzealous governments,\" said SW. \"We're making some material changes to Samourai Wallet to allow for a greater high latency and offline experience. In conjunction with the release of txTenna, Samourai Wallet users will be able to theoretically keep their phone offline at all times and still be able to send and receive payments with minimal hassle.\"\nThe concept explored by txTenna follows in the path of alternate methods to access the blockchain, previously seen with both the Blockstream Satellite and in the works of Nick Szabo and Elaine Ou. Not only does it provide more versatility to those wishing to avoid using censored systems, but it opens up a slew of use cases for Bitcoin in regions with less-developed infrastructures and those affected by natural disasters.

Traditional banking systems do not allow high-risk industries to access their payment systems. ZenaPay offers a cutting-edge payment solution that gives consumers a way to buy items online or in stores using Bitcoin. The new Bitcoin payment software will allow consumers to use digital currency to make online or in-store purchases with ease. The process will also be anonymous because all transaction details are encrypted through Bitcoin, which will enable stores to accept digital currency instead of only cash. ZenaPay is available on the App Store and Play Store.\nAbout Epazz, Inc.

Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) to be removed 10-05-2018 - 15:12\nComing Tuesday the 15th a hardfork for Bitcoin Cash (BCH/Bitcash/Bcash) is planned. Since there already was a planning for the removal of Bitcash the hardfork has become a reason and strict deadline for the removal of Bitcash from BL3P. Everyone who had bitcoins on BL3P on 1 August at 15:16:49 CEST, has received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (bitcash). BL3P maintains a strict selection policy when it comes to support for altcoins, bitcash unfortunately does not meet these requirements. For this reason we have not made it possible to trade bitcash on BL3P. In addition, we will disable the option to withdraw bitcash per 15 May, 2018.\nYou have until 14 May, 2018, 15:00:00 CEST to withdraw your bitcash balance from BL3P. You can choose to transfer it to a bitcash wallet or to trade it on another exchange. Below we elaborate upon the possibilities. Withdraw and store bitcash in your own wallet\nUnfortunately we can’t recommend a specific wallet or offer technical support. You can choose a wallet for yourself, at your own risk. After installation, you will receive a bitcoincash address. You can withdraw the coin on BL3P by clicking at the top of the page to convert the market to bitcoin cash (BCHEUR): Click / tap €. You can then enter your bitcoincash address on the 'withdrawal' page. Click on the amount next to \"Available\", to include your entire balance. Trading bitcash on another exchange\nYou can withdraw your bitcash credit in the same manner as described above. You then enter a bitcash deposit address from the exchange where you want to trade your bitcash. If you want to use an instant coin conversion service such as shapeshift.io, make sure to first create your own wallet, as you’ll need a bitcoincash address as a return address. Never enter a bitcoin address!\nClick here for a list of exchanges that support bitcash.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\n(Writing by Laura Dubois,; Editing by Joseph Nasr and Matthew Mpoke Bigg)\nBuyBitcoinsInNigeria ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T11:59:10.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5f3ae62b84ca689c0f4364181aad2f139c0ef25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZTsqGD3Dseu9jhszSzPo1ASvbzVt9_R8DEiFZV0e8mkdE7JAwYFkBBW", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "German Internet Bank to offer to replace Swift transactions Bitcoin", "title_full": "German Internet Bank to offer to replace Swift transactions Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-14T11:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5f3ae62b84ca689c0f4364181aad2f139c0ef25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZTsqGD3Dseu9jhszSzPo1ASvbzVt9_R8DEiFZV0e8mkdE7JAwYFkBBW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T11:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "German Internet Bank to offer to replace Swift transactions Bitcoin", "text": "\nInternational payments via cryptocurrencies can be faster and more profitable than it is now.\nBitbond, an online Bank based in Germany in 2013, proposes to replace international payments on loans that are held through the system of interbank payments Swift transaction of bitcoin.\nBitcoin vs Swift, who The Bank carries out the payment with bitcoin at the international level, in terms of amounts of about 1 million dollars in loans per month.\n\"Thanks to the innovations in the field of payments and credit rating Bitbond makes financial inclusion a reality throughout the world.

Robinson , Market Analyst Price behavior analysis, short to intermediate-term trade set-ups. Connect via:\nThe recent slide has cryptocurrencies postured for lower prices, but clarity is somewhat lacking in regard to the big-picture. However, given the volatility of the group there are trading levels of interest which can help guide short-term maneuvers. Today, we’ll check in on three of the heavyweights – Bitcoin , Ripple & Litecoin – and the technical outlook on the 4-hr time-frame.\nSee how positioning changes in cryptocurrencies and other markets can help as a tool to determine price direction on the IG Client Sentiment page. Bitcoin key levels around 8700 and 7800\nSince topping on 5/5, Bitcoin has been backpedaling with a series of lower-lows and lower-highs forming on the 4-hr time-frame. The key zone of resistance arrives around 8700 (+/- 50 pts.), a spot which we just saw an overnight rejection unfold from. A rally beyond and a cross of the trend-line off the monthly high will be needed before momentum can pick up to the top-side. Looking lower, price support first arrives around 7800 on a drop below the weekend low at 8208.\nCheck out this guide to learn more about how to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC/USD 4-hr Chart Ripple resistance around 75c, support ~62c\nRipple turned down overnight from just shy of the 75c area where a pair of bounces have developed from in recent weeks. With a push above, XRP will be trading back inside a range it was stuck in for nearly three weeks and will need to trade above 95c to reassert an upward trend. Looking lower, the area around 62c held over the weekend and is viewed as a fairly solid level of support, but if the recent trend lower is to gain further momentum then it won’t likely hold for long. XRP/USD 4-hr Chart Litecoin rejected from mid-140s\nOver the weekend, Litecoin broke a solid zone of support formed during the latter part of last month. Overnight, there was a rejection on a bounce, which further cements the mid-140s as an area of significant resistance. Looking lower, ~125 is minor support, with the area around 110 seen as the biggest threshold. It will take a strong move lower to trade there, but if momentum can continue from the $50 move already seen off the monthly high, then it may not take that long to extend another $25-30 lower from current levels.
