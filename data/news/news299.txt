(KFSN) -- What some might call the future of currency is sitting in the corner of this CellPros shop in Northwest Fresno on Ashlen Avenue-- a Bitcoin ATM.\"All you need is just an ID, four quick taps on the screen, less than 60 seconds and you can own cryptocurrency,\" said Coinme director of marketing Dom Garrett.It all starts with your ID, that goes in the ATM and a profile is created, which acts as a virtual wallet.\"You don't have to put in your password, you don't have to put in any usernames, it's all right here in your ID,\" said Garrett.You put in your money and congratulations, now you own some Bitcoin. That currency can be used to make purchases at certain online shops or you can make an investment.\"You can just save bit, by bit and be able to throw 20 bucks in at a time and watch it grow,\" said Garrett.Tech company Coinme has nearly 50 of these across the U.S.-- two of those are in Fresno. Garrett said they added the second machine last month because of increased interest. The first ATM was put in the Tower District last September, in the CellPros on Olive Avenue.\"And over the last couple of months it has become one of our top performing machines,\" said Garrett.Right now you can only buy Bitcoin on the ATM, but Garrett said in the coming week's people will be able to exchange their cryptocurrency for cash.

The launch of BTC.com, which has transacted billions of USD worth of BTC and BCH over the past few years, on Huawei paves the way for many Chinese smartphone owners to gain first-time access to a mobile bitcoin wallet. Consumers who purchase a new Huawei or Honor smartphone from the P20 and up will have the Huawei app store automatically installed on their device, while previous models will begin gaining access to it later in the current quarter. Huawei phone users will be in for a surprise when downloading the bitcoin wallet from the App Gallery, as BTC.com — which is owned by China-based cryptocurrency miner manufacturer Bitmain — is running a promotion in which it will “gift a starting amount of cryptocurrency.” “BTC.com is democratizing Bitcoin by breaking down barriers to entry and ensuring new users can access Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in a simple, secure and trusted environment,” according to BTC.com’s Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of Business Operations, in a press release. Mobile Crypto Payments BTC.com is the first bitcoin wallet accepted into Huawei’s recently-launched app store.\nChina is a global leader in mobile payments with apps like WeChat and AliPay leading the way. But the government has taken a hard line on the cryptocurrency industry, as evidenced by its banning of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and local bitcoin exchanges from operating in the mainland, not to mention its crackdown on bitcoin mining, which is a feature on the BTC.com platform. Nonetheless, BTC.com’s de la Torre recognizes “the amazing opportunity cryptocurrencies have in replacing fiat currency as the currency of choice for mobile payments” in China. Huawei execs have a similarly ambitious view. Huawei and BTC.com couldn’t wait on the sidelines as more than 90% of China’s internet users go online via their mobile device. In fact, mobile phone usage is poised to surpass watching television among China’s population this year, according to eMarketer . And China like India is almost entirely cashless. The companies want to usher in “millions of new cryptocurrency users” and make it easy for them to send or receive BTC and BCH among friends. Consumers can also join a bitcoin mining pool that’s backed by industry leader Bitmain.

It's not cheap, either.The wireless industry is built on high-priced auctions for chunks of spectrum in different parts of the nation, with billions paid to the FCC to gain access.Not all of the spectrum is being used, and shake-ups are happening now and in the near-future. One significant new part of the spectrum to be opened up was announced in 2015 , as a future release by the FCC. 150MHz of spectrum between the 3550-3700MHz band, also known as the 3.5GHz Band, and called the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS).Previously for the military-only, the attractive CBRS band will be opened upThis very useful band was previously exclusively under military control.

The short of this is those who use the PicsArt Android app going forward will be able to apply even more, and greater effects to their photos and images to create even more unique and appealing content.ML Kit was announced today by Google as part of the company's annual developer conference , and is in essence a one-stop solution for app developers to make use of Google's machine learning advancements with minimal integration needed. In this case, the benefits of the ML Kit is that it can help to apply more visually appealing effects to an otherwise normal-looking image. To be clear, PicsArt already offers its users its own AI-powered solution which underlines its \"Magic Effects\" feature that lets users change the look of an image, and in some cases quite drastically –… May 09, 2018 Posted by Chris Sells, Benjamin Poiesz, Karen Ng, Product Management, Android Developer Tools Today we're excited to introduce Android Jetpack, the next generation of components, tools and architectural guidance to accelerate your Android app development.Android Jetpack was inspired by the Support Library, a set of components to make it easy to take advantage of new Android features while maintaining backwards compatibility; it's currently used by 99% of every app in the Play Store. Following on that success, we introduced the Architecture Components , designed to make it easier to deal with data in the face of changes and the complications of the app lifecycle. Since we introduced those components at I/O just one year ago, an overwhelming number of you have adopted them. Companies such as LinkedIn, Zillow and iHeartRadio are seeing fewer bugs, higher testability and more time to focus on what makes their app unique.The Android developer community has been clear -- not only do yo… May 06, 2018 Welcome to the 242nd edition of Android Apps Weekly ! Here are the big headlines from the last week: Twitter had a mishap this week . A bug in their system had passwords stored as plain text. That is obviously not great news. However, Twitter did find the bug, fix it, and issued a notice to all of their users. Thankfully, they fixed it already. There isn't any evidence of a hack, exploit, or anything like that. Sometimes it's nice to hear that something is a bug and not a hack. Still, we highly recommend that everyone on Twitter change their password for obvious reasons. Google has a secret gaming startup, apparently . A report this week indicated that Google is working on a bunch of arcade games with social elements. There aren't a ton of details Google Arcade right now. We know it's part of Area 120, an incubator for startups at Google. Of course, if it's successful, we'll hear about it. It'll simply fold if it's not.

Hence, it does not fit Warrens style.\nSo what is your opinion?\nBefore we ask why is Warren Buffet did not want to invest in bitcoin let us examine who is really Warren Buffet. According to Wikipedia Warren Buffet is is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist who serves as the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is considered one of the most successful investors in the world and has a net worth of US$82.9 billion as of February 17, 2018, making him the third wealthiest person in the world. In addition Buffet is also the biggest shareholder of Hathaway since 1970 and the media is calling him oracle , sage, wizard due to his success and immense wealth.\nSo now after looking at his background, we can infer that Buffet have been successful all of his life using traditional business and this is the main reason why he thought that bitcoin was useless. If you are already making that huge amount of money I guess it is normal that you are confident on your field and will not mind bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T22:26:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fc0f9840f361cf686a5e3802a0522bcac87d6512", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNXYeFb9.2WCxKO_E6kUpVQn.A66tBz4Chp2rlRNfnl0m7d5G3T7780g--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin Moons to $36,000 by End of 2019 According to Fundstrat", "title_full": "Bitcoin Moons to $36,000 by End of 2019 According to Fundstrat", "published": "2018-05-11T23:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc0f9840f361cf686a5e3802a0522bcac87d6512", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNXYeFb9.2WCxKO_E6kUpVQn.A66tBz4Chp2rlRNfnl0m7d5G3T7780g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T23:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Moons to $36,000 by End of 2019 According to Fundstrat", "text": "Bitcoin Moons to $36,000 by End of 2019 According to Fundstrat\nC. Edward Kelso\nFundstrat Global, a favorite research firm in the cryptosphere with Wall Street-street cred, is once again providing eye-popping bitcoin (BTC) predictions. This time analysis depends largely on what's known as the mining economy. Hash power and hardware advancement all combine to show a possible $36,000 BTC price by the end of next year, they claim.\nAlso read: JP Morgan Chase Eats Humble Pie, Applies for Blockchain Patent\nFundstrat Continues Moon Price Predictions Fundstrat's head of data research, Sam Doctor, explained, \"The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.\"\nCapex is short for capital expenditure, and refers here to upgrades in technology such as mining rigs. Hash power growth can be thought of as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin using proof of work, relying on a unit of measure basically recording power consumed by the network to keep it humming along, in this case, roughly every ten minutes a block is found or generated.\nInternal Fundstrat research document \"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" Mr. Doctor continued. \"The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.\"\nIf a multiple of four from its current price seems ambitious, the actual range from Fundstrat pushes the high to nearly twice even that number. Mr. Doctor uses mining economics to establish a floor support level due to its supposed relative growth going forward. Through next year, researchers believe mining hash power will indeed boom by 350 percent.\nA Rosy Immediate Future Most of the price moon prediction depends upon miners Fundstrat assumes will hold their position through the crypto winter, and then sell once it recovers (and better). Moving variables in the mining economy include rig innovation, electricity cost, and the ability to lower hardware temperatures.\nMr. Doctor further elaborated how \"miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees. We argue that the Price/Miner's Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.\" And harder numbers Fundstrat asserts to be $6K per BTC for Bitmain's Antminer S7, and just over $2K for its S9 model.\nSuch rosey price predictions are nothing new for Fundstrat Global. Its very public face, and really only prominent Wall Street analyst to take cryptocurrencies seriously as an asset class, Tom Lee, famously last Summer forecast BTC becoming a store of value on par with gold, reaching a high of as much as $55K by 2022. As more information has come in, Mr. Lee has also said he expects the digital asset could moon to $25K by the end of this year alone.\nStill other analysts believe the causal connection between mining activity and speculative price is not well established, leading to perhaps more outlandish price calls as a result. And with other cryptocurrencies battling it out for market share, offering varieties of features not currently found in bitcoin, the BTC price explosion might not be such a given. At press time, BTC price hovered around $8,500, down almost ten percent.\nWhat are your crypto price predictions?

This time analysis depends largely on what’s known as the mining economy. Hash power and hardware advancement all combine to show a possible $36,000 BTC price by the end of next year, they claim.\nAlso read: JP Morgan Chase Eats Humble Pie, Applies for Blockchain Patent Fundstrat Continues Moon Price Predictions\nFundstrat’s head of data research, Sam Doctor, explained, “The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.”\nCapex is short for capital expenditure, and refers here to upgrades in technology such as mining rigs. Hash power growth can be thought of as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin using proof of work, relying on a unit of measure basically recording power consumed by the network to keep it humming along, in this case, roughly every ten minutes a block is found or generated. Internal Fundstrat research document\n“We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,” Mr. Doctor continued. “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.”\nIf a multiple of four from its current price seems ambitious, the actual range from Fundstrat pushes the high to nearly twice even that number. Mr. Doctor uses mining economics to establish a floor support level due to its supposed relative growth going forward. Through next year, researchers believe mining hash power will indeed boom by 350 percent. A Rosy Immediate Future\nMost of the price moon prediction depends upon miners Fundstrat assumes will hold their position through the crypto winter, and then sell once it recovers (and better). Moving variables in the mining economy include rig innovation, electricity cost, and the ability to lower hardware temperatures.\nMr. Doctor further elaborated how “miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees. We argue that the Price/Miner’s Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.” And harder numbers Fundstrat asserts to be $6K per BTC for Bitmain’s Antminer S7, and just over $2K for its S9 model.\nSuch rosey price predictions are nothing new for Fundstrat Global. Its very public face, and really only prominent Wall Street analyst to take cryptocurrencies seriously as an asset class, Tom Lee, famously last Summer forecast BTC becoming a store of value on par with gold, reaching a high of as much as $55K by 2022. As more information has come in, Mr. Lee has also said he expects the digital asset could moon to $25K by the end of this year alone.\nStill other analysts believe the causal connection between mining activity and speculative price is not well established, leading to perhaps more outlandish price calls as a result. And with other cryptocurrencies battling it out for market share, offering varieties of features not currently found in bitcoin, the BTC price explosion might not be such a given. At press time, BTC price hovered around $8,500, down almost ten percent.\nWhat are your crypto price predictions?

An anonymous source close to the operation described the number as an accurate approximation.\nAt about 7% of the worldwide bitcoin supply, that’s not crypto chump change. It means that four-year-old Xapo has more “deposits” than 98% of U.S. banks, according to Bloomberg.\nXapo’s Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the Financial Services Standards Association, a self-regulatory organization that ensures that its members comply with anti-money-laundering rules. The company serves its U.S. clientele through a Delaware corporation that is registered with Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\nIt may be worth familiarizing yourself with Xapo--a wealthy client may very well ask you to store some bitcoin with it.\n–Ross Snel\nToday in Advisor Center Here Are the Meatiest Dividend Yields\nAdvisor Crushed in Senate Bid, Vows to Run Again\nBlackRock Invests its Own Change in Acorns\nMost Popular Why the Buyback Boom Is Bullish for Investors Markets Now: Dow Gains 150 Points.

That time has long since passed; these days, you need an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) setup to even have a shot at making some money. But why did Bitcoin go from being an easy money maker to something few can afford to mine?\nThe answer lies with one of Bitcoin’s basic principles, which makes the cryptocurrency harder to mine as it grows in popularity. That way, having a bunch of people mine Bitcoin won’t undermine its value. It’s almost like circulating a limited number of U.S. dollars so each one is worth more, comparatively, instead of thinking you can create wealth by literally printing money.\nNot that you have to print Bitcoin, of course. Instead, when you’re “mining” the cryptocurrency, you’re basically tasking whatever device you’re using with solving a bunch of math problems.\nHow Bitcoin Is Mined Bitcoin, like seemingly every other technology these days, is based on the blockchain. The blockchain is pretty much what it sounds like: a series of interconnected “blocks.” In Bitcoin’s case, these blocks are used as transaction ledgers that make sure every exchange of the cryptocurrency is legitimate. Instead of trusting a central figure, like you do with traditional currencies, you’re trusting the math behind Bitcoin to ensure everything is on the up-and-up.\nDoing all that math requires some computational resources. That’s what your mining rig is--a system that downloads the blockchain, does a bunch of math, and assures the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem that a given transaction was legitimate. In exchange for devoting your rig to preserving this system, you’re given a certain transaction fee as well as a subsidy of new coins--hence the “mining” metaphor that compares earning Bitcoin to digging up something like gold.\nUnlike gold, however, Bitcoin isn’t a naturally limited resource. One could theoretically design a cryptocurrency that allows someone to earn as much as they want as long as they have the hardware to back it up. But that would devalue each unit (or “coin” for most cryptocurrencies). Instead, Bitcoin was designed in a way that ensures the creation of new coins is stable over the long term. As more Bitcoin is created, each individual Bitcoin gets harder to mine.\nWeighing The Costs Of A Mining Rig This increasing complexity makes it harder for general hardware, like an off-the-shelf CPU or GPU, to mine Bitcoin. The days of being able to mine Bitcoin while your system would otherwise be idle are pretty much over; you’re not going to make any real money that way. Instead, dedicated Bitcoin miners have to create “mining rigs” devoted specifically to Bitcoin mining.\nEach mining rig is the result of basic cost-benefit analysis. You have to think about how much the system will cost to assemble, how much it will add to your power bills, and how much you expect to make in real-world money before you actually build the thing. (We explained that process as it relates to Ethereum, another popular cryptocurrency, here .) It doesn’t make sense to spend an exorbitant amount of money up front, and monthly, on a rig that makes a pittance each month.\nCombine the need to pay for parts and power with the increasing complexity involved with mining Bitcoin, and you have a situation where CPUs and GPUs have been effectively pushed out of the mining game. To answer the question in the headline: You can, technically, mine Bitcoin with your PC. The problem is that doing so would be like trying to mine gold with a soup ladle while other people are out there with heavy equipment and teams of workers who all specialize in mining.\nYou'd Also Like\nWhy Can’t I Mine Bitcoin With My PC Anymore?

Some people anticipated clarity in the recently announced deal with Overstock.com, but what they were treated to was a pie in the sky tale about ElioCoin.\nYes, ElioCoin...Elio Motors, who haven't been able to produce a single vehicle since launching in 2009, is going to attempt to start up their own currency.\nThere has been a ton of attention paid to cryptocurrency since BitCoin exploded to record high value earlier this year. Interestingly, Bitcoin launched in 2009, the same year Elio came to be. However, unlike Elio, Bitcoin has turned into an insanely successful venture. Bitcoin, like all other cryptocurrency, is a digital currency that can be used as a peer-to-peer payment system, with no centralized bank or governing body. Making the value of Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) totally dependent on users need. It's not backed by it's value in anything, and you can't directly cash it out with anyone.\nBitcoin didn't suddenly become extremely valuable though. The majority of the value behind Bitcoin was built in unsavory ways.\nDue to the nature of a cryptocurrency, it's nearly impossible to track. Names don't have to be attached, and there's no unifying legal system around it. Making it the perfect payment system for illegal activities. Bitcoin has been primarily used for drug dealers, sex workers, and other nefarious entities. But that's not to say its all bad. There are tremendous benefits to cryptocurrency, and the future for them is very exciting. The point being that Bitcoin didn't just show up with value, it had to be built.\nElioCoin will also show up with no value, and unless they're hoping to have it become the new method of payment for drug dealers, has no foreseeable method of gaining value.\nWell, the company has floated the idea that coins could be redeemed for vehicles, then again people have heard this before, and have no cars to show for it. When Elio attempted this \"Kickstarter\" type effort, they raised over $20 million. But with no results as far as production goes.\nBack to the idea of a company, with little-to-no value, launching their own cryptocurrency...what is the endgame of this stunt? Do the people behind Elio honestly believe that they will raise the millions needed to produce these cars? Likely not. This is a move that falls in line with various other Elio moves...\nThey are attempting to use buzzwords and new concepts to confuse and excite people into handing over cash, with no intent of producing goods. From the start, the pitched a low gas mileage vehicle with questionable sustainability, then they moved into the \"unsecured\" investment in the model of Kickstarter, now cryptocurrency. This is a distinct pattern of behavior.\nThere were a lot of other nuggets to unpack from today's press conference, but I honestly can't get past ElioCoins.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greg atoms dennis foley paul elio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "elio motors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "shreveport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "overstock.com", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T23:46:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7113f9747ed3ff1daf826944d293df506b7fb28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRgUJhzgu_RlxaRHvhuuRWDb6LS4ujhHKw4Wy1JTehfLVqaZn7FR6dwIUGiAH7R5S3ZIzjzkDmaq2rAL4rPysgD.zJp0DMSHAl7F1Xtek1zQ8mhTITXgPImEJtI955pEw-", "site_full": "moneymorning.com", "site": "moneymorning.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/moneymorning/jOLe", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Money Morning – We Make Investing Profitable", "title": "Look for Bitcoin Prices to Rebound After the Consensus Conference", "title_full": "Look for Bitcoin Prices to Rebound After the Consensus Conference", "published": "2018-05-11T23:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://moneymorning.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2018/05/bitcoinPile-300x166.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13561, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7113f9747ed3ff1daf826944d293df506b7fb28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRgUJhzgu_RlxaRHvhuuRWDb6LS4ujhHKw4Wy1JTehfLVqaZn7FR6dwIUGiAH7R5S3ZIzjzkDmaq2rAL4rPysgD.zJp0DMSHAl7F1Xtek1zQ8mhTITXgPImEJtI955pEw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Money Morning Staff Reports", "published": "2018-05-11T23:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Look for Bitcoin Prices to Rebound After the Consensus Conference", "text": "Send with mail | ahoo instead.

The Top Cryptocurrency Stories for May 11 Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB ) is generating buzz, because it might launch its own cryptocurrency in the future. Financial outlet Cheddar reported today that the company is holding high-level discussions about how to implement blockchain technology into its platform. It's also considering launching its own cryptocurrency. The team leader of Facebook's blockchain research group is also a board member of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase . Some people aren't too thrilled about Goldman Sachs Group 's (NYSE: GS ) decision to launch a Bitcoin desk. A professor at Warwick Business School in England said that Goldman's decision will \"open the box\" for pure speculation in the global cryptocurrency markets. Of course, many speculate Goldman just wants to manipulate the market. Despite today's downturn in the broader cryptocurrency market, there was a bright spot. Augur popped more than 10% after the coin was listed on Binance. Augur was the only coin in the top 100 by market capitalization to show a gain north of 10% on the day. Augur describes itself as \"a decentralized oracle and prediction market platform.\" The Shocking Reason Why We Think Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 (and How You Could Make Millions)\nMoney Morning Defense and Tech Specialist – and cryptocurrency legend – Michael Robinson just revealed the little-known details regarding the future of Bitcoin… and why, at any moment, it could be poised for a record-breaking rebound far beyond anything we've witnessed already.\nMichael made a prediction about Bitcoin way back in 2013 – and folks who followed his advice stood to become 253 times richer .

That time has long since passed; these days, you need an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) setup to even have a shot at making some money. But why did Bitcoin go from being an easy money maker to something few can afford to mine?\nThe answer lies with one of Bitcoin’s basic principles, which makes the cryptocurrency harder to mine as it grows in popularity. That way, having a bunch of people mine Bitcoin won’t undermine its value. It’s almost like circulating a limited number of U.S. dollars so each one is worth more, comparatively, instead of thinking you can create wealth by literally printing money.\nNot that you have to print Bitcoin, of course. Instead, when you’re “mining” the cryptocurrency, you’re basically tasking whatever device you’re using with solving a bunch of math problems. How Bitcoin Is Mined\nBitcoin, like seemingly every other technology these days, is based on the blockchain. The blockchain is pretty much what it sounds like: a series of interconnected “blocks.” In Bitcoin’s case, these blocks are used as transaction ledgers that make sure every exchange of the cryptocurrency is legitimate. Instead of trusting a central figure, like you do with traditional currencies, you’re trusting the math behind Bitcoin to ensure everything is on the up-and-up.\nDoing all that math requires some computational resources. That’s what your mining rig is--a system that downloads the blockchain, does a bunch of math, and assures the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem that a given transaction was legitimate. In exchange for devoting your rig to preserving this system, you’re given a certain transaction fee as well as a subsidy of new coins--hence the “mining” metaphor that compares earning Bitcoin to digging up something like gold.\nUnlike gold, however, Bitcoin isn’t a naturally limited resource. One could theoretically design a cryptocurrency that allows someone to earn as much as they want as long as they have the hardware to back it up. But that would devalue each unit (or “coin” for most cryptocurrencies). Instead, Bitcoin was designed in a way that ensures the creation of new coins is stable over the long term. As more Bitcoin is created, each individual Bitcoin gets harder to mine. Weighing The Costs Of A Mining Rig\nThis increasing complexity makes it harder for general hardware, like an off-the-shelf CPU or GPU, to mine Bitcoin. The days of being able to mine Bitcoin while your system would otherwise be idle are pretty much over; you’re not going to make any real money that way. Instead, dedicated Bitcoin miners have to create “mining rigs” devoted specifically to Bitcoin mining.\nEach mining rig is the result of basic cost-benefit analysis. You have to think about how much the system will cost to assemble, how much it will add to your power bills, and how much you expect to make in real-world money before you actually build the thing. (We explained that process as it relates to Ethereum, another popular cryptocurrency, here .) It doesn’t make sense to spend an exorbitant amount of money up front, and monthly, on a rig that makes a pittance each month.\nCombine the need to pay for parts and power with the increasing complexity involved with mining Bitcoin, and you have a situation where CPUs and GPUs have been effectively pushed out of the mining game. To answer the question in the headline: You can, technically, mine Bitcoin with your PC. The problem is that doing so would be like trying to mine gold with a soup ladle while other people are out there with heavy equipment and teams of workers who all specialize in mining.

You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

Gox was the biggest Bitcoin exchange platform around the globe and was known to have been handling over 70% of the Bitcoin transactions in the world. But the exchange platform had to declare bankruptcy in the year of 2014 after they lost 7% of Bitcoin worth up to $474 million.\nLast month Mt.Gox had moved 16000 BTC from their cold storage. The Mt. Gox’s account had moved 2000 BTC eight times to several accounts and just a few hours ago, it happened again.\nThis time almost 8214 BTC has been moved from the cold storage account to an unidentified wallet.

But before that happens, he believes ethereum will take bitcoin’s crypto-crown. Ver, once known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” told The Independent that so-called technologically superior cryptocurrencies like ethereum and bitcoin cash will surpass bitcoin in value in the coming months and years. Ver sees ethereum surpassing bitcoin by year’s end and bitcoin cash by 2020. Analysts refer to this supposed development as “The Flippening.” Ver pointed to slow transaction times and high fees undermining bitcoin. He noted that more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies have entered the market since bitcoin’s 2009 inception in attempts to overcome bitcoin’s “limitations.” Bitcoin’s rise in value in the last year has carried other cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash outpacing bitcoin. ETH And BCH Outpace Bitcoin Rogver Ver was once known as “Bitcoin Jesus.” Now, he has thrown his weight behind bitcoin cash, which he believes better represents Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision for cryptocurrency. | Source: YouTube\nBitcoin’s price has jumped 450% from $1,700 to $9,360 in the past 12 months, while Ethereum has gained 1,000% (to $764) and Bitcoin Cash moved from $500 in August to $1,655. Ethereum has five times as many units in circulation as bitcoin, making its market cap slightly less than half of bitcoin’s. Ver stated in January that BCH will continue in its steady growth and surpass BTC in the near future. “BCH is the same version of bitcoin that everyone fell in love with and used from 2009 until 2017,” he said. “It has the same economic code that led to it becoming a worldwide phenomenon. I’m sure that formula will continue to work for BCH into the future, and it will surpass BTC in usage, popularity, and market cap in the near future.” Uncertainties Remain Not all cryptocurrency experts agree with Ver. Michael Jackson, Skype’s former COO now working at Mangrove Capital Partners, said bitcoin can overcome its shortcomings and thereby offset other cryptocurrencies’ benefits. Jackson said solutions are being sought for bitcoin’s scalability issues. He further noted that bitcoin is by far the best-known cryptocurrency and the reserve cryptocurrency. Ver acknowledged that bitcoin could remain the top cryptocurrency, but he doesn’t think it is likely. He said bitcoin cash’s utility could drive its price to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While this is not guaranteed, bitcoin cash has more than doubled in the past month, and the interest of big investors could cause its value to double by next week, Ver said. In the short term, though, the entire market has suffered a setback, with both ethereum and bitcion cash taking bigger hits than bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market has declined by more than $50 billion over the past 24 hours, as the bitcoin price declined by more than 8 percent and other major cryptocurrencies along with tokens experienced an intensified movement on the downside.

According to Alejandro de la Torre, Vice President of Business Operations of BTC.com, is Huawei BTC.com’s Bitcoin Wallet, to integrate in the Huawei App Gallery.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Huawei plans to the Chinese market to target, where the Shenzhen-based company is also the largest Smartphone manufacturer. The Nation, in the 1.379 billion people live, has always shown great interest in crypto-currencies. It has been reported that China has one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency farms. Also BTC.com once had its own Bitcoin-farms in China, had to this shift, however, because of electricity restrictions in the state, according to the Overseas.\nWith the Chinese Google Play Store from the Chinese government and some Parts of Apple’s iTunes, the Huawei App Gallery will get, therefore, with the Bitcoin Wallet of BTC.com just a little competition. Although the Chinese government has banned the Operation of all crypto trading platforms and ICOs, is it for Chinese nationals still legal to own digital currencies.\nIn a telephone interview, de la Torre also agrees that the introduction of the Wallet is winning btc.com in China massively.\n“It is a great opportunity to develop the Chinese market. The use of cashless payment with the Apps is very large and the traditional banking system. So there is a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.“ Concerns about state repression\nThis news may sound encouraging, it is still unclear how the Chinese government will react. Finally, the Xi-Li Administration has an infamous history when it comes to crypto-currency related operations.\nAt the beginning of this year, the Chinese government to ban all enterprises in the country trade with crypto currencies. This was one of the reasons why crypto has some value currencies lost.\nAlready in September of 2017, China has adopted a wide repression of crypto-currency exchanges, which forced the majority of traders to transfer their funds to Offshore platforms, to be able to continue to act.\nCurrently there is still no reaction from the Chinese government to the announcement by Huawei.

My take is they are both. A house is first and foremost a place to live. In buying one, you are also indicating this is an asset in your portfolio and you do expect the value of that asset to appreciate over time. Otherwise, if there is no intention to gain a higher profit from owning the home over time – you probably shouldn’t buy one . There might be better things to do with your money. So, in saying that, profits from home ownership may or may not happen due to your operating costs, borrowing costs and capital outlays to maintain the home over your period of ownership.\nInteresting interview with Warren Buffett about bitcoin here: Warren Buffett on bitcoin: “You can have anything you want to imagine if you look at something and say ‘that’s magic’… they did it with tulips in the 17th century” pic.twitter.com/nAZOkL990Q", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.co/nAZOkL990Q", "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/video-carrick-talks-money-are-houses-an-investment-or-a-consumer-good/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark rob carrick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "fort lauderdale", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T22:55:19.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4822ebe3f316887a02002c49796a0508918a8ddd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRTJaJxS4ehrlvc3xbWelrY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why do some government ban bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why do some government ban bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-11T22:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4822ebe3f316887a02002c49796a0508918a8ddd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRTJaJxS4ehrlvc3xbWelrY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "zhopas", "published": "2018-05-11T22:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why do some government ban bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: johnatunum on November 27, 2017, 10:23:59 PM They ban it because they can't control it.

As every great product is often susceptible to duplicates and malicious copycats, however, Electrum was on the receiving end this time.\nElectrum Pro, a malware wallet that stole both Electrum's name and the user's bitcoins , recently gained popularity as a legitimate product. However, the fame obviously alarmed developers of the original wallet about Pro's authenticity, leading them to investigate the product's code. Their suspicions were later confirmed to be true, with Electrum's team promptly releasing their findings to the public.\nWe now have proof that \"Electrum Pro\" is bitcoin-stealing malware. The sha256sum of https://t.co/cCVFExIrNy is f497d2681dc00a7470fef7bcef8228964a2412889cd70b098cb8985aa1573e99. This hash can be confirmed independently using https://t.co/5RT3AeyjXp .\n— Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) May 8, 2018\nPosted on their website on May 9, 2018, with a link to their GitHub page , Electrum's developer team released specifics of the malicious code and published a detailed DIY document that encouraged users to confirm the misdoings for themselves.\nAccording to the GitHub post, the malicious code is seen in the lines 223-248 in electrumpro_keystore.py, after which the Pro wallet appears to steal the user's wallet seed keys and uploads them to the hacker's servers.\nAdding to this, the developers reveal that their investigation has only been done on Pro's \"electrum pro-4.0.2.dmg\" macOS binary and \"ElectrumPro-4.0.2-Standalone.zip\" Windows binary, but warned that \"is safe to assume that the other Windows binaries are malicious as well.\"\nAs it stands, in order to trap unsuspecting users, the treacherous team behind Electrum Pro hosted the duping wallet on electrum.com, which easily misled users from the official electrum.org website.\nAn integral and sensitive part of a bitcoin wallet, seed keys are cryptographic trees that store human-readable words into an algorithmically-converted root private key. By gaining access to the seed keys, anyone can be capable of draining a user's bitcoin wallet.\nElectrum No Stranger to Such Frauds In the past, scammers have conducted similar attacks to dupe Electrum users, by registering similar-looking domains and providing a similar interface. However, this is by far the most significant instance of a phishing effort, with the malicious product closely replicating the original one.\nUnless a user was conversant enough with the original website, Pro's interface comes close to Electrum's, with the site claiming to be a \" fork \" of the latter.\nInterestingly, the fraudulent Electrum Pro was reportedly \"higher-rated\" on Google's PlayStore, appearing above the original Electrum in a \"bitcoin wallet\" app search. Upon conducting a Google web search, BTCManager found out similar results. However, Electrum Pro has seemingly exited after its fraud coming to light and doesn't appear in search results as on the time of writing.\n( Source : Google )\nElectrum's developers claim that only users of the Windows and OS X versions of Electrum Pro are affected, while the Linux version appears to be clean. To ensure such problems do not appear in the future, Electrum is working towards gaining a \"verified\" status on the Windows Store, with an official app on Mac Store soon to follow.\nAs a suggestion, BTCManager appeals to its readers to check their versions of Electrum, and immediately shift their bitcoins in case of a fallacy.\nThe post Popular Bitcoin Wallet Electrum Confirms Malicious Copycat Product appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "electrum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "electrum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T22:15:50.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4dbcd68483862efbf0801379b89c09b315b5c3b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZHqMtqmRnQ0p13E4ZH8ptI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=238.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bounties (Altcoins)", "title": "🔴[NEED TRANSLATORS] MONETO - 🔴WE ISSUE INSTANT LOANS SECURED BY BITCOINS​ 🔴", "title_full": "🔴[NEED TRANSLATORS] MONETO - 🔴WE ISSUE INSTANT LOANS SECURED BY BITCOINS​ 🔴", "published": "2018-05-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4dbcd68483862efbf0801379b89c09b315b5c3b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZHqMtqmRnQ0p13E4ZH8ptI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hexah", "published": "2018-05-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "🔴[NEED TRANSLATORS] MONETO - 🔴WE ISSUE INSTANT LOANS SECURED BY BITCOINS​ 🔴", "text": "BITCOINTALK THREAD | WEBSITE | TWITTER | MEDIUM | TELEGRAM | WHITE PAPER | WHO ARE WE?\nMoneto project is a service for provisions of loans in the dominated currency of bitcoins.\nBitcoin owners can easily get money with the help of MONETO , without selling their cryptoassets.\nThe Bounty Pool will be divided As Follows:\nSignature: 30%\nCreative Campaign & Articles Campaign: 20%\nTranslation: 10%\nReddit: 10%\nTelegram: 5%\nTwitter: 15%\nFacebook: 10%\nBounty Program starts on 7/3 runs through ICO period, and ends on ICO closure.

This is big news for enthusiasts who want to chat all things crypto, but some experts also believe it could be grounds for a Bitcoin price surge. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency sank below the $10,000 mark early in March and hasn’t been able to mount a comeback since. As of 2:50 p.m. Eastern, the token is valued at $8,601 down from a high of $9,022 it saw earlier on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. But Robert Sluymer, the managing director and technical strategist at investment research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC that Bitcoin’s price has spiked every year following Blockchain Week, which could give it the boost it needs to reach highs of $10,000. “The regulatory risk, the fundamental risk around what’s happening with cryptos, has hit a bottom and now we’re in a state of general recovery,” he said. “[It] continues higher from here.” Bitcoin seven-day price performance.

Sign up for our newsletter: sign up Blockchain week was started in 2015 and has since brought together the industry’s biggest players to discuss the future of the decentralized technology. This is the first time it will be hosted in New York City and it is expected to attract about 8,000 attendees, many of which have influence in the cryptocurrency world. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey , who was quoted saying Bitcoin will overthrow the dollar, is expected to make an appearance. Aside from discussion, there is a hackathon and blockchain job fair scheduled. Sluymer explained that Bitcoin saw a sizable boost in value directly after this event. In 2015 it saw 23 percent growth and the following year it inched up 10 percent. “Not a huge amount considering how volatile cryptos are,” he said regarding the 2015 valuation. “But then it moved up around year-end for about another 100 percent move.” @Voisecom will be attending this years @etherealsummit May 11 & 12 in New York City. #Music #Blockchain #Ethereum pic.twitter.com/uSEoeKlREc — Voise Inc. (not giving away eth) (@voisecom) May 10, 2018 Bitcoin Price Predictions: What Comes After Blockchain Week? Bitcoin has been on a bit of a slump recently. But other experts are predicting an enormous rally within the next two years. But as the market has settled below five digits, it seems increasingly unlikely that it will see price spikes like those in late 2017. National governments and financial institutions have taken steps to try and make cryptocurrencies less volatile through regulations, which could make for more stable prices. This year’s Blockchain Week might not cause bitcoin prices to surge to the heights of $19,000, but it could serve as a stepping stone to get past the $10,000 mark that has been seen to be evermore allusive.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.co/uSEoeKlREc", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Blockchain?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/voisecom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Music?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/11/bitcoin-could-soar-after-blockchain-week-new-york-crypto-analyst-says.html", "https://twitter.com/voisecom/status/994686644769865728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/EtherealSummit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "comic-con", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "says analyst filed under blockchain & cryptocurrency t", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T23:24:07.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b04640855d26c3af7e75469e6929afe24c2ad953", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXNFb_WFjjejPYk5yS0LNEs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Who is the first bitcoin billionaire?", "title_full": "Who is the first bitcoin billionaire?", "published": "2018-05-11T22:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b04640855d26c3af7e75469e6929afe24c2ad953", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXNFb_WFjjejPYk5yS0LNEs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hobo66", "published": "2018-05-11T22:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Who is the first bitcoin billionaire?", "text": "I would say the founder of bitcoin will be the first bitcoin billionaire\nobviously, why would he not be holding a few bitcoin from himself?,\nhe is anonymous as how the bitcoin blockchain works no trace of real identity.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T20:35:17.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c4836b4d94068ade819efc4de529dc2c569f008", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSa88_wXt1DNlObJfvGBFmPdJbo_Y_DyoQg6JjvmlgfD4USPdvpj9o29762mdn0uQpQ--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "‘Flippening’ Between Bitcoin & Ethereum Will Happen in 2018: Roger Ver", "title_full": "‘Flippening’ Between Bitcoin & Ethereum Will Happen in 2018: Roger Ver", "published": "2018-05-11T22:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c4836b4d94068ade819efc4de529dc2c569f008", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSa88_wXt1DNlObJfvGBFmPdJbo_Y_DyoQg6JjvmlgfD4USPdvpj9o29762mdn0uQpQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T22:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘Flippening’ Between Bitcoin & Ethereum Will Happen in 2018: Roger Ver", "text": "'Flippening' Between Bitcoin & Ethereum Will Happen in 2018: Roger Ver\nLester Coleman\nBitcoin cash promoter Roger Ver believes BCH will one day overtake BTC to become the world's most valuable cryptocurrency.

The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

Lee is also the only analyst on Wall Street to offer a target price for the digital currency.\nThose who already have bitcoin investment will surely benefit from that positive announcement. It will at least calm their mind and stop worrying about the current drop. But, if you look at the scenario, it may cut down buyers. Bitcoin had been in an up and down position ever since, and that property allows investor to trade and profit periodically.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T12:06:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56ea1aa0603144ecc4e48c31d323ed002afb5d44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeLLcwoC9YJBotzOFIar5xw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can we say that bitcoin can last forever?", "title_full": "Can we say that bitcoin can last forever?", "published": "2018-05-11T22:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.08, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56ea1aa0603144ecc4e48c31d323ed002afb5d44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeLLcwoC9YJBotzOFIar5xw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "miw1991", "published": "2018-05-11T22:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can we say that bitcoin can last forever?", "text": "Bitcoin is the beginning of the digital age, thanks to its beginning, many people have discovered an additional source of income.
