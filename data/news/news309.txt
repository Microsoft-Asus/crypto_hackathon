Cryptocurrencies themselves are just one application of a more fundamental technology called blockchain . Blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, and distributed public ledger. Before reviewing how it works, it is important to clarify two concepts: “ledger” and “public.”\nEvery ledger provides a complete record of transactions over a determined cycle or even over the lifetime of an entity, whether it is a company, a group or a network. Blockchain’s ledger being public means that it must be visible to all at any time with no limitations – whereby “all” means every single person.\nHow does blockchain work? It arranges new information – for example, a new transaction – adding it to the public ledger as a completed block. Such blocks are recorded and added to the ledger in chronological order. However, the added block must first be validated by a majority of a distributed system of nodes – computers connected to the network. Validation means that individual nodes add the block to their versions of the ledger. The public ledger, therefore, exists in multiple versions of itself distributed through nodes. When an absolute majority of them agree to an identical form, a transaction is completed. This is also called nodal majoritarianism. Principles of governance\nOn March 8, 2017, the monthly Harvard Business Review published an article titled “The Blockchain Will Do to the Financial System What the Internet did to Media.” On April 11, 2016, the service International Banker claimed in a featured article that “Bitcoin could disrupt the ability of central banks to exert control over the economy.” Do such – probably overstated – concerns point at something substantial in the governance structure that blockchain offers? The answer lies in the differences between systems of governance underlying most current structures, and blockchain.\nThe advantage of these principles is that they promote efficiency and allow for planning\nContemporary structures of governance – for example, monetary policy , corporate hierarchies, the organization of chains of supply and value creation, even political institutions – rely on sets of principles. These are centralization, hierarchy, monopoly (each activity is performed by one unit; one unit is the owner of a process), the division of labor, trust in administration and isonomy (equality of units on the same level of the hierarchy). The advantage of these principles is that they promote efficiency and allow for planning. The central unit can plan and enforce its plan through the hierarchy. On the other hand, the structure becomes dependent on central planning, monopolies and administrative control.\nBlockchain relies on different principles. It is a decentralized (distributed) mechanism of governance, functional rather than hierarchical, and it is conceived as a polypoly (any agent can supply or demand at any time; a multiplicity of agents must perform the same activity parallel to each other). In addition, blockchain combines elements of cooperation and competition, often simultaneously. For example, nodes must cooperate in order for a transaction to be added to the ledger. On the other hand, they compete on how quickly they validate transactions because only the first mover is rewarded by the system. Finally, since the verification of transactions occurs across the entire network, its guiding principle of governance is nodal majoritarianism.\nThere is yet another sharp contrast. Contemporary structures of governance tend to allow for or even privilege privacy. This applies not only to the privacy of users but especially to the privacy of the central, monopolistic decision-maker. Blockchain, on the other hand, might tolerate pseudonymous users. Nevertheless, as a distributed list (public ledger), it is committed to total transparency of transactions and nodes. Blockchain uses\nThe principles of governance explained above are not necessarily in strict opposition to each other. However, more often than not, they are contradictory at least in practice. Even if blockchain does not displace the logic of centralism and division of labor, it can complement it in several ways with its decentralized (distributed), cooperative and competitive model.\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney is among the most vocal critics of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and calls for them to be held “to the same standards as the rest of the financial system” (source: dpa)\nExamples of different applications of blockchain include medical records, insurance, shareholding structures and accounting. In fact, any type of bureaucratic organization – whether polities, supply or value-creation chains, or smart contracts executed by computerized protocols – can benefit from their use. After all, data embedded and hashed into secure blockchains become immutable and inerasable. The technology can be applied to identity verification and in cloud storage. In the future, it could even be used to draft legislation and organize voting.\nIn cybersecurity especially, blockchain offers remedies. A database, for example, will always be exposed to the risk of data loss, hacking, malware, spyware, etc. If the database is centrally organized by a monopolistic unit, i.e. if the central database is unique, no matter how many firewalls are installed to safeguard it, it will be more vulnerable than a distributed system. If the same database is managed by nodal majoritarianism, it will be replicated many times and the risks mentioned above would only materialize if more than a half of all the nodes fall prey to them.\nWill companies and state agents incorporate blockchain, or resist it?\nBlockchain allows algorithms to perform extremely detailed tasks that do not add value to the chain of activities in which they are embedded. This is analogous to the medical profession, whose value consists in treating the patient, not keeping the record of his or her history. Similarly, the use of a database and not its protection adds value. Thus, blockchain reduces deadweight and therefore costs. It sets capacities free for other, even more, novel developments. Questions and conclusion\nThese innovations will take time to influence society. The processes of exchange should be vetted before incorporating the new technology. In the meanwhile, many questions remain open about the principles of governance laid out by blockchain. What is, for example, the role of nodes – gatekeepers, superpowers, oligopolies? If blockchain is disruptive, who will be interested in its adoption and application to nonmonetary transactions? Does blockchain need a particular “ecosystem” to succeed?\nOther types of questions revolve around how society responds to blockchain. How will regulators react ? How will special interest groups advance their particularistic agendas? Will companies and state agents incorporate blockchain, or resist it? Will they be attracted or repelled by the overarching transparency requirement? How will centralized hierarchies adapt to functional decentralization and nodal majoritarianism?\nBlockchain could revolutionize governance. It shows that a distributed system of verification can replace a centralized system of trust, at least regarding some aspects of bureaucratic management. This will probably be its most important contribution in the long term. A decentralized system of governance promises to create, through competition and cooperation, an environment in which different agents will be empowered and incentivized to become more productive.\nMany questions remain about the details, however. The historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. might have framed it correctly – before the advent of blockchain: “Science and technology revolutionize our lives, but memory, tradition and myth frame our response.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:58:23.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35af3959e3bad52fa62072b81675c45c6538b011", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1CTecnjDe8R8y_TcgZ7vDwigTUk2AYal0iskquHKlWIXcb1CZFom772MGa67qSsw4TAVh0I8jJ0MKYmtQnS0f3Q--", "site_full": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Slips Below $9000 Following Korean Exchange Raid – 1 Bitcoin daily", "title_full": "Bitcoin Slips Below $9000 Following Korean Exchange Raid – 1 Bitcoin daily", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.279, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35af3959e3bad52fa62072b81675c45c6538b011", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1CTecnjDe8R8y_TcgZ7vDwigTUk2AYal0iskquHKlWIXcb1CZFom772MGa67qSsw4TAVh0I8jJ0MKYmtQnS0f3Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "View All Posts", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Slips Below $9000 Following Korean Exchange Raid – 1 Bitcoin daily", "text": "1 Bitcoin daily Bitcoin Slips Below $9000 Following Korean Exchange Raid Bitcoin was on course to eke out two weeks in a row above the $9,000 mark, until now.

Cardano (ADAUSD) Technical Analysis Cardano Weekly Chart by Trading View\nEven though we are seeing bearish moves when we take a top down approach, traders should be content with the fact that prices are still trending inside week ending April 30 candlestick. Remember, that candlestick was bullish and their high low at 38 cents and 25 cents shall be our immediate resistance and support. Because of this technical formation, it is likely that prices might sync and rebound back to bullish ways.\nHowever, that is subject to how ADA bulls behave by end of this week. In that case, looking for under-valuations in lower time frames and waiting for proper bull triggers whenever higher highs prints can be a good trading strategy. Going forward, conservative buy entries should be at week ending May 7 at 40 cents. There, if buyers manage to push above 40 cents then it would mean prices would be oscillating above the middle BB and edging towards the ideal $1 ADA valuation many desire. 4HR Chart Cardano 4HR Chart by Trading View\nIt this time frame it is clear that ADA sellers are in charge. In fact, the thing is, they have been successful in pushing prices down in the last 24 hours. ADA is down five percent in the last 24 hours and approaching this week’s support at 30 cents.\nAdvised by developments in the weekly chart, our trading strategy is simple: search for buy opportunities in lower time frames. Now, notice that visible long lower wick clear in the weekly chart? Those are bullish signals meaning buyers might be loading up at around these prices.\nNow, our immediate resistance line in our entry chart is this middle BB and any spike above 35 cents should beckon buyers to jump in right away with stops at 30 cents. If not, then bears might continue with their relentless push and week over week erosion towards 25 cents. So, if today end up bearish, then sell and trade with the prevailing trend.

With just days left there are a few things BCH holders and full node operators should know before the upgrade takes place this coming Tuesday.\nAlso read: Japan’s GMO Has Mined Over 900 Bitcoins – Hashrate Doubled Last Month Just a Few Days Left Until the May 15th Bitcoin Cash Upgrade\nThe Bitcoin Cash network is about to perform the largest block size increase ever as the upgrade will expand the block size by 4X on May 15, 2018. The development team has also added ‘Satoshi OP_Codes,’ and the fork will also increase the protocol’s default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes. Unless you run a BCH full node implementation there is not much a common user needs to do, except refrain from transacting during the upgrade. The Hard Fork Activation Will Use the Median Time Past Method\nThe BCH fork on May 15 will be similar to the fork activations that took place on August 1, and the DAA fork that took place this past November. This means the activation will take place on May 15, but there won’t be specific block height, because the upgrade will activate based on ‘Median Time Past’ (MTP). The initiation of the hard fork will begin on Tuesday, May 15 at 12:00:00 UTC, 2018, but the upgrade will not be implemented until the MTP timestamp and the processing of 11 blocks equal to or greater than 1,526,400,000 takes place. Following this period after the next block, the 32MB upgrade will be live on the BCH network. Full Node Clients and Miners Must Update Software\nFull node operators need to upgrade their Bitcoin Cash clients as soon as possible, before the fork begins. ABC users can download the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version here , and those operating other full nodes like Bitcoin Unlimited, or XT should upgrade to the client that supports the 32MB increase. At the moment looking at data for the most dominant BCH client, Bitcoin ABC, it shows a great majority of nodes have already upgraded to the latest 0.17.1 ABC version. Full node operators and miners are required to upgrade their software in order to participate during and after the network change. Ordinary Users Should Refrain from Transacting With BCH During the Upgrade and Patiently Wait for the Fork to Complete It is best not to transact with BCH during the May 15th Bitcoin Cash upgrade.\nOrdinary users don’t have to do much of anything, except keep up to date with current events concerning the fork, and its best not to transact during the activation period as well. This means if you don’t have to send money on May 15, then wait until the fork is complete before transacting with BCH. It’s always a good measure to look out for any updates provided by your exchange or wallet provider to make sure the platform you use is ready to accept the network changes. If your BCH service provider does not give any fork updates, it’s probably safe to assume that the exchange or wallet provider is ready for the upgrade. So on May 15 if your money is on an exchange or held within a non-custodial wallet all you really have to do is patiently wait until the fork is finished. Last November’s Successful Hard Fork Shows There Shouldn’t be Any Complications\nThe May 15th Bitcoin Cash fork that will change the protocol’s base block size to 32 MB, while adding some other interesting features will be quite a milestone for the BCH community. The last fork that took place this November was successful , and the new Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) has worked flawlessly ever since. The 32MB increase will be much larger than the already sizable 8MB blocks, and the upgrade will likely be a historic day for public blockchain consensus upgrades.\nWhat do you think about the fork taking place on May 15 that will increase the base block size to 32 MB? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments below.\nImages via Shutterstock, and Pixabay.\nDo you agree with us that Bitcoin is the best invention since sliced bread? Thought so.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH), for instance, is in the red zone. But the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) team has too much going on next week to worry about this, specifically; the Bitcoin Cash network upgrade. Bitcoin Cash Network Upgrade\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network is set to upgrade the base block size in less than a week. On Tuesday, May 15, the BCH network will upgrade the base block size to 32MB. For perspective, the original size was 8MB. This means the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network will be increasing the size by 4X. Considering this is the largest block size expansion the crypto world has seen, there are a few things to note before we move into the weekend. This way you can prepare on Saturday and Sunday for what is to come on Tuesday. \"In less than a week on May 15, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network will be upgrading the base block size from 8MB to 32MB, as well as re-enabling and adding some OP_Codes to the codebase.\" https://t.co/JYdeGpMYuT\n— Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) May 11, 2018 Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\nDespite the importance of the upgrade, and the need to prepare for the week to come, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is in the red today. As is the rest of the market, though. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently selling for $1,417.78. This puts BCH down 13.45% in the past twenty-four hours. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has a market capitalization of $24.28 billion, making it the fourth largest virtual currency. Source: CoinMarketCap Things to Know About the Bitcoin Cash Network Upgrade\nWith only a few days left before the upgrade, we don’t want anything to surprise you when it finally does roll around. Here are four things the crypto community should note about the forthcoming BCH network upgrade.\n1. The BCH network upgrade will be based on the median time past method. This means there will not be a specific block height. The BCH fork will have similar characteristics to the fork activations that happened in August.\n2. Before the BCH fork can begin, both full node clients and miners are required to upgrade their software.\n3. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) team has included “Satoshi OP_Codes.”\n4. The BCH fork will expand the default data-carrier-size of the protocol to 220 bytes.\n>>EOS Token Swap: Register Your EOS Coins Before They’re Frozen Forever What is the Crypto Community Saying?\nSo, is the crypto community looking forward to the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network upgrade? On Twitter, the community is fairly quiet, but a few people have decided to use their platform to share the news. Here’s one tweet that appears to be in BCH’s favor:\n— Jean Woodruff (@daitoukesb) May 11, 2018 The Takeaway\nWhat do you think of the BCH network upgrade?

But what about SA? Sentiment analysis, which involves making decisions based on the emotions of other traders, is arguably just as important, especially in the cryptocurrency market, where a herd mentality prevails.\nAlso read: South Korea’s Largest Crypto Exchange Upbit Under Investigation for Fraud Other People’s Feelings Matter\n“Don’t trade on your emotions” is one of the first rules a trader learns, because making yourself a hostage of FOMO, and all the feelings that come with it – remorse; euphoria; despondency – is a recipe for disaster. But what about trading on the emotions of others? You might be a mechanistic trading automaton, with your unbridled emotions kept in check, but the rest of the market is not, and it’s their decisions – no matter how irrational – that move markets, not yours.\nAs an example of sentiment analysis, consider the periodic bitcoin movements of the Mt Gox trustee. Every time he sends a tranche of coins to a different address, BTC dumps. Technically, this occurs because people are anticipating that when he offloads 8,000 BTC onto the open market it will cause a flash crash. And yet the trustee has provided reassurances that he is not selling his coins in such a manner, yet BTC still drops the moment he moves coins. The only interpretation is that traders are anticipating other traders dumping BTC on the news and are clamoring to sell first. Even if you have faith in the trustee’s intentions, simple sentiment analysis tells you to sell. There’s a Fine Line Between TA, FA, and SA\nTechnical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis are disciplines which intersect. Even if you’ve not been overtly factoring SA into your trading, it will have influenced your decisions. For example, a number of cryptocurrency traders have little love for Tron (TRX) which they deem to be a shitcoin. That doesn’t stop them from speculatively buying it though any time it’s dropped to a previous support level. Why? Because they know it’s almost certain to pump again for reasons that cannot be rationally explained using TA or FA. The same applies to other “penny cryptos” like verge.\nSentiment analysis is basically a self-fulfilling prophecy: that if enough traders believe in X, then X comes to be true. For example, do coins pump by 100% when they are listed on Binance because of the increased liquidity and wider investor access this brings? Or do they pump because everyone expects them to pump, and so everyone panic buys in a race to the top? Then there are coins like IOTA, which has a tendency to rise in price every time someone publishes negative news about it, which is a frequent phenomenon. One interpretation of IOTA’s immunity to “FUD” is that its community stubbornly buys up more of it during times of crisis as a gesture of defiance. Tools for Measuring Sentiment Analysis\nYou won’t find an SA overlay in Tradingview, but there are tools that provide a crude reckoner of overall market sentiment at a given point in time. One example is the Fear & Greed Index that charts emotions and sentiments from a range of aggregated sources. Right now, we’re in “fear”, but that’s still an improvement on last month’s “extreme fear”. Crypto Sentiment provides a more comprehensive set of SA tools including an index of strategic bias and an overconfidence index that “reflects the risk that investors might take to risky positions based on the behavior of the bitcoin price”.\nWhen trying to time their entry and exit points, good traders already factor in sentiment analysis. They might not explicitly refer to it by name, but they know it when they see it. For all the automated tools, bots, and indicators that have been developed over the years, markets remain deeply irrational and hostage to human emotion. Many traders are predicting a strong bitcoin and altcoin bounce in the wake of next week’s Consensus summit. Why? Because that’s what happened last year. It doesn’t matter if last year’s bull run was a coincidence: all that matters is that if enough investors expect the same to occur this year, it will occur. Once a belief takes root, feelings trump technicals every time.\nDo you think sentiment analysis is a useful trading tool?

C2 is an international community that intends to bolster open standard development in order to provide long-term Bitcoin Cash growth.\nAlso read: Upgrade Time: Bitcoin Cash 32MB Fork Activates Tuesday Contents 4 Cardona Believes the Opportunity to Move Quick and be Proactive is Now The Cash Consortium: Open Standards for Bitcoin Cash\nMuch of the cryptocurrency community understands what open source or open standard development is, and most of them embrace the idea. Furthermore, organizations like the W3C and other believers of open standards welcome the sharing of open sourced code that allows anyone the rights to study, change, and distribute OSS protocol for any purpose. Open standards also allows other developers to review a protocol’s design in order to prevent flaws and bugs within the software by coming up with sets of development standards that everyone agrees to and uses. The Cash Consortium will have engineers from leading companies to work together to build Bitcoin Cash (BCH) development standards much like how developers build on the open web with shared concepts like HTML.\n“The C2’s mission is to lead Bitcoin Cash to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the blockchain,” explains the C2 website.\nBitcoin Cash is the soundest money the world has ever known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability and transferability. It’s our intention that it remain the soundest money the world has ever known — Bitcoin Cash enables smart contracts/property, colored coins, tokens, ICOs and much more. We intend to standardize these emerging technologies in a way that plays to Bitcoin Cash’s strengths. A Formal Bitcoin Standards Body\nAt the moment organizations that are listed as members of C2 include Cointext , Atlantis Labs, Akari Global Foundation, the Bitcoin Cash Fund , Bitbox, Blockpress , Centbee, and the social network Yours . Last night news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the creator of the Cash Consortium, Carlos Cardona , who is also the lead developer of Bitbox , the open source development toolkit for Bitcoin Cash. Cardona tells us he is a firm believer in open standards and explains why he initiated the C2 organization.\n“When I was in college I was a member of the W3C’s HTML5 Working Group. There were engineers from Apple, Google (who I was with), Microsoft, Firefox and many more meeting up regularly in working groups to flesh out the next generation of technical specs for the web (HTML/CSS etc),” Cardona tells news.Bitcoin.com . “When the spec was nearing completion the teams would each implement it. Some open source like Firefox. Some closed source like Internet Explorer. But both implementing technical specs which were created together.”\nWhen I joined the blockchain space several years ago it surprised me that there was no formal Bitcoin standards body. The Cash Consortium will affirm and adhere to the Principles in support of The Modern Paradigm for Standards—cooperation, due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness. Huge Forces at Play Are About to Phase the Blockchain Industry\nThen Cardona says he started thinking about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash upgrade that will not only increase the block size by 4X but the fork will also add Satoshi OP_Codes that can enable the ability to create color coins and smart contract features on the BCH network.\n“With the new OP_Codes coming I had recently been thinking again about how to best standardize on new transaction types and then Memo/Blockpress happened,” Cardona emphasizes. “Having recently updated Bitbox’s block explorer to support both Memo and Blockpress I was struck with the same feeling I had during IE6/FF days — writing code twice with slightly different APIs because there was no standard. With OP_RETURN going from 80 bytes to 220 bytes we’re just seeing the start of OP_RETURN prefixed protocols — That got me thinking again about a standards body.”\nIn my opinion our industry spent many years fighting the Blockstream wars and became complacent — Things which I would expect in any other nearly decade old tech industry (such as a tech consortium) doesn’t exist in our space. The final part which caused me to move on it was when I found out Zuckerberg created a blockchain division last week. To me that is just a sign that HUGE forces are at play which are about to phase shift our entire industry. Cardona Believes the Opportunity to Move Quick and be Proactive is Now\nThe C2 website explains that if you work with a company that develops with Bitcoin Cash then they can feel free to fork this repo or reach out to Cardona to see how you can get involved.\n“I believe we have the opportunity to move quick, be proactive, build bridges and standardize or some much larger player will step in an do it for us,” Cardona adds.\nWhat do you think about the Cash Consortium (C2)? Do you think its a good idea for BCH developers to initiate open standards for protocol and application development? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments below.\nImages via Bitcoincash.org, Pixabay, The Cash Consortium, and Open Stand logos.\nGet our news feed on your site.

The company benefited in particular from strong demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Group has a clear USP within the industry thanks to Bitcoin.de, Germany's only regulated marketplace for digital currencies, which is operated by its wholly-owned subsidiary Bitcoin Deutschland AG. Demand for cryptocurrencies was reflected also in the high level of popularity of the innovative trading services offered by Bitcoin.de. The trading platform had 667,000 customers (currently over 745,000) at the end of December 2017 compared with just 356,000 in the previous year. With an average of 26,000 customers joining Bitcoin.de every month, the target of 480,000 customers by year-end was exceeded by some distance.\nIn an encouraging development, the growth in user numbers was accompanied by an equally dynamic upturn in the trading volume, which was well in excess of the forecast of EUR 1 billion at EUR 1.2 billion - for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin alone. Trading volume for the new cryptocurrencies Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum (ETH), which commenced trading in the third quarter of 2017, amounted to around EUR 250 million. The strong rise in the price of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the inclusion of further cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash proved to be beneficial. Based on the developments described above, Bitcoin Group SE generated record revenue of EUR 12,481 thousand in fiscal 2017 compared with EUR 1,044 thousand in the previous year. As a result, earnings before taxes jumped to EUR 10,888 thousand (previous year: EUR 208 thousand). Earnings after taxes multiplied to EUR 7,452 thousand (previous year: EUR 114 thousand).\n\"We are delighted by the dynamic business development in the past year. With sustained high customer interest and the continued expansion of the available infrastructure, the liquidity of cryptocurrencies will increase and prices will become less susceptible to fluctuation. The victory march of Bitcoin & Co. will be unstoppable. We are already making a fundamental contribution to this evolution with Bitcoin.de, offering our customers an innovative trading system with the very highest security standards and an interface with the traditional banking system. In the current fiscal year, we will continue to focus on permanently improving Bitcoin.de while expanding our market-leading position at the same time. We intend to pursue these objectives with passion and pleasure, just like we managed with great success in the past year,\" commented Michael Nowak, Managing Director of Bitcoin Group SE.\nBitcoin Group SE enjoys a strong statement of financial position. Total current assets increased by 1,594% year-on-year to EUR 49,027 thousand as of December 31, 2017 (previous year: EUR 2,893 thousand). This significant increase was achieved on the back of the higher number of bitcoins held by the company and the general rise in the Bitcoin price. Equity increased by EUR 32,107 thousand to EUR 38,190 thousand in the reporting period as a result of retained earnings (EUR 7,452 thousand) and other comprehensive income (EUR 24,659 thousand).\nOutlook for 2018\nFor the current 2018 financial year, the company expects further growth in the number of customers and sales. Assuming only moderate cost-side increases, the management is also anticipating a strong increase in earnings. Costs relate in particular to investments in research and development activities for the expansion of Bitcoin.de. In addition to the existing cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BCG) and Ethereum (ETH), a large number of other cryptocurrencies are to be included in trading on Bitcoin.de in the current fiscal year. The expansion focuses on Ripple, Litecoin, IOTA, DASH and Monero. The usability of the platform will also be improved continuously in 2018 and Bitcoin.de will receive a new, contemporary design. Based on these measures, the Group expects a further increase in the number of registered Bitcoin.de users to over 1 million by the end of 2018\nFurthermore, Bitcoin Group SE plans to acquire a majority stake in a regulated bank based in Germany in the current 2018 financial year. \"This would be a major milestone for the operation of a Bitcoin exchange and also the regulatory basis for the planned installation of the first Bitcoin ATMs in Germany.

But late on Thursday, the asset slid for a while below $9,000. Later, BTC regained positions to $9,002.70. Volumes remain low, mostly due to the outflow of Japanese investors. However, the $9,000 level proved hard to defend, and within hours, BTC sank back again to $8,765.28.\nThe drop has happened across the market, after a relatively successful week, showing that rapid shakedowns in prices are not out of the question.\nFor now, BTC volumes remain below the usual $7 billion in 24 hours. Trading against the Japanese Yen takes up to 43% of the market, and the share of the USD is 25%. But about 20% of BTC trades are against the Tether (USDT) asset, again showing the significant influence of the liquidity injection.\nBut this price movement is only seen as a temporary glitch by some. The predictions for Bitcoin remain extremely bullish, and one of the sources is the mining industry. At the moment, the Bitcoin network hashrate has stabilized around its recently achieved peak of 30,000,000 TH/s, and the building of new mining facilities continues.\nSome believe that the incentive to mine will keep Bitcoin alive, and even boost its price to reach mining breakeven levels.\nhttps://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/994566148007055361\nThe analysis of mining gives an optimistic, but also realistic price prediction, seeing BTC prices move between $20,000 and $60,000.\nAt the same time, altcoins have proven that they are capable of charting independent paths. The price dominance of Bitcoin shrank again to 36.6%, while altcoins grew in terms of market capitalization.\nSome altcoins, such as Decred (DCR) , Ethereum (ETH) and others have greeted the potential for ASIC mining. Based on the principle that “miners follow the money”, similar mining economies may form around the most prominent proof-of-work coins. × ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine masters", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:02:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24261eb25cb33db1848a4377084f40c96bf09a87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSR_TnVMwDU0cq18xbgp338H67rVMlWjSMWMUfIHKBOl_Td22d7MugGzZrYrf_qbmyUmKlXze08ALZvYDmxPo2S6PeLTLmNrom8winBhLUgkw--", "site_full": "thatscrazy.info", "site": "thatscrazy.info", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Downward Momentum Continues – Bitcoin dips below $7,000, Mt Gox – That’s Crazy", "title_full": "Downward Momentum Continues – Bitcoin dips below $7,000, Mt Gox – That’s Crazy", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thatscrazy.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/05qvhwnkd6q0h2aws-1526067545.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "24261eb25cb33db1848a4377084f40c96bf09a87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSR_TnVMwDU0cq18xbgp338H67rVMlWjSMWMUfIHKBOl_Td22d7MugGzZrYrf_qbmyUmKlXze08ALZvYDmxPo2S6PeLTLmNrom8winBhLUgkw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Downward Momentum Continues – Bitcoin dips below $7,000, Mt Gox – That’s Crazy", "text": "\nWorldopoly – Get Paid!\nDate: 2018-04-05 02:28:09\nSupport the stream: https://streamlabs.com/cryptobobby Join me for a Crypto Happy Hour, or as it has been lately, Crypto Sad Hour.

Although it is unclear where this sudden bearish pressure is coming from, the price is getting battered quite badly. Thanks to a 6% decline in the past few hours, the Bitcoin price has now dropped below $ 9,000 and is seemingly heading to $ 8,500 or potentially even lower. What is Happening to the Bitcoin Price?\nCryptocurrency is an industry which often makes no sense at all. Due to the speculative nature of all of these currencies, any price momentum can send the markets in either direction pretty quickly. Last year, we saw a lot of people placing buy orders at a higher Bitcoin price mainly because they were afraid of missing out on all of the action. This year, it is the exact opposite, with market makers pushing the Bitcoin price down fairly regularly.\nThis latest Bitcoin price dip comes in the form of another 6% decline. Even though the momentum looked fairly positive this morning, something has triggered a massive sell-off. The reason behind this unexpected momentum remains unclear to everyone, as there is no reason for the Bitcoin price to go through such rough patch at this stage. Global interest in Bitcoin has soared for several months now and the overall interest in the world’s leading cryptocurrency hasn’t diminished in the slightest.\nEven so, we are now looking at a Bitcoin price of $ 8,772. It seems unlikely this level will be maintained for the near future, as there is so much pressure to grind the Bitcoin price into the dirt. If this momentum is sustained, the upcoming value of Bitcoin may not even be above $ 8,000. That would be another big setback for the cryptocurrency users, although it won’t matter all that much to those who are in it for the long haul.\nOne thing keeping the Bitcoin price dream alive is how the trading volume isn’t diminishing over the past 24 hours. There is still over $ 7.39bn in 24-hour trades, which is on par with what we have seen for Bitcoin over the past few weeks. Despite the bears being in control of the market right now, it is possible this momentum will turn around sooner than people expect.\nAs of right now, Bitfinex is the largest exchange ranked by Bitcoin trading volume. OKEx is in second place, followed by Binance. All three platforms generate over $ 300n in volume as of right now, which looks pretty solid. Huobi and Bitstamp complete the top five, which brings the total number of fiat currency pairs to two. All three other pairs are USDT offerings, which seems to indicate there is still a lot of positive momentum for Bitcoin to contend with..\nFor the time being, one has to wait and see how the Bitcoin price evolves in the coming hours. If panic selling truly kicks in, a drop to $ 8,000 isn’t out of the question by any means. However, if a pushback can find stable ground, the Bitcoin price can easily reach $ 9,000 again before the day is over. A lot of people will be glued tot he price charts for some time to come, that much is certain. This upcoming weekend will also be quite interesting in terms of cryptocurrency trading.

As such, “it’s a bit of a strawman to say that bitcoin maximalists think there will only be one currency. The reason crypto is zero-sum is [because] money, in general, is zero-sum.”\nIn his analysis, global economies typically have one currency by which others are measured or held in reserve, whether it be gold or dollars. Rochard believes bitcoin is becoming that global store of value and transactional medium for the digital world, especially since other cryptocurrencies appear to be “heavily dependent” on it as a reserve currency.\nSo while other blockchain experts are launching multi-coin crypto hedge funds or freelancing as consultants for the tokenized fundraising projects known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), Rochard just launched Bitcoin Advisory LLC in Brooklyn, N.Y. – call it the maximalist consultancy.\nRochard wants to provide a variety of prospective investors with unadulterated insight into bitcoin.\nBut unlike with a traditional financial advisor or fund manager, clients are only paying for Rochard’s time. His advice, then, won’t be motivated by wanting people to invest through him or in anything offered exclusively by his company; to the contrary, he wants clients to walk away with the tools to manage their own investments.\n“I do want to also present the case against investing in bitcoin or at least being more cautious about its valuation or more rigorous about analyzing the risks of investing in bitcoin. I don’t want investors going all in on bitcoin,” Rochard said, adding:\n“I think that’s the worst possible thing they could do, even though that might not make me popular on Twitter. There needs to be a cautious portfolio approach to bitcoin.”\nIn fact, Rochard’s wife, a financial planner herself, insisted their “very boring” retirement funds exclude high-risk investments like bitcoin. Objectivity needed\nThis idea that people shouldn’t trust third parties and instead empower themselves fueled Rochard’s passion for starting Bitcoin Advisory LLC in the first place.\nAccording to him, the thwarted “ New York Agreement ,” in which a group of miners and businesses proposed ultimately unpopular changes to the bitcoin software, highlighted a dire need for independent advisors in this space. Since one aspect of the update was related to keeping transaction fees low for these corporate players, Rochard believes they had a vested interest to support the agreement, even though developers were worried about the effects of that change.\n“These CEOs are the main liaison between institutional investors,” Rochard said. “I want to unbundle the information from the financial product.”\nOf course, as a bitcoin maximalist Rochard isn’t completely objective.\nBut he may perhaps have less conflict of interest than a service provider that benefits from pushing users and investors to certain cryptocurrencies, for example.\nAt least, in his mind:\n“They [startup CEOs] are the ones providing views on the bitcoin ecosystem. As such, they have an effect on the way investors think about bitcoin. Their companies have an agenda with regards to bitcoin.”\nRochard said his fidelity belongs solely to bitcoin and related projects like the lightning network, the technology many bitcoin developers are working on which looks to push transactions off-chain so that bitcoin can scale to more users in time. Community building\nIn his new role, investors who want to run their own bitcoin nodes will find Rochard to be a particularly eager educator. And it’s definitely an area where expert advice could help, since running a full node can be one, quite the setup, and two, technically challenging,\nBut for Rochard, it’s a crucial activity in helping users to fully realize bitcoin’s potential, and ties into his engineering work (he’s created several tools to tally and organize access to new contributions to Bitcoin Core software on Github).\n“What I want to see from my own contributions to Bitcoin Core is to help accelerate the development of Bitcoin Core’s wallet,” he said.\nBecause the open-source wallet relies on Bitcoin Core nodes, which broadcast and tally transactions for bitcoin miners to validate, in contrast to lighter software wallets like Jaxx or Bread, which only facilitate transactions, Rochard said this is the best way to be fully in control of your money.\nSpeaking again to his interest in weening people off third-party systems, Rochard said, “I generally want people to be running a full node regardless of the implementation it’s in because we’ve seen a lot of reliance on third parties.”\nThe new consulting gig isn’t Rochard’s first crack at launching a project geared towards educating people on bitcoin.\nFor instance, he co-founded the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute in March 2014 with two fellow alumni of the University of Texas at Austin, Michael Goldstein and Daniel Krawisz. The institute is essentially a free archive of reading materials related to money and cryptography from as far back as the 1970s, including a collection of emails from bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\nMore recently, Rochard and Goldstein started the Noded Bitcoin podcast , where they interview leading developers and bitcoin community influencers.\nSpeaking to his love of bitcoin, Rochard told CoinDesk:\n“There’s so much to research in bitcoin alone. After five years, I’m still peeling the bitcoin onion.”\nImage via Pierre Rochard The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Bitcoin Miners Do the Selling\nAccording to independent research boutique Fundstrat, which provides market strategy and sector research, the bitcoin mining boom could potentially send the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization to upwards of $64,000 USD by the end of 2019. States the company’s head of research, Sam Doctor, in a report:\nWe believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range.\nBitcoin is infamously volatile, creating FOMOers and naysayers on what feels like a weekly basis. Nevertheless, Fundstrat believes the economics behind bitcoin mining create key support levels — since bitcoin miners are less likely to sell their rewards during market downturns, and more likely to cash out during bull runs. Explained Doctor in a conference call to CNBC on Thursday:\nThe primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors. We believe breakeven mining costs provide a support level for $BTC , as #miners – main natural #Crypto sellers – reduce selling at low $BTCUSD price. Based on expected computing hashpower and breakeven cost growth, that could imply #Bitcoin price of $36,000 by 2019 year end. pic.twitter.com/CVwIWNz8Lr\n— Sam Doctor (@fundstratQuant) May 10, 2018\nFundstrat has estimated that the current cash break-even price Antminer S7 models is $6,003 USD per bitcoin. The newer and more powerful Antminer S9 , however, features a much lower break-even point at $2,368 USD. Both popular pieces of bitcoin mining hardware are manufactured by Bitmain, which boasted an operating profit between 3 billion USD to 4 billion USD in 2017. Doctor said:\nThe release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.

Crypto mining economics lead/explain $BTC price—suggests $39,000 per bitcoin by YE19. key takeaways below… pic.twitter.com/f5ZQ4py3jS\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 10, 2018\nAccording to CBNC , Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover Bitcoin.\nLee previously predicted last July that Bitcoin may reach $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022. At the time of that prediction, bitcoin was trading at $2,540. Lee also noted that bitcoin could become a viable substitute for gold.\nDo you think bitcoin can reach upwards of 64,000 USD by the end of next year? Do you think the miners’ break-even point is indeed a key support level?

Shares 47\nThings are not looking all that great for the Bitcoin price as of right now. Although it is unclear where this sudden bearish pressure is coming from, the price is getting battered quite badly. Thanks to a 6% decline in the past few hours, the Bitcoin price has now dropped below $9,000 and is seemingly heading to $8,500 or potentially even lower. What is Happening to the Bitcoin Price?\nCryptocurrency is an industry which often makes no sense at all. Due to the speculative nature of all of these currencies, any price momentum can send the markets in either direction pretty quickly. Last year, we saw a lot of people placing buy orders at a higher Bitcoin price mainly because they were afraid of missing out on all of the action. This year, it is the exact opposite, with market makers pushing the Bitcoin price down fairly regularly.\nThis latest Bitcoin price dip comes in the form of another 6% decline. Even though the momentum looked fairly positive this morning, something has triggered a massive sell-off. The reason behind this unexpected momentum remains unclear to everyone, as there is no reason for the Bitcoin price to go through such rough patch at this stage. Global interest in Bitcoin has soared for several months now and the overall interest in the world’s leading cryptocurrency hasn’t diminished in the slightest.\nEven so, we are now looking at a Bitcoin price of $8,772. It seems unlikely this level will be maintained for the near future, as there is so much pressure to grind the Bitcoin price into the dirt. If this momentum is sustained, the upcoming value of Bitcoin may not even be above $8,000. That would be another big setback for the cryptocurrency users, although it won’t matter all that much to those who are in it for the long haul.\nOne thing keeping the Bitcoin price dream alive is how the trading volume isn’t diminishing over the past 24 hours. There is still over $7.39bn in 24-hour trades, which is on par with what we have seen for Bitcoin over the past few weeks. Despite the bears being in control of the market right now, it is possible this momentum will turn around sooner than people expect.\nAs of right now, Bitfinex is the largest exchange ranked by Bitcoin trading volume. OKEx is in second place, followed by Binance. All three platforms generate over $300n in volume as of right now, which looks pretty solid. Huobi and Bitstamp complete the top five, which brings the total number of fiat currency pairs to two. All three other pairs are USDT offerings, which seems to indicate there is still a lot of positive momentum for Bitcoin to contend with..\nFor the time being, one has to wait and see how the Bitcoin price evolves in the coming hours. If panic selling truly kicks in, a drop to $8,000 isn’t out of the question by any means. However, if a pushback can find stable ground, the Bitcoin price can easily reach $9,000 again before the day is over. A lot of people will be glued tot he price charts for some time to come, that much is certain. This upcoming weekend will also be quite interesting in terms of cryptocurrency trading.

Prior to that, the currency had experienced a weekend high of $9,800, but subsequently dropped to $9,500 and $9,300 respectively within a 48-hour period. This ultimately marks a $1,200 drop in only five days.\nNo doubt many investors are pulling their hair out of their scalps right about now. It appears there are several reasons for the price drop – one stemming out of Asia where digital trends are allegedly set, especially in the crypto arena. One of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit, has been raided by government authorities, once again renewing the notion that South Korea is heightening its regulatory scrutiny. Should this occur, bitcoin and its crypto-cousins will undoubtedly suffer. Enthusiasm is likely to drop significantly, and digital asset enterprises around the world will be feeling the heat.\nUpbit is suspected of illicitly moving customer funds to the accounts of its executives. While an official report has not yet been released, authorities state that if evidence is discovered that points to any illegal activity, the exchange could be temporarily or permanently shut down. At press time, general sentiment remains that Upbit had no reason to make such a move, and The Merkle will bring you more on this story as it comes along.\nIn addition, it appears we just can’t seem to get away from Mt. Gox. It is widely suspected that a Mt. Gox trustee has moved some heavy bitcoin funds into four separate wallets, which may have triggered a sell-off and contributed to the price drop. Since last September, trustees of the now infamous Japanese cryptocurrency exchange have continued to move large sums of bitcoin despite their own personal acknowledgements that such action may contribute to wide price swings in what is already a very unstable and volatile market.\nIt has been indicated that as many as 2,000 bitcoins were placed in each wallet over a 24-hour span.\nAnd yet despite all the hype and drama, many remain loyal to bitcoin and suggest its price is about to surge higher than ever before . One of those figures is financial strategist Robert Sluymer, who says that while bitcoin is likely to suffer a turbulent month, it will undoubtedly get stronger from here.\nSluymer attributes the present drops to ongoing attempts to regulate the currency, but feels this is on the verge of thinning out. “The regulatory risk, the fundamental risk around what’s happening with cryptos has hit a bottom, and now we’re in a state of general recovery,” he assures.\nOther figures, like head of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco John Williams admit that while there are benefits to bitcoin use, the currency is plagued by issues that need to be fixed. While discussing the setup or institutional arrangement around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with CNBC, Williams exclaimed, “They have problems with fraud, money laundering and terror financing. There are a lot of problems, there.” About The Author ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "merkle", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "upbit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T21:28:07.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b930b514d941a0b494ac6c3630183881f73506d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJx9DpwjOuVgImF0CXSDilnFQE.bF.F2vF1IhAgh6w84TQnH2KK05JOby6MC8CEZUMfYTXkP1fWgOffc1.CKoPp", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "https://www.marketwatch.com/topics/companies/stephens?prop=industry&propval=entertainment%20and%20leisure", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Stephens - MarketWatch.com Topics", "title": "Mining efficiency will launch bitcoin to $36,000 - MarketWatch", "title_full": "Mining efficiency will launch bitcoin to $36,000 - MarketWatch", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ040_bitcoi_ZG_20171127124451.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 210, "comments": 0, "shares": 210}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b930b514d941a0b494ac6c3630183881f73506d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJx9DpwjOuVgImF0CXSDilnFQE.bF.F2vF1IhAgh6w84TQnH2KK05JOby6MC8CEZUMfYTXkP1fWgOffc1.CKoPp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Hankin", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mining efficiency will launch bitcoin to $36,000 - MarketWatch", "text": "Bitcoin on Friday broke below a short-term support line at $9,000, extending selloff in the previous session that took all major currencies into the red for the week.\nA single bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.92% last traded at $8,593.01, down 5.5% since Thursday’s levels at 5 p.m. Eastern time on the Kraken exchange.\nThe price of the No. 1 digital currency had spent the best part of the week consolidating after nearing the $10,000 mark late last week.

This time analysis depends largely on what’s known as the mining economy. Hash power and hardware advancement all combine to show a possible $36,000 BTC price by the end of next year, they claim.\nAlso read: JP Morgan Chase Eats Humble Pie, Applies for Blockchain Patent Fundstrat Continues Moon Price Predictions\nFundstrat’s head of data research, Sam Doctor, explained, “The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.”\nCapex is short for capital expenditure, and refers here to upgrades in technology such as mining rigs. Hash power growth can be thought of as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin using proof of work, relying on a unit of measure basically recording power consumed by the network to keep it humming along, in this case, roughly every ten minutes a block is found or generated. Internal Fundstrat research document\n“We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,” Mr. Doctor continued. “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.”\nIf a multiple of four from its current price seems ambitious, the actual range from Fundstrat pushes the high to nearly twice even that number. Mr. Doctor uses mining economics to establish a floor support level due to its supposed relative growth going forward. Through next year, researchers believe mining hash power will indeed boom by 350 percent. A Rosy Immediate Future\nMost of the price moon prediction depends upon miners Fundstrat assumes will hold their position through the crypto winter, and then sell once it recovers (and better). Moving variables in the mining economy include rig innovation, electricity cost, and the ability to lower hardware temperatures.\nMr. Doctor further elaborated how “miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees. We argue that the Price/Miner’s Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.” And harder numbers Fundstrat asserts to be $6K per BTC for Bitmain’s Antminer S7, and just over $2K for its S9 model.\nSuch rosey price predictions are nothing new for Fundstrat Global. Its very public face, and really only prominent Wall Street analyst to take cryptocurrencies seriously as an asset class, Tom Lee, famously last Summer forecast BTC becoming a store of value on par with gold, reaching a high of as much as $55K by 2022. As more information has come in, Mr. Lee has also said he expects the digital asset could moon to $25K by the end of this year alone.\nStill other analysts believe the causal connection between mining activity and speculative price is not well established, leading to perhaps more outlandish price calls as a result. And with other cryptocurrencies battling it out for market share, offering varieties of features not currently found in bitcoin, the BTC price explosion might not be such a given. At press time, BTC price hovered around $8,500, down almost ten percent.\nWhat are your crypto price predictions?

The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by the New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential. ( Kin Cheung / THE CANADIAN PRESS ) By NATHANIEL POPPER The New York Times Fri., May 11, 2018\nSAN FRANCISCO—Some of the biggest names on Wall Street are warming up to bitcoin, a virtual currency that for nearly a decade has been consigned to the unregulated fringes of the financial world.\nThe parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by the New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential.\nThe news of the virtual exchange, which has not been reported before, came after Goldman Sachs went public with its intention to open a bitcoin trading unit — most likely the first of its kind at a Wall Street bank.\nRead more:\nOntario Securities Commission gathering info on cryptocurrency trading platforms after complaints\nThe moves by Goldman and the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, mark a dramatic shift toward the mainstream for a digital token that has been known primarily for its underworld associations and status as a high-risk, speculative investment.\nThe new interest among Wall Street power brokers also represents a surprising new chapter in the renegade history of bitcoin.\nThe virtual currency was created after the 2008 global financial crisis by a still-anonymous programmer who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was to replace the existing banking structure with an online alternative that couldn’t be controlled by a handful of powerful organizations.\nBut instead of being replaced, the old banks are beginning to assert their own role in the unorthodox financial world of virtual currency, sometimes called cryptocurrencies.\nWhile bitcoin was originally designed to be used by consumers for all sorts of transactions — without any financial institutions getting involved — it has mostly become a virtual investment, stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world. People buy bitcoin in the hope that its value will go up, similar to the way they purchase gold or silver.\nDetails of the platform that the Intercontinental Exchange is working on have not been finalized and the project could still fall apart, given the hesitancy among big Wall Street institutions to be closely associated with the Wild West of virtual currencies. A spokesman said that the company had no comment.\nMany corporations and governments have expressed interest in the technology that bitcoin introduced, particularly a form of database known as the blockchain.\nSome large financial exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have already created financial products linked to the price of bitcoin, known as futures. But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer’s account at the end of the trade.\nICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning bitcoin the next day — with the backing and security of the exchange, according to the people familiar with the project.\nThe swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of bitcoin. But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws — something today’s bitcoin exchanges have struggled to do.\nThe chief executive of Nasdaq, Adena Friedman, recently said her company could also create a virtual-currency exchange if regulatory issues are ironed out. While several hedge funds have been buying and selling bitcoin, most large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pensions, have avoided it largely as a result of similar regulatory concerns.\nBitcoin still faces plenty of skepticism in the mainstream financial world. Over the weekend, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett, who has long been critical of virtual currencies, said bitcoin was “probably rat poison squared” in an interview with CNBC. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates added his own skepticism, saying he’d “short” bitcoin if he could.\nAnd the new efforts to trade bitcoin don’t help answer basic questions about what makes the virtual currency useful in the real world. Most attempts to use bitcoin for everyday commerce haven’t gained traction, and investors have treated it as a speculative commodity such as gold or silver.\nSome bitcoin enthusiasts have said that its increasing integration into the existing financial system has pulled it away from its founding ideals. Paul Chou, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who set up LedgerX, a regulated bitcoin exchange that would compete with the Intercontinental Exchange, said his company has made a point of focusing on large bitcoin holders, rather than financial institutions.\n“The reason we got into crypto was not to partner with a bank, but to replace them,” Chou said, using the shorthand for cryptocurrencies. “We deal with crypto holders directly in a way that really takes advantage of bitcoin’s strengths, while avoiding brokers, banks and other institutions that take multiple cuts of the transaction.”\nGoldman will initially only be trading futures contracts linked to bitcoin’s price. But Goldman executives said they were looking at moving in the direction of buying and selling actual bitcoins.\nThe Intercontinental Exchange’s effort, if it pans out, could make bitcoin available to a much wider and more influential customer base, including other financial firms.\nSeveral big corporate names, including the giant technology investor SoftBank, which has stakes in Sprint and Uber, have been in discussions about being involved with the exchange in some way, the people familiar with the project said. But a spokesman for SoftBank said this week that it was no longer involved.\nLedgerX, the exchange founded by Chou, is the only exchange that now offers the kind of swaps that ICE has discussed. LedgerX has experienced increasing trading volume in recent months, but ICE would start with an edge because essentially every large financial institutions is already hooked into it.\nThe interest in bitcoin trading illustrates how the reputation of the virtual currency has, after a rocky start, improved.\nRegulators are looking at whether many virtual currencies, including the second-most widely used digital token, Ether, have been issued and traded in violation of securities regulations. Institutional investors believe that because of the way bitcoin was created and structured — without any one company or organization behind it — it would be on safer ground with regulators.\nICE was considering launching a swap contract linked to Ether, but backed away from that because of regulatory uncertainty, the people briefed on the effort said.\nChou, at LedgerX, said he made a similar decision and has delayed creating any products linked to Ether.\nWith bitcoin, on the other hand, Chou said that road seems to be clear for big institutions to get involved.\n“The industry is seeing unprecedented institutional interest for the first time in bitcoin’s history,” he said. “I’ve been amazed that the strongest believers in cryptocurrency often start out the most skeptical. It’s a healthy skepticism. But at some point the perception shifts, and for many institutions — I think we’re finally there.” Read more about: TOP STORIES, DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.

This resulted in a quick move leading to a drop to $8500 level. It is no surprise that with a drop like this, the permabulls have gone silent and the bears can now be heard quite loudly with voices like, “This is the end of Bitcoin (BTC)” and “What if Bitcoin ( BTC ) never rises above $10,000 again?”. To a first time traders, these voices are a matter of life and death especially in circumstances like these. The knee jerk reaction in this case for most amateur traders is to panic sell resulting in heavy price drops which are dragged downwards as long as the panic selling continues and as long as the market makers know that the prices can drop further.\nOnce the panic selling dies down, market makers aka whales start filling their bags with Bitcoin (BTC) pumping the price back up. While pumps and dumps are normally attributed to penny stocks, it can apply to any financial asset that can be easily manipulated due to a small market cap (comparatively) and more importantly low trade volumes. Situations like these are optimum for market makers to play their games. Such manipulation or shaking off of weak hands happens more often when market makers know that an asset can appreciate significantly in value in the near future.\nA good example of such manipulation is the stock, MOMO. The company reported spectacular earnings, the P/E ratio was very favorable but the stock kept tanking. It continued to fall for weeks even while it was trading at $20 which was considered highly undervalued. However, soon afterwards, the prices starting rising once the market makers were done. The stock then climbed to $46 in a matter of just a few weeks. The same is true of Bitcoin (BTC) and most cryptocurrencies . While most institutional investors and smart money realize that a 2014 style scenario is highly unlikely to unfold considering recent developments, they do realize that most investors trading Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are first time investors and they do not know that. So, they will continue to instill fear in the market and manipulate the price action such that it creates chaos and fear so the mainstream investors can leave their Bitcoin (BTC) on the table and run away.\nBitcoin (BTC) is a deflationary asset and its value will continue to appreciate over time. The current cost of mining a Bitcoin (BTC) is $8672 according to Coinwarz Calculator whereas the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $8561. That means if you are mining Bitcoin (BTC) at the moment, you will be mining at a loss. The mining difficulty has also taken a new turn this month and is now at an all time high of 4,143 G. In all fairness, it couldn’t get significantly worse than this. Apart from mining difficulty increases with time, the recent trouble with Iran and similar developments in the world could also prop up the price of electricity in some countries. All of these factors point to the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) is extremely undervalued at the moment and an inevitable price appreciation in the near future might be around the corner.

However, the first three months of 2018 have proven to be the worst first quarter for the cryptocurrency when it fell to $6,200 in February. Since then, though, bitcoin’s price has rallied and has risen.\nAt the time of publishing it is trading at $8,579, according to CoinMarketCap. This is a slight drop from its more than $9,000 value in recent days, but Sluymer is of the opinion that bitcoin ‘continues higher from here.’ He also thinks that the Blockchain Week New York will bring a positive rally for the digital currency’s value.\nTom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat, has also given a bullish projection on the price of bitcoin during the Consensus conference, which takes place between the 14th and 17th May. Earlier this week, MarketWatch reported that Lee said the cryptocurrency could increase by as much as 70 percent as a result of Consensus.\nLee said of the event:\nAlready one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years.\nAccording to Lee, previous rallies from Consensus have seen price gains between 10 percent and 70 percent. As the report states, this means that bitcoin could see a price surge of more than $15,000.\nEven though Sluymer said that the cryptocurrency’s price bottom may now be behind for the industry, it remains to be seen what impact, if any, the conferences will have on the price of the number one digital currency. Yesterday, a report from Fundstrat suggested that the price of bitcoin could rise to as high as $64,000 by 2019 . Featured image from Shutterstock.

Currencies / BlockChain May 11, 2018 - 12:21 PM GMT By: Avi_Gilburt\nRyan Wilday writes: Over the last few months, I have released a couple articles suggesting a potential bottom was in for the crypto market. Unfortunately, support levels that I called out did not hold, so I had to look lower.\nI am writing anew having seen a very bullish pattern off the recent lows struck on April 1. Currently, most of the coins we track have the \"impulsive five,\" a pattern we look for to indicate a bottom. These patterns so far are more bullish in structure than previous patterns seen since January. Furthermore, these structures, as measured in Fibonacci levels, are higher than before. This is promising.\nYet, as usual, we must watch supports and move them higher with the market to watch for indication of a false rally.\nAs of this writing, most of those coins are in consolidation off recent micro highs, and they appear to be setting up for continuation. Some coins are in the next degree wave 2 down. Some are in wave 4, needing to go one wave higher to complete the first-degree impulse.\nI'm now providing biweekly commentary on the crypto market for the Korelin report. Price action was bullish enough on April 30 for me to suggest a bottom was likely. I sounded a little excited that day and for good reason.\nAs is typical when we have a potential bullish reversal, I like to check in with our bellwethers: Litecoin (LTC-USD), Bitcoin (BTC-USD), and Ethereum (ETH-USD).\nI also want to take a look at Ripple (XRP-USD). Previously, I had been looking for any high degree rally in Ripple to be a B wave rally, reserving a major bottom in wave 4 for after a large degree C wave down. However, we now have a five-wave impulse pattern in Ripple off the bottom, so it is reasonable to believe the major rally toward new all-time highs in Ripple has also started.\nIn fact, we have an impulse in quite a few coins for which I've expected B wave rallies. These include OMG, REP, and NXT, to name just a few. This is more promising evidence that a major low is in.\nEthereum is the most clearly bullish of our bellwethers. It put in a very deep correction that forced a review of my long-term count. This indicates that sentiment reached extreme negative levels. And now it has a very clear impulse off the bottom, retracing nearly .618 of the height of the correction.\nOff the April 1 lows, we either have a five-wave impulse complete or need one more high as per the red count on my chart. White is my preference, and that means we had a very shallow wave 2 and are now in circle 1 of wave 3, targeting new highs. White is valid as long as $604 is not breached, and the pattern can be called bullish as long as $495 holds.\nSource: MotiveWave.com\nI view Litecoin in two ways: I have been tracking a triangle pattern off the February lows since we don't have enough waves to really suggest that the C wave of the wave 4 correction is completed. However, since we have five waves off the April 1 lows, which is not the structure we expect for a D wave, we may have something more bullish. This means the C wave could have been truncated and we are already in our expected climb to over $1,000. I have posted both views below.\nLitecoin Triangle:\nLitecoin with a truncated C wave:\nSource: MotiveWave.com\nBitcoin also has the potential to build a triangle. It has a five-wave pattern, but since I'm looking for this rally to be C of B, it still fits in Bitcoin's triangle. Another pattern works well, and that is the leading diagonal I posted in a previous article. This will become my primary view if we breach $16,000 from here. Both views are posted below.\nBitcoin Triangle Count:\nBitcoin Leading Diagonal:\nSource: MotiveWave.com\nNow, let's look at Ripple. If you recall from past articles, you know that I was looking for a B wave top. Yet, again, with a five-wave rally, I am looking higher. I'd like to see 60 cents to hold here, which gives me a target northward of $3.00 in the next degree. I'll move supports as we go, and I see the potential for Ripple to continue a major rally over $10 before the next major correction.\nSource: MotiveWave.com\nWhile I consider the bellwethers an important indication of the future: we are also tracking major bottoms in most of the small-cap coins, which are much higher in beta (realized volatility), so can provide more reward for more risk. Some of our favorites include Bitshares (BTS-USD), Steem (STEEM-USD), Lunyr (LUN-USD), and EMC2 (EMC2-USD). None of these \"picks\" are based on the project potential or fundamentals, but on Elliott Wave analysis, and I have posted targets for these and over a dozen other favorite small caps in my trading room on Elliott Wave Trader.\nWhether we are seeing the bottom or will see new lows, I do believe the next rally in the crypto market will be a sight to behold. \"Moon Count\" has become vernacular in the Elliott Wave trading room, indicating future expected price levels. Regardless, markets are markets, with a certain level of unpredictability. Whether our lunar rocket is ready to launch or not, we have to watch supportive price levels and move them up with the market if we want to see early warnings that this rally will fail. Also, in order to manage risk, we have to map key price levels in order to take profit and not suffer from any early failure. This also gives us the opportunity to catch the natural retraces in an unfolding rally. No rocket goes straight up.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long ETH-USD, LTC-USD, XRP-USD, BTC-USD.\nSee the charts provided in this article in an expandable format.\nRyan Wilday is a cryptocurrency analyst at ElliottWaveTrader.net , where he hosts the Cryptocurrency Trading premium subscription service. © 2018 Copyright Ryan Wilday - All Rights Reserved Disclaimer: The above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

And Xapo is talking about pensions, hedge funds and family offices as their clients, rumours of $10bn worth of bitcoin under their care.\nSo the only solution seems obvious, a huge vault in the side of a mountain. A decommissioned Swiss military bunker, on the shores of Lake Lucerne. Physical security, is what it comes down to in the end.\nBut of course there’s electronic security layered on top of this, and from the original bitcoin maximal evangelist Xapo is clearly a carefully-thought out solution to one of the biggest issues challenging the market.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nIn the few interviews Caseres has given, he treads a fine line: to reassure potential investors of the lengths to which they are going to secure their storage, but avoiding a compromising level of detail.\nThey are trading to an extent on their founders’ personal provenance and rep, as the original bitcoin ‘patient zero’ of Popper’s Digital Gold. It’s funny how much individual character matters in so many cases, in these new trustless settings.\nBut if Xapo can truly solve the custody issue to the satisfaction of big institutional fund managers, it could be a game changer in terms of market cap for sure.\n(here’s a pic from Quartz of the entry to the bunker, in case you fancy trying to break in!)\nSource: https://blockchainforums.info/category/13.rss ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "msn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lake lucerne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T10:58:27.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c85153e40826261fb2700062a4a4bf9236a1259", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSBDVMVJ_gRcsxV9oBJDJJWmYA6hjj9TZ1gVwagT09RGPw2Qw5xP6n5wE3khhHipw.fm.qiVoY_LcqMVVf0nYgzsyI.iGYpK30-", "site_full": "hacked.com", "site": "hacked.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Fed Explains The Bitcoin Crash: What Were They Thinking? | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Fed Explains The Bitcoin Crash: What Were They Thinking? | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://hacked.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/san-francisco-fed.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c85153e40826261fb2700062a4a4bf9236a1259", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSBDVMVJ_gRcsxV9oBJDJJWmYA6hjj9TZ1gVwagT09RGPw2Qw5xP6n5wE3khhHipw.fm.qiVoY_LcqMVVf0nYgzsyI.iGYpK30-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fed Explains The Bitcoin Crash: What Were They Thinking? | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "Fed Explains The Bitcoin Crash: What Were They Thinking?

Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.\nThe pioneering Ethereum-based e-commerce solution is looking for Sellers and Ambassadors to kickstart its new platform.\nBitBoost will launch its decentralised marketplace in June. The project, which is built using Ethereum’s smart contracts, will enable buyers and sellers to connect directly – facilitating free and private online commerce.\nTraditional user experience, low fees The marketplace takes the form of a downloadable piece of software that connects to the Ethereum blockchain via either BitBoost’s node or a local node, if preferred. Payments for goods are made in ETH, and all listings cost a flat fee of just $1, payable in the BBT token. The team has worked hard to replicate the look and feel of traditional e-commerce platforms, with instant search and product images hosted on Imgur for anonymity.\n‘We think this is going to be a game-changing decentralised e-commerce solution,’ says founder and CEO Paul Mahone. ‘We believe in free trade, and the BitBoost marketplace entirely removes several common barriers and intermediaries in online commerce. Anyone can sign up for an account. You don’t need to submit an email address or any personal details: all that is required is an Ethereum address. The interface is clean and familiar, payments are fast and borderless, and privacy is built in.’\nSellers’ Programme BitBoost is looking for merchants to join the platform’s Sellers’ Program , bootstrapping activity on the marketplace and helping to build network effect and momentum. With low listing fees, and a smart contracts escrow system to protect both buyers and sellers, the company believes it will be an attractive alternative to the high commission fees and data harvesting that are the price of doing business in the traditional e-commerce industry.\nBitBoost is also looking for Ambassadors to promote the initiative around the crypto world and the broader e-commerce sector.

Bypassing the technological issues causing friction on the BTC blockchain, such as the lack of scaling potential and the high transaction fees, BCH is fast becoming the preferred alternative in payments.\nWith the profile of bitcoin now greater than ever before, the launch of CFDs at BUX provides casual investors with an alternative means of capitalising on the underlying growth in the currency.\nContracts for difference are a type of trading instrument based on an underlying market. Instead of buying the underlying asset, as in other types of investing, traders buy a contract for the difference in the asset between the price today, and the price at a future date.\nThis has several key advantages for investors, according to BUX, including improved security.\nAccording to a post on their blog announcing the new CFDs, the CFD structure makes investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies less susceptible to hacking and theft.\n“What about hackers? It’s not easy to find a cryptocurrency exchange that hasn’t been hacked. Every time an exchange is pierced, hundreds of investors and traders lose their cryptos forever. Most crypto exchanges aren’t subject to regulation, so there are no protection measures in the event of hacking or bankruptcy.”\n“From a certain point of view, crypto CFDs may be more secure than buying the coin itself – because hackers can’t spend the CFD, so they’re not likely to steal it. CFDs, therefore, prevent you from unnecessary risk whilst allowing you to benefit from cryptocurrency movements.”\nAdditionally, CFDs also allow investors to trade on leverage, increasing the volatility and thereby the potential gains from incremental movements in the market.

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30–40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night’s move marked the first new low since the trading range (TR) formed 3 weeks ago: Figure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading Range\nUntil last night’s drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR — signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat.\nSometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity: Figure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume View\nAt the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side. The reaction to this lower price range will give us further insight as to the upcoming market movements. This is the first sign of weakness in our current trend, so it stands to reason that we will see a bounce in price to retest the resistance within the TR and further test the supply/demand of the market. Without proper distribution, its unlikely to see a sustained continuation of the downtrend, but at this point we shouldn’t rule anything out. On the short term, we can expect a retest of the $8,800s and possibly the lower $9K values.\nA somewhat alarming development is occurring as a consequence of this drop. Shortly after the market saw a golden cross of the 50/200 EMAs on the daily chart, we saw a definitive puncture of that support. Typically, the market doesn’t just plunge through the 200 EMA without seeing some sort of resistance, but a daily candle close below the 200 EMA marks a more macro bearish signal. That, combined with a Bollinger Band expansion, gives us an indication that the move downward may, on a macro scale, be a prolonged move over the coming days and weeks: Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro View Summary: A strong move downward brought the entire crypto market to its knees as bitcoin saw an $800 drop in a few short hours. This move marked the first sign of weakness in our current uptrend The sign of weakness combined with macro signals interacting with the Bollinger Bands and 50/200 EMAs hint toward a possible macro move downward.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

On that day, a major network upgrade will happen that will pave the way for the introduction of features designed to make the BCH blockchain more robust and, more importantly, help the network process more transactions. Or onboard all of mankind , if you will.\nThe upcoming upgrade will trigger an increase in the Bitcoin Cash blockchain block size from 8MB to 32MB, among other things. This, according to developers, will enable a capacity of 100 transactions per second, or 8.64 million transactions per day. There is an opinion, however, that lifting the cap on blocks will open the network to attacks—a notion that nChain Chief Scientist Dr. Craig Wright has shut down.\n“At 32MB, we’re talking about maybe a little bit of network cost and $50 worth of hard drive, or less. And for that, the attack would cost around $50,000. Now that $50,000 isn’t lost, it goes to the miners, the people protecting the network. The more you attack the network, the more profitable it becomes,” Wright told CoinGeek. “So, why would you, as a miner, not want to invest more money and make the network even more resilient when people are going to throw money at you as an attack? We’re at a stage now where you cannot really attack the network.”\nIncreasing the Bitcoin Cash network’s block size to 32MB, allowing it handle 8.64 million transactions per day, is a precursor to the Terab project’s goal of scaling to 1TB blocks, which, in turn, will bring in 7 million transactions per second or an estimated 604.8 billion transactions per day.\nTerab is an open source initiative launched by French quantitative supply chain Lokad and backed by the nChain Group, considered to be influential tech groups leading the development of Bitcoin Cash, along with CoinGeek.com owner and Antiguan-based entrepreneur Calvin Ayre, who has pledged up to €3.6 million in funding.\n“The whole idea here is to be able to scale so that we can have 50-plus transactions per person on earth,” the nChain chief scientist said. “If we can do that, then we can simply roll out Bitcoin to the world. We can have people in Africa, people in South America, people who aren’t banked, people who want to trade online.”\nTrue internet of money\nThe goal, according to Wright, is to scale the Bitcoin Cash network “naturally” so that 5 billion people can use it as cash daily.\n“We can create the true internet of money. And by doing this, we open up a global environment where free trade can start working no matter what,” he said. “But Bitcoin [BCH] is a distributed system, it’s no good us having our own node and going off on our own. We have to work with the entire ecosystem, so we’re going to have to work with miners to ensure that they can run everything correctly. We’re going to have to work with groups like Bitcoin ABC, and together, is how we build this ecosystem and community.”\nWright will be onhand at the upcoming CoinGeek Conference, happening at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong on May 18, to discuss tokenization and atomic swaps and how these will transform digital commerce.

November 30th 2017 /display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Technology - syndicated/ The federal budget will impact bitcoin devotees. Picture: Jack Guez Source:AFP THE Australian Government has made big cash payments illegal, but is it just giving a free kick to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?\nIn Tuesday’s Budget, Treasurer Scott Morrison announced a crackdown on the “black economy”, and a ban on cash payments was the centrepiece . From July 1, 2019, any business transaction over $10,000 has to be done using electronic payments. Handing over a hundred $100 notes or more will be illegal, as the government tries to flush out tax avoiders, drug dealers and the rest of the underground economy.\nBitcoiners and other cryptocurrency fans predicted this, and the government is playing into their greedy little hands.\nGRINDING ON UP\nBitcoin surged to $US20,000 last year and then quickly plunged back down to about $6700. Many thought it would continue back down close to zero. Instead, it has rebounded about 40 per cent in the past month to more than $9000, as this next graph shows. The volatile Bitcoin has rebounded in the past month. Source:Supplied\nThe recommendation of a ban on cash comes from the government’s Black Economy Task Force. The head of the task force, Michael Andrew, described the reasons people use cash in a recent podcast, giving as an example a shopkeeper who runs two tills, keeping some money out of sight of the taxman.\n“It’s basically paying people cash who want to maintain their welfare, their visa status or avoid their child maintenance,” Mr Andrew said. “That is widespread in certain areas particularly … the services-based economy, security industry, hospitality, cleaning, couriers, personal trainers, hairdressing and nail salons for example.”\nGovernments around the world are interested in cracking down on cash, and not just to get those dodgy nail salons paying tax, but also to kill off terrorist financing, to reduce money laundering, and even to let them reduce interest rates below zero. (If you make interest rates negative, people will just take cash out of the bank, but if you also make cash illegal, that’s not possible.)\nANARCHY IN THE BLOCKCHAIN\nAll these anti-cash trends are giving life to Bitcoin, and other digital currencies that could serve as an alternative to cash. For some people, that’s the whole point of cryptocurrencies. A big part of the early adopters of Bitcoin were people who are deeply worried about government. Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their “I told you so!” moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n“It is not about encouraging a black market economy,” says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n“We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.”\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n“People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you’re creating a cash economy, under the table, can’t be monitored by government. That’s not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.”\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has. (“You could be forgiven for thinking that accepting Bitcoin payments is a publicity stunt,” the firm’s website says, insisting it will actually be efficient. However, you can check its Bitcoin address on the Blockchain and see that no customers have paid bitcoin to that address yet).\nThe big risk is when the guy who is installing your new kitchen asks if he can be paid in anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Dash. That’s when the government’s cash ban could really backfire.\nSIGN-OFF", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott morrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack guez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "on up bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp the australian government", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T11:56:09.046+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "43e647baaa022118731d7a7ea3caa97c3d908668", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf37JiSWAvqWM0H0LoXeXOChsrIIqZsEtxMLfETNNbmcwgcNlrA74VFiwvS0I0vRKLSZsKzOV9fZLK", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Request Network now supports BTC and ERC20 : Bitcoin", "title_full": "Request Network now supports BTC and ERC20 : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.redditmedia.com/KehmY3PA3WT1CRxrc3p1pRkxyAr8-GkjCUa_IjZheWA.jpg?w=320&amp;s=d3aa0b4bdf8a13154dbc9858d52cf3b0", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "43e647baaa022118731d7a7ea3caa97c3d908668", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf37JiSWAvqWM0H0LoXeXOChsrIIqZsEtxMLfETNNbmcwgcNlrA74VFiwvS0I0vRKLSZsKzOV9fZLK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deleted", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Request Network now supports BTC and ERC20 : Bitcoin", "text": "Community guidelines Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.

Price is above an ascending trend line on the 4-hour time frame and is also near an area of interest. Technical indicators are giving mixed signals at the moment.\nThe 100 SMA is safely above the longer-term 200 SMA on the 4-hour time frame to hint that the path of least resistance is still to the upside. In other words, the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse.\nHowever, ethereum price is also treading below the 100 SMA dynamic support as an early signal of a pickup in selling pressure. A break below the trend line and area of interest could send it down to the next inflection point at the 200 SMA or $600.\nRSI looks ready to turn higher without hitting oversold levels, which suggests that bulls are eager to charge again. This could take ethereum price back up to the highs at $850. Stochastic, on the other hand, is on the move down so price could still follow suit.\nRoger Ver, who is dubbed ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, said that ethereum could surpass bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency.\n“I see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent,” Mr Ver said to The Independent . “Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020.”\nVer talked about issues pertaining to bitcoin’s core technology that are weighing on transaction times and boosting fees. Besides, the Casper code peer review also marked a significant milestone for ethereum as it will switch the network from mining to proof-of-stake. Although it will start off with a hybrid approach, the later stage will rely on people’s computing power but be less energy-intensive.

Based on the increase in user numbers and the resulting increase in trading volume for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin alone to approximately EUR 1.2 billion (forecast 2017: approximately EUR 1 billion), Bitcoin Group SE generated record revenues of EUR 12,481 thousand in fiscal year 2017 (previous year: EUR 1,044 thousand). As a result, earnings before taxes jumped to EUR 10,888 thousand (previous year: EUR 208 thousand). Earnings after taxes multiplied to EUR 7,452 thousand (previous year: EUR 114 thousand).\nTotal current assets increased by 1,594% year-on-year to EUR 49,027 thousand as of December 31, 2017 (previous year: EUR 2,893 thousand). This significant increase was achieved on the back of the higher number of bitcoins held by the company and the general rise in the Bitcoin price. Equity increased by EUR 32,107 thousand to EUR 38,190 thousand in the reporting period as a result of retained earnings (EUR 7,452 thousand) and other comprehensive income (EUR 24,659 thousand).\nFor the current 2018 financial year, the company expects the number of registered users to reach 1 million by the end of 2018 due to the steady growth at the end of 2018. With only moderate increases on the cost side, the management also expects a strong increase in earnings. Costs relate in particular to investments in research and development activities for the expansion of Bitcoin.de. In addition, Bitcoin Group SE plans to acquire a majority stake in a regulated bank based in Germany in the current 2018 financial year.\nThe 2017 annual report can be downloaded in PDF format from the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.bitcoingroup.com .\nContact:\nBitcoin Group SE\nMichael Nowak\nD-Nordstrasse 14\n32051 Herford\nmail: [email protected]\nphone.: +49.5221.69435.20\nfax: +49.5221.69435.25\nwebsite: www.bitcoingroup.com\nGerman Securities Identification Number (GSIN): A1TNV9\nISIN: DE000A1TNV91\nTicker symbol: ADE\nInvestor Relations contact:\nCROSS ALLIANCE communication GmbH\nSusan Hoffmeister\nphone.: +49 (0)89 89827227\nmail: [email protected]\nwebsite: www.crossalliance.com\n11-May-2018 CET/CEST The DGAP Distribution Services include Regulatory Announcements, Financial/Corporate News and Press Releases.\nArchive at www.dgap.de", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://public-cockpit.eqs.com/cgi-bin/fncls.ssp?fn=redirect&url=cc2a12dcbca32691ccaa3c0a1cea81ac&application_id=684915&site_id=zonebourse&application_name=news", "http://public-cockpit.eqs.com/cgi-bin/fncls.ssp?fn=redirect&url=603a1c2378a8b18e27dc1234091ca26e&application_id=684915&site_id=zonebourse&application_name=news"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "herford", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eqs group ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dgap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T20:48:28.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e438664f12144f1f052514884f9532c2172697c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeOZ7NgPmFyi1Ef7gRv2h8z8XPJpTjQmo7yZB3JKo.a2iiAHq2mewcA-", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=a&start=39&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "[twitter 검색 May-11, 05시] bitcoin", "title_full": "[twitter 검색 May-11, 05시] bitcoin : 네이버 블로그", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "http://blogimgs.naver.net/nblog/mylog/post/og_default_image_160610.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e438664f12144f1f052514884f9532c2172697c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeOZ7NgPmFyi1Ef7gRv2h8z8XPJpTjQmo7yZB3JKo.a2iiAHq2mewcA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NORAZO", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "[twitter 검색 May-11, 05시] bitcoin", "text": "가상화폐 [twitter 검색 May-11, 05시] bitcoin 머신 러닝을 통한 분석 Google Blogger(개발중)\n2018-05-10 20:55:22 RT @janeygak: This is huge.

Despite one crypto expert telling CNBC that Bitcoin could hit US$64,000 next year, the cryptocurrency hasn’t been able to break out of its bearish trend.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price has fallen 1.5% since this time yesterday to US$739.29, taking Ethereum’s market capitalisation down to a little under US$74.5 billion. According to the Independent, one expert thinks this could soon change, though. The so-called “Bitcoin Jesus” has predicted that Ethereum will be the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency by the end of the year.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has continued its slide and is down a further 3% over the last 24 hours to 78.1 U.S. cents. This has cut Ripple’s market capitalisation to US$30.6 billion. The Ripple price has come under pressure despite positive results from pilot trials of XRP for cross-border money transfers. Ripple advised of savings of up to 70% and transaction times of minutes instead of days.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has had a wild 24 hours of trade and is down 4.5% during the period to US$1,565.54, reducing its market capitalisation to US$26.8 billion. Bitcoin Cash is now down over 6% from yesterday’s high.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has managed to defy the market and has pushed 0.9% higher since this time yesterday to US$17.96.

Each of these cryptocurrencies was down no less than 3.5% over the last 24 hours. IOTA has been the worst performer with a 5% decline.\nThe Richest Man Alive Invests in This Instead of Cryptos\nThe richest man in the world has just launched a $100 million investment fund and investors who don't take note could miss out on a massive opportunity.\nAnd it isn't by sheer luck.

Worried that the process is too complicated? Well, fear not — trading bitcoin couldn’t be any easier. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to make your first bitcoin trade using SimpleFX. Getting Registered\nFirst and foremost, you will need an account to start trading on SimpleFX — and creating one is a simple process.\nSimply head on over to SimpleFX.com and click the green “CREATE ACCOUNT” button on the top right-hand side of the screen.\nYou may create a SimpleFX account using your Facebook or Google accounts, or use an existing email. Afterward, you will need to check your email address to complete the steps required for verification and the transfer of funds.\nOnce you’ve completed these initial registration steps, you’ll be ready to start trading! Make Your Move\nFirst, you will need to select your desired market from the left-hand side. For this guide, let’s assume you would like to start by trading Bitcoin.\nAfter clicking BTCUSD, you will need to choose a side — buy or sell. If you’ve already deposited bitcoin or another cryptocurrency into your wallet, you will be able to open buy or sell position (hopefully for a profit).\nHowever, let’s assume this is your first ever bitcoin trade. In this case, we’re obviously looking to buy\nYou will also want to choose between a market order — an order which is filled immediately at the current market price — or a pending order. With the latter order type, you choose the price you’d like to buy-in at, and the order will fill if and when that price is met.\nFor example, if the current buy price is 9399.04 USD, and you think the price of bitcoin will drop to 9200 USD, you may place a pending order at 9200 USD — which will fill if bitcoin market price will reach that level.\nNext, you simply need to choose the size of your order. You may purchase position worth whole bitcoins or fractions of bitcoins.\nThe trade value, required margin, and point value are all displayed for your convenience below the trade side box. Simply click the plus or minus buttons to increase or decrease your desired purchase amount.\nOnce you’ve selected how big position you would like to open, you may set prices for both profit taking and loss prevention.\n“Take Profit” is the price at which you would like to sell your bitcoin for a profit. For example, if you think Bitcoin will meet strong resistance at 10,000 USD, you may set an order to take profit at that price — in the hopes of possibly buying back in when it retraces.\nStop losses, on the other hand, may be set to minimize losses if the market should suddenly take an unexpected downturn. Many traders find these crucial, as it helps prevent large-scale losses in times of volatility and uncertainty.\nFinally, all that’s left to do is click buy!\nOf course, the process works exactly the same in reverse, should you be looking to sell.\nThat’s all there is to it. Now get out there and start making some money!\nWhat do you think of SimpleFX’s easy platform for bitcoin trading ? Do you use SimpleFX?

For Williams, a former Heisman Trophy winner, the future is in astrology, and when he looked up, the stars aligned for him to buy cryptocurrencies. Williams told CNBC :\n“When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight. The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.”\nIn astrology , a new moon is synonymous with new beginnings, and for Williams, that means entering the cryptocurrency market. This month, astrologists have much to celebrate with the moon rising in Taurus, a sign of positive things to come. But in a rare occurrence, Uranus, which Williams describes using familiar cryptocurrency features like “revolution” and “innovation”, happens to be moving away from Aries and inching closer to Taurus, which like cryptocurrency prices is reflective of some volatility.\n— Ricky Williams (@Rickthelaureate) May 1, 2018\n“We’re going to totally change the way we view and understand” the financial system, he told CNBC.\nIt gets deeper (so to speak). Pluto, which is now identified as a dwarf planet, is in retrograde with Capricorn, which Williams believes is a sure sign to re-examine financial “structures like banks.”\nHe explained:\n“I think as people are starting to become disillusioned with our institutions, that things like blockchain and cryptocurrency, it’s the perfect time for them to catch fire and really change the way we do things. So, you know, I had to get a little piece of that action.” Two-Point Conversion\nWilliams is not the only NFL-er to have caught cryptocurrency fever. Richard Sherman, who helped lead the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl win in 2014, is the spokesperson for cryptocurrency trading platform Cobinhood, which boasts no trading fees, though he reportedly dissuaded his grandmother from investing.\nWilliams is a former Heisman Trophy winner who spent 12 years with the National Football League (NFL) and one year with the Canadian Football League. He was the best in college, where he attended the University of Texas. But his NFL contract in the late nineties — though worth a potential $68 million — wouldn’t reflect that, given lofty milestones to earn that peak and a disenchanted Williams, and it is still looked to among future players as an example of how not to negotiate.\nSo when it comes to cryptocurrencies, Williams is playing it safe, pouring no more than $50,000 in to start.

The software scores transactions and addresses according to their risk, flagging bitcoin movements that may be associated with illegal activities, for example.\nAccording to Bitfury, the tool can help the authorities speed up their investigations into illicit activities involving the cryptocurrency. The firm's website says that it took just three hours to find the entity behind the $5 billion WannaCry ransomware attacks last May.\n\"If law enforcement agencies had had the proper tool to find criminals on the Bitcoin Blockchain,\" the company said in a presentation, \"they could have quickly cornered the criminals and prevented further global damage.\"\nBitfury also markets Crystal to companies, which face potential legal repercussions for accepting bitcoin derived from black market activities. Using Crystal, Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov told CoinDesk in January, \"you can track bitcoin transactions and see if this bitcoin address that you're getting money from is green or black.\"\nDoJ image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

In fact, bitcoin mining energy consumption is set to exceed private consumption, an energy expert told the BBC . And according to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index , global energy usage of all bitcoin mining already is equivalent to the power uptake of the country of the Czech Republic, with a population of 10.6 million, and will eventually approach Bangladesh, a country of 163 million people.\nIn search of cost savings, cryptocurrency miners traverse the globe to take advantage of cheaper energy. Those virtual miners perform a crucial function within the blockchain, or the decentralized ledger technology that underpins most cryptocurrencies, by solving complex problems to validate transactions on the network, In exchange for this function, which powers miners are rewarded with bitcoins.\nHowever, because bitcoin’s protocol operates on a proof-of-work basis—meaning it requires an expenditure of computing power—both the power and difficulty of problems increase as miners approach the maximum number of bitcoin’s meant to exist at 21 million. Currently, there are about 16.9 million bitcoins in existence.\nThe mainstream attention around bitcoin as it hit a peak level at $20,000 last December has led to an outcropping of digital miners and mining operations.\nSo, where is the cheapest place to mine bitcoin?\nAccording to research conducted by Elite Fixtures , the cost of mining a bitcoin varies significantly around the world, from as little as $531 to a stunning $26,170.\nThe Elite Fixtures report looked at the costs to mine a single bitcoin BTCUSD, -5.85% in 115 different countries based on average electricity rates according to local government data, utility company reports, and/or information from the Paris, France-based International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy Information Administration and currency-data company Oanda.\nElite Fixtures What the report (see table above) found is that the U.S. ranks 41st among countries, with an average costs for mining bitcoin of $4,758 a bitcoin, close to other popular mining destinations Russia at $4,675 and the aforementioned Iceland at $4,746. That means that investors would be able to make a profit with bitcoin’s current value at $8,567.86, according to Kraken exchange prices .\nMining costs nearing break-even according to some However, some estimates have the break-even price of mining a bitcoin higher. New York-based research firm Fundstart said the price of bitcoin is nearing a break-even of 1.0x, meaning the reward for mining a bitcoin equals the total cost.\n“Bitcoin currently trades essentially at the break-even cost of mining a bitcoin, currently at $8,038 based on a mining model developed by our data science team,” said Tom Lee managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors.\nAccording to Fundstrat data, when the price of bitcoin peaked in Dec. 2017, its model had the break-even price at 3.5x.\nSee also: In one chart, here’s how much it costs to mine bitcoin in your state\nWhatever the actual break-even costs are, times are much tougher in South Korea. The tight capital controls within the bitcoin industry put South Korea as the costliest place to mine, where a staggering $26,170 would be expended to extract a single bitcoin.\nElite Fixtures’ report was based on using specialized mining-rigs models, including the AntMiner S9, the AntMiner S7, and the Avalon 6 and the total power expenditure.\nFor those looking to do it on the cheap, head to Venezuela where the cost of mining a bitcoin is just $531. To be sure, Venezuela offers a host of other challenges miners must overcome.\nRead: Here’s why Venezuela’s cryptocurrency venture is no panacea\nMore from MarketWatch More Coverage BlackRock fund manager sees this as the market’s ‘sweet spot’ Three reasons the stock market’s fundamentals look solid My husband sold his grandmother’s house and paid off our mortgage — now his family is threatening to sue", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43030677", "https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://www.elitefixtures.com/blog/post/2683/bitcoin-mining-costs-by-country/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:22:47.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d9fd8eb604f5a996e1bf4ee9a09a83bad7e0c62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJcxGIcSYozvZnXFFC8afFLCaBiuGbDEtXg6EzIhkBuUAwgoW3kqBiGgMT.EXL6Ctvee2am7LhbTqpQ6n8ggJ_LlH5QjBOQ0aOPLpTRloxyQj5XpJCkkdj4NJg2WUWPXOeExgWgRhno0rbmqNl31_WL", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com - Top Stories", "title": "Why a raid in a South Korean crypto-exchange rattled the wider bitcoin market", "title_full": "Why a raid in a South Korean crypto-exchange rattled the wider bitcoin market - MarketWatch", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY667_bitcoi_ZG_20171120073849.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d9fd8eb604f5a996e1bf4ee9a09a83bad7e0c62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJcxGIcSYozvZnXFFC8afFLCaBiuGbDEtXg6EzIhkBuUAwgoW3kqBiGgMT.EXL6Ctvee2am7LhbTqpQ6n8ggJ_LlH5QjBOQ0aOPLpTRloxyQj5XpJCkkdj4NJg2WUWPXOeExgWgRhno0rbmqNl31_WL", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Hankin", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why a raid in a South Korean crypto-exchange rattled the wider bitcoin market", "text": "Reports of a police raid on one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in one of the most cryptocrazy countries has rippled through the digital-currency market over the past 24 hours.\nThe exchange known as UPbit, South Korea’s largest crypto platform, has been accused of selling cryptocurrency it doesn’t hold, according to local news outlet Chosun . “We have secured hard disks and accounting books through confiscation.

Gox trustee, who was tasked to sell about 200,000 bitcoin after the bankruptcy of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, is suspected to have dumped another 8,000 bitcoin on the cryptocurrency market. Domino Effect As CCN reported yesterday, CNBC’s Fast Money contributor and BKCM founder Brian Kelly stated that the entrance of major financial institutions and banks into the cryptocurrency market could allow the cryptocurrency market to surge in value and cryptocurrencies to be considered as an emerging asset class. Currently, Kelly stated that cryptocurrencies are bearer instruments and it is difficult for institutional money to flow into the market. “I’m actually a bit shocked that the market did not pick up on this. Dominic Chu of CNBC said that investors will get physical delivery of bitcoin. That doesn’t sound that interesting except for the fact that it means ICE Exchange has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets. These are generally bearer instruments, just like gold bearer bonds. That’s the big deal. They have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders,” said Kelly. Following the logic of Kelly, the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and its daily trading volume is relatively low compared to other traditional assets and markets like the NASDAQ and gold. As such, the movement of funds of less than a billion dollars could drastically impact the market and the rates of cryptocurrencies, especially if large amounts of bitcoin are sold on public cryptocurrency exchanges. Over the past few months, despite of the criticism from the cryptocurrency market, the Mt. Gox trustee has continued to sell massive chunks of bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges, even after acknowledging that the sell off of tens of thousands of bitcoins can easily move the market that is already highly volatile. Today, on May 11, various reports have suggested that the recent price dip of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies was triggered by the sell off of Mt. Gox coins. Four wallets of the Mt. Gox trustee moved around 2,000 bitcoins each, sending over 8,000 bitcoins in total over the past 24 hours. Considering that the Mt. Gox trustee was asked to sell over 200,000 bitcoins and convert it to Japanese yen by local financial authorities, it is evident that any external movement of the Mt. Gox trustee’s funds likely means that they are being sold on cryptocurrency exchanges. Over-The-Counter (OTC) Market Similar to how most institutional traders and retail investors purchase and sell large batches of cryptocurrencies, the Mt. Gox trustee could use the over-the-counter (OTC) market and directly deal with large-scale investors that are willing to purchase thousands of bitcoins. Instead, the Mt. Gox trustee has opted to sell its funds on cryptocurrency exchanges, creating a domino effect across all major exchanges and leading the cryptocurrency market to drop by large margins.

He is very positive on Bitcoin Cash and predicts that the coin will hold a value which is as high as Bitcoin’s.\nRoger Ver is a well-known cryptocurrency investor. He is one of the first people to invest in Bitcoin and is known for his site Bitcoin.com. He has high hopes for cryptocurrency and believes that it will become the future of currency.\nIn the interview, Roger is questioned about the Fork to Bitcoin Cash. He comments that it was an upgrade to BCH resulting in increasing the number of transactions for the coin. The main reason for the upgrade was to make the coin more accessible to investors. The upgrade makes BCH’s transactions speed 30 times greater than Bitcoin’s.\nHe also says that BCH has more utility and can be used as money in various countries. Countries like Bangkok accept BCH for food, coffee, and other things. He also advises business startups to start using Bitcoin Cash.\nThe interviewer then proceeds to question the liquidity of Bitcoin Cash and how would it rise in value. Roger then replies that BCH has a higher market cap than what Bitcoin did a year ago and hence shows a bullish sign. He also says that companies are coming up with new innovations based on Bitcoin Cash and not Bitcoin.\nHe then proceeds to criticize Bitcoin saying that it is slow and unreliable. He praises the developers of BCH saying that they work hard to make BCH successful, as they follow the same path which made BTC successful.\nRoger Ver says:\n“I am very bullish on Bitcoin Cash, just like I was when I was the very first investor of Bitcoin in 2011.”\nAnother interviewer asks whether Bitcoin Cash can be used in day to day life like in America just like it is in Thailand. Roger replies by stating that companies like Coinbase are already using BCH to accept payments with Bitpay as the payment processor to accept payments.\nHe says the reason why BCH is more popular is that it can be stored and be spent as cash, something the top cryptocurrencies lack.\nWhen asked to give his thoughts on BCH surpassing BTC, Roger says a lot of people are already lobbying BCH and he witnessed an exchange which supported BCH. He says BCH is growing fast and furiously.\nHe gives an example of how BCH surpasses BTC stating that he received his first Bitcoin on a site called Bitcoin Faucet, but now it is not possible. It is possible to receive $0.15 worth BCH on a site called free.bitcoin.com.

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $9,380 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now trading well below the $9,050 support, which is a bearish sign in the short term.\nBitcoin price turned bearish below $9,050 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD may continue to move down as long as it is below $9,000-9,050. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nYesterday, we discussed a major resistance area near $9,450 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price was trading with a positive bias, but buyers failed to push the price above $9,400 and $9,450, which resulted in a downside move. There was a sharp bearish reaction and the price tumbled below the $9,050 and $9,000 support levels. The recent downside break looks real as the price settled below the $9,000 handle and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nIt traded as low as $8,696 and is currently consolidating losses. An initial resistance is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,465 high to $8,696 low. However, the most important resistance is close to $9,050, which was a support earlier . Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,465 high to $8,696 low is at $9,050 to prevent gains. A push above $9,050 could decrease the current bearish pressure in the short term.\nLooking at the hourly chart , is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $9,380. On the downside, a break and close below $8,600 may perhaps open the doors for more losses towards the $8,200 level in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently near the extreme oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $8,600\nMajor Resistance Level – $9,050 Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Turned Bearish was last modified: May 11th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price analysis yesterday", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T13:56:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d01f66ffacc0068ce2375414903661f5e2dcddcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNT2ZEmJSqgLctQEufVlwSCFiPxVGckmUwXAmQTYWDrsM0y7Y9l7gnuc1k3wS38SN7LQLZ3CWVQsORzzov0RQG5k", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Trimmed Gains | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Trimmed Gains | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.885, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/04/17074938/techanalysis-bch.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d01f66ffacc0068ce2375414903661f5e2dcddcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNT2ZEmJSqgLctQEufVlwSCFiPxVGckmUwXAmQTYWDrsM0y7Y9l7gnuc1k3wS38SN7LQLZ3CWVQsORzzov0RQG5k", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Trimmed Gains | NewsBTC", "text": "Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Trimmed Gains Aayush Jindal | May 11, 2018 | 4:08 am Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Trimmed Gains Aayush Jindal | May 11, 2018 | 4:08 am Key Points Bitcoin cash price failed to move above the $1,650 resistance and declined sharply against the US Dollar. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,640 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $1,500 and $1,480 support levels to avoid more declines.\nBitcoin cash price trimmed yesterday’s gains against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is now back below $1,600 with a few bearish signs near $1,520. Bitcoin Cash Price Support\nThere were a couple of attempts by bitcoin cash price to break the $1,650 resistance against the US Dollar. The price failed to move above $1,650 and started a downside move. It declined sharply and trimmed most its yesterday’s gains. During the decline, it broke the $1,600 and $1,550 support levels to settle below the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nIt even spiked below the $1,500 support level and traded as low as $1,482. At the moment, it is consolidating losses around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,664 high to $1,482 low. On the upside, there are many hurdles for buyers near $1,580 and the 100 hourly SMA. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,664 high to $1,482 low is at $1,573 to act as a key resistance. Moreover, there is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,640 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , it seems like the price may correct higher, but it may struggle to move above $1,580 and $1,600.

In a recent interview , the former Facebook executive said Buffett is not an expert on technology. He also reiterated the notion that Bitcoin is digital gold. Buffett Knows Little About Technology\nSpeaking during the interview, Palihapitiya said Buffett, the 82-year Berkshire Hathaway CEO, isn’t entirely tech-savvy. According to Palihapitiya, knowledge of technology isn’t exactly in Buffett’s “circle of competence,” saying:\nNot everybody is right all the time.\nIndeed, Warren Buffett hasn’t always been right. Despite being regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time, Buffett has passed up on a few choice investments like Amazon and Google . With cryptocurrency, he remains a staunch critic, recently declaring that buying the crypto wasn’t investing but speculating. Chamath Palihapitiya\nThe “Oracle of Omaha” has had a lot of negative things to say about cryptocurrency, calling it a bubble and a mirage. He has even called the number one crypto “rat poison,” a view shared by Charles Munger, Buffett’s second-in-command at Berkshire Hathaway. Munger recently referred to the granddaddy of cryptocurrency as a “ noxious poison ” and called for the U.S. to adopt China’s crypto crackdown philosophy. According to Buffett, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and does not produce anything.\nPalihapitiya isn’t the only one who thinks Buffett knows nothing about technology and cryptocurrency. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng said earlier in the year that the Berkshire Hathaway chief doesn’t understand bitcoin . Recently, Weiss Ratings provided evidence to dispute Buffett’s claims that the number one virtual currency has no value. Bitcoin is a Replacement for Gold\nPalihapitiya believes Bitcoin is a replacement for gold. The self-proclaimed Buffett disciple identifies with the importance of the cryptocurrency, saying that it bears no correlation with the mainstream market. As a result, it appears like Bitcoin has created a separate world, one that Palihapitiya jokes requires a passport to move from one to the other.\nThe former Facebook executive has owned Bitcoin since 2012. He says that he prefers to view the cryptocurrency as a hedge to the uncertainty of the mainstream market. Bitcoin emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, an event that Palihapitiya says broke the confidence of many people in the safety of mainstream finance. As a final thought, Palihapitiya states:\nEverything broke down, and things that we thought were hedges went away.\nDo you think Palihapitiya is correct in saying Warren Buffett is wrong about Bitcoin?

The app is now available in 10 U.S. states.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space $5.6 Billion Valuation\nRobinhood started out about three years ago as a simple stock trading smartphone app with no transaction fees. The company is now valued at $5.6 billion following a new financing round announced on Thursday. Robinhood confirmed that it has raised “$363 million to expand [its] product lineup.”\n“Our platform has also grown significantly, reaching over four million users, cementing Robinhood Financial as the fastest-growing brokerage ever,” the company wrote, adding:\nOn the heels of this growth, we recently raised $363 million in capital, valuing Robinhood at $5.6 billion. The series D round of funding was led by DST Global, with participation from new investors Iconiq, Capital G, Sequoia Capital, and KPCB. Existing investors included NEA and Thrive Capital.\nRobinhood announced the integration of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in January, with actual trading beginning on February 22 . A few days after the initial announcement, over a million people had already signed up to get access to trade cryptocurrencies. Crypto Helps Growth\nAccording to its website, “Bitcoin and ethereum trading is now available in California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, and Wisconsin” through Robinhood Crypto.\nThe app caters to “the ‘millennial’ population, roughly ages 18 to 35. The demographic is often considered a challenge for traditional financial institutions to reach, and Robinhood is trying to attract the group by offering commission-free trading through an app,” CNBC described. “The company generates revenue by taking a tiny fraction of a cent per dollar from each trade order as well as collecting interest on customer deposits.”\nMost of the cryptocurrencies held by Robinhood are kept in cold storage, the publication conveyed, adding that\nFor cryptocurrency trading, Robinhood has no investment minimums or maximums and no withdrawal limits.\nBesides crypto trading and market data services for BTC and ETH, Robinhood Crypto also supports real-time market data for “bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin gold (BTG), dash (DASH), dogecoin (DOGE), ethereum classic (ETC), lisk (LSK), litecoin (LTC), monero (XMR), NEO (NEO), omisego (OMG), qtum (QTUM), ripple (XRP), stellar (XLM), [and] zcash (ZEC).”\n“We also plan to support the ability to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies through Robinhood Crypto,” the company emphasized, clarifying that “supporting market data for individual cryptocurrencies does not necessarily mean we plan to add buying and selling.”\nWhat do you think of the Robinhood app and its valuation?

Gox liquidation speculation Published May 11, 2018 | By Atama Oteze Spread the love\nWhen it comes to blockchain prospects, it’s always a roller-coaster ride for investors. Bitcoin, whose price had remained over $9,000 for most of this month, once again dipped below $8,000 yesterday and today. In fact, the price recently hit a three-week low.\nOne potential reason for the drop may be Mt. Gox, the now-defunct crypto exchange, which is in the process of paying off its creditors. Some have speculated that its trustee sold a large chunk of the bitcoin it had in its coffers, according to Bloomberg . What’s more, South Korean authorities recently raided one of the country’s biggest exchanges, UPbit, which likely impacted bitcoin’s price.\nNevertheless, some are still bullish on the bitcoin market overall. A recent report from Fundstrat predicts that the price of the cryptocurrency will hit $64,000 by the end of 2019.

The early Bitcoin-turned-Bitcoin Cash advocate believes a ‘flippening’ will occur that will see the market capitalisation of Ethereum overtake that of BTC. Is Ver Bullish on Everything but Bitcoin?\nIf you’re familiar with the cryptocurrency space at all, you’ve probably heard of Roger Ver. He was an early proponent of digital currencies who loudly espoused the virtues of Bitcoin back when each unit cost just a few dollars. His almost religious zeal for all things crypto even earned him the title of ‘ Bitcoin Jesus .’\nVer has since turned his back on Bitcoin in favour of pumping up one of its forks. He’s now the loudest voice by far shouting about Bitcoin Cash. However, he spoke more about Ethereum in an interview today with the U.K.’s newspaper the Independent . For Ver, a ‘flippening’ (the overtaking of Bitcoin’s market cap by another cryptocurrency) is going to happen and it’s going to happen soon:\n“I see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent… Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year and Bitcoin Cash could do the same before 2020.”\nRoger Ver turned his back on the original Bitcoin’s community back in 2017. For him, the only way to scale Bitcoin to the level that it could successfully serve the planet as a means of payment was to increase the size of the blocks comprising its blockchain. Many other developers disagreed, citing concerns over increased centralisation. The differences in opinion couldn’t be reconciled and Bitcoin was forked into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in August of last year.\nDespite his views on Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, Ver does concede that Bitcoin could remain the dominant digital currency. He stated to the British publication that he sees this as unlikely, however. For Ver, the innovative scaling methods proposed by those still developing on the original chain won’t be enough to see the kind of gains he predicts for Bitcoin Cash. These, he claimed could see BCH reaching a price point of ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars’ at some undisclosed point in the future. Ver continued:\n“It’s not guaranteed but it is much more likely to happen than not… Bitcoin Cash has more than doubled in value in the last month and big investors coming in soon could see it double again by next week. People love to chase a rising star.”\nUnfortunately, ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ didn’t disclose to the Independent exactly where his knowledge of these ‘big investors’ coming ‘soon’ had come from.

As such, \"it's a bit of a strawman to say that bitcoin maximalists think there will only be one currency. The reason crypto is zero-sum is [because] money, in general, is zero-sum.\"\nIn his analysis, global economies typically have one currency by which others are measured or held in reserve, whether it be gold or dollars. Rochard believes bitcoin is becoming that global store of value and transactional medium for the digital world, especially since other cryptocurrencies appear to be \"heavily dependent\" on it as a reserve currency.\nSo while other blockchain experts are launching multi-coin crypto hedge funds or freelancing as consultants for the tokenized fundraising projects known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), Rochard just launched Bitcoin Advisory LLC in Brooklyn, N.Y. - call it the maximalist consultancy.\nRochard wants to provide a variety of prospective investors with unadulterated insight into bitcoin.\nBut unlike with a traditional financial advisor or fund manager, clients are only paying for Rochard's time. His advice, then, won't be motivated by wanting people to invest through him or in anything offered exclusively by his company; to the contrary, he wants clients to walk away with the tools to manage their own investments.\n\"I do want to also present the case against investing in bitcoin or at least being more cautious about its valuation or more rigorous about analyzing the risks of investing in bitcoin. I don't want investors going all in on bitcoin,\" Rochard said, adding:\n\"I think that's the worst possible thing they could do, even though that might not make me popular on Twitter. There needs to be a cautious portfolio approach to bitcoin.\"\nIn fact, Rochard's wife, a financial planner herself, insisted their \"very boring\" retirement funds exclude high-risk investments like bitcoin. Objectivity needed\nThis idea that people shouldn't trust third parties and instead empower themselves fueled Rochard's passion for starting Bitcoin Advisory LLC in the first place.\nAccording to him, the thwarted \" New York Agreement ,\" in which a group of miners and businesses proposed ultimately unpopular changes to the bitcoin software, highlighted a dire need for independent advisors in this space. Since one aspect of the update was related to keeping transaction fees low for these corporate players, Rochard believes they had a vested interest to support the agreement, even though developers were worried about the effects of that change.\n\"These CEOs are the main liaison between institutional investors,\" Rochard said. \"I want to unbundle the information from the financial product.\"\nOf course, as a bitcoin maximalist Rochard isn't completely objective.\nBut he may perhaps have less conflict of interest than a service provider that benefits from pushing users and investors to certain cryptocurrencies, for example.\nAt least, in his mind:\n\"They [startup CEOs] are the ones providing views on the bitcoin ecosystem. As such, they have an effect on the way investors think about bitcoin. Their companies have an agenda with regards to bitcoin.\"\nRochard said his fidelity belongs solely to bitcoin and related projects like the lightning network, the technology many bitcoin developers are working on which looks to push transactions off-chain so that bitcoin can scale to more users in time. Community building\nIn his new role, investors who want to run their own bitcoin nodes will find Rochard to be a particularly eager educator. And it's definitely an area where expert advice could help, since running a full node can be one, quite the setup, and two, technically challenging,\nBut for Rochard, it's a crucial activity in helping users to fully realize bitcoin's potential, and ties into his engineering work (he's created several tools to tally and organize access to new contributions to Bitcoin Core software on Github).\n\"What I want to see from my own contributions to Bitcoin Core is to help accelerate the development of Bitcoin Core's wallet,\" he said.\nBecause the open-source wallet relies on Bitcoin Core nodes, which broadcast and tally transactions for bitcoin miners to validate, in contrast to lighter software wallets like Jaxx or Bread, which only facilitate transactions, Rochard said this is the best way to be fully in control of your money.\nSpeaking again to his interest in weening people off third-party systems, Rochard said, \"I generally want people to be running a full node regardless of the implementation it's in because we've seen a lot of reliance on third parties.\"\nThe new consulting gig isn't Rochard's first crack at launching a project geared towards educating people on bitcoin.\nFor instance, he co-founded the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute in March 2014 with two fellow alumni of the University of Texas at Austin, Michael Goldstein and Daniel Krawisz. The institute is essentially a free archive of reading materials related to money and cryptography from as far back as the 1970s, including a collection of emails from bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\nMore recently, Rochard and Goldstein started the Noded Bitcoin podcast , where they interview leading developers and bitcoin community influencers.\nSpeaking to his love of bitcoin, Rochard told CoinDesk:\n\"There's so much to research in bitcoin alone. After five years, I'm still peeling the bitcoin onion.\"\nImage via Pierre Rochard The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

The double spending problem has been solved; this means that it is possible to use a digital certificate to stand in the place of money and be sure that no one else can spend that certificate other than you as long as you hold it. This is an unprecedented paradigm shift, the implications of which are not yet fully understood, and for which the tools do not yet exist to fully take advantage of this new idea. This new technology requires some new thinking when it comes to developing businesses that are built upon it. In the same way that the pioneer providers of email did not correctly understand the service they were selling for many years, new and correct thinking about Bitcoin is needed, and will emerge, so that it reaches its full potential and becomes ubiquitous. The original Hotmail Interface Hotmail used familiar technologies (the browser, email) to create a better way of accessing and delivering email; the idea of using an email client like Outlook Express has been superseded by web interfaces and email ‘in the cloud’ that provides many advantages over a dedicated client with your mail in your own local storage. Bitcoin, which will transform the way you transfer money, needs to be understood on its own terms, and not just as an online form of money. Thinking about Bitcoin as money is as absurd as thinking about email as another form of sending letters by post; one not only replaces the other but it profoundly changes the way people send and consume messages. It is not a simple substitution or one dimensional improvement of an existing idea or service. As I have explained previously, Bitcoin is not money . Bitcoin is a protocol . If you treat it in this way, with the correct assumptions, you can start the process of putting Bitcoin in a proper context, allowing you to make rational suggestions about the sort of services that might be profitable based on it. Every part of Bitcoin is text. It is always text, and never at any point ceases to be text. This is a fact, and as text, it is protected under the free speech provisions of the constitutions of civilized nations with guaranteed, irrevocable rights. If Bitcoin is a protocol and not money, then setting up currency exchanges that mimic real world money, stock and commodity exchanges to trade in it is not the sole means of discovering its price. You would not set up an email exchange to discover the value of email services, and the same thing applies to Bitcoin. Staying with this train of thought, when you type in an email on your Gmail account, you are inputting your ‘letter’. You press send, it goes through your ISP, over the internets, into the ISP of your recipient and then it is outputted on your recipient’s machine. The same is true of Bitcoin; you input money on one end through a service and then send the Bitcoin to your recipient, without an intermediary to handle the transfer. Once Bitcoin does its job of moving your value across the globe to its recipient it needs to be ‘read out’, i.e. turned back into money , in the same way that your letter is displayed to its recipient in an email. In the email scenario, once the transfer happens and the email you have received conveys its information to you, it has no use other than to be a record of the information that was sent (accounting), and you archive that information. Bitcoin does this accounting on the block chain for you, and a good service built on it will store extended transaction details for you locally, but what you need to have as the recipient of Bitcoin is services or goods not Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin’s true nature is as an instant way to pay (despite not being money) anywhere in the world. It is not an investment, and holding on to it in the hopes that it will become valuable is like holding on to an email or a PDF in the hopes it will be come valuable in the future; it doesn’t make any sense. Of course, you can hold on to Bitcoin and watch its value go up, and its value will go up, but you need to have guts to weather the violent waves of selling and buying as the transition to an all Bitcoin economy gets under way. Remember also, that businesses that have a need to store Bitcoin need to be concerned about its value if their models are open ended and are exposed to the market. “Closed Circuit Bitcoin” models have control over everything and never need to worry about prices at exchanges. They can do all their business moving an unlimited amount of fiat with just a few Bitcoin. Despite the fact that you can’t double spend them and each one is unique, Bitcoins have no inherent value, unlike a book or any physical object. They cannot appreciate in value. Mistaken thinking about Bitcoin has spread because it behaves like money , due to the fact it cannot be double spent. Misrepresentation of Bitcoin’s true nature has masked Bitcoin’s dual nature of being digital and not double spendable. Razzles. They start as a candy, and then end as a gum. Before you chew them, which are they? A candy, or a gum? Bitcoin is digital, with all the qualities of information that make information non scarce. It sits in a new place that oscillates between the goods of the physical world and the infinitely abundant digital world of information, belonging exclusively to the digital world but having the characteristics of both. This is why it has been widely misunderstood and why a new approach is needed to design businesses around it. All of this goes some way to explain why the price of buying Bitcoins at the exchanges doesn’t matter for the consumer. If the cost of buying a Bitcoin goes to 1¢ This doesn't change the amount of money that comes out at the other end of a transfer. As long as you redeem your Bitcoin immediately after the transfer into either goods or currency, the same value comes out at the other end no matter what you paid for the Bitcoin when you started the process. Think about it this way. Let us suppose that you want to send a long text file to another person. You can either send it as it is, or you can compress it with zip. The size of a document file when it is zipped can be up to 87% smaller than the original. When we transpose this idea to Bitcoin, the compression ratio is the price of Bitcoin at an exchange. If a Bitcoin is $100, and you want to buy something from someone in India for $100 you need to buy 1 Bitcoin to get that $100 to India. If the price of Bitcoin is 1¢ then you need 10,000 Bitcoin to send $100 dollars to India. These would be expressed as compression ratios of 1:1 and 10,000:1 respectively. The same $100 value is sent to India, whether you use 10,000 or 1 Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoins is irrelevant to the value that is being transmitted , in the same way that zip files do not ‘care’ what is inside them; Bitcoin and zip are dumb protocols that do a job. As long as the value of Bitcoins does not go to zero, it will have the same utility as if the value were very ‘high’. Bearing all of this in mind, it’s clear that new services to facilitate the rapid, frictionless conversion into and out of Bitcoin are needed to allow it to function in a manner that is true to its nature. The current business models of exchanges are not addressing Bitcoin’s nature correctly. They are using the Twentieth Century model of stock, commodity and currency exchanges and superimposing this onto Bitcoin. Interfacing with these exchanges is non-trivial, and for the ordinary user a daunting prospect. In some cases, you have to wait up to seven days to receive a transfer of your fiat currency after it has been cashed out of your account from Bitcoins. Whilst this is not a fault of the exchanges, it represents a very real impediment to Bitcoin acting in its nature and providing its complete value. Imagine this; you receive an email from across the world, and are notified of the fact by being displayed the subject line in your browser. You then apply to your ISP to have this email delivered to you, and you have to wait seven days for it to arrive in your physical mail box. The very idea is completely absurd, and yet, this is exactly what is happening with Bitcoin, for no technical reason whatsoever. It is clear that there needs to be a re-think of the services that are growing around Bitcoin, along with a re-think of what the true nature of Bitcoin is. Rethinking services is a normal part of entrepreneurialism and we should expect business models to fail and early entrants to fall by the wayside as the ceaseless iterations and pivoting progress. Bearing all of this in mind, focussing on the price of Bitcoin at exchanges using a business model that is inappropriate for this new software simply is not rational; its like putting a methane breathing canary in a mine full of oxygen breathing humans as a detector. The bird dies even though nothing is wrong with the air; the miners rush to evacuate, leaving the exposed gold seams behind, thinking that they are all about to be wiped out, when all is actually fine. Day traders speculating on Bitcoin from home cause the price to oscillate. Its an artificial signal that has nothing to do with demand for Bitcoin and its circulation as an economic tool to facilitate commerce. Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it are here to stay. As the number of people downloading the client and using it increases, like Hotmail, it will eventually reach critical mass and then spread exponentially through the internet. When that happens, the correct business models will spontaneously emerge, as they will become obvious, in the same way that Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook, cellular phones and instant messaging seem like second nature. In the future. I imagine that very few people will speculate on the value of Bitcoin, because even though that might be possible, and even profitable, there will be more money to be made in providing easy to use Bitcoin services that take full advantages of what Bitcoin is. One thing is for sure; speed will be of the essence in any future Bitcoin business model. The startups that provide instant satisfaction on both ends of the transaction are the ones that are going to succeed. Even though the volatility of the price of Bitcoin is bound to stabilise, since it has no use in and of itself, getting back to money or goods instantly will be a sought after characteristic of any business built on Bitcoin. The needs of Bitcoin businesses provide many challenges in terms of performance, security and new thinking. Out of these challenges will come new practices and software that we can only just imagine as they come over the horizon. Finally, when there is no more fiat, and the chaotic transition zone between fiat and Bitcoin has been abolished, then everything will be priced in Bitcoin, and there will be no volatility, because no one uses anything other than Bitcoin to buy or sell. If you know any chemistry, this will be like a reaction’s reagents reaching equilibrium; you can shake it and stir it all you like; the reaction is over, and you’re left with the inert product. Right now, compared to the amount of fiat in the world, Bitcoin can expand and contract very rapidly over a large range, because it is small in volume. It can expand to what for many is an unimaginably high price, and then shrink down again. As it gets bigger and accumulates more mass (its price expressed in fiat), these fluctuations will become smaller and smaller. Through all of this, Bitcoin remains exactly the same; it is its users that are publishing numbers as a signal to react upon.

According to statements by Chinese officials, the People’s Republic is developing a national standard for blockchain technologies, which should be introduced next year. Also, the Zcash Foundation is taking steps to protect the network of the privacy coin from ASIC-based mining. Chinese giant Bitmain has recently launched its Antminer Z9 Mini designed to process transactions for cryptos like Zcash, which use the Equihash algorithm.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General China Preparing National Blockchain Standard\nChinese authorities are working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic.\nA national standard plan for blockchain is under preparation and respective departments will set up a national blockchain and distributed Accounting Technology Standardization Committee said Li Ming, director of the Blockchain Research Office at the Electronic Industry Standards Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Li Ming told the Economic Information Daily that the national blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards. He also added that the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future.\nAccording to a recent statement by Yu Kequn, director of the National Center for Information Technology Security Research, “The development of blockchain technology may become an important step for China to grasp the global technological competition.” Yu Kequn also noted that blockchain technology is a new integrated application of distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanisms, and encryption algorithms. “It has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, tamper resistance, and anonymity,” the official pointed out and added: “It can be applied in the production, management, and transaction chains, and it will bring the entire life cycle of restructuring to different areas, so that it can be managed and traceable.” Iceland’s Missing Mining Rigs May Have Been Found in China\nThe mining equipment which was stolen from data centers in Iceland several months ago might have reached China, according to media reports from the Nordic nation, which has attracted crypto miners with cheap energy and favorable conditions. At least 600 computers, graphics cards, motherboards, processors, and other hardware, worth an estimated $2 million, disappeared in a series of burglaries in December and January. Last month, Chinese authorities conducted a raid on a crypto mining farm in the city of Tianjin. According to local media, police have confiscated 600 computers used to mine cryptocurrency in the illegal facility.\nThe suspected organizer of the heist in Iceland, Sindri Thor Stefansson, fled to Sweden after escaping from a low security prison in his country. He was recently arrested in Amsterdam and is now awaiting extradition to Iceland, where he is going to face trial. The ongoing investigation and the court proceedings are expected to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding one of the biggest burglaries in Iceland’s history. Tracing the stolen mining equipment is a priority for authorities trying to get to the bottom of this case. Their findings should prove or dismiss the media speculation around the possible connection between the two incidents. Zcash Opposes ASIC-Based Mining after Chinese Giant Launches Equihash Miner\nDevelopers of Zcash have stated that the struggle against ASIC-supported mining is a priority. They have indicated their opposition after the launch of a new application specific circuit designed to process transactions for the privacy coin. Zencash, a Zcash fork, has also announced plans to potentially change its algorithm for the same reason. Earlier in May, the Chinese mining giant Bitmain revealed the upcoming release of a new device that will be capable of working with the Equihash algorithm, which was itself introduced to prevent ASIC mining and is used by Zcash and other cryptos. ASICs were initially developed to mine mainly bitcoin. The highly specialized hardware is capable of handling the enormous number of calculations involved in the processing of its transactions.\nBitmain has a track record of successfully overcoming ASIC-resistant algorithms. The mining equipment producer has already developed powerful miners for many cryptocurrencies whose developers have tried to stop the centralization of hashing power. These include miners for the algorithms Ethash, used by the Ethereum network, and Cryptonight, used by Monero. The new Antminer Z9 Mini, developed to mine Zcash, Zencash, and others, offers a hashrate of 10k Sol/s. It was expected to hit the market in June, but according to the manufacturer, it can be ordered now. “To prevent hoarding and to let more individuals worldwide get one, we’ve set a limit of one miner per user,” Bitmain said in a tweet .\nThe management of the Zcash Foundation has decided to allocate resources to study the influence of ASIC mining on the network. An advisory council will be convened to provide a “scientifically grounded answer” to the problem. The team behind Zcash, however, may be forced to fight a war on two fronts, after researchers from the University College London recently found a vulnerability in the crypto’s algorithms. They believe that certain patterns in Zcash transactions significantly weaken its anonymity. The claim is that when the cryptocurrency is transferred from unprotected to protected addresses and then back again, the overall level of anonymity decreases significantly. Student Leaves China after Losing on Crypto Investments\nA Chinese college student has reportedly lost a small fortune by local standards due to unwise crypto investments and has already left the country in search of better opportunities to compensate the losses. Liu Ke, a sophomore in his twenties, used all his money to buy cryptocurrency, mostly aircoins, when markets were going up towards the end of last year. When cryptos were hitting their all-time highs, he spent a total of 140,000 yuan (~$23,000), including amounts he borrowed from online micro loan platforms like Alipay and Baidu. He even “invested” the money for his tuition fees. Liu Ke told the local outlet 8btc that he now lives and works in the Cambodian coastal resort Sihanoukville, where he hopes to earn more money to cover his debts.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s stories in Bitcoin in Brief?

Specifically, Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), Huobi Token (HT), and Skycoin (SKY). Meanwhile, the more well-known altcoins, such as Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC) are all down.\nWe’re going to focus on the three alternative coins and token today — Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), Huobi Token (HT), and Skycoin (SKY). Bitcoin Diamond (BCD)\nBitcoin Diamond (BCD) is currently selling for $5.51. This puts BCD up 14.71% in the past twenty-four hours. Not bad, right? BCD has a market capitalization of $846.81 million. Source: CoinMarketCap\nSo far, Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) has had a successful month of May. The latest announcement from the Bitcoin Diamond team came on Monday. At the start of the week, Bitcoin Diamond announced that it will be listing on the SWFT blockchain platform. If you don’t know, SWFT is a cross-blockchain platform. Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is now listed on SWFT Platform. You can start trading on https://t.co/ErgwJHHCQX or download the app and start making money💰\nHow?

Further, last week, Bitcoin Diamond provided development and operation progress for the month of April. It cited support from exchanges, like OKcoinkr.com and KEX.kr, and support from the media. For instance, both Reuters and Nasdaq have reported on the alternative coin. Additionally, on May 1, it was announced that Coinw listed Bitcoin Diamond (BCD). $BCD just listed on Coinw exchange!

This puts Huobi Token (HT) up 14.04% in the past twenty-four hours. Huobi Token (HT) has a market cap of $183.60 million. HT is below Factom (FCT) and ahead of Achain (ACT). Source: CoinMarketCap\nDespite being a newbie to the crypto markets, Huobi Token (HT) has managed to develop the reputation of being a coin that offers solid volatility. Over the past two months, Huobi Token (HT) has made waves, even when the crypto market was faced with a crash. In April, Huobi Token (HT) collected roughly 83% of gains during the last 30 days.\nSo, what’s happened in May so far? Is there a reason Huobi Token (HT) is up nearly 15% in the past twenty-four hours? Huobi doesn’t appear to have announced anything today, but that doesn’t mean the markets aren’t optimistic about the value of this token. In fact, one report stated that because Huobi didn’t go through an initial coin offering, and its structure makes sure investors are keen to have the token no matter what, Huobi Token’s (HT) value has a chance of increasing.\nWhat do you think? Skycoin (SKY)\nSkycoin (SKY) is currently selling for $26.38. This puts Skycoin (SKY) up 10.83% in the past twenty-four hours. Source: CoinMarketCap\nSkycoin has been pretty quiet since early April. On April 12, it was announced that Skycoin (SKY) is now trading on CHAOEX. However, word surfaced this week that Skycoin (SKY) will be added to five “upcoming high volume exchanges” soon. Skycoin has not said anything about this, so keep your eyes peeled to see if this really is happening.\n>>EOS, TRON, and Stellar; Big Things Ahead Was wondering why $sky $skycoin been slowly creeping up. 3 more big exchanges adding it soon.

The public authorities’ intentions may be confronted with a rush towards cryptocurrencies as many Australians won’t take these newly added controls lightly. Australian Government May Trigger Rush to Bitcoin Amid Ban on A$10,000 Cash Payments\nAt the announcement of the Black Economy Standing Taskforce, Australia’s government Treasurer Scott Morrison explained that the commission is preparing a rigorous identification system and mobile strike teams in order to better detect illegal cash transactions. Additionally, the task force will establish a black economy hotline for people to denounce suspicious cash transactions.\n“The Government will introduce a cash payment limit of A$10,000 on payments made to businesses. This will not cover individual-to-individual transactions. The cash limit is aimed at reducing opportunities for criminals to launder the proceeds of crime into goods and services or for businesses to hide transactions to reduce their tax liabilities.”\nThe official document added that the task force will be consulting the community and industry on the most effective way to implement this limit and to consider whether exemptions are warranted. The recommendation to strengthen anti-money laundering laws includes cracking down on unregulated money exchanges.\n“Cash provides an easy, anonymous and largely untraceable mechanism for conducting black economy activity. Cash payments make it easier to under-report income and avoid tax obligations. This allows businesses transacting in cash to undercut competitors and gain a competitive advantage.”\nIn order to extinguish the $50 billion black economy, the Aussie government proposes to ban all cash payments over A$10,000 made to businesses for goods and services from July 1, 2019. Treasurer Morrison explained the effort in his Budget speech.\n“This will be bad news for criminal gangs, terrorists and those who are just trying to cheat on their tax or get a discount for letting someone else cheat on their tax. It’s not clever. It’s not OK. It’s a crime.”\nThe task force also refers to the gig economy as a threat. The government plans to enforce greater scrutiny over workers in the sharing economy, as well as requiring payments into bank accounts instead of cash-in-hand payments, ‘encouraging the transition to a digital society.’\nThe cryptocurrency industry, as the ultimate digital society, offers a number of solutions as the government wishes to exterminate payments in cash. Naturally, a number of individuals that want to steer clear of official economic activity might adopt untraceable digital currencies such as Monero or Zcash . Australians might also turn to Bitcoin et al. for official transactions as people find increasingly few reasons to use fiat money and be subject to the will of the central bank.

The turnout the following year nearly doubled to 2,700 attendees. This year, the event is expected to attract about 8,000 people, half of whom are coming from outside of the United States .\nSluymer said, historically, bitcoin has increased each year after Consensus, one of Blockchain Week's largest events, which includes a hackathon and blockchain job fair, had taken place.\nIn fact, in 2015, the digital currency increased 23 percent after Consensus.\n\"Not a huge amount considering how volatile cryptos are,\" the technician said. \"But then it moved up around year-end for about another 100 percent move.\"\nBitcoin continued to edge upwards in 2016, about 10 percent after the Consensus event, and then an additional 80 percent by year's end, Sluymer said. The large-cap digital coin soared even more — 69 percent — around 2017's Blockchain Week.

The platform is designed to offer detailed reviews of global blockchain projects by renowned experts in academia, industry and government bodies.\nPreviously, the CCID had established the Blockchain Research Institute and the China Ecological Blockchain Alliance, which are assigned to strengthen industry, policy research and blockchain technology. The organizations also provide software research and testing to China’s government.\nThe conference introduced blockchain experts to the CCID’s latest work in public chain identification. The association’s Blockchain Research Institute has garnered most of its data through the cooperation of the CCID Think Tank, the China Software Testing Center and other departments built to scientifically evaluate global public chain technology and further blockchain innovation. In the future, the CCID hopes to provide professional consulting services to blockchain businesses, government branches, technology developers and research institutes, thus paving the way for further blockchain adoption.\nDuring the event, representatives stated what was necessary to identify public chain objects: An application must possess its own independent main chain. Any entity should be able to freely create and operate a full node on the network. It should have a published block explorer where information is easily tracked. It must run on open-source code. Its primary team members should be easy to contact through its website.\nThese regulations have allowed the organization to identify several public chain objects including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano and NEO, among others. The first Global Public Chain Assessment will be formally announced this coming week, while the CCID’s website will serve as its official publishing platform.\nThe conference was hosted by Dr. Songtao Pu of the CCID Think Tank. Additional panelists included Dr. Qian Liu from the organization’s software institute, Dr. Tao Lv from the China Software Testing Center, and Anlei Wei from the CCID Blockchain Research Institute.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in China was established in 2008 as a government body under the country’s state council to administer China’s industrial branches and information industry. Its primary duties include determining China’s industrial planning, standards and policies; promoting the development of major equipment and innovation in China’s communications arena; guiding the construction of information systems; and instilling necessary protection for these systems.\nServing directly under the Ministry, the CCID seeks to develop information industries in China and bridge the gaps between government and business ventures by providing research, evaluations and certifications to ongoing data projects.

Millions watched online.\nAnd they all hear dear Mr Buffett bash Bitcoin to bits.\nBerkshire Hatchway's annual general meetings are eagerly awaited all year round. These meetings always have something in store for everyone tuning in. If you haven't seen the video, read what our analysts have been saying about it - Richa , a leader in the small cap space; Ankit also known as the Insider; and Taha - a follower of Graham, Buffet's guru, have all shared their takeaways from the meeting.\nAmong a range of topics discussed, there was invariably a question on bitcoin, and this is what I want to talk about today.\nWhen asked why he thinks bitcoin is a bubble, Buffet dismissed it by saying that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are speculative and are not productive.\nWarren Buffet doesn't like Bitcoin because... 'it's not a value producing asset'. --- Advertisement --- This Piece of Paper in Your Wallet Could Potentially Make You a Fortune... You may have a few of these lying around in your wallet... Or not... Either way, you need to know this. This secret has changed lives forever - and it could change yours. Click here for the full story…\nBut so what? Neither is cash or gold . The only reason the US dollar has value is because people perceive it as having value. Otherwise it's just a flimsy piece of paper.\nBuffet then went on to equating cryptos to a cheque: 'You know, the cheque is a wonderful idea. Just imagine how the world would be without being able to write cheque or have wire transfer of funds. But it doesn't make the cheque intrinsically itself worth a lot of money.' However, Mr. Buffett is wrong\nComparing bitcoin with a cheque makes no sense because bitcoin does not represent money, it IS money.\nIf someone sent me a cheque for Rs 10,000, that cheque is just a promise to give me rupees. When someone sends me bitcoin, it is instantly spendable in its current form. I need not 'cash a cheque' because bitcoin is already money.\nDo not think of bitcoin as a means to transfer rupees, it holds value by itself.\nBuffet then goes on to show the differences between purchasing a farm and bitcoin. 'If you buy a farm, apartment or a business and look to the asset itself to determine whether you've done something, what the farm produces, what the business earns and so on... and it's a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you''Now if you buy something like bitcoin ... you don't have anyone producing, you're just hoping the next guy pays more. If you ban trading in farms, you could still buy farms and have a perfectly decent investment ... But if you ban trading in tulips, or bitcoin ... people would say 'why in the world would I buy it.' You aren't investing when you do that. You're speculating.'\nWhile Buffett is right to say bitcoin in itself has no intrinsic material value, and derives it only from demand and supply, it is in that sense exactly like any currency.\nYou can't plant a rupee or a dollar, watch it grow and expect dividends out of it.\nYou, however, can buy a stock because you think other people will be willing to pay more for it.\nAlmost everyone buys stocks for one reason which is: because they think it will be worth more later.\nHaving said that, much of the cryptocurrency craze is built up on speculation, and on that singular front, Mr Buffett is absolutely right. Most cryptos thrive on speculation and have little to nothing to show for a 'product'.\nI've been saying the same too - I believe 95% of all cryptos are bound to end up as failures .\nHowever, the point that makes Buffett right, is also where he goes wrong. You see, the mistake is to assume speculation as the complete extent of the technology.\nCryptos, along with the blockchain can offer a variety of solutions for businesses of all sizes, ranging from trustless payment gateways, to immutable record keeping.\nThis obviously has real world applications and goes way beyond mere speculation.\nToo often traditional investors forget Bitcoin is actually a technology infrastructure.\nBitcoin has fueled huge amounts of innovation over the last few years. The revolutionary blockchain technology has shown that there are alternatives to many industries and assets.\nAs we all know, Buffet only invests in things he understands. And, by his own admission, he doesn't understand technology. Buffet admitted that he missed investing in Google and Amazon, which proved to be costly mistakes.\nTalking about missing out on Google, Buffett and his deputy Charlie Munger admitted their age (87 and 94, respectively) mean some tech investments may pass them by:\n'We were not ideally located to be high-tech wizards,' Munger said, adding 'I have been to Google headquarters.

Bitcoin Cash 7-day chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\nBitcoin Cash’s price needs to reach around $2000 to take the 3rd spot. This is highly possible as BCH increased from $600 to $1700 in one month. The coin has had a 5.57% growth rate over the past 24 hours.\nMany speculate the fork which will happen on the 15th of May might be the main factor in BCH beating XRP. The fork is an upgrade to BCH. The block size of Bitcoin cash is upgraded from 8 megabytes to 32 megabytes. The update will also allow developers to create smart contracts on the bitcoin cash network.\nThere is a lot of speculation that the fork will increase the number of BCH transactions due to increasing speed and reduction in the price of transactions. The volumes are rising and many people are investing in the coin, especially in Asia. Bitcoin Cash is widely popular in Asia, especially South Korea and Japan.\nThe coin was recently promoted and uplifted by Akari Global . The coin recently has been in the big stories like the Roger Ver Lawsuit which was canceled due to the lack of funds and the London Block exchange now accepting BCH.\nLexGrom, Reddit user comments on the Fork:\n“Darwinian evolution.

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Bitcoin Cash [BCH] looks to take #3 position from Ripple [XRP]\nPublished Anirudh VK Source: Wikimedia Commons\nRipple [XRP] is feeling the burn from Bitcoin Cash [BCH], with a $3 billion difference in the overall market cap of the two. The fight is for the #3 position, which holds a lot of assumed power as being in the top 3 most traded coins.\nRipple is currently still at the number 3 position with a market cap of $31.44 billion. Bitcoin Cash is close behind with $28.57 billion. Bitcoin Cash needs a 15.15% hike in price to take over Ripple’s position as the number 3 biggest currency by market cap. This would mean that a price increase to close to $1900 would break Ripple’s position in the top 3, assuming XRP doesn’t change in price.\nAfter a week of decline, Ripple is staying stable today after rallying from a low point of $0.77 yesterday. It continues to hover around the $0.80 mark, occasionally falling below and going above over the day. Its seven-day decline rounds up to 6.86%. It had a series of sharp declines from $0.91 to $0.87 on May 6 th , further down to $0.80 on May 7 th .\nBitcoin Cash, on the other hand, saw an uptick this week, probably due to the upcoming hard fork on May 15 th . Ripple also has significant events lined up this week, such as the Community night on May 15th featuring Snoop Dogg .\nAlthough its status as a security has been subject to a large amount of FUD, investors have compared it to the likes of Netflix and Amazon before it. Poster gamedev268 said on the Ripple subreddit that:\n“Just like Netflix and Amazon before that Ripple/XRP gets a ton of FUD because it is a threat to established businesses.”\nHe went on to say that Ripple and the XRP token suffers a worse problem as it is attacked on two front; by the threat Ripple poses to big central banks and the SWIFT protocol, and also as an attack to Bitcoin and its surrounding philosophies.\nHe finished by saying:\n“No one would care to write up blatant lies and FUD if they didn’t see XRP as a threat. Hold tight, XRP’s enemies can see the writing on the wall.” Bitcoin [BTC] versus Bitcoin Cash [BCH], the fiery debate continues with insights from Vinny Lingham\nPublished Aman Swami Source: Wikipedia\nCivic CEO popularly known as the Bitcoin Oracle, Vinny Lingham, has weighed in on the Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash debate.\nLingham has been involved in the cryptocurrency industry for years and describes himself as an active investor focused on blockchain technology projects.\nLingham’s Civic is an identity verification project which allows users to prove their identity with blockchain technology.\nThe debate between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash advocates has raged since the inception of the ‘Cash’ cryptocurrency during a hard fork in 2017. Proponents of both coins laud their cryptocurrency as the one true Bitcoin, often pointing out the limitations of the opposing technology to substantiate their claims.\nOne of the major differences between the two blockchains is their approach towards scaling. While Bitcoin opts to implement Segregated Witness and second-layer scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, Bitcoin Cash relies on increased block sizes.\nCurrently, Bitcoin Cash is a lot cheaper to transfer and use, while Bitcoin is perceived to be more stable and widespread.\nLingham said:\n“At the moment, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are focusing on two completely different markets. Bitcoin Cash is most commonly used for fast payments, as a medium of exchange, and Bitcoin is the better suited for store of value, in my opinion”\nHe added:\n“When I look at it from the product standpoint, I think the greater demand is for peer-to-peer cash than for digital gold, given the size and velocity of the markets.”\nHe further said that however there is still uncertainty about the potential adoption of Bitcoin Cash. It remains to be seen if the network effect around Bitcoin Cash can grow faster than Bitcoin’s. The question remains about Bitcoin Cash’s capability to catch up to Bitcoin if it focuses just on payments.\nBitcoin Cash is designed to function as a substitute, and possible replacement, for cash as it offers fungibility and security. While cryptocurrencies have steadily gained the attention of mainstream consumers, Lingham said there is a long way to go before they could replace cash as a medium of exchange.\nHe said what we are seeing now is the beginning of a token economy.\nLingham says:\n“Blockchain technologies are changing the way the world functions, and I believe this is just the beginning of the token economy. The adoption of the infrastructure, the cost of transactions and network security will be in relation to primary value of the token infrastructure. It will not be pegged to the value of the underlying assets on that network, but rather the activity levels for trading those assets”\nHe predicted the demand for Ethereum and Bitcoin would rise on fiat-to-crypto exchanges in the short term, leading to possible widespread adoption and utilization of the technology in mainstream applications.\nLingham concluded:\n“Given that these token assets can typically only be purchased on exchanges that accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum will rise at the fiat onramps. However, it’s not far-fetched to believe that you could one day buy a CoffeeCoin, blockchain-based stock, or Civic token directly via your bank or brokerage account with the token economy’s growth and becomes more mainstream.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T08:42:29.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1f6b8bdef35839331c6d27199b1599ff97ea1a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDccd5cDM.l6wACIWRfX7Kge6852o96qNz3x.xhpAIVnxoAd5_4Mq2PpigUQWmgdO6sDsL5KUgiDXDm2mMEKVpagVR7yJRvpn60", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - Huawei to Offer First Crypto Wallet App in Latest Smartphones - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - Huawei to Offer First Crypto Wallet App in Latest Smartphones - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/huawei.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1f6b8bdef35839331c6d27199b1599ff97ea1a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDccd5cDM.l6wACIWRfX7Kge6852o96qNz3x.xhpAIVnxoAd5_4Mq2PpigUQWmgdO6sDsL5KUgiDXDm2mMEKVpagVR7yJRvpn60", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - Huawei to Offer First Crypto Wallet App in Latest Smartphones - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New – Huawei to Offer First Crypto Wallet App in Latest Smartphones Best New – Huawei to Offer First Crypto Wallet App in Latest Smartphones Best New Cryptocurrency By root / May 11, 2018\nChinese telecommunications firm and smartphone maker Huawei is partnering with BTC.com to roll out a mobile cryptocurrency app for the tech giant’s newly launched app store.\nBTC.com, which is owned by mining giant Bitmain, tracks cryptocurrency mining and block information, while also providing a digital wallet service. The site’s vice president for business operations, Alejandro de la Torre, said its new wallet application will appear in Huawei’s proprietary app store, AppGallery, which was launched in March.\nCurrently, AppGallery is only available for customers via a pre-install on the latest Huawei devices, but will be rolled out for older versions in the second quarter of this year. That said, the effort to boost cryptocurrency wallet support is still a notable move by Huawei to bring cryptocurrency services to a potentially wider use base.\n“Cryptocurrencies have recently expanded the human understanding of digital economy at a large scale … We expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future,” said Dr. Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei Mobile Services.\nHuawei’s move also comes at a time when the tech giant is moving to beef up its wider effort for blockchain development.\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, Huawei launched its blockchain-as-a-service platform just last month – one built on Hyberledger Fabric 1.0 technology developed by the Linux Foundation’s Hyberledger blockchain consortium, of which Huawei has been a member since 2016.\nHuawei image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

ONG repeatedly told the agent, who was posing as a member of a drug trafficking group, that he did not want to know the source of the cash so that he would have ‘plausible deniability.’ Even after ONG registered as a money transmitter, he made little effort to comply with regulations about reporting suspicious transactions. At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik imposed three years of supervised release and noted that ONG will likely be unable to return to the U.S. from Canada.\n“The dark web is not a free pass for crime and mayhem,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes. “As this defendant knew full well, the laws and rules apply to crypto currency dealings just as they do to other types of financial transactions. I commend Homeland Security Investigations for their ongoing work to police the Internet – including the Dark Web — to root out those who undermine public safety for all of us.”\nAccording to records filed in the case, in December 2016, federal law enforcement responded to an ad ONG had placed regarding buying and selling bitcoin – a cryptocurrency that can be used for purchases on the dark web and elsewhere. Later in December, and again in February and March 2017, ONG traveled to the Seattle area to exchange cash for bitcoin. At various times the undercover agents specifically told ONG that the funds they were exchanging for bitcoin came from drug trafficking. ONG repeatedly told them he did not want to hear that so that he had ‘plausible deniability.’\nIn May 2017, ONG was observed by other HSI agents in Blaine, Washington running cash through a bill counter while sitting in his car. The agents informed him he needed to register as a money remitter with FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Treasury whose mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use and money laundering . ONG registered with FinCEN, and informed Homeland Security that he had done so. However, even after registering he failed to follow FinCEN regulations requiring the reporting of suspicious transactions – including three more with undercover agents.\nONG was arrested in the midst of his sixth financial transaction with undercover law enforcement agents. After each of the exchanges for bitcoin, law enforcement used licensed cryptocurrency exchanges to return the government funds to cash. As part of his plea agreement, ONG is forfeiting both cash and bitcoin now valued at more than $1 million.\nONG was indicted on August 16, 2017 and pleaded guilty on February 15, 2018. He was released on bond to reside with his sister in Los Angeles, California after being held for 20 days at the Federal Detention Center at SeaTac.\nWhile on home restrictions in Los Angeles, ONG volunteered with a variety of homeless organizations and today tearfully told the court he now realizes “how his actions (as an illegal money transmitter) facilitated more people being exposed to addictive substances.”\nThe case was investigated by Homeland Security Investigations and is being prosecuted by Special Assistant United States Attorney Joe Silvio. Mr. Silvio is an attorney with Homeland Security Investigations who is specially designated to prosecute cases in federal court.
