Current statistics show the BCH chain will halve its reward from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH on or around April 6, 2020, and with more than 80 percent of BCH now in circulation, when the next halving takes place the decentralized asset will be much harder to obtain.\nAlso read: Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin\nBitcoin Cash Has Less Than Two Years Left Until the 2020 Reward Halving Bitcoin Cash has great worth to a lot of digital asset proponents and the cryptocurrency has gained in value tremendously over the past nine months. One benefit that BCH advocates appreciate is the fact that the currency has digital scarcity. There will never be more than 21 million BCH in existence and right now there is a circulating supply of 17.1 million. More than 80 percent of BCH has been mined into existence since the end of April and the BCH hashrate has been around 3.5 to 4.5 exahash per second. At this speed alone, with just 13 mining pools, the next halving date will be on or around April 6, 2020 . After this date, BCH miners will lose half the current block reward (12.5 BCH) and receive 6.25 BCH and fees per block mined.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) protocol is set to halve its block reward on or around the year 2020 depending on hashrate speed. Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts appreciate the fact that BCH will grow gradually harder to obtain over time due to Satoshi Nakamoto's built-in supply limit, which introduced a different kind of 'digital scarcity' — one that's backed by the Bitcoin Cash hashrate. This day in age, with computer files like MP3s or JPEGs, we typically think about these digital items differently because they are easily duplicated. The decentralized currency BCH cannot be duplicated so easily, as it's re-enforced by 3.5 to 4.5 exahash of power validating all the ledger transactions. The system keeps miners sincere because they are economically incentivized to stay honest, unlike traditional systems and public officials trusted today. As time goes by and the mining hashrate continues to increase, the BCH network becomes much more expensive to besiege by making a 51% or double spend attack harder every passing day.\nNo More Quantitative Easing or Bailouts Digital scarcity makes Bitcoin Cash far more valuable than the fiat notes printed by governments and central banks because the code does not allow for mass fiat printing and quantitative easing. The U.S. dollar, for example, has been devalued considerably over time making it lose purchasing power year after year. Extreme USD printing began after the adoption of the Bretton Woods system, throughout the eighties and nineties and then with the bailed-out banks who received billions of printed dollars after the 2008 'economic crisis.' Bitcoin Cash will always be finite and allow users to conserve or spend, because their ownership is defined by a protocol that continues to strengthen its security daily. There is no monetary system out there that allows for true transferable digital value like Satoshi Nakamoto's clever invention.\nSatoshi put a cap on the supply for a reason and this can be seen in the genesis block's famous text. After April 6, 2020, in another four years or less the reward will again halve, and continue to halve until the last coins are found on or around the year 2140. Halvings in the past have shown consistent price rises following these events, which confirms proponents appreciate the genius of Nakamoto's digital scarcity. Sending people a nice fraction of BCH is cool, but people will also admire how scarce the decentralized asset is unlike the devalued fiat currencies in their wallet.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash halving that takes place every four years? Let us know your thoughts on the subject of digital scarcity in the comments below.\nImages via Shutterstock, Fork.lol, and the UK Times 2009.\nNow live, Satoshi Pulse.

gone, obviously personal hand is less, mostly in the platform, the hands of large investors and institutions, and these people are in a bear market is declining currency is worth ponder, from the BTC now has been extended to certain currencies with special properties, currency flow in the down market trading in reducing the economic characteristics of the supply.\nSo I think the bigger bull market is about to come to the end of the history of the financial characteristics of the currency market is about to enter the global burst cycle, let us together verify the biggest bull market in history

Bitcoin 19 Views\nProminent Japanese conglomerate, GMO Internet Inc., has taken another significant step in its quest to excel in the cryptocurrency market. On May 31, 2018, the firm announced the launching of an in-game rewards system called CryptoChips. About CryptoChips\nGMO announced the crypto gaming rewards system via a press release on the company’s website. In recent times, GMO has expanded from an Internet company, into a significant player in the domestic cryptocurrency scene in Japan. Sponsored Links\nAccording to GMO, CryptoChips is an application that enables players to earn rewards while playing games. These rewards can be obtained by achieving specific milestones in these games and, more importantly, CryptoChips will be launched with bitcoin support. GMO also said that the bitcoin-based in-game rewards system would first be installed its own real-time territorial battle strategy game, “Whimsical War.”\nStarting from August 2018, players of the game will receive rewards in bitcoin based on their rankings in the game. Whimsical War ( Source : GMO)\nAccording to the press release:\n“CryptoChips can be mounted on the game application and allows players to receive cryptocurrency as remuneration within the game – like “secret pocket money” – depending on the players’ rankings or when players have achieved missions or acquired items. The players must have their wallets (cryptocurrency accounts) to receive the remuneration (cryptocurrencies).”\nPart of the company’s goal is to improve people’s familiarity and understanding of the nascent cryptocurrency market. GMO plans to use the famous gaming industry as a veritable platform for educating people on cryptocurrencies. Whimsical War is available for download on the iOS and Android. GMO Internet and the Bitcoin Market\nFrom large-scale mining to wallet services, GMO has been making significant inroads in the cryptosphere. In September 2017, the company announced its decision to embark on bitcoin mining with an initial investment of $3 million. By December 2017, there were reports that the company had officially initiated its bitcoin mining enterprise in Northern Europe. The choice of Northern Europe was to cut cost based on the availability of cheap electricity and the cold climatic conditions.\nGMO uses cutting-edge 7nm chips to power its mining operations. In addition to its location-based mining endeavors, GMO also announced that it planned to offer cloud mining services as well as build a series of “next generation mining boards.”\nIn March 2018, BTCManager reported that GMO had already raked in bitcoin mining revenues exceeding $3 million. In only three months, the company had mined 240 bitcoin (BTC) and 525 Bitcoin Cash (BCH). By May 2018, GMO had reportedly mined over 900 BTC and 537 BCH respectively.\nThe company made significant efforts to enhance its hashrate to improve its mining efficiency. As part of its efforts, the company also declared its intention to contribute resources into R&D for more sophisticated mining chips. The company also pays a percentage of its staff salaries in bitcoin.

This list is essential if you're serious about making money from Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies .\nBut what is a Bitcoin exchange, and how can you be sure you sign up to the best Bitcoin exchange? Well, think of Bitcoin exchanges as digital marketplaces for people to buy and sell Bitcoins using different currencies. The Bitcoin can be exchanged for either fiat money (legal tender) or other alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. The exchange serves as the middleman for traders of the cryptocurrency.\nBeing able to purchase Bitcoin is the initial step to trading in it. Just like trading a stock, Bitcoin exchanges charge transaction fees, which range from 0 to 1%. In order to trade Bitcoin on an exchange, the user needs to have an account, and go through a series of steps to be verified. Remember that Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies are a completely digital currency, and there are no physical Bitcoins.\nHowever, before plunging in with both feet, users should be aware of what to look for in choosing a Bitcoin exchange for their cryptocurrency transactions. This is analogous to the issues and potential pitfalls in making a choice of where to do your banking, or open an online brokerage account. Furthermore, bear in mind that unlike banks and stock trading, Bitcoin trading is largely unregulated by most countries, although this is changing as its popularity increases.\nA good place to start is to look at the virtual coins which are supported by an exchange. With over 4,000 cryptocurrencies, and additional ones being added all the time, it is key to figure out which currencies you want to trade in, and then match the exchange that deals in those. For example, Ethereum mining has recently become more popular, but not all Bitcoin exchanges support this alternative cryptocurrency. Bitcoin vs distributed ledger vs Ethereum vs blockchain explained Language barriers\nNext look at the country that is hosting the Bitcoin exchange. Some are in less regulated countries, and there may be additional problems if something goes awry. This can include time differences, international long distance costs, and language barriers. In general, it’s preferable to find an exchange that speaks your language.\nAdditionally, pay close attention to the fees levied. While all these exchanges charge transaction fees – after all, they are businesses looking to make a profit – as the user, it is obviously best to find one with the lowest costs in order to maximize your own profits.\nAlso look for a secure trading platform, and a Bitcoin exchange which has robust security measures. After all, you wouldn’t use a bank that didn’t have a vault, and stored its money on the counter…\nDesirable security features include two-factor authentication, SMS or email alerts, encrypted emails, and wallet monitoring. A smartphone app can also be very useful in terms of accessing and monitoring funds – but equally, poorly implemented software can represent a security risk.\nFinally, look for an exchange which is doing a good volume of trading – in other words, one with a high number of trading pairs, and high liquidity.\nNow that we know the features to look for in the best Bitcoin exchanges, let’s move on to pick out our particular favorites.\nThe biggest exchange out there Streamlined interface Wide currency support Insurance protection available\nThis is a US-based exchange which was founded in 2012, and it supports over 32 countries. Coinbase exchanges Bitcoin and the alternative cryptocurrencies of Ethereum and Litecoin, and it’s the largest of the exchanges, claiming $20 billion (£15 billion) in currency exchanged. In 2014 Coinbase created GDAX, the Global Digital Asset Exchange which was developed for professionals with high volumes of trading.\nThe firm offers a mobile wallet, offline storage, and insurance protection for currency stored on its servers. Coinbase supports several fiat currencies: British Pounds, US Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Singapore Dollars.\nThe Coinbase exchange has a 1% flat fee for each purchase, while cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are done without any fees. A streamlined user interface which is ideal for novice traders – and fast trades – makes Coinbase a popular exchange with traders.\nRegulated exchange from the Winklevoss twins Low fees Accepts ACH transfers Interface isn’t very novice-friendly\nGemini Exchange is another US-based outfit founded by the Winklevoss twins – the pair who sued Mark Zuckerberg over social networking, and were awarded $65 million (£48 million), which they put to use as venture capitalists. This exchange is based in New York, and is available in 45 US states, as well as the UK, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.\nGemini’s only supported fiat currency is US dollars, and it only trades Bitcoin and Ethereum. Gemini does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees, and levies a low flat rate of 0.25% for trades, to both the buyer and the seller.\nAnother advantage of Gemini is that it’s a New York state limited liability trust company, and is regulated by New York’s Department of Financial Services. Close proximity to the Wall Street financial markets allows the company to easily provide a bridge from more traditional investments to newer cryptocurrency markets, for both individual and institutional investors.\nGemini is also notable in that it accepts ACH transfers for fast access to money for trades. A potential downside is that the interface is not particularly novice-friendly.\nFrom the team that created MinerGate Supports lots of cryptocurrencies Competitive in terms of fees Relative newcomer on the scene\nChangelly is a cryptocurrency exchange with support for many more virtual currencies than most, including Monero, Dash, Bytecoin, and DigitalNote among others. If you are mining a less popular currency, chances are that Changelly can exchange it for you.\nThis exchange comes from the popular mining platform MinerGate which provides a merged mining pool across Windows, Mac, Linux and Android operating systems. While Changelly focuses on exchanges between different cryptocurrencies, users can also purchase cryptocurrency with US Dollars or Euros.\nNote that this exchange has a shorter track record, as it only entered the market in 2016. Exchange fees are 0.5% on transactions.\nAn exchange that supports literally hundreds of cryptocurrencies Supports a huge number of virtual currencies Low trading fee Sprawling and rather unwieldy website\nCryptopia was founded in 2014, aiming to be a comprehensive exchange that focuses on the user experience, with integration of additional services including a marketplace and wallet. It is based in Christchurch, New Zealand. Cryptopia is notable in that the first level of verification happens very quickly, and only requires an email address for initial verification.\nWhile Cryptopia does not support fiat money trading, it does support a ridiculously large number of cryptocurrencies: over 400 to date, with more being added all the time. The trading fee is also a low 0.20% per transaction, which compares favorably with many competitors. The website is quite large and sprawling, meaning that new users might find their first experiences with the site a little daunting.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/", "https://changelly.com/", "https://www.techradar.comhttps://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-bitcoin-exchange", "https://gemini.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T22:26:09.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0519c9b4d4877777deadda924b8aa6d6f583942", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwaez9tRfpoUmxJvWMzQZJeTTSKp50Dm7V0NtjibyF4pdQ.Xs5pBueP7XZNWhvhdsWojWs5gd7zZ.tX3I2gDJ5_W3ibpHyBARo-", "site_full": "feedjunkie.com", "site": "feedjunkie.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/feedjunkie", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Feedjunkie.com", "title": "The best Bitcoin exchange of 2018", "title_full": "The best Bitcoin exchange of 2018", "published": "2018-06-02T21:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0519c9b4d4877777deadda924b8aa6d6f583942", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwaez9tRfpoUmxJvWMzQZJeTTSKp50Dm7V0NtjibyF4pdQ.Xs5pBueP7XZNWhvhdsWojWs5gd7zZ.tX3I2gDJ5_W3ibpHyBARo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Techradar - All the latest technology news", "published": "2018-06-02T21:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "The best Bitcoin exchange of 2018", "text": "The best Bitcoin exchange of 2018 We’ve picked out the very best places to trade in cryptocurrencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T21:47:24.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abf9bc652174e7611e4970758bba688a54fac71e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLWMupqZb7fy9JZ.cx9wCjiP9ddK6cS3jcM83gzlYotPAHnivSw4K0lTqXEaWoWcd5SgArVdY1o78VVKbsXhMj27oyo0olT9Xs-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – Zimbabwe Exchange Granted “Interim Relief,” Ban Appeal Still Ongoing", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Zimbabwe Exchange Granted “Interim Relief,” Ban Appeal Still Ongoing", "published": "2018-06-02T21:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bitcoin-Zimbabwe-Exchange-Granted-“Interim-Relief”-Ban-Appeal-Still-Ongoing.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abf9bc652174e7611e4970758bba688a54fac71e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLWMupqZb7fy9JZ.cx9wCjiP9ddK6cS3jcM83gzlYotPAHnivSw4K0lTqXEaWoWcd5SgArVdY1o78VVKbsXhMj27oyo0olT9Xs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-06-02T21:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Zimbabwe Exchange Granted “Interim Relief,” Ban Appeal Still Ongoing", "text": "Bitcoin – Zimbabwe Exchange Granted “Interim Relief,” Ban Appeal Still Ongoing 2 June 2018 8537\nDespite reports of the Zimbabwe High Court’s reversal of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s (RBZ) recently issued cryptocurrency ban, the country’s leading bitcoin exchange, Golix, is yet to restore trading on its platform. In an email recently sent to customers of the exchange, Golix sought to clarify that it has been granted “an interim relief,” that its accounts have not yet been restored, and that legal proceedings are currently still ongoing.\nAlso Read: The Top Ten Altcoin Markets of 2014 – How Are They Faring Now? Golix Discusses Appealing Zimbabwe’s Cryptocurrency Ban\nGolix states that on the 11th of May, “the RBZ issue[d] a circular to all the banks instructing them to close all of our bank accounts,” however, a “60-day window” was given to the exchange. On the 15th of May, Golix “issued a statement to [their] customers” informing customers that the company was “aware of the directive” and had “started the process of engaging the RBZ” to discuss and address the central bank’s concerned.\nIn response, the RBZ “issue[d] a second circular that was addressed to Golix where they instructed Golix to cease all operations immediately” on the 17th of May, with Golix adding that all of their bank accounts had been closed by the following day. On the 21st of May, Golix “file[d] an urgent chamber application at the High Court requesting the ban on Golix to be lifted.” Golix Granted “Interim Relief” by High Court\nThe exchange states that on the 24th of May, 2018, “the High Court grant[ed] Golix an interim relief that lifts the ban on cryptocurrencies by the Central Bank.” Despite comprising positive news, the exchange states that “The interim relief does not guarantee that we will get our bank accounts reopened.”\nGolix emphasized that “the court case is still ongoing,” meaning that the “interim relief is only valid until the outcome of the case is determined in court.” The exchange added that “Because the case is still in court, we cannot comment on questions that are related to the case and this is the response you will get if you contact anyone on the Golix Team to make an inquiry that is related to this case.”\n“We are working hard to get our bank accounts reopened and we will send another update to let you know how this goes,” the exchange said. Ramifications of Interim Relief for Customers\nGolix has sought to deter customers from depositing funds with the exchange, stating “Please do not make any deposits into Golix until we have announced that we have resumed trading. If you try to deposit funds to our bank accounts right now, it may take weeks before we are able to recover those funds because, unless we tell the bank in advance, those funds will go straight to a suspense account.”\nThe exchange added: “Although we are working hard to have our bank accounts reopened, we have started a separate conversation with banks to allow us to send customer funds we are holding back to the customers and because the bank would like to limit the activity on the accounts, we cannot be able to process withdrawals as often as we used to […] Because of the logistics involved in processing withdrawals, we encourage every customer to initiate the withdrawal of the funds in their Golix accounts between Monday and Wednesday so that we have all the withdrawals processed on Friday.”\nGolix also recommended that customers not store their funds on the exchanges, stating “We recommend that you initiate a withdrawal your crypto and/or fiat funds right now until we recommend that we have resumed trading.”\nDo you think that Golix will be successful in appealing the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s cryptocurrency ban?

A birthday attack is a scenario where an attacker is able to produce the same hash as another input by using a completely different input (called a collision ). This breaks the third property of uniqueness. Without it, two completely different Bitcoin blocks may be represented by the exact same hash, allowing attackers to potentially switch out blocks. With the SHA-256 function, the probability of this attack happening is infinitely small. If it wasn’t close to impossible, SHA-256 would be considered broken. However, other hash functions have been “broken” in the past. In order to safeguard against this happening to SHA-256 in the future (and effectively breaking the security model of Bitcoin) it’s best to hash the hash . This halves the probability of a collision occurring, making the protocol that much more secure. At a very high level, Bitcoin mining is a system in which all Bitcoin transactions are sent to Bitcoin miners. Miners select one megabyte worth of transactions, bundle them as an input into the SHA-256 function, and attempt to find a specific output the network accepts. The first miner to find this output and publish the block to the network receives a reward in the form of transaction fees and the creation of new Bitcoin. Let’s take things a step further and dive into the Bitcoin blockchain itself to see what exactly it is that miners do to make the network secure. Bitcoin Mining: A Technical Introduction Mining was introduced as the solution to the double-spend problem. If I have 1 Bitcoin and I send it to Bob, and then try sending that same Bitcoin to Alice, the network ensures that only one transaction will be accepted. It does this through the well-known process called mining. Before diving into the technical details, its important to understand why mining is necessary to secure the network. As fiat currency exists now, the currency we hold is created and validated by a federal reserve. Because Bitcoin operates under the rigid assumption of decentralization and consensus, no central authority can exist that validates and time-stamps the issuance of that currency and validation of any transactions that occur with that currency. Satoshi Nakamoto proposed the only known solution at the time to solving this validation problem in a consensus-oriented system. Titled in the Bitcoin whitepaper as proof-of-work , this scheme elegantly justifies that transactions are validated by those who are willing to expend enough physical computational energy and time to do so, while simultaneously introducing an incentive to induce market competition. This competition enables the property of decentralization to emerge and thrive organically within the ecosystem. A Look Inside a Block A Bitcoin block consists primarily of two components: 1. Transactions, in the form of a merkle tree Mining computers collect enough transactions to fill a block and bundle them into a merkle tree. A merkle tree is a relatively simple concept: transactions lie at the bottom of the tree as leaves and are hashed using the SHA-256 function. The combination of two leaf transactions are hashed again using the SHA-256 function to form a parent of the leaves. This parent is continuously hashed upwards in combination with other parents of hashed transactions, until a single root is created. The hash of this root is effectively a unique representation of the transactions that are underneath it. A visualization of how a merkle tree is built — the leaves at the very bottom of the tree are transactions The root of the merkle tree is a combination of the hashes of every transaction in the tree. Recall that for any any input to a hash function, the output is entirely unique. Therefore, once most nodes on the network receive a mined block, the root of the merkle tree hash acts as an unchangeable summary of all the transactions in that given block. If a malicious actor were to try and change the contents of a transaction in a block, its hash would be changed. This change of a hash would be propagated up the transaction’s merkle tree until the hash of the root is changed. Any node can then quickly catch this malicious act by comparing the root of the changed block’s merkle tree to that of a valid block’s merkle tree. 2. The block header The block header is a summary of the contents of the block itself. It contains the following six components : The version of software the Bitcoin client is running The timestamp of the block The root of its containing transactions' merkle tree The hash of the block before it A nonce The target Remember that the root of the transaction merkle tree acts as an effective summary of every transaction in the block without having to look at each transaction. The hash of the previous block before it allows the network to properly place the block in chronological order. This is where the term blockchain is derived from — each block is chained to a previous block. The nonce and target are what make mining tick. They are the basis for solving the SHA-256 puzzle that miners need to solve. Please note that all of this data in the block header is compressed into 80 bytes using a notation called little-endian , making the transfer of block headers between nodes a trivially efficient process. For the purposes of this explanation, we’ll ignore this compression and assume data is in its original form. Explaining the Mining Problem The target stored in the block header is simply a numeric value stored in bits. In traditional base 10 notation, this target ranges anywhere between 0 to somewhere in the range of 2²²⁴ (a 67+ digit number), depending on how many miners are competing to solve this problem at the same time. Recall that the output of SHA-256 is just a number. The goal of a miner is to take the current block’s header, add a random number to it called the nonce , and calculate its hash. This numeric value of the hash must be smaller than the target value. That’s all there is to it. But it’s much easier said than done. Recall the first property of SHA-256: an input into a hash function will always result in the same output. Therefore, if the miner took the block header, hashed it, and realized that the hash value wasn’t less than the target, they would have to change the input somehow in order to try finding a hash below the target value. This is where the nonce comes in. The miner adds a number (starting from 0), called the nonce , to the block header, and hashes that value. If the hash value isn’t less than the target, the miner will increment the nonce by 1, add it again to the block header, and hash that changed value. This process is repeated continuously until a hash less than the target value is found. A Mining Example Here’s a rough approximation of what made up the first block header: The merkle root of the transaction in the Genesis block: Merkle Root: The first known Bitcoin version: 0.1.0 The timestamp of the block: 2009–01–03 18:15:05 The target (this is also the highest the target will ever be): Target: 0x No previous block hash — this was the first block, and so this is a unique case The final block header after adding its components together: The Genesis block data (this includes the nonce, but lets pretend it doesn’t), source: bitcointalk Let’s take this large header and compute the double-hash: SHA-256 of header: SHA-256 of the previous result (final result): c5aa3150f61b752c8fb39525f911981e2f9982c8b9bc907c73914585ad2ef12b Both the target and the output hash are incredibly large numbers when converted to base 10 (remember, over 67 digits long). Instead of trying to demonstrate the comparison of the two here, the following Python function handles the comparison instead: def isBlockHashLessThanTarget(blockHash, target): return int(blockHash, 16) < int(target, 16) True is returned if the hash is less than the target, false otherwise. Here is the result with our target and block hash: Now we take the original block hexadecimal value and add 1 to it. Here is the following result: Notice how the very last digit is now 1, due to the addition of the nonce We then run the same hashing algorithm and comparison on this changed data. If its not below the target, keep repeating. Once a successful hash is found, the latest nonce used to find this solution is saved within the block. The listed nonce on the Genesis block is 2,083,236,893. This means Satoshi Nakomoto iterated through this process over 2 billion times before he found a hash that was acceptable. I’ve written a small Python implementation of this Genesis block mining process that can be found on my GitHub .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=52706", "https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/2063/why-does-the-bitcoin-protocol-use-the-little-endian-notation", "http://creativecommons.org/ns#", "https://blockchain.info/block-index/14849", "http://github.com/subhan-nadeem/bitcoin-mining-python"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T00:48:22.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bee837fc18e2f6507fbb7ef08764f50dcabb11c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TcMIB0mg1.BvvUYPAKFyinqr87sUQYElEe8FUpGue9jgxH99GcwTLv9FhJBUZGK8-", "site_full": "www.gamekyo.com", "site": "gamekyo.com", "site_section": "http://www.gamekyo.com/boards_games.html", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Gamekyo : magazine social des jeux vidéo", "title": "cloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner", "title_full": "Gamekyo : cloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner", "published": "2018-06-02T21:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53617, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bee837fc18e2f6507fbb7ef08764f50dcabb11c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8TcMIB0mg1.BvvUYPAKFyinqr87sUQYElEe8FUpGue9jgxH99GcwTLv9FhJBUZGK8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jjake669712", "published": "2018-06-02T21:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "cloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner", "text": "cloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner\ncloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner\ncloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner\ncloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner\ncloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner\ncloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner\ncloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner\ncloud bitcoin mining-Btcminespool.com-best bitcoin miner\nFree Bitcoin - free 0. 200 BTC every hour!

He said a sports betting app might run afoul of the federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Act of 2006, a law originally aimed at stopping the use of credit cards and electronic fund transfers to pay for illegal internet gambling.\n“That could be a snag,” Humphreys said.\nState lawmakers and lottery officials believe sports betting will bring in about $5 million in the first year of implementation, about $13.4 million by the third year and about $28.7 million by the fifth year as betting becomes established.\nNeedless-to-say, West Virginia gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal.

Instead of a direct bullish correction, it traded in a sideways consolidation, which eventually turned out to be a rounded bottom as we can see in the 1H chart.\nBTC/USD 1H Chart\n(click to enlarge)\nRounded Bottom: As we can see on the 1H chart, price has rounded out a bottom. Price is now above the 200-, 100-, and 50-hour simple moving averages (SMAs), and is breaking above a falling trendline. Momentum is starting to look bullish as well with the RSI being able to tag 70 but unable to tag 30.\nUpside: If price can hold above $7450, it should be able to push towards the $8000 mark. I feel that the energy built up in the rounded bottom would be able to push price above the previously anticipated resistance around $7800. Instead I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin push above $8000 briefly. Bitcoin is volatile, so even a push to $8600 is possible before the next phase of consolidation.\nDownside: I noted that this bullish outlook relies on a hold above $7450, which is where the current breakout is being launched from. A break below $7450, and then $7400 (where the 200-hour SMA resides), would open up a bearish continuation scenario.\nFor now, I can't say the market is bullish or bearish, but it does look like it is setting up for a short-term bullish attempt towards at least $8000.

Written by: Published on: Jun/02/2018\nFor this year's FIFA World Cup, the best way to place bets online from Virginia will be with bitcoin using a cryptocurrency wallet that can be linked to one's banking account. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\nWILL VIRGINIA WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nVirginia has traditionally been slow to embrace any form of gambling.\nGovernor Ralph Northam said in a statement that his office was reviewing the Supreme Court's ruling and would review any legislation that might come from the General Assembly in the future.\nCabaniss thinks that if Virginia were to legalize sports gambling, the state could take in $100 million in taxes in the first year alone.\nNeedless-to-say, Virginia gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ralph northam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabaniss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa world cup online from virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa world cup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T02:49:12.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8fa486c26e4d8dcc017687180fb64d4a0d93e2d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_WO9sE5JKwAWe060cPAOH2dGAb1f3bjPWN3kSZ3QzdTgeQEQ3Kp9krxNt0cQSbtGtE_NkyA1JGWTKUbE.xNyRIbmRsE9rWXOrOXyPtCWDvSptiR7n.07S7KtKgLmBjurs-", "site_full": "www.itsforhome.com", "site": "itsforhome.com", "site_section": "http://www.itsforhome.com/pub", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Technology Solutions for Home – Smart Grid – Demand Response", "title": "Bitcoin Mining's Electricity Bill Is It Worth It", "title_full": "Bitcoin Mining's Electricity Bill Is It Worth It", "published": "2018-06-02T20:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8fa486c26e4d8dcc017687180fb64d4a0d93e2d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_WO9sE5JKwAWe060cPAOH2dGAb1f3bjPWN3kSZ3QzdTgeQEQ3Kp9krxNt0cQSbtGtE_NkyA1JGWTKUbE.xNyRIbmRsE9rWXOrOXyPtCWDvSptiR7n.07S7KtKgLmBjurs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tom Gardner", "published": "2018-06-02T20:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Mining's Electricity Bill Is It Worth It", "text": "\n“We know that mining is done with coal-electricity, but also with renewable energy.

As more miners join the Bitcoin network, some individuals fear that the amount of electricity consumed by mining will have a negative impact on the environment. Others believe that the benefits of Bitcoin mining outweigh the cost it takes to produce the digital currency. Bitcoin mining and energy consumption\nNew Bitcoin are produced through a process called mining, where computers expend energy and computational resources to solve a difficult math problem that verifies a recent block of Bitcoin transactions. The miner who solves the math problem adds the block to the blockchain and receives newly minted Bitcoin. The difficulty of the math problem depends on how much computational power the network has in summation. As the Bitcoin network attracts more miners, the mining difficulty increases, and usually, the amount of energy a mining rig consumes increases too.\nThe Bitcoin network currently consumes about 2.55 gigawatts (GW) of electricity per year; to put that into perspective, the entire country of Ireland has an average electricity consumption of 3.1 GW, and Austria has an average electricity consumption of 8.2 GW per year. Over the past year, the estimated amount of TwH that the Bitcoin network consumes per year increased 413.37 percent. When compared to countries like the Czech Republic, the Bitcoin network uses 102.3 percent of the entire electricity consumed by the country per year.\nData consultant and blockchain specialist Alex De Vries believes that the amount of energy Bitcoin mining consumes is problematic. In a recent research study published in Joule, De Vries found that the average amount of electricity consumed per Bitcoin transaction is 300 kwH, and at the rate new miners are joining the network – and the mining difficulty increases – this number has the potential to reach 900 KwH by the end of 2018.\nDe Vries told Cointelegraph that even though society can not see the changes being made to the environment via Bitcoin mining, mining operations are not helping the world get closer to their climate and environmental goals: “We know that mining is done with coal-electricity, but also with renewable energy. In the latter case, we don’t know what we are displacing, plus renewable energy never has zero lifetime carbon footprint either. There’s more work to be done here, but there’s certainly an impact. The more energy Bitcoin uses, the more it will impact the environment for sure – which in turn will impact everyone. It’s not helping us reach our climate goals.”\nThere is a grey area when it comes to figuring out how Bitcoin mining is impacting the environment. Although some of the electricity used is sourced from coal, mining operations usually do not release carbon emissions themselves. Just because miners do not see the physical impact that mining has on the environment, the amount of resources consumed and the opportunity cost involved should be concerning in itself. Hash rate and energy consumption The amount of energy mining consumes seems to be increasing. As mining equipment becomes better at solving blocks, the electricity consumed by each mining rig increases. To stay ahead of their competitors, miners are always looking for mining equipment with a higher hashrate. The hashrate is the speed at which the miner is able to provide answers to the math problem. The higher the hash rate, the faster one can guess the answer to the problem.\nAt first, the problem was easy enough to be solved by a standard CPU, but as more miners joined the network and the problem became more difficult, miners found that GPU were better suited to solve the problem. Just a few years later, FPGAs and then ASICs – application specific integrated circuits – were better suited than GPUs to solve a block.\nOthers, like entrepreneur and former Google information security engineer Marc Bevand, believe that the amount of energy that mining consumes will cause further innovation in the form of renewable energies. Bevand believes that the energy consumption will eventually lead to decreased costs of renewable energy for society at large:\n“Because miners are so sensitive to electricity prices, they are often a driver pushing utilities to further develop renewables which are now the cheapest source of energy. For example in China, many miners are located in the Sichuan province because of its abundant hydroelectricity. Another example is an Australian entrepreneur who is building a 20 megawatt (MW) solar-powered mining farm. If the energy use of cryptocurrency miners continue to increase it will help decrease the costs of renewables for society at large (increased demand → increased R&D → increased capacity & higher efficiency → lower costs through economies of scale).”\nElectricity costs have already put miners in search for a cheaper source of energy. Companies have been looking to places like Canada and the Sichuan province where electricity is typically cheaper. Because miners have incentives to use cheap electricity, this leads to more R&D in the energy space. In the long run, this should make forms of electricity cheaper to all of society as innovations are made in energy. The Price of Network Security\nAlthough the amount of energy mining operations consume does not go unnoticed, some individuals believe that the benefits of mining – network security – outweigh the negative externalities like electricity consumption.\nThe Bitcoin network is secured by a consensus algorithm called proof-of-work (PoW). Miners are paid newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees for solving a block, securing the network in the process. If a miner is not able to solve the cryptographic proof, blocks of transaction history would not be added to the blockchain and blockchain technology as a whole would be nullified; no record of transaction history would be created if blocks were not solved and added to the chain by miners. The cost that has to be paid for this network security is the large amounts of energy that a PoW consensus consumes.\nCypherpunk Jameson Lopp took to twitter to express how he feels about Bitcoin’s energy expenditure problem. Lopp believes that the electricity expense that Bitcoin mining accrues is simply a tax that must be paid for network security. Whining about the energy expenditure to secure Bitcoin against computational attacks will have no effect. The Bitcoin ecosystem pays contractors (miners) for security; if you want them to stop then you’ll have to make a better offer on the open market.\n— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) May 18, 2018\nEconomic researcher Vasily Sumanov also believes that energy inefficiency and waste is currently the price we pay to conduct blockchain experiments:\n“Higher energy consumption is associated not only with environmental pollution but also with the higher security of a distributed ledger dedicated to storage and transfer of value. I have a strong feeling that this is a temporary situation, and in the future, Bitcoin energy efficiency as a function of transaction volume and energy consumption will increase as a result of Lightning Network adoption.”\n“Just look at any other industry, for example, cars or electronic devices – their environment pollution and energy costs considerably decreased over time as these industries developed. So why do people expect high energy efficiency from the Bitcoin in the very beginning? It is only 9 years old.” Consensus algorithm\nPoW is currently the most popular form of consensus on a blockchain network. Before transactions are verified, miners must solve cryptographic proofs. However, it is also the most energy intensive form of consensus. Alternatives that consume less energy like Proof-of-Stake and the Lightning Network are being developed to make blockchain networks more efficient. But for the most part, these innovations have not officially launched. Bitcoin is still in its early stages and is not even 10 years old yet, and throughout history, it is not uncommon for technologies to be sub-optimal in their beginning stages. Improving efficiency\nAt the same time, there are people working towards solutions for these network problems. The Ethereum network is looking into proof-of-stake solutions to increase its efficiency while decreasing electricity consumption; the Bitcoin network is looking to implement the Lightning Network. But until these solutions are out of their test net phases and go live, PoW will continue to be criticized for its electricity consumption.\nOnce the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is optimized, the overall efficiency of the Bitcoin network will increase. In an academic paper titled Banking on Blockchain: Costs Savings Thanks to the Blockchain Technology, Luisanna Cocco, Andrea Pinna, and Michele Marchesi from the University of Cagliari’s electrical engineering and computer science departments, found that Bitcoin must increase its economic efficiency, operational efficiency, and service efficiency before it truly optimizes global financial infrastructures. “In a nutshell, all of our results show that the overall efficiency of the Bitcoin system can increase only after overcoming its main limitations: the low number of transactions per block and the too high computational power that it currently needs”\nBitcoin is useful for its transparent ledger, secure data storage, and user empowerment features, but is going to struggle with mass adoption until it can sort out scalability and energy consumption problems. The total amount of Bitcoin that can ever exist is 21 mln, and as mining rigs consume more energy, miners incur higher electricity bills, and the reward for mining Bitcoin diminishes. Eventually, the profit from Bitcoin mining alone will not be enough to cover the electricity expense. In the future, miners will need to supplement their electricity cost payment with money from the transaction fees they receive for signing a block. Is the energy expenditure worth it?\nAlthough some people believe that the amount of energy mining consumes is problematic, it is difficult to measure how much of society is benefiting from Bitcoin. Bevand told Cointelegraph: “Answering “is Bitcoin’s energy consumption worth it?” is very subjective, because we don’t have any hard data measuring how much Bitcoin is helping society. How many Venezuelan are using it to escape inflation? How many families are using it for international remittance and therefore avoiding the average fee of 7.13 percent of remittance providers? How many Bitcoin millionaires given back their newfound wealth to charities? We don’t have much data for any of these questions. I don’t think that the current level of energy consumption is worrisome. We are only at 0.2-0.5 percent of the worldwide electricity consumption. Like Morgan Stanley researchers said in their reports cryptocurrency miners are currently just a “blip on the radar” for utilities”\nSo far, there is no way for the world to quantitatively measure or know how many people are using Bitcoin, what they are using it for, and if it is making their lives better. But individuals like Bevand and businesses like Morgan Stanley say there’s no need to worry, because Bitcoin mining consumes such a small fraction of the world’s total electricity consumption. Innovation is imperative\nAlthough we may not be able to see the toll that Bitcoin mining is taking on our environment with the naked eye, there is no doubt that the Bitcoin network will have to reduce its energy consumption before the Bitcoin blockchain undergoes mass adoption. It would not be surprising to see a regulating body create policy and regulation for miners in attempt to control/reduce electricity consumption.\nBecause Bitcoin miners are so sensitive to the price of electricity, this should push R&D in the energy space and produce more efficient energy solutions. It is hard to get an understanding of the positive vs negatives externalities of Bitcoin, so it is hard to say if the amount of energy consumed is truly “worth it”. But if the amount of electricity consumed by mining is not kept under control or made more efficient, then it is possible that the impact to the environment will be irreversible once people become aware of the negative effects that Bitcoin mining had on it.

By contrast, Bitcoin takes approximately an hour to settle due to its low transaction throughput of approximately 32 transactions per second. The XRP Ledger can perform around 1500 transactions per second.\nDue to the bottleneck created by blocks updating every 10 minutes and the general slow transaction speed of the original blockchain, the transaction fees are higher, sometimes to the tune of approximately $20. This further hampers the experience of using the coin due to the need for calculating transaction fees.\nRipple’s transaction fees come up to around $0.0001 per transaction, reflecting their philosophy for the creation of the Internet of Value. The Ledger also enhances the user experience by automatically calculating the fees needed and deducting it from the transaction.\nThe electricity required for 1 transaction of Bitcoin is close to 162 kWh, according to the slide shown. This is approximately the amount of energy required to run an average refrigerator for a year. The XRP Ledger uses “negligible energy consumption”, however, the exact amount is not specified.\nThe scalability and power consumption of the Bitcoin network has been an issue and is being addressed by the introduction of the Lightning Network. The Lightning network is a second layer payment protocol implementation that allows instant transactions between participating nodes through off-chain transactions.\nBitcoin is known for being mineable, and this is achieved using its Proof of Work algorithm. This is probabilistic in nature, which involves adaptation to the theory of probability. The XRP Ledger uses a consensus protocol, allowing for a deterministic method of reaching decisions.\nTwitter users responded to the graphic, with user Bernhardt Meyers saying:\n“Bitcoin: decentralized Ripple: centralized”\nUser The Loremaster:\n“Good stuff.

News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

Research interest: Cryptocurrency and code governance. Jun 2 The End of Crypto Winter: the bear market of 2018 and what has happened to Bitcoin and Altcoins Manipulation, futures, regulatory crackdowns, AML, KYC and possible reasons for low volume on crypto markets in Q1 2018 so far. Cryptocurrency is said to currently be (or have been) in a bear market, which some are calling “crypto winter” ( bitcoin.com , coindesk , outlier ventures ). Market observers are suggesting that “ the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices ”, and the obvious reason for the downwards spiral of altcoins are their strong correlation to Bitcoin ( #1 , #2 , #3 , #4 ). Bitcoin fell by nearly 70% from Dec 17, 2017 and Feb 6, 2018 ( #1 , #2 ), taking with it the whole cryptocurrency market and entering a “ corrective winter cycle ”. December 2017 brought an all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin and Altcoins, the so-called “December wave”, introduced by what Super Crypto calls the “ Bitcoin Manipulation Cartel ”, which is “ taming Bitcoin ” in order to profit on futures contracts. The recent price decline of Bitcoin is “consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset” ( #1 , #2 , #3 ). “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. Rather, it is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.” ( Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ) Bans, regulatory crackdowns and regulations: 2018 marks the institutionalization of cryptocurrency Since the beginning of 2018 the cryptocurrency game has changed. Twitter, Facebook and Google have banned cryptocurrency ads ( attributed to the ICO hype ), and the space transformed from anarchism to a regulated and institutionalized setting. Issuers and intermediaries of virtual currencies are largely getting regulated worldwide, although the legal status of bitcoin still varies substantially from country to country . Bitcoin magazine calls 2018 the “ year of regulatory reckoning ”, painting a picture of a stoney road ahead for ventures and startups in the cryptocurrency space. “Regulators all over the world have begun to address the challenges presented by virtual currencies that mostly bypass regulated banks, financial firms, exchanges and central clearinghouses.” ( marketwatch ) South Korean regulations in January had a big effect on the markets ( #1 , #2 , #3 ), as in 2018 already a few important events have shaped the new era of institutionalization. On March 7, 2018 the SEC argued that “ digital assets, like coins and tokens offered and sold in initial coin offerings (ICOs), fall within the definition of a “security” under US security laws ”, effectively causing an almost 10% price drop of Bitcoin. After a long heist of the hackers who stole an estimated $524 million in NEM tokens from the cryptocurrency exchange coincheck (which was unsuccessful, as they were able to drain the funds and to stay anonymous), the exchange started to preemptively ban privacy-based cryptocurrency, as it is harder (or impossible) to trace in case of an emergency. This led to a ripple effect of regulations and general anxiety in the market, which further took the market volume and valuation of privacy-related cryptocurrency down. Dash went from $1598 in Dec 21, 2017 down to $322 as of now, and Zcash was $876 in Jan 9, 2018 (now $248). Monero for example went from an ATH of $474.57 in January 7, 2018 down to $165 at the time of this writing (Jun 2, 2018). This can also be attributed to the forking culture, which produced a total number of 6 Moneroj , but besides the long fork story of Monero (XMR) , there is general uncertainty on the horizon, what will happen with privacy-centrist coins in the long run. Conclusion Bitcoin seems to have found its bottom at $7000 , and we might see the market in recovery already. For all we know, “Crypto Winter” might be already over and we have entered “Crypto Spring”. Instead of the “ A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System ” as Satoshi Nakamoto has initially called it, we are currently missing the main aspect: cash. Visa ended their relationship with a large cryptocurrency card provider in Jan, 2018 and with that killing a lot of crypto-to-cash providers such as Cryptopay, TenX, Bitwala, Wirex and others ( #1 , #2 , #3 ). Visa issuers and Mastercard are making it harder to buy Bitcoin , which hinders the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. At the same time on June 1, 2018 the Visa payment systems in Europe suffered a major outage, showing us that it could largely benefit from a more distributed system. The massive over-regulations are currently hitting the wrong targets — the example of recent preemptive bans of ‘anonymity-focused coins’[sic] (Monero, Dash, Augur, Zcash) via the Japanese Financial Security Agency (FSA) on Japanese exchanges are “ a wake up call to defend privacy coins ”. This shows us that the cryptocurrency space is currently moving in the wrong direction. Mainstream adoption is hindered by the lack of (traditional) payment options with cryptocurrency, and over-regulation is a big problem, effectively creating problems for a lot of startups in the crypto and fintech space. Vitalik Buterin also recently shifted his views on privacy , making the discussion of “Transparency vs. Privacy” one of the hottest topics of 2018. As the markets recover, we might be losing something more important than possible crypto-gains: our right to privacy.

"Bitcoin – The Bitcoin Cash Chain Has Less Than Two Years Until the Reward Halving 2 June 2018 8534\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain is now less than two years away from its next block reward halving. Current statistics show the BCH chain will halve its reward from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH on or around April 6, 2020, and with more than 80 percent of BCH now in circulation, when the next halving takes place the decentralized asset will be much harder to obtain.\nAlso read: Adult Film Star Brenna Sparks Discusses Transforming the Sex Industry With Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Has Less Than Two Years Left Until the 2020 Reward Halving\nBitcoin Cash has great worth to a lot of digital asset proponents and the cryptocurrency has gained in value tremendously over the past nine months. One benefit that BCH advocates appreciate is the fact that the currency has digital scarcity. There will never be more than 21 million BCH in existence and right now there is a circulating supply of 17.1 million. More than 80 percent of BCH has been mined into existence since the end of April and the BCH hashrate has been around 3.5 to 4.5 exahash per second. At this speed alone, with just 13 mining pools, the next halving date will be on or around April 6, 2020 . After this date, BCH miners will lose half the current block reward (12.5 BCH) and receive 6.25 BCH and fees per block mined. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) protocol is set to halve its block reward on or around the year 2020 depending on hashrate speed.\nMany cryptocurrency enthusiasts appreciate the fact that BCH will grow gradually harder to obtain over time due to Satoshi Nakamoto’s built-in supply limit, which introduced a different kind of ‘digital scarcity’ — one that’s backed by the Bitcoin Cash hashrate. This day in age, with computer files like MP3s or JPEGs, we typically think about these digital items differently because they are easily duplicated. The decentralized currency BCH cannot be duplicated so easily, as it’s re-enforced by 3.5 to 4.5 exahash of power validating all the ledger transactions. The system keeps miners sincere because they are economically incentivized to stay honest, unlike traditional systems and public officials trusted today. As time goes by and the mining hashrate continues to increase, the BCH network becomes much more expensive to besiege by making a 51% or double spend attack harder every passing day. No More Quantitative Easing or Bailouts\nDigital scarcity makes Bitcoin Cash far more valuable than the fiat notes printed by governments and central banks because the code does not allow for mass fiat printing and quantitative easing. The U.S. dollar, for example, has been devalued considerably over time making it lose purchasing power year after year. Extreme USD printing began after the adoption of the Bretton Woods system, throughout the eighties and nineties and then with the bailed-out banks who received billions of printed dollars after the 2008 ‘economic crisis.’ Bitcoin Cash will always be finite and allow users to conserve or spend, because their ownership is defined by a protocol that continues to strengthen its security daily. There is no monetary system out there that allows for true transferable digital value like Satoshi Nakamoto’s clever invention. Satoshi put a cap on the supply for a reason and this can be seen in the genesis block’s famous text.\nAfter April 6, 2020, in another four years or less the reward will again halve, and continue to halve until the last coins are found on or around the year 2140. Halvings in the past have shown consistent price rises following these events, which confirms proponents appreciate the genius of Nakamoto’s digital scarcity. Sending people a nice fraction of BCH is cool, but people will also admire how scarce the decentralized asset is unlike the devalued fiat currencies in their wallet.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash halving that takes place every four years? Let us know your thoughts on the subject of digital scarcity in the comments below.\nImages via Shutterstock, Fork.lol, and the UK Times 2009.\nNow live, Satoshi Pulse.

Recently, the technological giant IBM has acquired two crucial and influential patents that will change the marketplace of cryptocurrency security .\nIBM acquired these two patents on May 31 st and aims to utilize them as soon as possible. While the patents mostly offer clear and concise definitions about various aspects of blockchain technology, the existence of the two patents puts IBM closer to becoming a key player in the blockchain world.\nIf a company seeks to enter into a technological area such as blockchain they must take small steps towards the market of these industries. That is exactly what these two patents serve as for IBM. They are stepping stones towards a greater influence in the huge world of blockchain. Many companies are competing very fiercely to be the dominant force in the blockchain revolution that is taking the technology world by storm. The First Patent\nPatent number one defines what is defined as a checkpoint. It describes a checkpoint as something that confirms data from other nodes or messengers and stores its information. IBM’s official summary for the patent states\n“Before a checkpoint is certified, it must be consistent, meaning that all validating peers must reach the same state for the checkpoint. Preferably, the checkpoint is a compression of the current blockchain world state into a compact representation of the ledger that is consistent across the peers.”\nThis ultimately allows for a more citable and understandable definition of a checkpoint. Moving forward, many companies will look to this as a key building block for companies wishing to utilize and create blockchain technology. When IBM goes to make any product in the future they will likely rely on this patent because it is at the core of just about all blockchain technology.\nNo company can seek to make products that all seamlessly interact with one another without first defining and being on the same terms across all devices and software. This patent will make being on the same page a whole lot easier. The Second Patent\nSecondly, IBM has acquired a patent that expands upon the other patent and discusses how various checkpoints have the ability to be audited. IBM has patented its new auditing process. It seeks to have set in stone processes that all of its software and devices will operate on so there can be seamless communication and transferring of data between various products and companies. IBM’s official patent report states\n“An auditor should be able to rerun the transactions between checkpoints and then compare the value of the latter checkpoint with the value recorded in the ledger. The first step in this auditing process is to double check the hashes of all the blocks in the chain. To be thorough, the signatures on all transactions should be checked, although the hashes on all blocks ought to be sufficient.”\nIBM has been revolutionizing the computer industry for many years now, and these two patents are stepping stones towards them becoming a key player in the blockchain industry. Whether they get involved in the cryptocurrency technology , finances, or data transfer aspect of blockchain technology, they will be sure to make big changes to the 21 st century technological industry.

EOS was the strongest performer today, recording a gain of 16.24 percent subsequent to its mainnet launch. No Major Movement Over the Past 7 Days\nAlthough it seems as if the market has recovered by large margins and bitcoin has rebounded from its previous dip, BTC has remained in the same region over the past seven days. Last week, on May 27, exactly seven days ago, the price of BTC was $7,560. As of June 2, the price of BTC remains just over $7,600, less than 1 percent higher than its position on May 27.\nOn May 27, analysts predicted a downward trajectory for BTC and a possible drop below the $7,000 mark. BTC did drop to $7,040, but recovered relatively quickly back to $7,500, as bulls refused to allow bitcoin to drop below a key resistance level at $7,000, which could have led BTC to enter the higher end of $5,000.\nThe descending trendline from May 6 to June 2, covering two corrective rallies on May 11 and May 21, demonstrate that BTC has the potential to regain momentum at its current level, establishing $7,040 as the bottom.\nHowever, BTC has also replicated the head and shoulders top that was formed throughout May 15 to May 20, which ultimately led BTC to fall from $8,500 to $7,040.\nIn order for BTC to initiate a short to mid-term rally in the upcoming days, similar to the corrective rally on April 11 that allowed BTC To rise from $6,950 to $8,000 within a one-hour period, BTC would need to experience a significant surge in volume, achieving $8,000 in the next 24 to 48 hours. If BTC fails to sustain momentum at its current level, it could drop back down to the $6,000 region and eye a potential movement to $5,000, as cryptocurrency researcher Willy Woo hinted previously.\n“So in summary my best guess… slowish bleed down to $6800… then a steeper slide to $5700, then a levelling out of the drop… then a flat zone. This is an educated guess based on volume profile and fundamental data framing the rate of movement,” Woo said on May 25. Performance of Tokens\nTokens such as Ontology, ICON, WanChain, Theta, and others recorded a surge in volume and price over past few days, benefiting from the short-term recovery of BTC. Because tokens tend to decline and increase in value with larger margins in comparison to BTC, tokens usually provide high-risk and high-return trading opportunities.\nEOS recorded a 16 percent increase in price, as CCN reported, as traders and investors have started to anticipate the performance of EOS post-mainnet launch. Some analysts and traders have claimed that the performance of EOS is not organic and it will likely fall in value in the upcoming days.\nOther tokens such as Tron have also experienced an increase in value due to their mainnet launches, but quite often, a price spike triggered by a certain event or a single factor is vulnerable to a short-term correction.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

This list is essential if you&apos;re serious about making money from Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies .\nBut what is a Bitcoin exchange, and how can you be sure you sign up to the best Bitcoin exchange? Well, think of Bitcoin exchanges as digital marketplaces for people to buy and sell Bitcoins using different currencies. The Bitcoin can be exchanged for either fiat money (legal tender) or other alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. The exchange serves as the middleman for traders of the cryptocurrency.\nBeing able to purchase Bitcoin is the initial step to trading in it. Just like trading a stock, Bitcoin exchanges charge transaction fees, which range from 0 to 1%. In order to trade Bitcoin on an exchange, the user needs to have an account, and go through a series of steps to be verified. Remember that Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies are a completely digital currency, and there are no physical Bitcoins.\nHowever, before plunging in with both feet, users should be aware of what to look for in choosing a Bitcoin exchange for their cryptocurrency transactions. This is analogous to the issues and potential pitfalls in making a choice of where to do your banking, or open an online brokerage account. Furthermore, bear in mind that unlike banks and stock trading, Bitcoin trading is largely unregulated by most countries, although this is changing as its popularity increases.\nA good place to start is to look at the virtual coins which are supported by an exchange. With over 4,000 cryptocurrencies, and additional ones being added all the time, it is key to figure out which currencies you want to trade in, and then match the exchange that deals in those. For example, Ethereum mining has recently become more popular, but not all Bitcoin exchanges support this alternative cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin vs distributed ledger vs Ethereum vs blockchain explained Language barriers Next look at the country that is hosting the Bitcoin exchange. Some are in less regulated countries, and there may be additional problems if something goes awry. This can include time differences, international long distance costs, and language barriers. In general, it’s preferable to find an exchange that speaks your language.\nAdditionally, pay close attention to the fees levied. While all these exchanges charge transaction fees – after all, they are businesses looking to make a profit – as the user, it is obviously best to find one with the lowest costs in order to maximize your own profits.\nAlso look for a secure trading platform, and a Bitcoin exchange which has robust security measures. After all, you wouldn’t use a bank that didn’t have a vault, and stored its money on the counter…\nDesirable security features include two-factor authentication, SMS or email alerts, encrypted emails, and wallet monitoring. A smartphone app can also be very useful in terms of accessing and monitoring funds – but equally, poorly implemented software can represent a security risk.\nFinally, look for an exchange which is doing a good volume of trading – in other words, one with a high number of trading pairs, and high liquidity.\nNow that we know the features to look for in the best Bitcoin exchanges, let’s move on to pick out our particular favorites.\nThis is a US-based exchange which was founded in 2012, and it supports over 32 countries. Coinbase exchanges Bitcoin and the alternative cryptocurrencies of Ethereum and Litecoin, and it’s the largest of the exchanges, claiming $20 billion (&#xA3;15 billion) in currency exchanged. In 2014 Coinbase created GDAX, the Global Digital Asset Exchange which was developed for professionals with high volumes of trading.\nThe firm offers a mobile wallet, offline storage, and insurance protection for currency stored on its servers. Coinbase supports several fiat currencies: British Pounds, US Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Singapore Dollars.\nThe Coinbase exchange has a 1% flat fee for each purchase, while cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are done without any fees. A streamlined user interface which is ideal for novice traders – and fast trades – makes Coinbase a popular exchange with traders.\nGemini Exchange is another US-based outfit founded by the Winklevoss twins – the pair who sued Mark Zuckerberg over social networking, and were awarded $65 million (&#xA3;48 million), which they put to use as venture capitalists. This exchange is based in New York, and is available in 45 US states, as well as the UK, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.\nGemini’s only supported fiat currency is US dollars, and it only trades Bitcoin and Ethereum. Gemini does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees, and levies a low flat rate of 0.25% for trades, to both the buyer and the seller.\nAnother advantage of Gemini is that it’s a New York state limited liability trust company, and is regulated by New York’s Department of Financial Services. Close proximity to the Wall Street financial markets allows the company to easily provide a bridge from more traditional investments to newer cryptocurrency markets, for both individual and institutional investors.\nGemini is also notable in that it accepts ACH transfers for fast access to money for trades. A potential downside is that the interface is not particularly novice-friendly.\nChangelly is a cryptocurrency exchange with support for many more virtual currencies than most, including Monero, Dash, Bytecoin, and DigitalNote among others. If you are mining a less popular currency, chances are that Changelly can exchange it for you.\nThis exchange comes from the popular mining platform MinerGate which provides a merged mining pool across Windows, Mac, Linux and Android operating systems. While Changelly focuses on exchanges between different cryptocurrencies, users can also purchase cryptocurrency with US Dollars or Euros.\nNote that this exchange has a shorter track record, as it only entered the market in 2016. Exchange fees are 0.5% on transactions.\nCryptopia was founded in 2014, aiming to be a comprehensive exchange that focuses on the user experience, with integration of additional services including a marketplace and wallet. It is based in Christchurch, New Zealand. Cryptopia is notable in that the first level of verification happens very quickly, and only requires an email address for initial verification.\nWhile Cryptopia does not support fiat money trading, it does support a ridiculously large number of cryptocurrencies: over 400 to date, with more being added all the time. The trading fee is also a low 0.20% per transaction, which compares favorably with many competitors.
