Japan’s Internet Giant GMO Has Mined 900 Bitcoins and 537 Bitcoin Cash. May 11, 2018 GMO Internet is a multi-billion listed Japanese Internet and Technology Composite. Previously, it reveals its plan to launch its new cloud mining service in August. Currently, the mining activity of Japan’s internet giant GMO is issuing nearly 900 bitcoins and 537 bitcoin cash. Hash rate doubled\nJapanese composite GMO Internet launched its cryptocurrency mining business report for the month of April. The firm has made their hashrate last month.\nThe team conceded its “Hash rate rose due to the increase in the number of computers which are been operated as planned.” In the month of April, hashrate is 241 PH/s up from 129 PH/s for in the month of March, 108 PH/s for February and 27 PH/s in January. Concurrently, it is a crypto exchange which is reported at the first-quarter loss after the state’s financial regulator controlled for its enhancement.\nGMO writes “We are currently mining Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)”. The company mined 373 BTC and 0 BCH in April. For the month of March, it mined 295 BTC and 12 BCH. In the month of February GMO mined 124 BTC and 287 BCH. Globally, GMO has mined around 906 BTC and 537 BCH since the commencement of mining activity. The announcement is as follows:-\nHash rate is an important indicator for estimating our mining share. The goal is achieved hashrate and reach 3,000PH/s this year. GMO’s roadmap\nIn January, GMO declared to succeed in developing a 12 nm ASIC mining Chip. In October, it outlines plans to release an Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) for the sale of its next-generation mining boards. September last year, the firm announced the launch of its mining business.\nWithal, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) is issuing the exchange a business improvement order. The government approved exchange is receiving an order for Tech Bureau which runs Zaif exchange. GMO Coin\nGMO Financial Holdings launched GMO Coin’s earnings report. It displays an operating loss of 760 million yen -US$7 million in the first quarter of the year. GMO Coin is the cryptocurrency exchange subsidiary of GMO Internet.\nGMO is planning to begin a bitcoin salary payment system for employees in the cryptocurrency. The cost of operating crypto business raised 560 million yen for the group from the previous quarter. It is a 16 fully licensed crypto exchange of Japan. The company is releasing a service to acquiesce customers and lend their bitcoins for the company. Well, it is interesting to know Japan’s internet giant GMO has mined 900 bitcoins and 537 bitcoin cash. Share your thoughts through Twitter and Telegram .

According to statements by Chinese officials, the People's Republic is developing a national standard for blockchain technologies, which should be introduced next year. Also, the Zcash Foundation is taking steps to protect the network of the privacy coin from ASIC-based mining. Chinese giant Bitmain has recently launched its Antminer Z9 Mini designed to process transactions for cryptos like Zcash, which use the Equihash algorithm.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General\nChina Preparing National Blockchain Standard Chinese authorities are working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People's Republic.\nA national standard plan for blockchain is under preparation and respective departments will set up a national blockchain and distributed Accounting Technology Standardization Committee said Li Ming, director of the Blockchain Research Office at the Electronic Industry Standards Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Li Ming told the Economic Information Daily that the national blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards. He also added that the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future.\nAccording to a recent statement by Yu Kequn, director of the National Center for Information Technology Security Research, \"The development of blockchain technology may become an important step for China to grasp the global technological competition.\" Yu Kequn also noted that blockchain technology is a new integrated application of distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanisms, and encryption algorithms. \"It has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, tamper resistance, and anonymity,\" the official pointed out and added: \"It can be applied in the production, management, and transaction chains, and it will bring the entire life cycle of restructuring to different areas, so that it can be managed and traceable.\"\nIceland's Missing Mining Rigs May Have Been Found in China The mining equipment which was stolen from data centers in Iceland several months ago might have reached China, according to media reports from the Nordic nation, which has attracted crypto miners with cheap energy and favorable conditions. At least 600 computers, graphics cards, motherboards, processors, and other hardware, worth an estimated $2 million, disappeared in a series of burglaries in December and January. Last month, Chinese authorities conducted a raid on a crypto mining farm in the city of Tianjin. According to local media, police have confiscated 600 computers used to mine cryptocurrency in the illegal facility.\nThe suspected organizer of the heist in Iceland, Sindri Thor Stefansson, fled to Sweden after escaping from a low security prison in his country. He was recently arrested in Amsterdam and is now awaiting extradition to Iceland, where he is going to face trial. The ongoing investigation and the court proceedings are expected to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding one of the biggest burglaries in Iceland's history. Tracing the stolen mining equipment is a priority for authorities trying to get to the bottom of this case. Their findings should prove or dismiss the media speculation around the possible connection between the two incidents.\nZcash Opposes ASIC-Based Mining after Chinese Giant Launches Equihash Miner Developers of Zcash have stated that the struggle against ASIC-supported mining is a priority. They have indicated their opposition after the launch of a new application specific circuit designed to process transactions for the privacy coin. Zencash, a Zcash fork, has also announced plans to potentially change its algorithm for the same reason. Earlier in May, the Chinese mining giant Bitmain revealed the upcoming release of a new device that will be capable of working with the Equihash algorithm, which was itself introduced to prevent ASIC mining and is used by Zcash and other cryptos. ASICs were initially developed to mine mainly bitcoin. The highly specialized hardware is capable of handling the enormous number of calculations involved in the processing of its transactions.\nBitmain has a track record of successfully overcoming ASIC-resistant algorithms. The mining equipment producer has already developed powerful miners for many cryptocurrencies whose developers have tried to stop the centralization of hashing power. These include miners for the algorithms Ethash, used by the Ethereum network, and Cryptonight, used by Monero. The new Antminer Z9 Mini, developed to mine Zcash, Zencash, and others, offers a hashrate of 10k Sol/s. It was expected to hit the market in June, but according to the manufacturer, it can be ordered now. \"To prevent hoarding and to let more individuals worldwide get one, we've set a limit of one miner per user,\" Bitmain said in a tweet .\nThe management of the Zcash Foundation has decided to allocate resources to study the influence of ASIC mining on the network. An advisory council will be convened to provide a \"scientifically grounded answer\" to the problem. The team behind Zcash, however, may be forced to fight a war on two fronts, after researchers from the University College London recently found a vulnerability in the crypto's algorithms. They believe that certain patterns in Zcash transactions significantly weaken its anonymity. The claim is that when the cryptocurrency is transferred from unprotected to protected addresses and then back again, the overall level of anonymity decreases significantly.\nStudent Leaves China after Losing on Crypto Investments A Chinese college student has reportedly lost a small fortune by local standards due to unwise crypto investments and has already left the country in search of better opportunities to compensate the losses. Liu Ke, a sophomore in his twenties, used all his money to buy cryptocurrency, mostly aircoins, when markets were going up towards the end of last year. When cryptos were hitting their all-time highs, he spent a total of 140,000 yuan (~$23,000), including amounts he borrowed from online micro loan platforms like Alipay and Baidu. He even \"invested\" the money for his tuition fees. Liu Ke told the local outlet 8btc that he now lives and works in the Cambodian coastal resort Sihanoukville, where he hopes to earn more money to cover his debts.\nWhat are your thoughts on today's stories in Bitcoin in Brief?

EPAZ\nByOmar RahimOmar Rahim is CEO of Energi Mine\nSince the birth of cryptocurrency, many have questioned whether tokens can count as ‘real money’. Cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin – have caused a buzz in the financial world, with leading financial figures often disagreeing publicly as to what they are and as to their future. All cryptocurrencies have the same foundation of using blockchain for value exchange. Some cryptocurrencies are focussed on creating a new digital money, others take the same principle but apply it specifically to a wide range of varied applications.\nA $15 COFFEE?\nCryptocurrencies share all the key qualities of ‘ real money’, except for the single most crucial characteristic: the ability to access and spend cryptocurrencies at merchants and retailers as quickly and easily as regular cash. Without this ability, widespread adoption of crypto will falter. That it is so difficult to buy your morning cup of coffee, or your weekly grocery shop, with your digital coins is testament to the spendability problem that plagues crypto.\nTo date, it has been particularly difficult to spend small amounts of cryptocurrency and handling payments has become a barrier to cryptocurrencies becoming adopted as a viable payment method. In January, using Bitcoin, it could cost up to $15 to get a transaction recorded by miners, which means a $3 coffee increasing fivefold in price: making it almost useless as a means of exchange for small transactions.\nHowever, promising new methods of payment are emerging that allow for the instant spending of cryptocurrencies at merchants and retailers, utilising an electronic credit-card sized device. In the near future, these cards will also hold the details of the user’s existing regular credit and debit cards. This follows a trend within banking that sees customers actively moving towards products that aggregate all of their spending methods, bank accounts, bills and other assets into one single screen or platform. This much can be best observed in Curve – a single card that, at the press of a button within an app, can transform itself into any of your various credit and debit cards – or with apps such as Money Hub that aggregate a user’s bank accounts into a single screen.\nCHANGING CRYPTO’S IMAGE\nCrypto has often been seen as catering to a group of crypto-enthusiasts who wish to keep all their assets in cryptocurrencies and who shun regular banks. This is certainly true of the evangelists in the community, and this emerging trend will enable them to spend their crypto currencies alongside or even in place of any fiat currency that they use – making their experience similar to anyone using a traditional bank.\nMuch like regular credit and debit cards, these all-in-one cards of the future will contain an EMV chip, enabling them to be used like any card at merchants and retailers to pay for purchases in local currency. However, the difference is that behind the scenes, payments are automatically routed to partner crypto exchanges and display as instantly debited from users’ cryptocurrency balances. In doing so, there is a hope that crypto users will soon be able to spend their currency on goods without the fear that their transaction will incur exorbitant transaction costs. A $3 coffee will hopefully remain $3 dollars when you use crypto.\nOne such example of these factors intersecting is the prototype FuzeX Card, which is due to shortly be introduced in the UK is identical in size and thickness to a standard debit or credit card. It contains an EMV chip, a dynamic magnetic strip, an e-paper display and three input/option buttons, allowing users to physically see the balance of their cryptocurrency accounts before spending. This gives users all the function of a regular debit or credit card, even incorporating into the card the services that would normally be placed in an app, and crucially bridges the gap between crypto and regular currencies.\nTHE REGULATORY UNDERPINNING\nIn the UK, such developments have been made possible by the country’s Open Banking regulations. Traditional banks are now required to let their customers safely share account data with third parties like FuzeX or Curve, providing them with “read only” access to customers’ accounts. This effectively makes banks responsible for underwriting their customers data security and allows third parties to aggregate account data into a single view or service.\nThe Open Banking regulations and changing consumer banking trends, particularly among millennials, together signal that there is an appetite for the convenience offered by an all-in-one card that spans multiple currencies and payment options. While aggregator cards like Curve are proving successful as all-in-one card options, they lack the ability to effectively bridge the normally segregated crypto and fiat currency markets. This is something that needs to be addressed to make cryptocurrency more viable as a legitimate currency alternative.\nTHE FUTURE OF CRYPTO\nCrypto has often been heralded as the currency of the future. And despite the doubting of its detractors, we are finally seeing it come of age and gradually trickle into the mainstream. This will hopefully pave the way for more widespread adoption of crypto as a means of exchange and also add weight to those currencies that have specific use cases: making their goals all the more achievable.\nALL comments are In My Own OPINION.

Later, on November 2008 the whitepaper was published on The Cryptography Mailing list at metzdowd by a programmer, or a group of programmers, using the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. It was titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”\nNakamoto has conducted a series of experiments with Bitcoin’s software before revealing it to others in January 2009. On Jan. 3, the first ever Bitcoin block has been mined, marking the beginning of Bitcoin’s existence. Later on Jan. 9, 2009, Nakamoto has released the updated 0.1 version of Bitcoin software on Sourceforge, which contained some minor bug fixes.\nNakamoto has also created the Bitcoin.org website, which he used to collaborate with other developers. Satoshi remained a mystery, as he – or she – did not reveal any personal information during the entire time of cooperation with other developers. After two years of collaboration, Nakamoto has handed the leading position to Gavin Andresen and ceased all involvement in the project in December 2010.\nSatoshi showed up once again on April 23, 2011, when he emailed a software developer, Mike Hearn, with “I’ve moved on to other things. It’s in good hands with Gavin and everyone.” From then no one knows what Satoshi is up to.\nWho else?\nLater on, the community has grown much bigger with many developers who continued to work on Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Core project has a large open source developer community with many contributors who perform research, peer reviewing, testing and so on. But it all can’t work without maintainers, who have commit access and feel responsibility for merging patches from contributors. They also do the final checks to ensure that patches are safe and correspond to the project’s goals. There are three best-known Bitcoin Core maintainers: Wladimir J. van der Laan, Jonas Schnelli and Marco Falke.\nFrom 2010 until 2014 Bitcoin’s lead developer was Gavin Andresen. Originally he was a developer of 3D graphics and virtual reality software, and in 2010 became involved in developing products for the Bitcoin market.\nSoon he was noticed by Satoshi Nakamoto and chosen to be the lead developer for Bitcoin Core. Two years later Gavin started the Bitcoin Foundation to support the development of the cryptocurrency. On April 8, 2014, he had passed his duties to Wladimir J. van der Laan.\nIn April 2013 Jonas Schnelli became another Bitcoin Core developer and the co-founder of a minimalist Bitcoin hardware wallet Digital Bitbox. He also created libbtc, a Bitcoin library written in C which is available for almost any OS.\nOne year after, Wladimir announced Marco Falke as “the new Testing & QA maintainer for Bitcoin Core.” In his welcoming post, van der Laan praises Marco’s success in testing framework, increasing coverage and some other important abilities.\nDevelopers want to make a modern software. Avast number of updates have been added to Bitcoin’s software over the years: a Linux and Qt user-friendly versions, LevelDB, seeding nodes through IRC and so on. Finally, from version 0.9.0 the software was renamed to Bitcoin Core. So far, the latest update is Bitcoin Core version 0.14.2 released on June 17, 2017.\nCore developers prefer to consider the Blockchain layer as highly decentralized system that gives them more independence. They also tend to make the software risk averse. A list of all developers who have contributed their code to Core’s software over the years can be found here. Thanks to the GitHub repository, any developer can now contribute to the Bitcoin project.\nBiography or fiction?\nSatoshi Nakamoto has claimed to be a Japanese, born on April 5, 1975. But the fact that his Bitcoin documentation hasn’t been published in Japanese and his perfect knowledge of English created some suspicions among others Bitcoiners.\nIf we try to translate his full name into English, we’ll get a very symbolic phrase: Quick witted inside a foundation. “Satoshi” stands for “quick-witted; wise”, “Naka” means “inside” and “Moto” stands for “foundation.”\nBut it’s only one of many possible translations which had been discussed here. Another way to translate it might be “born from the ashes” for Satoshi and “central origin” for Nakamoto, which altogether can be interpreted as “Born from the ashes of centralization.” Of course, these are all guesses, and the name might just have been selected randomly.\nSo even now the identity of Bitcoin’s inventor is uncertain: even whether it was “he,” or “she,” or “they.” Some known candidates have been suggested to be Satoshi: Charlie Lee or Hal Finney and Dorian Nakamoto.

According to statements by Chinese officials, the People’s Republic is developing a national standard for blockchain technologies, which should be introduced next year. Also, the Zcash Foundation is taking steps to protect the network of the privacy coin from ASIC-based mining. Chinese giant Bitmain has recently launched its Antminer Z9 Mini designed to process transactions for cryptos like Zcash, which use the Equihash algorithm.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General\nChina Preparing National Blockchain Standard Chinese authorities are working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic.\nA national standard plan for blockchain is under preparation and respective departments will set up a national blockchain and distributed Accounting Technology Standardization Committee said Li Ming, director of the Blockchain Research Office at the Electronic Industry Standards Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Li Ming told the Economic Information Daily that the national blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards. He also added that the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future.\nAccording to a recent statement by Yu Kequn, director of the National Center for Information Technology Security Research, “The development of blockchain technology may become an important step for China to grasp the global technological competition.” Yu Kequn also noted that blockchain technology is a new integrated application of distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanisms, and encryption algorithms. “It has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, tamper resistance, and anonymity,” the official pointed out and added: “It can be applied in the production, management, and transaction chains, and it will bring the entire life cycle of restructuring to different areas, so that it can be managed and traceable.”\nIceland’s Missing Mining Rigs May Have Been Found in China The mining equipment which was stolen from data centers in Iceland several months ago might have reached China, according to media reports from the Nordic nation, which has attracted crypto miners with cheap energy and favorable conditions. At least 600 computers, graphics cards, motherboards, processors, and other hardware, worth an estimated $2 million, disappeared in a series of burglaries in December and January. Last month, Chinese authorities conducted a raid on a crypto mining farm in the city of Tianjin. According to local media, police have confiscated 600 computers used to mine cryptocurrency in the illegal facility.\nThe suspected organizer of the heist in Iceland, Sindri Thor Stefansson, fled to Sweden after escaping from a low security prison in his country. He was recently arrested in Amsterdam and is now awaiting extradition to Iceland, where he is going to face trial. The ongoing investigation and the court proceedings are expected to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding one of the biggest burglaries in Iceland’s history. Tracing the stolen mining equipment is a priority for authorities trying to get to the bottom of this case. Their findings should prove or dismiss the media speculation around the possible connection between the two incidents.\nZcash Opposes ASIC-Based Mining after Chinese Giant Launches Equihash Miner Developers of Zcash have stated that the struggle against ASIC-supported mining is a priority. They have indicated their opposition after the launch of a new application specific circuit designed to process transactions for the privacy coin. Zencash, a Zcash fork, has also announced plans to potentially change its algorithm for the same reason. Earlier in May, the Chinese mining giant Bitmain revealed the upcoming release of a new device that will be capable of working with the Equihash algorithm, which was itself introduced to prevent ASIC mining and is used by Zcash and other cryptos. ASICs were initially developed to mine mainly bitcoin. The highly specialized hardware is capable of handling the enormous number of calculations involved in the processing of its transactions.\nBitmain has a track record of successfully overcoming ASIC-resistant algorithms. The mining equipment producer has already developed powerful miners for many cryptocurrencies whose developers have tried to stop the centralization of hashing power. These include miners for the algorithms Ethash, used by the Ethereum network, and Cryptonight, used by Monero. The new Antminer Z9 Mini, developed to mine Zcash, Zencash, and others, offers a hashrate of 10k Sol/s. It was expected to hit the market in June, but according to the manufacturer, it can be ordered now. “To prevent hoarding and to let more individuals worldwide get one, we’ve set a limit of one miner per user,” Bitmain said in a tweet .\nThe management of the Zcash Foundation has decided to allocate resources to study the influence of ASIC mining on the network. An advisory council will be convened to provide a “scientifically grounded answer” to the problem. The team behind Zcash, however, may be forced to fight a war on two fronts, after researchers from the University College London recently found a vulnerability in the crypto’s algorithms. They believe that certain patterns in Zcash transactions significantly weaken its anonymity. The claim is that when the cryptocurrency is transferred from unprotected to protected addresses and then back again, the overall level of anonymity decreases significantly.\nStudent Leaves China after Losing on Crypto Investments A Chinese college student has reportedly lost a small fortune by local standards due to unwise crypto investments and has already left the country in search of better opportunities to compensate the losses. Liu Ke, a sophomore in his twenties, used all his money to buy cryptocurrency, mostly aircoins, when markets were going up towards the end of last year. When cryptos were hitting their all-time highs, he spent a total of 140,000 yuan (~$23,000), including amounts he borrowed from online micro loan platforms like Alipay and Baidu. He even “invested” the money for his tuition fees. Liu Ke told the local outlet 8btc that he now lives and works in the Cambodian coastal resort Sihanoukville, where he hopes to earn more money to cover his debts.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s stories in Bitcoin in Brief?

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30-40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night's move marked the first new low since the trading range ( TR ) formed 3 weeks ago:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading Range\nUntil last night's drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR - signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat.\nSometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume View\nAt the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side. The reaction to this lower price range will give us further insight as to the upcoming market movements. This is the first sign of weakness in our current trend, so it stands to reason that we will see a bounce in price to retest the resistance within the TR and further test the supply/demand of the market. Without proper distribution, its unlikely to see a sustained continuation of the downtrend, but at this point we shouldn't rule anything out. On the short term, we can expect a retest of the $8,800s and possibly the lower $9K values.\nA somewhat alarming development is occurring as a consequence of this drop. Shortly after the market saw a golden cross of the 50/200 EMAs on the daily chart, we saw a definitive puncture of that support. Typically, the market doesn't just plunge through the 200 EMA without seeing some sort of resistance, but a daily candle close below the 200 EMA marks a more macro bearish signal. That, combined with a Bollinger Band expansion, gives us an indication that the move downward may, on a macro scale, be a prolonged move over the coming days and weeks:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro View\nSummary:\nA strong move downward brought the entire crypto market to its knees as bitcoin saw an $800 drop in a few short hours.\nThis move marked the first sign of weakness in our current uptrend\nThe sign of weakness combined with macro signals interacting with the Bollinger Bands and 50/200 EMAs hint toward a possible macro move downward.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

But while galleries and art dealers have mostly replaced this ancient system, a new breed of crowdfunded services like Patreon and Ulule are now lending even more fiscal independence to cash-strapped artists.\nDespite this liberating disruption in the artist-patron dynamic, such services pose the same risk to the financial security of creatives as the old patronage system, the revised art dealership model capitalism brought, and the crowdsourced funding alternative facilitated by the recent technological boom. Namely, that the artists are in a chronic threat of having their streams of income severed – at the drop of a hat.\nBut thanks to blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies, creatives might have a new viable option to make ends meet without leaving their fiscal stability in the hands of profit-oriented dealers and corporations. Meet French street artist Pascal ‘PBOY’ Boyart .\nBoyart recently attracted the attention of the cryptocurrency community after one of his pieces made its way to the top of the Bitcoin discussion board on Reddit .\nIndeed, numerous Redditors flocked to salute him for his witty use of QR codes as a way of funding his work with Bitcoin donations from inspired passers-by.\nInfluenced by the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin, Boyart has made cryptocurrencies and decentralization a central theme in his work. In his paintings, Bitcoin becomes not only an integral part of the piece itself but also the very method by which Boyart can profit from his creation.\nThe QR codes are both his statement against the dangers of central censorship and his weapon of liberation.\nIn this sense, his artistic fascination with the technology is two-fold: it explores how cryptocurrencies are gradually challenging the status quo of central authorities and simultaneously puts this playful exploration to the test.\nThis, precisely, is the conundrum Boyart addresses in his mural of esteemed Dutch painter Rembrandt (whose life was marked by severe financial hardships despite his undeniable talent).\nBut while it was the Rembrandt piece that brought the recognition of Reddit to Boyart, it wasn’t the first time the artist had experimented with incorporating Bitcoin donation addresses in his work.\n“I first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017,” Boyart told Hard Fork. “I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father ‘Dad, what is money?’ and I placed a QR code at the side of my signature.”\n“I wasn’t sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations,” the artists added. “I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos’ book The Internet of Money .”\nSince then, Boyart has received over $1,000 (approximately 0.11 BTC) in donations so far, according to stats from the Bitcoin blockchain explorer.\nBoyart first got acquainted with Bitcoin in early 2014, but it took him four years to grasp the promise the technology behind it.\n“I didn’t understand it,” the artist told Hard Fork. “I thought it was a new PayPal.”\n“It was last May when I became really passionate about this new paradigm of money… I was thinking about all the best use cases artists can do with it,” Boyart continued. “It can free us from institutions and galleries.”\n“The most interesting aspect is decentralization – a peer-to-peer horizontal system,” he added. “Art and creation need that, I believe.”\n“My street art costs me a lot of money in materials and painting,” Boyart said. “But instead of funding alternatives like [crowdfunding platform] Ulule, I wanted a solution that offers direct financial relation with the people.”\n“Bitcoin is perfect for this,” he added.\nAnyone keen on supporting Boyart and his art can find his donation address at his personal website here : in addition to Bitcoin, he also welcomes donations in Litecoin and Ethereum.\nCurious to see more of his pieces?

According to statements by Chinese officials, the People’s Republic is developing a national standard for blockchain technologies, which should be introduced next year. Also, the Zcash Foundation is taking steps to protect the network of the privacy coin from ASIC-based mining. Chinese giant Bitmain has recently launched its Antminer Z9 Mini designed to process transactions for cryptos like Zcash, which use the Equihash algorithm.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General China Preparing National Blockchain Standard\nChinese authorities are working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic.\nA national standard plan for blockchain is under preparation and respective departments will set up a national blockchain and distributed Accounting Technology Standardization Committee said Li Ming, director of the Blockchain Research Office at the Electronic Industry Standards Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Li Ming told the Economic Information Daily that the national blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards. He also added that the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future.\nAccording to a recent statement by Yu Kequn, director of the National Center for Information Technology Security Research, “The development of blockchain technology may become an important step for China to grasp the global technological competition.” Yu Kequn also noted that blockchain technology is a new integrated application of distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanisms, and encryption algorithms. “It has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, tamper resistance, and anonymity,” the official pointed out and added: “It can be applied in the production, management, and transaction chains, and it will bring the entire life cycle of restructuring to different areas, so that it can be managed and traceable.” Iceland’s Missing Mining Rigs May Have Been Found in China\nThe mining equipment which was stolen from data centers in Iceland several months ago might have reached China, according to media reports from the Nordic nation, which has attracted crypto miners with cheap energy and favorable conditions. At least 600 computers, graphics cards, motherboards, processors, and other hardware, worth an estimated $2 million, disappeared in a series of burglaries in December and January. Last month, Chinese authorities conducted a raid on a crypto mining farm in the city of Tianjin. According to local media, police have confiscated 600 computers used to mine cryptocurrency in the illegal facility.\nThe suspected organizer of the heist in Iceland, Sindri Thor Stefansson, fled to Sweden after escaping from a low security prison in his country. He was recently arrested in Amsterdam and is now awaiting extradition to Iceland, where he is going to face trial. The ongoing investigation and the court proceedings are expected to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding one of the biggest burglaries in Iceland’s history. Tracing the stolen mining equipment is a priority for authorities trying to get to the bottom of this case. Their findings should prove or dismiss the media speculation around the possible connection between the two incidents. Zcash Opposes ASIC-Based Mining after Chinese Giant Launches Equihash Miner\nDevelopers of Zcash have stated that the struggle against ASIC-supported mining is a priority. They have indicated their opposition after the launch of a new application specific circuit designed to process transactions for the privacy coin. Zencash, a Zcash fork, has also announced plans to potentially change its algorithm for the same reason. Earlier in May, the Chinese mining giant Bitmain revealed the upcoming release of a new device that will be capable of working with the Equihash algorithm, which was itself introduced to prevent ASIC mining and is used by Zcash and other cryptos. ASICs were initially developed to mine mainly bitcoin. The highly specialized hardware is capable of handling the enormous number of calculations involved in the processing of its transactions.\nBitmain has a track record of successfully overcoming ASIC-resistant algorithms. The mining equipment producer has already developed powerful miners for many cryptocurrencies whose developers have tried to stop the centralization of hashing power. These include miners for the algorithms Ethash, used by the Ethereum network, and Cryptonight, used by Monero. The new Antminer Z9 Mini, developed to mine Zcash, Zencash, and others, offers a hashrate of 10k Sol/s. It was expected to hit the market in June, but according to the manufacturer, it can be ordered now. “To prevent hoarding and to let more individuals worldwide get one, we’ve set a limit of one miner per user,” Bitmain said in a tweet .\nThe management of the Zcash Foundation has decided to allocate resources to study the influence of ASIC mining on the network. An advisory council will be convened to provide a “scientifically grounded answer” to the problem. The team behind Zcash, however, may be forced to fight a war on two fronts, after researchers from the University College London recently found a vulnerability in the crypto’s algorithms. They believe that certain patterns in Zcash transactions significantly weaken its anonymity. The claim is that when the cryptocurrency is transferred from unprotected to protected addresses and then back again, the overall level of anonymity decreases significantly. Student Leaves China after Losing on Crypto Investments\nA Chinese college student has reportedly lost a small fortune by local standards due to unwise crypto investments and has already left the country in search of better opportunities to compensate the losses. Liu Ke, a sophomore in his twenties, used all his money to buy cryptocurrency, mostly aircoins, when markets were going up towards the end of last year. When cryptos were hitting their all-time highs, he spent a total of 140,000 yuan (~$23,000), including amounts he borrowed from online micro loan platforms like Alipay and Baidu. He even “invested” the money for his tuition fees. Liu Ke told the local outlet 8btc that he now lives and works in the Cambodian coastal resort Sihanoukville, where he hopes to earn more money to cover his debts.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s stories in Bitcoin in Brief?

He was arrested in connection with Rs 26 lakh fraud perpetrated by luring people to invest their Bitcoins in an international company. Sources from EOW said Wasnik was part of Malaysian company Future Bit that belonged to one Mike Lucy and Romji Bin Ahmed. The company, which had held several seminars in city since January last year, offered to double the amount of virtual currency Bitcoins invested in their firm after a period of 90 days. Till the completion of 90-day period, investors were promised 1.05% interest daily. The investors, provided with an ID and password for their accounts, were made to purchase their Bitcoins from an Ahmedabad-based company Zebpay Pvt Ltd. After several investors, including many from city, invested their Bitcoins in Malaysian company, it wrapped up the operations leading to complaints against it. Police said the investors from city, including complainant in the case Mayuresh Ganorkar, had already invested Bitcoins worth about Rs 26 lakh. An officer of EOW said Wasnik was produced before a court on Thursday that allowed a five-day custody to the cops for interrogation. The Malaysian company had floated it’s operation in city without seeking any permission from either RBI or SEBI.

A community that is educated will be less influenced by propaganda. The second principle is that of clarity. The community needs to be \"on the same page\". There is never going to be a perfect alignment of opinions among a large group of people, but… we need to have the same basic vision for Bitcoin Cash.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 1\nIt's Not Complicated, Bitcoin Cash is Money If you have something of value to offer me, and I'm willing to pay for it, then I send you bitcoin cash. No middleman and low fees.\nDone. Instantly.\nThat's the vision.\nThe Challenge of Distributed Consensus In bitcoin, everyone needs to be using the same set of rules — also called consensus rules, network rules, or protocol rules. What happens when we need to upgrade or change the rules?\nWe have this nifty thing in bitcoin called \"Proof of Work\". It secures the network, and it keeps everyone on the same set of rules.\nIt's also a voting mechanism: The miners can vote on changing the rules because the \"longest\" chain (the chain with the most accumulated proof of work) is accepted by convention.\nIn other words, the ultimate decision as to what rules the network follows are in the hands of the largest combined group of mining power. This is commonly known as Nakamoto Consensus .\nForking Off Because of Metcalf's Law , commonly referred to as \"the network effect\", miners with a dissenting opinion are highly incentivized to capitulate and rejoin the majority.\nTheir only alternative is to \"fork off\" and continue mining a minority chain. This is usually not worth it, unless the direction that the majority wants to go is so radical that it's deemed unacceptable.\n…which is precisely what happened when Bitcoin Cash forked off from BTC on August 1st, 2017.\nThe BTC community had wandered too far off the reservation. They focused on making it cheap to run a node even if it was expensive to send a transaction. They valued being a digital commodity over being a payment system. They worked on ethereal problems of the future rather than the real problems facing us today. And worst of all, they allowed censorship to flourish.\nNakamoto Consensus works and is simple. We all stay together until it no longer makes sense.\nIts limitation is that bitcoin is also a social experiment — it's not just miners that make up the ecosystem. The miners (who are actually voting) are also trying to make the decisions they believe the developers, users, investors, and businesses will support. That's why education (and communication) are so important.\nA Magic Formula For Governance? What happens when we think we all want the same thing, but disagree on the best way to achieve it?\nFor example, last year Bitcoin Cash's difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) was updated but there was some contention between developers on the best algorithm to use.\nIt would be nice to have some governance process by which competing ideas could be resolved. So far, no one has invented a \"magic formula\" one-size-fits-all solution, although some have tried. For example, here is a proposal that attempts to create a simple, effective governance process.\nIn the above proposal, who decides if \"a fix/improvement is under time pressure\", and what the \"period of time\" should be for voting on a proposal? Most importantly, how do you make sure miners have enough time (and unbiased information) to make the proper voting decisions?\nEven though there's no silver bullet or magic formula, that may be ok. In the end, decisions are made and Bitcoin Cash moves on.\nBCH is a Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System The Bitcoin Core approach was to avoid making any protocol changes without broad consensus. Generally, in a system that depends on consensus, there is wisdom in this.\nSome would say that Core took this too far; that they impractically avoided making needed changes by looking for perfection. Others believe that this was merely an excuse and that those in control had already made up their minds against raising the blocksize.\nEither way, the common thread is that the community lacked clarity around wanting to be a peer to peer electronic cash system and what that really means.\nKnowing exactly what we want, and why, will help us to avoid stagnating and splintering in the future.\nWritten by Jonald Fyookball\nJonald Fyookball (pseudonym) is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, best known as the project leader of the Electron Cash wallet, and for a series of hard hitting articles on the Bitcoin scaling debate.

The cryptocurrency failed to reduce throughout the descending (bearish) 5-day moving average (MA) located at $9,382 yesterday, despite the bullish falling station breakout on May 9, and fell beneath the $9,000 mark as expected. As of writing, BTC is shifting hands around $8,800 – beneath the 100-day moving average (MA) of $8,849 and down 2.42 percent from the previous day’s close (as per UTC) of $9,018. The 10 percent decline from the latest high of $9,990 has diminished the bulls and has fostered the odds of a deeper drop to the 50-day moving average strung up at $8,282. Daily graph\nThe preceding chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $9,149 (23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement), compelling indications into bearish territory. For example, the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 50.00, confirming that a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend shift and opening up the doors to get a further drop in prices. The 5-day MA along with the 10-day MA are trending south, having witnessed a bearish crossover before this week. 4-hour graph\nOn the 4-hour graph, BTC has violated the trendline support in a convincing fashion, and also the 50-candle and 100-candle MAs have topped out (shed bullish bias). The cryptocurrency looks set to test the progressively ascending (mildly bullish) 200-candle MA located just above the $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement, seen from the daily graph). Nevertheless, the moving average support might hold earth for a couple of hours as the relative strength index (RSI) shows oversold conditions. 1-hour graph\nThe 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA are trending south west and positioned one beneath the other in favor of the bears. However, the RSI on the 60-minute graph also shows oversold conditions. Therefore, a minor corrective rally can not be ruled out. View\nBitcoin will probably break below $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), signaling the end of the rally from the Apr 1 low of $6,425 and dangers decreasing to $8,282 (50-day MA) over the weekend. The cryptocurrency could revisit $9,000 as indicated by the oversold conditions from the 4-hour and 1-hour graph. Nevertheless, upticks will probably be short-lived as indicated by usually bearish setup. Bearish invalidation situation: A rally from the somewhat bullish 200-candle MA located at $8,628 at 4-hour graph and a close above 10-day MA of $9,390 would abort the bearish view.\nBitcoin and graph image via Shutterstock\n information, CoinDesk is a media outlet that tries for the greatest abides by a ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:15:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05cfb506924aa7333dff1742fd7d9dc8c00b02f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdTzC78j6f8hEpi4uC0MjjLsCDTpS_0.RnvJVfNEJXTgzmHqkCS9CQdJNLzJ8S8AqEEQ--", "site_full": "earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Earn Money", "title": "An Easy way to Boost Your Bitcoin income", "title_full": "An Easy way to Boost Your Bitcoin income", "published": "2018-05-11T13:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05cfb506924aa7333dff1742fd7d9dc8c00b02f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdTzC78j6f8hEpi4uC0MjjLsCDTpS_0.RnvJVfNEJXTgzmHqkCS9CQdJNLzJ8S8AqEEQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "earn money (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T13:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "An Easy way to Boost Your Bitcoin income", "text": "This ad is from a PRO or GOLD HERCULIST member.

Betancourt in Room 77 in Berlin. When I asked him where he was from, and he replied with “Venezuela,” was I excited to see what he would have to report. The assessment first-Hand, I think it is very valuable. Alejandro told me that he is the founder and CEO of Mango Markets, one of the three crypto-exchanges in Venezuela. Since I had to interview him. What can you imagine under the Mango Markets?\nWe are a stock exchange for digital currencies in Venezuela. Currently you can trade Bitcoin, Ether, and the national currency (Bolivar). Our goal is to create a solid Foundation for Venezuelans to get access to the Blockchain technology and to regain control over its own finances. What was the biggest challenge in building the business?\nThe biggest challenge is the legal uncertainty. In a country where the government has absolute control, can be fucking each solution as a dualie. Any real solution has a double effect. It proves that there is an actual Problem. In addition, it proves that the power fulfills commander in chief of his responsibility to solve. Whether it is to cover up incompetence or corruption – both of which are rampant in the country – would stop the government prefer the Innovation that could solve the Problem, as bad as this.\nIt is very difficult to reconcile that the government has on the one hand, a strong stance against the exchange of Fiat currencies (Bolviar against the US Dollar), on the other hand, crypto currencies with open arms. In principle, it is the same.\nThese grey zones and rapidly evolving Ecosystems pose great challenges when it comes to establish working relationships with banks. You have difficulties finding investors. Because for many the priority is not to invest in something that violates the local Regulation. Also Explain the technology turns out to be a challenge, because there are certain areas in which the System just doesn’t make sense. But that’s the way things work. How are the interactions with the government?\nOur interactions with the Fake, technology, and super intendant for crypto-currencies were polite and productive, because we want to put our focus on the technology rather than policy. So we want to lead a paradigm-change for the use of Blockchain solutions.\nHowever, it is becoming more and more clear that the Ministry of technology and the super intendant is only to give the people the impression that things “are treated in the right way”. The real decisions are made for political reasons and behind the Scenes.\nWe have been excluded completely. After six months of Meetings and a formal request for a stock exchange license (which has not been assigned yet) – not awarded, the government is suddenly on the night of 16 licenses to Exchanges even exist yet. Our sources say that half of these exchanges belong to high-ranking politicians and military. The other half belong to doubtful business men, the rich bribes paid by the funds.\nThe fact that not a single one of the existing local stock exchanges has received a license, given we have reason to believe that the real intention of the government all of the Innovation is to smother. No one is allowed to drive Innovation forward and we will have to give up our business, if we get no license. The award of the license, acts more like a political bet than on technology, business, or legislative docility is supported. What are your plans for 2018?\nWe begin by asking, “What can we not accomplish together, that we do this alone?”. The government has tried to prevent the free flow of information, limit freedom of expression and to incite hatred among Venezuelans. Apostasy is, either to leave the country or end up in prison. Today, over four million Venezuelans are distributed around the world. I’m working on several projects – all with the focus on Blockchain technology and the Venezuelan community. I act mainly as a bridge between the innovation hub’s capital and Venezuela as a country where these solutions can be implemented.

The almost quasi-religious argument is basically Ethereum enthusiasts claiming their coin preserves an untampered – pure – history of the Ethereum blockchain, free from interference.\nWhile Bitcoin Cash supporters claim that their fork is a faster, more reliable version of Bitcoin, and a better example of the “true vision” of Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The experts have weighed in on feud and Maxwell Arnold co-author of the crypto Laser whitepaper told Express.co.uk that, “the beef seems to stem from the idea that as ETH transitions to proof-of-stake – as opposed to proof-of-work – it will supposedly make ETH less secure – whereas Bitcoin Cash is based on proof-of-work.”\nHe said: “As ETH doesn’t necessarily have a fixed supply, it raises questions as to the value of the currency, compared to Bitcoin Cash, which does have a fixed supply just like Bitcoin.” JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon is one of Bitcoin’s harshest critics It would be like if I copied a computer games code and then spent huge amount of money on marketing saying that my version was the real game. Reddit threads have emerged exploring the hatred between the two communities.\nBitcoin Cash believers say that there was an organised attempt to create a negative sentiment towards Bitcoin Cash and label it a scam. User regecide2025 describes his experience discussing Bitcoin online as “annoying”.\nHe said: “I don’t have a problem with Bitcoin Cash. I have a problem with the community since they decided attacking people and if you try to have any conversation with them it turns into ‘you’re a paid core shill’ or ‘you’re just afraid of BCH’.” User Uncle-Badtouch agrees, lamenting the “cult-like behaviour” of bitcoin believers, and comparing online discussion over the two coins to, “being attacked by scientologists”.

CURRENCY:BTC\nFrom Tyler Durden : Shortly after FundStrat’s Tom Lee presented his thesis for why mining will take Bitcoin to $36,000 by the end of 2019, the crypto space suddenly kneejerked lower on notable volume.\nNo obvious catalyst for the move for now… This drop comes as CoinTelegraph reports of new research from Fundstrat Global Advisors places Bitcoin prices at $36,000 by the end of 2019, co-founder Tom Lee revealed Thursday, May 10.\nAnalysis of the relationship between Bitcoin mining costs and price by Fundstrat’s Quantamental Strategist Sam Doctor has led the market research firm to predict the cryptocurrency’s range will fall between $20,000 and $64,000 by 2019 year end.\nimage courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nThe calculations focused on Bitcoin Price to Mining Breakeven Cost Metric, known as P/BE, which Doctor says has “proven a reliable long-term support level.”\n“We expect the mining economy to grow over the next several years, and project a BTC price of ~$36,000 by year end 2019 based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple,” an executive summary of the findings uploaded to Twitter by cofounder Tom Lee reads.\nThe price target is broadly in line with Lee’s own recent prediction of $25,000 by the end of 2018.\nRemaining bullish on Bitcoin has characterized both Lee and Fundstrat in recent months, a previous survey in April revealing that 82% of institutional investors believed prices had already “bottomed out.”\nThe survey also contained a prediction question, with the highest number of respondents opting for a range of between $10,000 and $20,000 by the end of this year.\nThis article is brought to you courtesy of ZeroHedge .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

bitcoin bubble crashed:\n“You were very right! All the cryptos have CRASHED. Good call!”\nI didn’t address the crypto situation much as it unfolded because I didn’t want readers mistakenly buying into the bubble. Now that the air has come out of the crypto-mania, I hope it’s safe to talk about the real opportunity.\nI’m not talking about Bitcoin. I’m talking about the blockchain – and the dividend growth opportunities that will unfold as this “megatrend” plays out in the coming years and decades.\nThe blockchain is the nascent technology that serves as the backbone for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, I’m going to introduce you to five pioneering income plays that boast a “blockchain kicker.”\nFirst, a quick primer on blockchain.\nThe simplest way to describe the technology is to call it a digital ledger of sorts. It’s essentially just a group of encrypted records (“blocks”) that can be used to record transactions and other interactions.\nThe utilization of blockchain that people are most familiar with are cryptocurrencies – products such as Bitcoin that are meant to serve as digital currencies, but have quickly become extremely speculative investments as they’ve gained thousands of percent in just a few years. But companies are increasingly learning that blockchain can be used for so much more, from tracing medical histories to keeping voting records.\nAs a result, companies from Amazon (AMZN) and International Business Machines (IBM) to Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are becoming increasingly involved in trying to exploit this technology. That has given rise to a few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on this space, including one that’s surprisingly rife with dividend growth names.\nThe Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) is a portfolio of companies expected to benefit from blockchain in some way, with the stocks actually graded by their “potential for increased economic profit, operational efficiencies, and transformational business practices.” In short, it holds “companies working to utilize and incorporate blockchain technologies into their businesses.”\nWhat fascinates me about this fund, however, is the dividend growth potential in some of its component stocks.\nReality Shares’ BLCN is a deviation from its main focus: income. The ETF provider boasts another quartet of funds, all of which hold dividend stocks, and three of which are centered around the company’s proprietary “DIVCON” system.\nThe DIVCON system essentially measures a stock’s dividend health, assigning a score of 1 to 5, “where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut.”\nAnd right now, this system is flashing a ringing endorsement for five blockchain-linked stocks, which are all at “DIVCON 5.” In other words, they’re in the best position for dividend growth going forward:\nVisa (V) Dividend Yield: 0.6% BLCN Weight: 1.39%\nA stock like Visa (V) that yields just 0.6% hardly screams “income opportunity,” but it is. Visa has juiced its payout by 154% in five years. But it’s not just a prolific dividend grower – it’s a perfect example of the share-price growth you should expect when a company puts its shareholders first via increasingly generous cash payments.\nAs Visa’s Dividend Goes, So Does Its Price\nVisa already is elbow-deep in blockchain. The company launched a pilot phase of a blockchain-based B2B payments service called B2B Connect last year in partnership with banks in the U.S., South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines. The service will allow institutions to make payments to one another directly, and the second phase of the project is expected to go live later this year.\nMasterCard (MA) Dividend Yield: 0.5% BLCN Weight: 1.40%\nVisa rival MasterCard (MA) also has its hands in blockchain, making its moves through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In early April, the credit-card processing company filed a patent to help verify and store identity data on a blockchain system. Later in the month, it filed another patent, this time to create “fast track flags” within the blockchain that would allow nodes (any electronic device that performs a task within the blockchain network) to more quickly verify data, making the system work more efficiently.\nMasterCard (MA) Has Some Catching Up to Do – in a Good Way\nMasterCard might be an even more intriguing opportunity. While Visa’s share price and dividend growth have been roughly in line, MA shares – despite more than tripling over the past year – still haven’t caught up with the pace of the dividend, which has quadrupled and then some over the same time frame.\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Dividend Yield: 2.2% BLCN Weight: 2.04%\nTexas Instruments (TXN) isn’t exactly known for being the flashiest of chip stocks. Its analog chips and embedded processors, which make up 80%-plus of revenues, are found in some of the simplest of devices, from calculators to alarm clocks. But they have a wide array of uses, from appliances to displays to motors drives and even avionics.\nThe company is increasingly delving into more cutting-edge technologies, however, such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. And its position as a chipmaker also puts it square in the world of enabling the devices that make the blockchain possible.\nThat said, TXN’s positioning in the less glamorous world of analog chips makes it a cash cow with the few companies that even want to compete with it. And Texas Instruments makes good use of that cash, more than doubling its dividend over the past five years.\nIntuit (INTU) Dividend Yield: 0.8% BLCN Weight: 1.31%\nIf the blockchain acts as a ledger of sorts, what better company to research its applications than Intuit (INTU) – the well-known purveyor of accounting software such as TurboTax and QuickBooks.\nIntuit clearly spells out the blockchain opportunity in a post about the technology’s potential:\n“Some accounting and auditing firms already embrace blockchain technology. Blockchain transactions are simpler, more visible, and more transparent. Improvements in operational efficiency mean that much of the work accountants do, such as collecting and inputting data, sampling, and proving provenance, takes place automatically. This leaves accountants more time to provide valuable services to their clients.”\nAgain, this is another prolific dividend grower that has more than doubled its quarterly dole in five years. And its DIVCON rating of 5 implies that INTU is well-armed enough to continue the upward march.\nIntuit (INTU): Self-Service Taxes, Full-Service Dividends\nNvidia (NVDA) Dividend Yield: 0.3% BLCN Weight: 2.06%\nOne of BLCN’s most exciting holdings is also one of the “healthiest” from a dividend perspective.\nNvidia (NVDA) , maker of high-performance chips, is among the stocks most commonly connected with the booming blockchain technology. That’s because its GPUs are widely used by cryptocurrency “miners,” who need extremely powerful computers to do the processing necessary to generate new digital tokens.\nIn fact, demand is so intense that Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang recently said the company needs to crank out more of the GPUs to catch up, as video gamers (Nvidia’s bread-and-butter market) are finding it difficult to procure the graphics chips their advanced games require.\nThe sky seems the limit, then, for its blockchain potential, and the same goes for NVDA’s income opportunity. Because despite the fact Nvidia has powered up its dividend by 76% since 2014, it currently boasts a mere 11% payout ratio. That’s a large reason why Nvidia boasts DIVCON’s top score of dividend health, and why investors should be licking their chops over this dual-threat stock going forward.\nHow to Earn 12% Annual Returns For Life!\nRobust dividend growth separates the winners from the losers.\nAnd I’m not just talking about the stocks.\nLow dividend growth goes hand-in-hand with slow and no growth – and even eventual decay. Hitch your wagon to the supposedly “safe” blue chips that most financial pundits shill for, and you’ll quickly be looking for part-time work a few years into your retirement.\nIf you want to retire fully funded and worry-free, it’ll take more – a lot more. In fact, it’ll take 12% in safe, annual returns.\nThat sounds impossible, but it’s not. It takes a special kind of portfolio that offers high current yield, and dividend growth, and the potential for double-digit capital gains in some years. But after months of research and weeding out numerous “ticking yield bombs,” I’ve identified a handful of stocks and funds that check all those boxes.\nThese stock picks will each reap at least 12% in annual returns – the magic number you need to meet to ensure the worry-free retirement you’ve labored so hard for decades to reach.\nMy “12% for Life” portfolio ditches pundit favorites such as Exxon Mobil, Coca-Cola or General Mills – yes, the same General Mills that has lost a quarter of its value this year! – and relies on these kind of picks instead: One stock that has juiced its dividend 800%-plus in just four years, and has at least another decade of double-digit growth ahead of it! A high-growth, high-yield “double threat” stock that threw off 252% gains the last time it was this cheap. A 9%-plus payer that hikes its payout multiple times a year, and is on track to double its payout by 2021!\nIncome. Dividend growth. Capital gains. Even nest egg protection. This all-weather portfolio is a diversified powerhouse that provides three times more income than most retirement experts say you need , while being built to be more durable against retirement-shattering downturns like in 2007-09.\nI don’t want you to ever have to worry about how you’ll pay next month’s bills in retirement. With this portfolio, you won’t have to. In fact, you’ll be able to pay all your monthly expenses from dividend income alone, with enough left over for the convertible, the new master bedroom or the island vacation – all those extras you should be enjoying in retirement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ac", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T14:38:47.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88903852d19dab3df726abc78f91a3735a4b3179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQuVHASPSroiNOHtKZG2FjVOenTL.Eeg_2maHS2P5VZzDiRzbbQuIvN4wDpXmmZ_N7.4nmzHdjA4mAae8EJt_.hhdzZZ4XOdntLlfrd0vjMbg--", "site_full": "contrarianoutlook.com", "site": "contrarianoutlook.com", "site_section": "https://contrarianoutlook.com/feed", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Contrarian Outlook", "title": "The Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys", "title_full": "The Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys", "published": "2018-05-11T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88903852d19dab3df726abc78f91a3735a4b3179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQuVHASPSroiNOHtKZG2FjVOenTL.Eeg_2maHS2P5VZzDiRzbbQuIvN4wDpXmmZ_N7.4nmzHdjA4mAae8EJt_.hhdzZZ4XOdntLlfrd0vjMbg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brett Owens", "published": "2018-05-11T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys", "text": "The Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys Brett Owens, Chief Investment Strategist Updated: May 11, 2018\nMy college buddy AC wrote to me after the bitcoin bubble crashed:\n“You were very right!

The blockchain is the nascent technology that serves as the backbone for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.… Read more", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ac", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:50:42.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af03eb05d11944230cc667fe2072d128fc280ea2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfK6RSb_kBGhd2pevbVtsMY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin alive", "title_full": "Bitcoin alive", "published": "2018-05-11T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.163, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af03eb05d11944230cc667fe2072d128fc280ea2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfK6RSb_kBGhd2pevbVtsMY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "baho11", "published": "2018-05-11T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin alive", "text": "Yes because iuse it now", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T08:43:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "163a7092a7f0e7a7b3ae11cffe5d6a0237991299", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQlWI_fP8ROqrsXbMP_MLJjIuoFvOxmdhjCqI_Yu7.ClrMZwVaA8z6Ar2f36qHOxPNuWOv2UVg8_Lt185ZHI7n5bJp4ZT7AignUBX2MnUSo1A4blQfjlW_YInXCki6tDj0-", "site_full": "blog.tradeo.com", "site": "tradeo.com", "site_section": "https://blog.tradeo.com/en/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Tradeo Blog", "title": "Cryptocurrencies and Forex Analysis May 11th: Bitcoin and Ether actively moving!", "title_full": "Cryptocurrencies and Forex Analysis May 11th: Bitcoin and Ether actively moving!", "published": "2018-05-11T12:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://blog.tradeo.com/tradeo-content/uploads/2017/06/Building-photo-blog.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29000, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "163a7092a7f0e7a7b3ae11cffe5d6a0237991299", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQlWI_fP8ROqrsXbMP_MLJjIuoFvOxmdhjCqI_Yu7.ClrMZwVaA8z6Ar2f36qHOxPNuWOv2UVg8_Lt185ZHI7n5bJp4ZT7AignUBX2MnUSo1A4blQfjlW_YInXCki6tDj0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dilyana", "published": "2018-05-11T12:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrencies and Forex Analysis May 11th: Bitcoin and Ether actively moving!", "text": "Cryptocurrencies and Forex Analysis May 11th: Bitcoin and Ether actively moving! May 11, 2018\nEURUSD, Daily timeframe\nBias: Uptrend\nYesterday, the euro appreciated about 80 pips. Currently, price is trying to overcome the area at 1.1900. The trend is still bullish so depending on Friday’s price action we may actually have a signal. The scenarios on our watch list are:\nScenario 1:\nThe euro continues to gain value against its dollar counterpart. If the pair makes another bullish day with at least 90-100 pips, this could mean a rejection of the support level at 1.1900. Going forward into next week, there could be opportunities for going long. Target level is the resistance at 1.2500.\nScenario 2:\nIf the week finishes below 1.1900 then bias would be tilted to the negative side. No long trades should be attempted prior to a signal candle on the daily timeframe. Price could retrace toward the support level at 1.1700. Next level is the farthest support at 1.1500.\nScenario 3:\nThe support area at 1.1500 is a pivotal level that is to be carefully observed. Should the euro drop below that price and close on a daily timeframe that would suggest a lot more weakness is to come into the market. From that level, the market would be back into a downtrend and we’d be looking for suitable places to go short only.\nGold, Daily timeframe\nBias: Bullish\nFinally, gold is now out of consolidation mode. On Thursday, the precious metal sprang to action and gained more than 80 pips. The market continues to move up. The daily timeframe chart shows that the market is trading back into the range located between the 1300.00 support level and the upper band located at 1350.00. The scenarios we’ve outlined are:\nScenario 1:\nIn order to gain perspective of where the market is heading, traders could always consult the USD index which shows how the dollar performs against the basket of major currencies. If the basket starts to appreciate against the dollar, chances increase that gold will appreciate as well. Target level is the resistance at 1350.00.\nScenario 2:\nThis scenarios considers a potential retest of the support at 1300.00. A drop would be a worrying sign for those positions that are already long. One way to aid a situation where you’re already in a long trade and price goes down for a retest is to have a stop loss that is reasonably wide so that price a breathing space to move.\nScenario 3:\nIf gold collapses below 1300.00 with a bearish candle, then we’d have to reposition our stance. From that point on, trades would be short only and our goal would be to look for appropriate places to short the market. Potential is significant in this scenario as well. Target level 1260.00\nBitcoin\nBias: Bearish, Daily timeframe\nThere is a clear reaction from the resistance level at $9,500. Bitcoin is heading for a bearish week. Not only that if the day continues to be negative, traders might witness a bearish engulfment. It would be best to plan our trades before Monday comes in with levels and alternative courses of action that the market might undertake. The scenarios monitored are:\nScenario 1:\nFurther weakness could take place next week, if the market closes in red. Traders have to remember that the trend dominating Bitcoin is currently a down trend. Consequently, we’d be looking to go short. Target level is the support at $5,800.\nScenario 2:\nIf the market returns beyond $9,500 and closes the week with bullishness, this could be a signal that retracement levels in the north are likely to be tested. Depending on risk appetite, traders may opt for a long trade. Just make sure that you’ve attached a stop loss in case the market reacts adversely. Retracement levels that could be tested are $10,000, $12,000 and $13,000.\nScenario 3:\nIf price gets hammered below the farthest support level at $5,800, make no mistake- more interest on the short side could pile into the market. Market flow would point toward the red and as traders our job is to maximize our chances for success. Thus, we’d be looking to go short the market. Target level could be the starting point of the market.\nEther\nBias: Bearish, 4-Hour timeframe\nGood news- ether is no long consolidating! The market is trading lower and price is actively moving south. As long as there is direction and volatility to the market, there will be opportunities we could take advantage of. The trend is very much a Down Trend so curentyl market flow is on our side. The scenarios we’ve mapped out are:\nScenario 1:\nMore bearishness could come into the market. This would be in line with the established trend. As you can see, Ether has respected the resistance at $740 and now the market is plummeting and trading around 680. Next level where price may find a support is $600. If the week closes below it, then Ether could test the farthest support area at $360.\nScenario 2:\nProvided price bounces from the support at $600, we’d have to wait. If a bullish daily rejection candle pushes back from that level to close at least around the $650s price, then we could see more upward movement toward precious retracements. These are $740, $860 and $1,000.\nScenario 3:\nFull recovery from the bear trend would be price trading above $1,000. For more conservative traders, that level would be the resistance at $1,180. This is the level where opportunities would be open to the upside. There is no cap to prices Ether could reach to as far as the upside is concerned.\nWishing you Happy and Successful Trading!\nRisk Warning: The information above constitutes Marketing Communication and does not constitute Investment Advice or Investment Research.

Gox?\nIf you look at the prices of all crypto currencies in the last hours, will see once again a deep red Tableau. Almost all of the Cryptocurrencies out of the Top 100 are part of the two-digit values in the Minus. The reason currently can be a mystery, one only. Nevertheless, a track leads once again to the bankruptcy Trustee of Mt. Gox.\nWho looks this Morning on the course overview, is scare. Apparently, there was once again a Crash that was triggered without a specific foreseeable reason. Is the Mt. Gox bankruptcy Trustee responsible?\nUntil the beginning of March, the bankruptcy Trustee of the insolvent Bitcoin had Mt stock exchange. Gox, Nobuaki Kobayashi caused a Crash of the entire crypto currency market by selling larger amounts of Bitcoin and Bitcoin to Cash.\nMt. Gox, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange was at the time. In February 2014, the biggest Hack occurred in the crypto currency history. About 850,000 Bitcoin were stolen from the exchange, and Mt. Gox had to cease its operation. The aggrieved investors and business partners have not been compensated since then. From the 850.000 Bitcoin only 200,000 showed up again. The rest of the Bitcoin, however, could not be found.\nAs afterwards was known, had Kobayashi sold since the end of September until the beginning of 2018, approximately 35,000 BTC and 34,000 BCH. The majority of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin (around 165,000 BTC), as well as the forked Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin, Gold, etc. but are still in the possession of the bankruptcy Trustee Kobayashi.\nIf you look at the well-known Bitcoin and Bitcoin to Cash addresses to the liquidator, then you can see that, once again, transactions from the Cold Wallet have taken place. Bitcoin: 14LuAvrRzAmeikgaafs7H5695xs5dVXqa5 Bitcoin Cash: 1K3RsYNFgYA5p2MMzZ4fT6XEYPV7N3NJmd\nA total of 02 have been since. May to today (11.05.) approximately 7.123 Bitcoin , as well as 7.309 Bitcoin Cash moves. Whether these amounts were actually sold or just a different address has been sent, it can not be verified. Nevertheless, a first trace for the Crash leads once again to the bankruptcy Trustee of Mt. Gox.\nIn addition, it is not yet clear to continue and, therefore, critical to ask whether there is a connection between the sales of Kobayashi and the Bitcoin crash in the past few months, and Today’s. As we reported, played in the past, other reasons may play a more important role. Furthermore, the subject of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) is not, in our view, always to be ignored, which is why the Mt. Contributed to Gox’s sales, perhaps even indirectly to the crash.\nDisclaimer: — trading in crypto-currencies carries a large financial risk, and can be up to a total loss of the invested capital.

The price is not a measure of a coin success so what I'm referring to here is the the number of ATMs, exchanges, stores, services, and people accepting it.\nSo even If we have some people using alts currently because they believe they are better then bitcoin (which may be true), bitcoin is evolving and the development is super active and exciting times are coming. I honestly believe that this make alts useless (say, by the end of the year), your thoughts?\nWhile it is true that a very high percentage of the alt coins are the same thing with just a few tweaks it is not true of all coins. There are several coins out there that have real solid use cases, for instance Phore. Not only does it make use of zero protocol, but it has a smart contract platform that allows decentralized applications to be created and ran on the Phore blockchain. Alt coins like these have real value and will not be rendered useless by bitcoin. Additionally, a lot of the alt coins that are pretty much just clones with a few minor tweaks are often used as hedges which is all thats needed to keep some of this crap alive lol.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T06:04:07.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40b70a789ef5ee87069839dff9b3b8a4c26a9519", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbAcKyOA3hb_r3b7Vp0oyFs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "So Bitcoin is King.. why is it?!", "title_full": "So Bitcoin is King.. why is it?!", "published": "2018-05-11T12:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40b70a789ef5ee87069839dff9b3b8a4c26a9519", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbAcKyOA3hb_r3b7Vp0oyFs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "oioi", "published": "2018-05-11T12:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "So Bitcoin is King.. why is it?!", "text": "a clear and fixed bitcoin remains the king for the digital currency,\nbecause the early bitcon of another coin coin is now widely circulated,\nand also with very high bitcoin prices so very worth bitcoin has the title of king for all the coins", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T07:58:26.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3bb535413460eec34ddc57472d85413f24e2ce0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZ8bLsO3zoiTyPbuGGu1tKq388XsOTmSkUx7RxbIMBT4OdAayjmiWRcK5tq.AoaKzg--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Pineapple fund bids farewell after donating 5104 bitcoins to various nonprofit organizations.", "title_full": "Pineapple fund bids farewell after donating 5104 bitcoins to various nonprofit organizations.", "published": "2018-05-11T12:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b3bb535413460eec34ddc57472d85413f24e2ce0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZ8bLsO3zoiTyPbuGGu1tKq388XsOTmSkUx7RxbIMBT4OdAayjmiWRcK5tq.AoaKzg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T12:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pineapple fund bids farewell after donating 5104 bitcoins to various nonprofit organizations.", "text": "Pineapple fund bids farewell after donating 5104 bitcoins to various nonprofit organizations.\nPineapple fund bids farewell after donating 5104 bitcoins to various nonprofit organizations.

According to their website, 90 percent of investors are from Argentina, with the rest coming from Mexico and Brazil.\nBitcoin ATMs are becoming popular in Argentina. Image: Wikimedia\nCosts of the ATMs and ROI Businesses installing these machines can expect to pay approximately $10,000 per machine, as equipment cost is $8,000 plus VAT per machine, with an additional $1,000-$1,500 for installation fees.\nA unique feature of Odyssey is that the working capital for ATMs can be handled by the company, or you can charge each trade transaction. Opting this method means taking out insurance, however.\nHow fast ATM owners see a return on their investment will depend on the rate per transaction, which is negotiated with Odysseys on a case by case basis. However, estimates show average return on investment (ROI) times at five or six months, meaning owners could already be seeing a profit within the first year of installation.\nThe fast turn around times is attributed to the high transaction volumes tellers currently have in Argentina, with around ten thousand transactions being conducted on a monthly basis. Note these numbers are likely to decrease as more supply of ATMs flood the market.\nArgentina's Currency Crisis The news comes at a time when the Argentine peso is going through a crisis, with the national currency depreciating against the dollar more than two percent on May 2, 2018, even after central bank intervention.\nIn times of crisis, people tend to focus more heavily on other assets like commodities, which makes this a perfect time for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be introduced into the market. Besides offering traditional ATM services, the ATMs are also cryptocurrency compatible and bi-directional, allowing users to buy or sell bitcoin , litecoin , and ether .\nThe post Argentina to Get Thousands of Bitcoin ATMs appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "odyssey group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:40:31.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9f4b666f85fc64903c6ee6fe1cacc5b2c7cf2b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywQOzX2bzhWxE0.xvVgIwP0LKMQvpHc4UNdA1vvXiZgYnVWxVD2tPKPQ--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Remains Supported", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Remains Supported", "published": "2018-05-11T12:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c9f4b666f85fc64903c6ee6fe1cacc5b2c7cf2b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywQOzX2bzhWxE0.xvVgIwP0LKMQvpHc4UNdA1vvXiZgYnVWxVD2tPKPQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T12:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Remains Supported", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price started consolidating gains above the $1,420 level against the US Dollar. There is a major bullish trend line forming with support at $1,440 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the near term, but it remains supported above $1,420. Bitcoin cash price is placed nicely in a bullish zone against the US Dollar. BCH/USD may perhaps resume its upside once the current correction is over.\nBitcoin Cash Price Consolidation After a major upside move above the $1,500 level, bitcoin cash price faced sellers against the US Dollar. The price traded as high as $1,538 before starting a downside correction. It declined and moved below the $1,500 support to start a short-term correction. It is currently testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,240 low to $1,538 high.\nHowever, there are many supports on the downside on the way up to $1,400. First, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support at $1,440 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. Second, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,240 low to $1,538 high. Third, the 100 hourly simple moving average near the $1,400 level. Finally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,240 low to $1,538 high at $1,389. Having said that, there are very less chances that the pair may correct below $1,400 in the short term.\nLooking at the chart , the price remains supported above the $1,420 level. On the upside, the $1,500 level is an initial resistance, followed by the $1,540 level. A break above the stated $1,540 level might open the doors for more gains towards $1,600.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD has moved below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,420\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,500\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Remains Supported appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:40:41.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bee0af682a338b3526d3e3a70ca99aa6b8d0d9e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrgkJZ.k9_FzdI_EauM1DaEziquaMOEcQS8kG30IljyhiJ_QU6EJ27WanhTTvj5T9scP9qnq3iGb.9xAIshXX4LJIWf55rfhUPZG6Kht77YTg--", "site_full": "buype.co.za", "site": "buype.co.za", "site_section": "http://buype.co.za/feed", "site_categories": ["business_software", "business"], "section_title": "Buy PE", "title": "Bitcoin Beginners Guide-How To Setup Bitcoin Cold Storage-Part 2", "title_full": "Bitcoin Beginners Guide-How To Setup Bitcoin Cold Storage-Part 2", "published": "2018-05-11T12:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bee0af682a338b3526d3e3a70ca99aa6b8d0d9e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrgkJZ.k9_FzdI_EauM1DaEziquaMOEcQS8kG30IljyhiJ_QU6EJ27WanhTTvj5T9scP9qnq3iGb.9xAIshXX4LJIWf55rfhUPZG6Kht77YTg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Business News", "published": "2018-05-11T12:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Beginners Guide-How To Setup Bitcoin Cold Storage-Part 2", "text": "Bitcoin Beginners Guide-How To Setup Bitcoin Cold Storage-Part 2 :\nIf you want to purchase Bitcoin as an investment and you want to join the BitClub Network Company, so that BitClub can mine Bitcoin and other Crypto Currency on your behalf to grow a stable and increasing investment for you, please join BitClub for free at http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn .

The benefit of this technique is you can load the JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being loaded. The tool is open source at https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org and the code can be reviewed at any time. Also, make sure you never share your private key with anyone or online. Adding funds to your cold storage wallet. The next step is you want to add bitcoin to the wallet. Just like with any other bitcoin transaction, using a wallet you may have online, scan the public cold storage wallet QR code or copy the address, and send funds to your cold storage. You can check the status of the funds at anytime using a Bitcoin block explorer. Redeeming bitcoin from cold storage.\nWhen you are ready to spend from your cold storage wallet, you will need to import the private key to a Bitcoin wallet that is online. Any wallet that supports importing private keys will work. For example, if you download the Bitcoin Unlimited wallet at https://wallet.bitcoin.com/ (which is a full Bitcoin client) you can import the private key. To do so, simply follow these steps. 1. Open the client and click on Help. 2. Select the Debug Window and click on the Console tab. 3. Type in the field “importprivkey <bitcoinprivkey>” (replace <bitcoinprivkey> with your private key and remove quotes). 4. Hit enter to import the private key; this will require a rescan of the blockchain which may take a few minutes to syncronize. In this screen, you can see the “importprivkey” command in the Console. Type “help” in the Console to get a full list of wallet commands.\nAnother alternative online web wallet that supports importing private keys is Blockchain.info at https://www.bitcoin.com/choose-your-wallet/blockchain . To import your private key on this wallet, simply follow these steps. 1. Open the online wallet. 2. Click on Settings and then click on Addresses. 3. Click on Import Address. 4. Copy and paste the cold storage private key and click Import/transfer. 5. You can safely archive the old address and transfer the funds to your wallet.

Crypto mining economics lead/explain $BTC price—suggests $39,000 per bitcoin by YE19. key takeaways below… pic.twitter.com/f5ZQ4py3jS\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 10, 2018\nIt’s been a rough couple of months for Bitcoin following the crypto’s December boom and subsequent bust; at several points since the beginning of the year, BTC has sunk below $8000, lows that it had not reached since 2017. However, some analysts believe that a recovery may already be underway; the coin has stabilized near $9000 over the last several weeks. Miners are More Likely to ‘Hodl’, Stabilizing the Market\nBTC’s fall has largely been attributed to a global rise in crypto regulations; the governments of countries such as South Korea, Russia, and the United States have begun taking cryptocurrency regulation more seriously.\nBanks and internet companies have also independently taken action to restrict access to cryptocurrency-related products and services. Some banks around the world have blocked their customers’ crypto-related transactions ; Facebook, Snapchat, Google, Twitter, and other social media platforms have banned or limited cryptocurrency advertisements on their sites.\nHowever, Doctor believes that BTC miners are playing a key role in stabilizing BTC’s valuation. Doctor reportedly said that Bitcoin miners are more likely to hold onto their coins during dips in valuation in order to sell when BTC’s price rises to make greater profits.\nIn a conference call with CNBC, Doctor said that “the primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.”\nDoctor also explained that “the release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.” At present, Fundstrat estimates that the cash break-even price for the popular ‘Antiminer’ BTC miners models s7 and s9 are $6,003 and $2,368 per coin, respectively.\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/994566148007055361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/long-blockchain-corp-announces-agreement-acquire-1000-%E2%80%8Ebitcoin-miners/", "https://t.co/f5ZQ4py3jS", "https://www.financemagnates.com/institutional-forex/regulation/ceo-calls-bitcoin-joke-nordea-bans-employees-cryptocurrency/", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/exclusive-marketing-fx-cfds-post-google-ads-ban-world/", "https://twitter.com/fundstratQuant?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam doctor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T15:45:08.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a05fabf2f2039abf4db7f45e9880038c68de823", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQhH3h8jj7Vt9bGIiW0HyFqUFsSYo2rlIPaqdnL4O2LP92gNtCbVXGma_frhNeSlW4tqSzh7nvP5z12rumdDujsF4QJtG1Yj8OI1fY3I.0SR.B5O77NF5eMTBBu6Ou5hCFp6KEzL.lLSO26bDfW9VEu", "site_full": "www.financemagnates.com", "site": "financemagnates.com", "site_section": "http://www.financemagnates.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Finance Magnates | Financial and business news", "title": "Bitcoin Miners Will Drive BTC to $36,000 by End of 2019, Fundstrat Predicts", "title_full": "Bitcoin Miners Will Drive BTC to $36,000 by End of 2019, Fundstrat Predicts", "published": "2018-05-11T12:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bitcoin-mining-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 35046, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a05fabf2f2039abf4db7f45e9880038c68de823", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQhH3h8jj7Vt9bGIiW0HyFqUFsSYo2rlIPaqdnL4O2LP92gNtCbVXGma_frhNeSlW4tqSzh7nvP5z12rumdDujsF4QJtG1Yj8OI1fY3I.0SR.B5O77NF5eMTBBu6Ou5hCFp6KEzL.lLSO26bDfW9VEu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rachel McIntosh", "published": "2018-05-11T12:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Miners Will Drive BTC to $36,000 by End of 2019, Fundstrat Predicts", "text": "Intelligence Intelligence Our Quarterly Report incorporates unique data on trading volumes and traders, in-depth insights, special guest articles, regional information, regulations, updates and much more.

Bitcoin enthusiasts can no longer use the banking app to withdraw from exchanges and echoes similar moves made by UK banks in the past.\nRevolut has marketed itself as a cryptocurrency friendly service, announcing buy and sell support for major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin , litecoin , and ether . However, the author discovered that on May 3, a payment from Kraken had been 'reverted' and after contacting support, we learned that Revolut no longer supports cryptocurrency-related services like Kraken.\nImage: Screenshot\nExamining Revolut's Twitter and blog, we see no official announcement of forewarning for their customers. After contacting Kraken, BTCManager found out that the exchange had been dealing with a lot of requests due to Revolut's decision.\nImage: Screenshot\nWhen asked why the fintech startup made such a decision, one of the support agents mentioned that is was something to do with 'security.' BTCManager reached out to CTO Vlad Yatsenko for further explanation, but at the time of writing has not replied.\nBritish banks Barclays and Lloyds have also in the past restricted bank accounts related to bitcoin trading, as reported by BTCManager in February 2017.\nRevolut's move to stop working with crypto-related services is quite confusing given they allow customers to buy bitcoin from them, and are planning a cashback feature converted straight into cryptocurrency. Revolut's chief executive Nikolay Storonsky said to Business Insider , \"In the next three months we're going to launch Platinum cards — it's a metallic card that allows you to get one percent cash back in cryptocurrencies and also provides you a concierge service.\"\nIt looks as if now Revolut's customers who use services like Kraken will have to find alternatives. It seems as time goes on, those using cryptocurrencies should not even bother with banking businesses, but rather avoid them completely to ensure and use peer-to-peer services like Bisq , Mycelium's inbuilt exchange.\nThe post Revolut Unexpectedly Stops Supporting Withdrawals from Bitcoin Exchanges appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "revolut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:10:25.110+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2a7edfb9302ad98565018686ed99a577bad3c1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywqtwuJRJa5DQkT1dKvtOf1TNzoksscjFBnbdOngz6NAdgoI7nUCjqTQ--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Turned Bearish", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Turned Bearish", "published": "2018-05-11T12:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2a7edfb9302ad98565018686ed99a577bad3c1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywqtwuJRJa5DQkT1dKvtOf1TNzoksscjFBnbdOngz6NAdgoI7nUCjqTQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T12:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Turned Bearish", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin price failed to break a major resistance area near $9,400 and declined sharply against the US Dollar. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $9,380 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now trading well below the $9,050 support, which is a bearish sign in the short term. Bitcoin price turned bearish below $9,050 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD may continue to move down as long as it is below $9,000-9,050.\nBitcoin Price Analysis Yesterday, we discussed a major resistance area near $9,450 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price was trading with a positive bias, but buyers failed to push the price above $9,400 and $9,450, which resulted in a downside move. There was a sharp bearish reaction and the price tumbled below the $9,050 and $9,000 support levels. The recent downside break looks real as the price settled below the $9,000 handle and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nIt traded as low as $8,696 and is currently consolidating losses. An initial resistance is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,465 high to $8,696 low. However, the most important resistance is close to $9,050, which was a support earlier . Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,465 high to $8,696 low is at $9,050 to prevent gains. A push above $9,050 could decrease the current bearish pressure in the short term.\nLooking at the hourly chart , is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $9,380. On the downside, a break and close below $8,600 may perhaps open the doors for more losses towards the $8,200 level in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently near the extreme oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $8,600\nMajor Resistance Level – $9,050\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Turned Bearish appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price analysis yesterday", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:10:32.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e8648e14a5b4464aabb5cfa6303b49314efe8c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powc7S.5E5gPw01cBwrAlAMfQTac7FZykQ12IdSTWkUzmj9ux2GuB3_S0kpfZp5vvorZp0y8wNry_PnizXlG4SfMLOijGFE86WDk7PkjBT6FEtlbzah5r2pu", "site_full": "invezz.com", "site": "invezz.com", "site_section": "http://invezz.com/rss/invezz.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Invezz - The Investors' Portal", "title": "Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) drops to three-weeks low below $9,000", "title_full": "Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) drops to three-weeks low below $9,000", "published": "2018-05-11T12:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://invezz.com//uploads/story/30631/thumbs/bitcoinprice_story_full.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e8648e14a5b4464aabb5cfa6303b49314efe8c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powc7S.5E5gPw01cBwrAlAMfQTac7FZykQ12IdSTWkUzmj9ux2GuB3_S0kpfZp5vvorZp0y8wNry_PnizXlG4SfMLOijGFE86WDk7PkjBT6FEtlbzah5r2pu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T12:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) drops to three-weeks low below $9,000", "text": "Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) drops to three-weeks low below $9,000 Fundstrat believes the original cryptocurrency could hit $36,000 by next year’s end by Dimitar Bogdanov 10:09 BST\nThe Bitcoin price (BTC/USD) has dropped below the $9,000 level after experiencing a sharp decline in Friday’s morning session.\nThe original cryptocurrency had a difficult session yesterday, with the $9,000 mark coming under pressure towards the end of the day. The digital coin was able to hold above the key price level, closing the session at $9,043.94, down from its opening level of $9,325.96.\nThe cryptocurrency continued to lose ground in the early hours of today’s trading, with its price dipping below $9,000 for the first time since May 1. This was followed by a drop to $8,696.02, a three-week low. Bitcoin has managed to recover some of its losses in more recent trading and its price is currently hovering around $8,790, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nDespite Bitcoin’s ongoing troubles, investment research firm Fundstrat remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s longer-term prospects. In a report published yesterday, Fundstrat pointed to the growth of Bitcoin mining activity as a likely driver of a new price surge for the digital currency.\n\"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report, as quoted by CNBC .\nDoctor added that the economics of Bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency. He noted that miners are more likely to hold Bitcoin as its price falls to breakeven for operating costs and sell as the price rises to pocket greater profits.\nFundstrat was co-founded by Tom Lee, a Wall Street analyst who is widely known for his bullish views on Bitcoin.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $9795, as of 10:06 BST. The digital coin has lost 6% of its value in the past 24 hours.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/10/bitcoin-could-soar-as-high-as-64000-next-year-fundstrat-predicts.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:27:19.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a752236b89e89872eaa33a497f409bc77e41707", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdtrBQ4wnXbVVqEq_NCYjYw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How bad is people's opposition to bitcoin?", "title_full": "How bad is people's opposition to bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-11T12:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.068, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a752236b89e89872eaa33a497f409bc77e41707", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdtrBQ4wnXbVVqEq_NCYjYw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dadan", "published": "2018-05-11T12:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "How bad is people's opposition to bitcoin?", "text": "There are as many fake news links as bitcoin as scammers and hackers as they catch the bitcoin in the eyes of people so many people ask bitcoin questions.

На конференции выступят представители IBM, Европейского парламента и крупной швейцарской юридической фирмы PwC Legal. Регулирование цифровых валют и блокчейна стало центральной темой для криптосообщества в наступившем году. Эксперты называют 2018-й годом регулирования. Поэтому на конференции в Праге в фокусе внимания будет именно законодательный вопрос. Мнение властей озвучит Димитриос Псаракис, советник Европейского парламента по рынкам капитала и регулированию финансовых технологий. В своем докладе он расскажет о подходах к регулированию криптовалют, которые позволят отрасли развиваться. Кроме того, он объяснит, как парламент, центробанки и судебная система видят правовой статус цифровых активов. Гюнтер Добрауц, партнер в юридической компании PwC Legal в Швейцарии, также поговорит о регулировании криптовалют, но в контексте их будущего. В выступлении он поднимет темы \"Заменит ли криптовалюта традиционные деньги?\" и \"Криптовалюты и банковская система: хайп или реальные перемены?\". Доминик Строукал, известный чешский эксперт по блокчейну (сооснователь Bit Agency и главный экономист в Roklen), посвятит свой доклад базовым принципам децентрализованных технологий. В выступлении на тему \"Чей же на самом деле блокчейн?\" он разберет определение распределенного реестра, его важнейшие характеристики и главные вызовы, связанные с приватностью. Инвесторов заинтересует выступление Сандриса Муринса, основателя немецкой компании Iconiq Lab, в котором он обобщит свое исследование двухсот популярных токенов. Эксперт пояснит, какие сервисы используют самые ценные токены, как происходит инфляция и дефляция цифровых активов, и даже заглянет в будущее, рассказав о токенизации искусственного интеллекта. Доклад Рене Бостик, технического вице-президента по инновациям и новым технологиям проекта IBM Cloud, называется \"Анализ извлеченных из блокчейна уроков: хайп или реальность?\". В нем она разберет тематическое исследование блокчейна и пояснит, в каких сферах применяется технология. Стефано Вирджилли, CEO в компании VOX ICO Consulting и директор по стратегическим вопросам в INVICTUS, посвятит свой доклад майнингу. Эксперт объяснит, как определяются стоимости транзакций, как понять сложность вычисления хеша и какие есть возможности для распространения блокчейна за пределами финансовой сферы. Также на конференции выступят представители CA Technologies, Adel, GRAFT Blockchain, Crowdholding и других компаний. Подробная программа доступна на сайте.

This week our CEO Roger Ver sat down in a video chat with the acclaimed championship female fighter Mei Yamaguchi to discuss her successful career, and introduced her to Bitcoin Cash for the first time.\nDuring the video, Yamaguchi downloads her first BCH wallet and our CEO scans her wallet’s QR code and sends her $1,000 worth of bitcoin cash instantly. After being sent some BCH, Yamaguchi seemed pleasantly surprised to see how fast it took to receive the funds.\nUpon getting her first BCH, Yamaguchi began to explain how she got started as a female MMA fighter and kickboxer.

All the cryptos have CRASHED. Good call!”\nI didn’t address the crypto situation much as it unfolded because I didn’t want readers mistakenly buying into the bubble. Now that the air has come out of the crypto-mania, I hope it’s safe to talk about the real opportunity.\nI’m not talking about Bitcoin. I’m talking about the blockchain – and the dividend growth opportunities that will unfold as this “megatrend” plays out in the coming years and decades.\nThe blockchain is the nascent technology that serves as the backbone for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, I’m going to introduce you to five pioneering income plays that boast a “blockchain kicker.”\nFirst, a quick primer on blockchain.\nThe simplest way to describe the technology is to call it a digital ledger of sorts. It’s essentially just a group of encrypted records (“blocks”) that can be used to record transactions and other interactions.\nThe utilization of blockchain that people are most familiar with are cryptocurrencies – products such as Bitcoin that are meant to serve as digital currencies, but have quickly become extremely speculative investments as they’ve gained thousands of percent in just a few years. But companies are increasingly learning that blockchain can be used for so much more, from tracing medical histories to keeping voting records.\nAs a result, companies from Amazon (AMZN) and International Business Machines (IBM) to Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are becoming increasingly involved in trying to exploit this technology. That has given rise to a few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on this space, including one that’s surprisingly rife with dividend growth names.\nThe Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) is a portfolio of companies expected to benefit from blockchain in some way, with the stocks actually graded by their “potential for increased economic profit, operational efficiencies, and transformational business practices.” In short, it holds “companies working to utilize and incorporate blockchain technologies into their businesses.”\nWhat fascinates me about this fund, however, is the dividend growth potential in some of its component stocks.\nReality Shares’ BLCN is a deviation from its main focus: income. The ETF provider boasts another quartet of funds, all of which hold dividend stocks, and three of which are centered around the company’s proprietary “DIVCON” system.\nThe DIVCON system essentially measures a stock’s dividend health, assigning a score of 1 to 5, “where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut.”\nAnd right now, this system is flashing a ringing endorsement for five blockchain-linked stocks, which are all at “DIVCON 5.” In other words, they’re in the best position for dividend growth going forward:\nVisa (V)\nDividend Yield: 0.6%\nBLCN Weight: 1.39%\nA stock like Visa (V) that yields just 0.6% hardly screams “income opportunity,” but it is. Visa has juiced its payout by 154% in five years. But it’s not just a prolific dividend grower – it’s a perfect example of the share-price growth you should expect when a company puts its shareholders first via increasingly generous cash payments.\nAs Visa’s Dividend Goes, So Does Its Price\nVisa already is elbow-deep in blockchain. The company launched a pilot phase of a blockchain-based B2B payments service called B2B Connect last year in partnership with banks in the U.S., South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines. The service will allow institutions to make payments to one another directly, and the second phase of the project is expected to go live later this year.\nMasterCard (MA)\nDividend Yield: 0.5%\nBLCN Weight: 1.40%\nVisa rival MasterCard (MA) also has its hands in blockchain, making its moves through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In early April, the credit-card processing company filed a patent to help verify and store identity data on a blockchain system. Later in the month, it filed another patent, this time to create “fast track flags” within the blockchain that would allow nodes (any electronic device that performs a task within the blockchain network) to more quickly verify data, making the system work more efficiently.\nMasterCard (MA) Has Some Catching Up to Do – in a Good Way\nMasterCard might be an even more intriguing opportunity. While Visa’s share price and dividend growth have been roughly in line, MA shares – despite more than tripling over the past year – still haven’t caught up with the pace of the dividend, which has quadrupled and then some over the same time frame.\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\nDividend Yield: 2.2%\nBLCN Weight: 2.04%\nTexas Instruments (TXN) isn’t exactly known for being the flashiest of chip stocks. Its analog chips and embedded processors, which make up 80%-plus of revenues, are found in some of the simplest of devices, from calculators to alarm clocks. But they have a wide array of uses, from appliances to displays to motors drives and even avionics.\nThe company is increasingly delving into more cutting-edge technologies, however, such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. And its position as a chipmaker also puts it square in the world of enabling the devices that make the blockchain possible.\nThat said, TXN’s positioning in the less glamorous world of analog chips makes it a cash cow with the few companies that even want to compete with it. And Texas Instruments makes good use of that cash, more than doubling its dividend over the past five years.\nIntuit (INTU)\nDividend Yield: 0.8%\nBLCN Weight: 1.31%\nIf the blockchain acts as a ledger of sorts, what better company to research its applications than Intuit (INTU) – the well-known purveyor of accounting software such as TurboTax and QuickBooks.\nIntuit clearly spells out the blockchain opportunity in a post about the technology’s potential:\n“Some accounting and auditing firms already embrace blockchain technology. Blockchain transactions are simpler, more visible, and more transparent. Improvements in operational efficiency mean that much of the work accountants do, such as collecting and inputting data, sampling, and proving provenance, takes place automatically. This leaves accountants more time to provide valuable services to their clients.”\nAgain, this is another prolific dividend grower that has more than doubled its quarterly dole in five years. And its DIVCON rating of 5 implies that INTU is well-armed enough to continue the upward march.\nIntuit (INTU): Self-Service Taxes, Full-Service Dividends\nNvidia (NVDA)\nDividend Yield: 0.3%\nBLCN Weight: 2.06%\nOne of BLCN’s most exciting holdings is also one of the “healthiest” from a dividend perspective.\nNvidia (NVDA) , maker of high-performance chips, is among the stocks most commonly connected with the booming blockchain technology. That’s because its GPUs are widely used by cryptocurrency “miners,” who need extremely powerful computers to do the processing necessary to generate new digital tokens.\nIn fact, demand is so intense that Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang recently said the company needs to crank out more of the GPUs to catch up, as video gamers (Nvidia’s bread-and-butter market) are finding it difficult to procure the graphics chips their advanced games require.\nThe sky seems the limit, then, for its blockchain potential, and the same goes for NVDA’s income opportunity. Because despite the fact Nvidia has powered up its dividend by 76% since 2014, it currently boasts a mere 11% payout ratio. That’s a large reason why Nvidia boasts DIVCON’s top score of dividend health, and why investors should be licking their chops over this dual-threat stock going forward.\nHow to Earn 12% Annual Returns For Life!\nRobust dividend growth separates the winners from the losers.\nAnd I’m not just talking about the stocks.\nLow dividend growth goes hand-in-hand with slow and no growth – and even eventual decay. Hitch your wagon to the supposedly “safe” blue chips that most financial pundits shill for, and you’ll quickly be looking for part-time work a few years into your retirement.\nIf you want to retire fully funded and worry-free, it’ll take more – a lot more. In fact, it’ll take 12% in safe, annual returns.\nThat sounds impossible, but it’s not. It takes a special kind of portfolio that offers high current yield, and dividend growth, and the potential for double-digit capital gains in some years. But after months of research and weeding out numerous “ticking yield bombs,” I’ve identified a handful of stocks and funds that check all those boxes.\nThese stock picks will each reap at least 12% in annual returns – the magic number you need to meet to ensure the worry-free retirement you’ve labored so hard for decades to reach.\nMy “12% for Life” portfolio ditches pundit favorites such as Exxon Mobil, Coca-Cola or General Mills – yes, the same General Mills that has lost a quarter of its value this year! – and relies on these kind of picks instead:\nOne stock that has juiced its dividend 800%-plus in just four years, and has at least another decade of double-digit growth ahead of it! A high-growth, high-yield “double threat” stock that threw off 252% gains the last time it was this cheap. A 9%-plus payer that hikes its payout multiple times a year, and is on track to double its payout by 2021! Income. Dividend growth. Capital gains. Even nest egg protection. This all-weather portfolio is a diversified powerhouse that provides three times more income than most retirement experts say you need , while being built to be more durable against retirement-shattering downturns like in 2007-09.\nI don’t want you to ever have to worry about how you’ll pay next month’s bills in retirement. With this portfolio, you won’t have to. In fact, you’ll be able to pay all your monthly expenses from dividend income alone, with enough left over for the convertible, the new master bedroom or the island vacation – all those extras you should be enjoying in retirement.\nLet me show you the way to double-digit returns that you can actually depend on.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\nCharlie Munger , Buffett’s longtime business partner and a Berkshire vice chairman, is also no bitcoin fan, describing it as “ worthless artificial gold .” He likened it to Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting, calling it “the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.”\nBuffett, 87, and Munger, 94, spoke two days after they presided at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which was expected to have drawn more than 40,000 people.\nIt was the first meeting since Berkshire elevated longtime executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to vice chairmen, making them top contenders to replace Buffett as chief executive.\nBuffett said their promotions have been “very, very good” for the company. Berkshire has said its board knows who would become chief executive if the need arose.\nOne of its members, Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates, said on CNBC “it’s not a horse race” between Abel and Jain\nBuffett renewed his desire to spend some of Berkshire’s low-yielding cash on a major acquisition. He said he would be happier if Berkshire had $30 billion of cash and equivalents, not the $108.6 billion it reported holding at the end of March.\n“If a $100 billion deal came along that Charlie and I really liked, we’d get it done,” he said.\nBuffett revealed last week Berkshire had bought about 75 million additional Apple Inc shares in the first quarter, adding to the 165.3 million it already owns. It now has a 5 percent stake in the iPhone maker, trailing only Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.\nBuffett said he would be happy to see the Apple share price fall if it would spur repurchases.\nMunger, meanwhile, said Berkshire may have been “a little too restrained” in buying Apple, saying “it’s reasonably priced and strong.” He added: “ I wished we owned more of it.”\nBuffett also said the list of CEO candidates has been “narrowed down” for the healthcare venture between Berkshire, Amazon.com and JPMorgan Chase . He said choosing the CEO will be “by far the most difficult decision we will make.”\n(Reporting By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Hugh Lawson, Nick Zieminski and Susan Thomas) --", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buffett bashes bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan stempel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer ablan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T17:06:24.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7af769c6987ab9abd0a428d25bd97f05cb540a9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.yGwThw8mVRDTZ9j32MYxxu7jNV.Si4TJvhHN6ddmbkHOzq_0D8xSTiz0.h4XpIKS39Myxem7ybrrNaL992QWkniiW282OBGRCd.frdy18KlpNmOdFCLkNJYVTSD_kjEP24cgX5MVrLB2SMraKl4cxM7ea6z.6vyF8hKfn58vGVA--", "site_full": "www.fintech.finance", "site": "fintech.finance", "site_section": "http://www.fintech.finance/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Fintech Finance", "title": "IBM and European Parliament representatives to speak at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague", "title_full": "IBM and European Parliament representatives to speak at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague", "published": "2018-05-11T11:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.fintech.finance/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/800x600_eng.jpg?fit=800%2C600", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7af769c6987ab9abd0a428d25bd97f05cb540a9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.yGwThw8mVRDTZ9j32MYxxu7jNV.Si4TJvhHN6ddmbkHOzq_0D8xSTiz0.h4XpIKS39Myxem7ybrrNaL992QWkniiW282OBGRCd.frdy18KlpNmOdFCLkNJYVTSD_kjEP24cgX5MVrLB2SMraKl4cxM7ea6z.6vyF8hKfn58vGVA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yash Hirani", "published": "2018-05-11T11:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "IBM and European Parliament representatives to speak at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague", "text": "IBM and European Parliament representatives to speak at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague Home » News » IBM and European Parliament representatives to speak at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague\nCryptocurrency regulation, AI tokens and blockchain-based cyber security — it is only part of topics to be discussed at the fourth annual Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Prague scheduled for May 17.

I hate we can be secured knowing that our hard earned money will be in a safe place. You really cannot remove banks from the equation. Because like what you said this is very traditional. As the bitcoin era is rising, more and more banks are actually adapting the use and slowly incorporating some of its technology to their systems. Banks are still important especially those who earn big in cryptocurrency because they will still need a good place to store that money.\nI think bank is still important. Because many people around still trust in bank rather than bitcoin. It is all maybe because bank is already used in a decade and from the start bank is the most safest storage of our savings. It is a traditional saving states. I believe many people around deposit their saving on banks for good.

Some people expect big things, whereas others are convinced BTC will not stick around for that long. Nasdaq chief executive Adena Friedman is extremely bullish when it comes to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In fact, Friedman is confident Bitcoin is the “next step in the space of currency”. \\n Can Bitcoin Appease the Masses? \\n\nIt has become apparent Bitcoin still has a public image problem. Despite a solid price change late last year, the first few months of 2018 have been far less successful. As such, there are a lot of people who claim Bitcoin will not succeed in the long run. Warren Buffett made that rather adamant by claiming how Bitcoin is worse than “rat poison”. A very strong sentiment which doesn’t sit well with the cryptocurrency community. \\n\nBill Gates is seemingly convinced Buffett is right. If he had the chance, Gates would “bet against Bitcoin”. Even though Gates could easily short the BTC price, it seems he wants to do more “permanent damage” in this regard. Such opinions are not unique, as cryptocurrency has suffered from such negative comments for some time now. Nasdaq chief executive Adena Friedman has a completely different outlook on cryptocurrency. \\n\nInstead, Friedman envisions a bright future for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A globalized payment mechanism is needed to deal with the cross-border digital economy. In Friedman’s opinion, cryptocurrencies are perfectly suited for this particular need. All cryptocurrencies operate in a completely borderless and decentralized nature with no intermediaries involved at any time. \\n The Evolution of Cryptocurrency \\n\nTogether with cryptocurrencies, Friedman is also high on blockchain technology. This technology allows for some unique business models and solution for pressing financial problems. With cross-border payments becoming a lot more common, a new approach needs to be taken altogether. Friedman explains how this situation can change as follows: \\n\n\\u201cHow it evolves and which of the cryptocurrencies may or may not be the one that ultimately gets embraced, I think that really the jury is still out on that. But I do think the idea of a more globalized payment mechanism that is more efficient than what we have today allows for money to transfer across countries and certainly supports the Internet economy.\\u201d \\n\nSuch a bullish outlook comes at an interesting time for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. With the markets slowly recovering over the past few weeks, the sentiment toward this form of money has shifted once again. Additionally, major financial firms are preparing to offer Bitcoin trading functionality. Combined with the technical upgrades planned for BTC in the coming months, the future may look very different compared to what most people expect. \\n\n \\n Image from Shutterstock \\n\nThe post Nasdaq Chief Executive Offers a Rare Bullish Outlook on Bitcoin appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adena friedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasdaq", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T03:33:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7db235d9a8c1efd4730db2c6eb7bf55cdbf02601", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC.lrE1sxj9KdXyWLsDz4d6Kn_okK1TizXMvhQwz3wn7ffiPvgJth33X7oD2o5_HL3OrDAFUzfEOyRtV3fxT2fwgDSoJERiEnL6mu7fjMNlxe", "site_full": "www.newsr.in", "site": "newsr.in", "site_section": "https://www.newsr.in/latest/Markets.htm", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Markets: newsR", "title": "Bitcoin Loses $9K Support As Markets React To S.
