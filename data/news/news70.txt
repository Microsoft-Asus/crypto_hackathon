Your bitcoin-core pass-phrase cannot be used to recover your bitcoin.\ni was told the need of a private key\nIf you have the private key, you can recover access to your bitcoin.\nIf you have a recovery phrase and know which bitcoin wallet you used, you can recover the private key and recover access to your bitcoin.\nOtherwise those bitcoin are gone forever .\ni promise a reward to anyone who helps me out?\nExpect to receive lots of email from scammers and very convincing professional conmen.\nDon't give anyone your private-key or your recovery-phrase. The only circumstances you should ever do that is in front of a lawyer paid by you with proof of the helper's identity and a signed contract in her hand. Otherwise you will lose even more money.\nPeople can help you without knowing your private-key or recovery-phrase. If they say they can't help you without those things, they are conmen.\nIf i installed the latest version of Bitcoin core with the same wallet phrase will i see that old address back with the balance.\nNo.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated\nAre all of the words in your passphrase in the BIP39 list? If so it is a recovery-phrase not a pass-phrase. If so it would be associated with a different type of wallet than the \"bitcoin core\" wallet.\nIf so, download a wallet application that uses BIP39 and try using your recovery phrase in it. Be very careful not to download malware. Start with wallets that don't require an online service to work. Bitcoin core \"passphrase\"\nNote that in the \"bitcoin core\" wallet, the Passphrase is used to encrypt your wallet. It is not a recovery phrase. You cannot recover access to your bitcoins using only the pass-phrase of a lost wallet.

Mr. Hanyecz describes his dealings with Satoshi as having been “kind of weird.”\nAlso Read: Moon Missions and Custom Wallets: Bitcoin Community Celebrates Pizza Day Early BTC Developer Discusses Email Exchanges with Satoshi\nMr. Hanyecz, a programmer known in the bitcoin world for paying a man from Bitcointalk.org 10,000 BTC to order him two pizzas from Papa John’s in 2010, discussed his personal interactions with Satoshi Nakamoto in a recent interview .\nAfter mining bitcoins on his laptop for some time, Mr. Hanyecz reached out to Satoshi to express his desire to contribute to the development of bitcoin. “I thought bitcoin was awesome, and I wanted to be involved, but I had a regular developing job,” Hanyecz said. “Nakamoto would send me emails like ‘Hey, can you fix this bug?’ ‘Hey, can you do this?’” Mr. Hanyecz “Didn’t Want the Responsibility”\nDespite his enthusiasm for bitcoin, Mr. Hanyecz saw his contributions to the cryptocurrency as a side project of secondary importance to his career, and felt as though Satoshi had unrealistic expectations of his involvement.\n“He’d say, ‘Hey, the west side’s down,’ or ‘We have these bugs – we need to fix this.’ I’d be like, we? We’re not a team,” Mr. Hanyecz said. “I thought that it was approval from him, that maybe he accepted me as a member. But I didn’t want the responsibility. I didn’t really understand all of the forces that were going on at the time.”\nOn occasion, Mr. Hanyecz would express his dissatisfaction, recounting that he would say “Hey, you’re not my boss.” Despite the irritation, Mr. Hanyecz states that he “didn’t take it too seriously.” Interactions with Satoshi Consistently Gave Mr. Hanyecz “A Weird Feeling”\nMr. Hanyecz describes the majority of his interaction with bitcoin’s creator to be “kind of weird.”\nMr. Hanyecz found Satoshi to paranoid in many of their exchanges, stating “There were a few times when I got messages that seemed off-base. I brushed them off because I was like, who cares if this guy tells me to go pound sand and go away? This wasn’t my job or anything – it was a hobby. I was trying to be friends with him. He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it ‘prerelease,’ and I was helping him get it to release.”\nLooking back, Mr. Hanyecz can empathize with Satoshi’s apparent paranoia, stating that “If anything had happened to the code early on, we wouldn’t be having this conversation today.” Satoshi Weary of Mining Centralization\nAccording to Mr. Hanyecz, Satoshi Nakamoto was aware of the potential for mining to lead to centralization in bitcoin ownership, stating that Satoshi told him “Well, I’d rather not have you do the mining too much.”\nMr. Hanyecz stated that “[Satoshi] was trying to grow the community and get more commerce use cases. He fully recognized that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.”\nMr. Hanyecz also stated that Satoshi was careful to maintain anonymity, stating “He or she or whoever it was never told me anything personal. I asked a few questions, but he always dodged them. Those questions never got answered.”\nWhat’s your interpretation of the person behind the Satoshi Nakamoto enigma?

Learning how to securely archive records that hold private keys like a JSON file or exporting, importing, and sweeping can provide people with the basic steps towards really owning bitcoin. Private Key Ownership Provides Financial Sovereignty Every day someone new is learning about the fantastic benefits of bitcoin and cryptocurrency solutions. Many people will have acquired their first digital asset from an exchange like Coinbase or Circle Invest, but have yet to learn how to secure their private keys so they can really own those precious cryptocurrencies. The first and foremost lesson to digital currency ownership is a statement said over and over again by veteran bitcoiners. If you don’t possess your private key, you don’t own bitcoins. Private Keys and the Different Ways to Obtain Them A private key is the secret alphanumeric code that is mathematically paired with your public key — the alphanumeric address you use to receive payments. Private keys allow you to spend your cryptocurrencies and ensure you maintain ownership over them as long as the 256-bit alphanumeric code is kept a secret. If you happen to own cryptocurrencies because maybe you purchased some on an exchange, or someone loaded up a wallet for you or gave you a paper wallet, you may want to know how to obtain full ownership of your private keys. The thing about private keys is they can be stored in various ways and it’s good to gain knowledge on the differences between each method. Mnemonic Phrase If someone gave you a wallet you may have to find out the mnemonic phrase or mnemonic seed associated with the cryptocurrency. For instance, if someone gave you some bitcoin cash (BCH) using a software client like the Bitcoin.com Wallet you can set up and find your mnemonic recovery phrase easily. An example of a phrase would be twelve random words given to you by the software client in order which you must back up by writing down the phrase in the exact same order. The twelve words (some wallets use 24) can be used to recover your bitcoin cash either using the same Bitcoin.com Wallet or another wallet that supports the mnemonic phrase backup restoration process. These words should be guarded with maximum security and you should never take a screenshot of them or type the words online. If someone else knows the twelve-word mnemonic seed tethered to your coins this means someone can have full access to your cryptocurrency holdings. An example of a private key tied to a twelve-word mnemonic phrase within an Electrum wallet. The QR code to the right is also a private key. A Backup Keyfile or JSON File There are other ways you can be given a private key like, for instance, in a keyfile or JSON file. A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is simply a file with a lightweight data format that allows it to be easily read and written by humans or machines. Sometimes browser wallets will give you a backup JSON file that contains your coins’ private keys. These types of files need to be imported into a supporting wallet to gain access to the funds associated with the keys. These files need to be secured in a safe manner and users can hide them and encrypt them in folders so intruders can’t gain access to the file. Just like the mnemonic seed, someone with access to a keyfile or JSON has full access to the funds associated with those keys. The Fundamental Difference Between Importing and Sweeping Import There are also two different ways people can obtain their keys — importing and sweeping. These two distinct ways of gaining full ownership of keys are separate actions within the cryptocurrency-import process. Importing a private key means you are simply tethering the funds that belong to the private key to an existing set of keys in your software wallet. This means the coins are still tied to the private key that may be tied to a paper wallet for example. Both wallets now have access to the funds tethered to the private key until they are spent. If you are planning to import keys make sure that both areas of ownership remain 100 percent secure from other individuals, otherwise you may want to sweep the keys. Sweep Essentially sweeping private keys is a form of importing them but when you sweep them they are sent to an entirely different address and the older imported key set is no longer valid. So if you take the Bitcoin.com Wallet and sweep the paper wallet someone gave you, the paper wallet will be emptied. Anytime you sweep a source wallet the funds will be moved to an entirely different location with another public and private key pair. Lots of wallets allow users to sweep a QR code that contains a private key in order to gain access to the funds. Note that if you have a QR code tethered to a private key on a paper wallet or stored somewhere and it is exposed it can be easily swept away if it’s not kept hidden. Bitcoin: Be Your Own Bank As we mentioned above, keys can be kept in QR codes, keyfiles, JSON files, and mnemonic phrases and knowing how to access them for full ownership is a must for every cryptocurrency enthusiast. If you hold your money on an exchange you are allowing a third party to have ownership of your coins and if something happened to that exchange like a hack that resulted in a huge loss you may lose your bitcoins.

And that makes IBM a better long-term investment than the digital currency.\nInvestors chasing after Bitcoin as its price gyrates, hoping that they will find other investors to sell to at higher prices, are confusing something: the promise of the technology behind Bitcoin, as opposed to the promise of Bitcoin as an alternative form of money. Without doubt, the technology behind Bitcoin, called blockchain, has the potential to change capitalism, by bringing efficiency, transparency, and accurate recording to everyday transactions.\nBitcoin as an alternative to national currencies has the potential to change capitalism, too, by democratizing transactions, eliminating corruption, and shifting power from central and commercial banks to the people. That’s why I have called it “people’s currency” in a previous piece here.\nThe trouble is that both promises are expected to face stiff opposition from economic elites. Using blockchain technology to fight corruption – which holds most emerging economies back from becoming developed — is expected to face the opposition of the local elites that benefit from corruption.\nAnd the use of Bitcoin as an alternative to national currencies is already facing stiff resistance by central banks and commercial banks. That’s bad news for Bitcoin investors, as banks can find ways to slow down the demand for Bitcoin, taming any further price gains and occasionally crushing it, as the Chinese government did last September.

Here's what you can't miss in cryptocurrency for Friday, June 1.\nApril Showers Bring May ... Losses Bitcoin had a rough go of it in May. Despite a mid-month rally that saw the top cryptocurrency reaching for $10,000, bitcoin closed out May with a tough 19% price decline, according to data from Bitfinex. That monthly loss pushed bitcoin's five-month moving average below its 10-month moving average for the first time since June 2014. As June began, bitcoin was still lower at about $7,400 for most of the day. While that puts bitcoin about 62% lower than its record high set in December 2017, it's worth noting that bitcoin traded for just $2,407 on June 1, 2017. In the last year, prices have climbed more than 200%.\nIMF Official: Central Banks Need to Compete Dong He, the deputy director for the International Monetary Fund's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said in an editorial that central banks need to offer \"better\" fiat currencies in order to compete with cryptocurrencies. He noted that central banks should consider adopting some of the technological innovation in play in the crypto space to \"forestall the competitive pressure crypto assets may exert on fiat currencies.\" The deputy director's thesis was based on the notion that, if cryptocurrencies become the de facto currency of choice over fiat currencies, central banks will lose their ability to influence the economy in times of duress.\nBitcoin Is Worth as Much as This Banknote While many bitcoin evangelists have suggested the cryptocurrency will replace all fiat currencies in coming years, the digital assets have yet to do so. But right now, one single bitcoin has about the same market value as the largest banknote in circulation, Quartz pointed out . Brunei's B$10,000 note is worth about $7,480 - nearly in line with bitcoin's price this week. Most people in Brunei don't use the note, instead hoarding it for an emergency or for use in wartime. It also has, since its introduction in 2006, sometimes served as the go-to currency for illicit transactions. Few countries allow for such large banknotes anymore. The eurozone most recently moved to retire its 500-euro bill, often called the \"bin Laden\" following concerns the high-value banknote was being used to fund terrorism.\nGMO Launches Bitcoin Reward for Gamers GMO Internet Group, a Japanese technology firm, has developed a new app for mobile devices that rewards users with bitcoin earned by playing games.

As the New York Times points out, the decision “is likely to have implications far beyond Mr. Trump’s feed and its 52 million followers.” A blog post on the online version of the monthly magazine Reason provides some tips for politicians with social media accounts who want to stay on the right side of the law.\nSpeaking of President Trump, the former secretary of a federal judge is claiming the President got her fired. Okay, not exactly. The secretary, Olga Zuniga, who worked for a judge on Texas’s highest criminal court, filed a lawsuit alleging that the judge—a member of the GOP—terminated her employment because he found Facebook posts in which Zuniga criticized President Trump’s and other Republican politicians’ immigration policies. A post on Popehat , a fellow ABA Web 100 honoree, explores the strength of Zuniga’s case .\nUnless you’ve been living in a cave, you know that the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect last Friday, May 25 th .

If you want details on what GDPR means for your outsourcing and other vendor agreements, you might want to attend our upcoming webinar .\nThe impact of GDPR is being felt across social media platforms in all sorts of ways. For example, in a move reportedly prompted by GDPR, Twitter has shut down accounts of those users who, at the time that they joined Twitter, were under 13 years of age, based on date-of-birth information voluntarily provided by such users during the registration process .\nFacing an inbox full of companies’ privacy policy updates? You can blame that on the GDPR too. In fact, the onslaught of GDPR-induced privacy-policy updates inspired some pretty creative memes on Twitter .\nWait… the GDPR will also affect tourists taking photos with their phones ?\nInstagram is expanding its anti-bullying initiatives by using a machine-learning algorithm to filter out harassing comments and reviewing the accounts with an especially high number of blocked comments to determine whether the owners of those accounts have violated the platform’s community guidelines.\nThe still-unprofitable Snapchat will begin running six-second advertisements that its users will not be able to skip . These un-skippable commercials will not run during users’ personal stories, only during select Snapchat Shows—highly produced three-to-five minute programs from well-known entertainment companies.\nThe fascinating story of how Wired lost a small fortune in Bitcoin . . . . (Well, the Bitcoins are here , but the key has been destroyed.)\nThe Royal Wedding was a bigger topic on Pinterest than it was on Facebook. FastCompany speculates that it’s because Pinterest’s audience is predominantly women and reveals the subject of most of the Royal Wedding pins .\nThe post Social Links: Laws affecting politicians using Twitter & tourists taking photos; the GDPR takes effect; lost Bitcoins appeared first on Socially Aware Blog .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olga zuniga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zuniga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T01:12:33.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9799e179b7fc570b54fc4e03799197f737e9bd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSOyS6H7arTSTKF8DRdZ_Vs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Isn't crazy how much does bitcoin exchange earn?", "title_full": "Isn't crazy how much does bitcoin exchange earn?", "published": "2018-06-02T00:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f9799e179b7fc570b54fc4e03799197f737e9bd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSOyS6H7arTSTKF8DRdZ_Vs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dudeperfect", "published": "2018-06-02T00:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Isn't crazy how much does bitcoin exchange earn?", "text": "Yes, exchanges are generating a huge revenue but on the other hand, they also have the expenses in that proportion to run their routine operations.

Network support went live on Google Play May 31 in a further milestone for the technology.\nLightning Payments Meet Android The release, called simply Lightning Wallet , incorporates a fully operational Lightning node, providing for both on-chain Bitcoin and off-chain Lightning Network transactions.\nUsers will be able to take advantage of the increasingly well-populated network, benefits including near-instant sending and receiving of Bitcoin via dedicated channels for fees of less than one satoshi ($0.0000755141) – Bitcoin's smallest unit. The app has received six positive 5-star user reviews so far.\n\"It is crucial to understand that Lightning Wallet is a completely standalone app, it is not a thin client to some centralized service,\" the wallet's description to potential users reads.\nThis most importantly means that your money is stored right on your phone and nowhere else which gives you a ultimate censorship resistance: no one can 'freeze your account' or cancel your transactions, but at the same time this makes you the only one responsible for securing your funds.\nMitigating Funds Loss Concerns As Bitcoinist has reported throughout 2018 since Lightning's mainnet release went live, both support and adoption have been brisk, despite the underlying technology remaining in an experimental phase.\nWhile the potential for funds to go missing due to technical inconsistencies remains, Lightning Wallet developers claim they have mitigated such risks using a mnemonic passphrase setup.\n\"This is [the] first Lightning wallet on [the] market which offers off-chain data loss protection: in case of emergencies such as phone loss you will only need a mnemonic phrase to recover both on-chain Bitcoin balance and off-chain Lightning balance,\" its Google Play description confirms.\nIn April, Lightning passed the symbolic adoption mark of 2000 nodes, with over 6000 channels currently open, handling a total network capacity of over $160,000.\nVarious consumer tools have gone live, while payment processor CoinGate recently announced it had also pivoted to add compatibility for merchants.\n\"Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network,\" the company wrote in a statement.\nWhat do you think about Lightning Wallet?

The decision is still depends on you, if you feel like it is not going to dump anymore, then buy bitcoin will all of the money that you have and wait for it to pump again.\nSince it is all about profits, I could say that it is a good opportunity right now to buy bitcoin, it doesn't matter if it gets dump even more, the point here is you bought already during a dump meaning that is a sure profit in the future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T21:58:24.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1f97012c0de0e20d93e2dc61f68f8a5dfa6399e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQHt1kcPv9iNx6eTd91NoDE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Where does bitcoin end up this year", "title_full": "Where does bitcoin end up this year", "published": "2018-06-02T00:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1f97012c0de0e20d93e2dc61f68f8a5dfa6399e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQHt1kcPv9iNx6eTd91NoDE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "KenChanYu", "published": "2018-06-02T00:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Where does bitcoin end up this year", "text": "Quote: from: carlisle1 on June 01, 2018, 03:40:16 PM Quote: from: jakech2211 on April 01, 2018, 04:54:23 PM Bitcoin is starting to climb up again. Where do you think think does it end up by the end of the quarter or eventually by the end of 2018.\nIf i will only know,and if it's positively increases?for sure i will sell my house and lot and business to invest all in crypto specially in bitcoin,but the sad thing is no one really knows.this may result for another speculation because all answer here is indeed speculate.so what you do is be optional,diversification of funds so many option of profiteering\nI do agree! No one can ever exactly conclude if when high or low in price strikes. There could be a comparison from previous years or months, taking a look at the chart, but still I don't think it can be applicable for what may happen in the coming days, because the demand keeps on changing.

(123RF)\nThe going rate of bitcoins continues to rise. As of September 2017, one bitcoin was equal to nearly US$4,000 and $4,900 Canadian, according to the CoinDesk calculator. Considering bitcoin is such a highly valued yet volatile form of currency, many people have questions as to how bitcoins were created and how they are used.\nBitcoin is a relatively new currency that was created in 2009 by an anonymous person (or group) using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoins are produced and traded in the virtual world. In a relatively short period of time, bitcoins went from being worth pennies to thousands of dollars. Unlike other forms of currency, which are controlled by a central authority of a particular country, bitcoins are completely virtual.\nHow to get bitcoins\nBitcoins are not acquired in the same way as other currencies. Bitcoins can be bought and sold in marketplaces called ‘bitcoin exchanges.’ These online trading areas enable people to buy and sell bitcoins using various currencies, says CNN Money. Similarly, people can send bitcoins to one another using mobile apps or a computer, much like one would make digital transfers at a bank.\nBitcoins are not based on gold or another backing currency, but rather on mathematics. Instead of a federal reserve deciding on when to print and distribute money, bitcoins are created as a reward for mining. ‘Mining’ involves a special open source software that is designed to solve math problems. As a reward for solving these problems, people are rewarded with bitcoins. This creates an incentive for people to mine.\nBitcoin mining is designed to require exertion and take time so that the rate resembles the rate at which commodities like gold would be mined from the ground, offers Bitcoinmining.com. According to ABC News, available bitcoins are hidden amid a complex encrypted computer program. Users’ computers work around the clock to solve a complicated mathematical problem in order to release new coins. The system requires more work to get coins as time goes by.\nHow are bitcoins stored\nBitcoins are stored in a digital bitcoin wallet. Only 21 million bitcoins can be found by miners so the value of the system is preserved. To date, not all bitcoins have been mined. Every bitcoin transaction is completely transparent, which means they can be traced back to creation. The ‘block chain’ is a public ledger where every bitcoin transaction that has ever taken place is registered.\nAnonymity\nEven though bitcoin transactions are recorded publicly, the names of buyers and sellers are never revealed. Only a wallet ID is recorded. This enables bitcoin users to buy or sell anything without it being traced back to them. While many legitimate businesses now accept bitcoins, bitcoins also are highly valued for black market ventures like purchasing drugs and illegal weapons.\nBitcoins are changing the way people see money and store their private wealth. The concept decentralizes money and makes the bitcoin exchange a relatively transparent process.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://commontag.org/ns#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/DCMIType/", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T01:12:47.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f657f1e97f964aad7855ce0106f9da4f7901a9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTextAUhAOTcXROVpmZPrHk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marketplace", "title": "Target Market of Bitcoin", "title_full": "Target Market of Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-02T00:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f657f1e97f964aad7855ce0106f9da4f7901a9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTextAUhAOTcXROVpmZPrHk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "C.

The strategy to trade such a large range is to buy near the bottom and sell close to the top. So, we have been waiting to buy on a sharp dip below $7,000, as close to the bottom of the range as possible, so that our risk is less. If the $6,075.04 level breaks, the digital currency can fall to $5,450 levels. The BTC/USD pair is presently facing resistance at the downtrend line. Even if this level is crossed, it will again face resistance close to the 20-day EMA. Once this level is crossed, a move to the 50-day SMA is possible. We retain our preference to buy on a sharp dip but only after the fall is arrested. Therefore, we suggest waiting for a couple of days to get better clarity. ETH/USD Ethereum has been gradually rising, moving towards the 20-day EMA where it will face a stiff resistance. Just above the 20-day EMA is the resistance line of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA, which will also act as a major hurdle. On the downside, the intraday low of May 28 at $492.5 will act as a strong support. If this level holds, we shall consider long positions but if the level breaks, a fall to $464.65 is probable. We don’t find any buy setups at the current levels, hence, we are not proposing any trade on the ETH/USD pair. XRP/USD Ripple formed a doji candlestick pattern on May 30 and followed it up with an insider day candlestick pattern on May 31. Today also, the digital currency is on track to form a doji. This shows uncertainty among the traders. The XRP/USD pair fell below the 20-day EMA on May 08 and has sustained below it ever since. If the next dip holds above $0.54, it will indicate buying at lower levels. We suggest waiting for this retest to hold before buying on a rebound above the 20-day EMA. If the bears break below $0.54, the decline can extend to $0.45. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has not been able to find buyers after rising above the downtrend line. It formed a doji on May 30, followed it up with an inside day on May 31 and is likely to make another doji today. The BCH/USD pair has a tendency to trade in a tight range for a few days before making a decisive move. On the upside, the 20-day EMA will act as a resistance, above which a rally to the 50-day SMA is possible. On the downside, $878 and $750 are the supports to watch out for. We suggest waiting for the price to sustain above the 20-day EMA for initiating any long positions. EOS/USD EOS has a major event coming up on June 02 with its Mainnet launch. It is difficult to predict the price action after such an important event. Due to the uncertainty, we shall not suggest any trade on it. However, we shall mention the important levels to watch out for, both on the upside and the downside. Since May 23, the EOS/USD pair is stuck in a range between $10.3384-$12.9870. A breakout and close above $13 gives it a minimum target objective of $15.6356, which can extend to $18.67 because there is no major resistance once $15.15 is crossed. On a breakdown from the range, the digital currency can slide to $7.6898. LTC/USD Litecoin is struggling to find buyers even at the current levels. It has failed to break out of the downtrend line for the past two days. The LTC/USD pair has strong resistances between the downtrend line and $127. We shall turn positive only if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $127. Above this level, the digital currency should quickly move up to $140 and above it to the downtrend line of the descending triangle at $158 levels. If the digital currency fails to rally above $127, it will remain range bound between $107-$127 for the next few days. We shall wait for a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $127 before recommending a long position. ADA/USD The 20-day EMA and the horizontal line at $0.23 are acting as a strong resistance. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of this level, Cardano should pick up momentum and rally to the 50-day SMA and above it to $0.35. The traders can enter long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.23 and the stops can be kept below the May 28 intraday lows. If the ADA/USD pair returns from the current levels, it will find a strong buying support at $0.17. If the level fails to hold, it can slide to the bottom of the range at $0.13. We suggest buying only 50 percent of the desired allocation above $0.23 because volatility will remain high inside the range. XLM/USD Stellar has sustained above the downtrend line for the past three days, which is a positive indication. It is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA but has not given up much ground, which shows that the bulls are not keen to book profits at this level. On a close above the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair should rally to the 50-day SMA, followed by a move to $0.385. The traders can initiate long positions once the price closes (UTC time frame) above the 20-day EMA. The stop loss can be kept below the recent lows. On the downside, a break below the May 29 intraday low of $0.24288 can sink the digital currency to $0.184. IOTA/USD Contrary to our expectation, IOTA easily broke out of $1.63 and the 20-day EMA on May 31. It is currently at the 50-day SMA but considering the strong momentum, it looks like the rally will extend to $2.2117. We anticipate a strong resistance at $2.2117 levels. Any correction from $2.2117 will have a strong support at $1.63. If the bulls force a break out of $2.2117, likelihood of the start of a new uptrend increase, which has a minimum target objective of $3.5084. There is a minor resistance at $2.6977 but we believe that it will be crossed this time. Therefore, we shall wait for a break out of $2.2117 levels or wait for a dip to $1.63 levels to enter long positions. We don’t find any trade setup at the current levels; hence, we are not suggesting a trade on the IOTA/USD pair.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

You will also hear Electrum wallet from many people as the most convenient wallet to use. It is true as it is compatible with all the devices. Apart from all of these wallets, Mycelium wallet has been my most used wallet as it is convenient and efficient to use. It provides features such as custom fees, reboradcast transaction, cancel transaction etc... which not many of the wallets provide. It's seed can be backed up and used whenever we want.\nWow. This helps me a lot. Is there any other besides hardware that would you recommend? I mean is the hardward really the most secure or is there other else? I would appreciate if you could suggest/answer.

Market pundits are claiming that the cryptocurrency market has reached the bottom and now expect positive movement for the majority of coins.\nIndeed, some technical experts are suggesting investors should reduce short positions. Head of the technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors says, “We think the setup is very attractive here.\nIf you’re short, we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.” Market participants are supporting Fundstrat’s Global Advisors stance; they believe moving averages and other technical factors are forming the bullish pattern.\nThe potential for higher adaptation could also support Bitcoin Cash price movement.

The correlation between bitcoin and the rest of the crypto universe is very high and they mostly seem to move in lockstep.\n(Click to enlarge)\n(Click to enlarge)\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nYou can call it following the leader. Of course, there are exceptions to this trend, such as when bitcoin losses translate to gains for some cryptos. For instance, alternative protocol assets rallied after the SEC rejected a proposed bitcoin ETF in March. But then, some others, such as Tether, just seem to have a mind of their own.\n(Click to enlarge)\n(Click to enlarge)\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nBut, by and large, bitcoin is the leader in the space while everybody else follows. And that doesn’t make a lot of sense when you consider that every crypto is backed by an independent open-source technology, including the hordes of bitcoin clones.\nThe Ripple Effect\nBut Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, reckons that it's about time we begin to see the crypto market behaving rationally with various degrees of decoupling between individual cryptos and the top dog.\nGarlinghouse says the nascent industry is still largely driven by speculation mostly because there are so many cryptocurrencies that people don't understand very well. He claims most cryptos have no real utility, and a massive shakeout will see to it that 99 percent of cryptos won't be here a decade down the line.\nOf course, he capped it all by claiming that Ripple itself has real utility, and will survive the test of time.\nMaybe the CEO felt the need to talk up his brainchild after the pounding it received during the last crypto sell-off, which led to its XRP token cratering 82 percent from its January all-time high.\n(Click to enlarge)\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nBut what does Ripple do (or claim to do)?\nBlockchain technology can be used to lower costs of money transfers by reducing or eliminating the need for banks to manually settle transactions. Ripple is a blockchain-powered interbank money transfer platform, while XRP is its crypto token. You can think of it as the blockchain equivalent of SWIFT, the leading electronic platform when it comes to interbank money transfers.\nBut what purpose does Ripple serve that SWIFT does not?\nAccording to Garlinghouse, the current banking model whereby liquidity needs are managed via nostro and vostro accounts, which hold trillions of dollars, is highly inefficient. Using digital assets to fund liquidity is a better model, and Ripple is better-positioned to capitalize on it than other cryptos. For instance, the XRP token takes just 3.6 seconds to settle a transaction compared to four hours for bitcoin. Related: EV Sales Are Set To Triple In Two Years\nRipple can help banks move money from point A to point B cheaply and in record time. Further, the XRP token can be used as a bridge currency and a lingua franca that helps banks avoid the hassle of tying up money in varying currencies at foreign accounts.\nSounds like a fairly compelling business case on paper, especially when you consider that banking networks around the world move around $76 billion a day. But do banks need it?\nUnfortunately, banks have been giving Ripple and XRP the cold shoulder. Although Ripple has signed up lots of banks on its network, only Stockholm-based Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB has actually used RippleNet in a money transfer, moving just shy of $1 billion in payments. Even Ripple investors Santander and Standard Chartered have only been testing the network and haven’t yet really taken the plunge.\nThat's not very encouraging considering that Ripple has been around for nearly seven years now. It appears that banks are balking at Ripple and XRP mainly due to regulatory hurdles. Further, the main movers of cross-border payments are large corporates, and it's going to be mighty tough to convince them to forego established banking networks in favor of a digital startup.\nIn this David-and-Goliath struggle, Garlinghouse’s confidence that Ripple and XRP won’t eventually join thousands of others in the crypto graveyard may be misplaced.\nBy Alex Kimani for Safehaven.com\nMore Top Reads From Safehaven.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/sec-shoots-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-bid/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex kimani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T06:19:22.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df14759c7b7ed7084dcfb217c23a38a290f595f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYOECrqd8nkhfEyzQXvuCBQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "Big Whales doing day trade with bitcoin?", "title_full": "Big Whales doing day trade with bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-01T23:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df14759c7b7ed7084dcfb217c23a38a290f595f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYOECrqd8nkhfEyzQXvuCBQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jademacoy", "published": "2018-06-01T23:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Big Whales doing day trade with bitcoin?", "text": "At first i was just thinking that it is normal because there are many investors and some of them had sold their bitcoin due to their needs or whatsoever reason they sell their bitcoin though the price for now is not that good for selling.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe market capitalization of the crypto world has increased by about $25 billion since May 29. The Italian political crisis and the probable escalation of a trade war have attracted investors back into cryptocurrencies.\nDan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital Management believes that Bitcoin has made a bottom for the year. He proposes to buy now when the prices are still low, to benefit from the ensuing rally in the next few months. We have been voicing a similar opinion for the past few days but we believe that the purchases should be staggered to take advantage of the volatility.\nBitcoin continues to be the undeniable leader. It sets the direction that is followed by most altcoins. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple believes that once the crypto markets mature, they will start differentiating between the digital currencies and the correlation with Bitcoin will reduce. He, however, warned that 99 percent of the virtual currencies in circulation will vanish in about a decade. Only the ones that solve a real problem will remain.\nThere have been a few complains that we don’t mention the fundamentals in our analysis. In technical analysis, we believe that the charts discount all the fundamental news. Hence, we only read the patterns on the chart and try to forecast the probable direction. In the past few months, these patterns have kept us on the right side of the trade and have helped us avoid large losses. We try to avoid trading during major events, due to the uncertainty.\nLet’s see, what direction are the charts pointing to today.\nBTC/USD We believe that Bitcoin is trading in a large range of $6,075.04 to $12,172.43. The strategy to trade such a large range is to buy near the bottom and sell close to the top. So, we have been waiting to buy on a sharp dip below $7,000, as close to the bottom of the range as possible, so that our risk is less. If the $6,075.04 level breaks, the digital currency can fall to $5,450 levels.\nThe BTC/USD pair is presently facing resistance at the downtrend line. Even if this level is crossed, it will again face resistance close to the 20-day EMA. Once this level is crossed, a move to the 50-day SMA is possible.\nWe retain our preference to buy on a sharp dip but only after the fall is arrested. Therefore, we suggest waiting for a couple of days to get better clarity.\nETH/USD Ethereum has been gradually rising, moving towards the 20-day EMA where it will face a stiff resistance. Just above the 20-day EMA is the resistance line of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA, which will also act as a major hurdle.\nOn the downside, the intraday low of May 28 at $492.5 will act as a strong support. If this level holds, we shall consider long positions but if the level breaks, a fall to $464.65 is probable.\nWe don’t find any buy setups at the current levels, hence, we are not proposing any trade on the ETH/USD pair.\nXRP/USD Ripple formed a doji candlestick pattern on May 30 and followed it up with an insider day candlestick pattern on May 31. Today also, the digital currency is on track to form a doji. This shows uncertainty among the traders.\nThe XRP/USD pair fell below the 20-day EMA on May 08 and has sustained below it ever since. If the next dip holds above $0.54, it will indicate buying at lower levels. We suggest waiting for this retest to hold before buying on a rebound above the 20-day EMA.\nIf the bears break below $0.54, the decline can extend to $0.45.\nBCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has not been able to find buyers after rising above the downtrend line. It formed a doji on May 30, followed it up with an inside day on May 31 and is likely to make another doji today.\nThe BCH/USD pair has a tendency to trade in a tight range for a few days before making a decisive move.\nOn the upside, the 20-day EMA will act as a resistance, above which a rally to the 50-day SMA is possible.\nOn the downside, $878 and $750 are the supports to watch out for. We suggest waiting for the price to sustain above the 20-day EMA for initiating any long positions.\nEOS/USD EOS has a major event coming up on June 02 with its Mainnet launch. It is difficult to predict the price action after such an important event. Due to the uncertainty, we shall not suggest any trade on it. However, we shall mention the important levels to watch out for, both on the upside and the downside.\nSince May 23, the EOS/USD pair is stuck in a range between $10.3384-$12.9870. A breakout and close above $13 gives it a minimum target objective of $15.6356, which can extend to $18.67 because there is no major resistance once $15.15 is crossed.\nOn a breakdown from the range, the digital currency can slide to $7.6898.\nLTC/USD Litecoin is struggling to find buyers even at the current levels. It has failed to break out of the downtrend line for the past two days.\nThe LTC/USD pair has strong resistances between the downtrend line and $127. We shall turn positive only if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $127. Above this level, the digital currency should quickly move up to $140 and above it to the downtrend line of the descending triangle at $158 levels.\nIf the digital currency fails to rally above $127, it will remain range bound between $107-$127 for the next few days.\nWe shall wait for a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $127 before recommending a long position.\nADA/USD The 20-day EMA and the horizontal line at $0.23 are acting as a strong resistance. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of this level, Cardano should pick up momentum and rally to the 50-day SMA and above it to $0.35. The traders can enter long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.23 and the stops can be kept below the May 28 intraday lows.\nIf the ADA/USD pair returns from the current levels, it will find a strong buying support at $0.17. If the level fails to hold, it can slide to the bottom of the range at $0.13.\nWe suggest buying only 50 percent of the desired allocation above $0.23 because volatility will remain high inside the range.\nXLM/USD Stellar has sustained above the downtrend line for the past three days, which is a positive indication. It is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA but has not given up much ground, which shows that the bulls are not keen to book profits at this level.\nOn a close above the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair should rally to the 50-day SMA, followed by a move to $0.385. The traders can initiate long positions once the price closes (UTC time frame) above the 20-day EMA. The stop loss can be kept below the recent lows.\nOn the downside, a break below the May 29 intraday low of $0.24288 can sink the digital currency to $0.184.\nIOTA/USD Contrary to our expectation , IOTA easily broke out of $1.63 and the 20-day EMA on May 31. It is currently at the 50-day SMA but considering the strong momentum, it looks like the rally will extend to $2.2117. We anticipate a strong resistance at $2.2117 levels. Any correction from $2.2117 will have a strong support at $1.63.\nIf the bulls force a break out of $2.2117, likelihood of the start of a new uptrend increase, which has a minimum target objective of $3.5084. There is a minor resistance at $2.6977 but we believe that it will be crossed this time.\nTherefore, we shall wait for a break out of $2.2117 levels or wait for a dip to $1.63 levels to enter long positions. We don’t find any trade setup at the current levels; hence, we are not suggesting a trade on the IOTA/USD pair.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

A prescient $1,000 investment in March 2010, assuming you could find someone willing to part with that many bitcoin (333,333 tokens), would have been worth billions of dollars as of this past December.\nCryptocurrency optimists view bitcoin and blockchain technology as a game-changers for monetary theory and how currency is transferred from one party to another, which is a big reason bitcoin has been so successful thus far.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nBitcoin’s underlying blockchain is its digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that works around traditional banking networks to record and process transactions. Most notably, blockchain offers the ability to transfer funds from one party to another considerably quicker than with current banking networks, especially in cross-border transactions. Sending funds overseas may take moments to validate and settle with blockchain, whereas traditional banking networks may take up to five business days to settle cross-border remittances.\nStop comparing bitcoin to gold! They’re nothing alike\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has also drawn regular comparisons to gold, which is viewed as the go-to investment anytime fear, volatility, and/or inflation rear their heads. This comparison takes shape given the relative scarcity of each asset. In other words, there’s a 21-million-coin limit on the number of bitcoin that can be mined, just as there’s a limit on the amount of gold that can be mined from our planet. Therefore, the assumption has been made that bitcoin can act as a store of value much in the same way gold has for investors.\nHowever, I’m here to tell you, again, and for the last time, that you shouldn’t believe everything you hear about bitcoin. It isn’t, and will never be, the “new gold.” How do I know this? The answer lies in a number of comparative tests that bitcoin simply fails when put side by side with gold.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThere’s absolutely no application comparison\nTo begin with, there’s the application of gold versus bitcoin. Bitcoin exists in the digital realm as code. It’s not tangible. You can’t put it in your hand or do anything with it, aside from using it as a medium of exchange, or hoping that someone else comes along at a later date and pays more for it, per token, than you did.\nOn the other hand, gold is a physical asset that can be held in the palm of one’s hand. It also has practical uses, such as being a conductor in electronic equipment, as the primary metal in fine jewelry, and as crowns in the cosmetic dental industry, to name a few uses. One asset is tangible and has practical use, the other exists entirely within the digital realm. Not comparable.\nA false sense of scarcity\nAnother comparison that fails to hold muster is scarcity. When it comes to gold, all we’re ever going to have is what’s on this planet. Putting aside science fiction hype of mining asteroids, what we have in the ground and have already mined is all the gold we’re ever going to get. That provides a true physical cap on gold, allowing investors to make a genuine case for scarcity.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin does have a 21-million-coin cap, but this is only limited by protocols. Admittedly, getting consensus on bitcoin’s network to increase the coin limit would be very difficult — but the point is that it’s not impossible. We can’t wave a wand and make more gold appear out of thin air, but computer coders with the backing of the bitcoin community could do just that and create more bitcoin.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nTo add to this point, even without increasing the coin limit above 21 million, bitcoin’s numerous hard forks essentially violate the idea of a token limit and scarcity. Bitcoin has had three instances since August where a disagreement between developers on the future path of bitcoin and its blockchain resulted in the creation of a new currency. These spinoffs of sorts — Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Private — topple the idea of true scarcity, as new coins have been, or could continue to be, created from bitcoin.\nGold has history on its side\nIn terms of which asset has history on its side, that, too, goes to gold. Gold has been used as a currency for more than 2,700 years and is today a highly liquid asset, at least in terms of futures contract trading. It’s also an asset held by central banks all over the globe. While you’re not likely to pay for your morning cup of coffee with a gold ingot, gold has been viewed as an accepted form of currency for a long time.\nHowever, bitcoin doesn’t have that tenured history. There are no fundamental tethers that allow investors to make a reasonable determination about bitcoin’s value, and liquidity on bitcoin futures contracts has been spotty at times. Additionally, there are no governments holding bitcoin in their vaults, as they do with gold.\nThe bottom line is that gold and bitcoin are nothing alike — and to think that bitcoin will behave similarly to gold could prove to be a big mistake. by admin .

The hacker who called himself IsHakdz vandalized the site by replacing the website’s content with an image of Guy Fawkes from the film V for Vendetta along with the phrase “Your security down I’m not sorry.” The page also contained links to files allegedly containing customer information, prompting Eventbrite to temporarily shut down Ticketfly until the security situation could be assessed and resolved.\n“Following recent site issues, we determined that Ticketfly has been the target ofa cyber incident,” the company said in a statement. “To protect our clients and fans, and to secure the website and related data, we have temporarily taken all Ticketfly systems offline.”\nIn addition to breaching Ticketfly while keeping the site’s HTTPS certificate intact, the hack also affected Brooklyn Bowl, Pear Street Warehouse, and Lafayette Theater, according to The Verge . And because Ticketfly was unable to comment on what information may have been compromised during this attack, if you’ve recently made any transactions through Tickefly or any of the affected sites, you may want to keep an eye on your credit card statements and credit report. Motherboard was able to confirm that home addresses, emails, and telephone numbers of customers were part of the files leaked by the IsHakdz. Additionally, the hacker said that he may release more stolen information on his website, PCMag reported.\nThe hacker claimed to have initially warned Ticketfly about the site’s vulnerability that would allow him to take control of the site and all its database, but he demanded a payment of one Bitcoin to reveal the details. Ticketfly didn’t reply, and it appears that the hacker went ahead and put his knowledge to use in hacking Ticketfly’s site, Motherboard reported.\nIf you had purchased a ticket for an upcoming event from Ticketfly, a support page notes that these tickets may be available at the door. You’ll need three forms of ID, Ticketfly advised, which includes an original photo ID and a copy of the printed digital ticket.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices.

Blockchain can be used to create other cryptocurrencies that compete against Bitcoin, and already has done so. Like Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple, to mention but a few.\nThat’s bad news for Bitcoin investors, too. A larger supply of cryptocurrencies could eventually crush Bitcoin prices for good, the way a larger supply of different varieties of tulips crushed tulip prices back in the 17th century.\nSimply put, the technology that created Bitcoin will eventually undermine it.\nCompany/Coin 3-month Performance 2-year Performance IBM -6.85% -6.05% Bitcoin -37.65 1,168.11 Source: Finance.yahoo.com 5/28/18\n[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin.]\nThat isn’t the case for companies that are leaders in blockchain technology. IBM is one of them.\n“Yes, IBM can beat Bitcoin in Fortune 100 clients that utilize centralized solutions because many solutions are more efficient, centralized vs. decentralized,” says David Drake, Founder and Chairman at LDJ Capital. “Furthermore, most initial coin offerings are centralized businesses using a decentralized solution. Ether and Bitcoin are decentralized solutions without companies running them. But all others are mainly decentralized solutions in centralized businesses. So IBM falls in the same category and certainly has a real business operations that is far more efficient than 90% of the current cryptocurrencies that don't have an operational revenue history like IBM.”\nJust a few weeks ago, IBM announced a $5.5 million investment to build the first blockchain solutions center in Sao Paolo, Brazil (adding to IBM blockchain centers located in England, the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Germany).\nThat’s a market IDC says will grow more than 125% over the next three years.\nIn addition, IBM is working on over 400 blockchain projects worldwide.\nAnd there’s IBM lead in universal quantum computing. Last year, IBM began to work with its first clients, such as JPMorgan Chase, Daimler AG and Samsung, to deploy its IBM Q, early-access commercial quantum computing systems, to explore practical applications for business and science.\nMeanwhile, IBM is the leader in a number of other promising technologies like Cloud, Artificial Intelligence, and Internet Security.\nAnd that makes IBM a better long-term investment bet than Bitcoin.\nGallery The Cities Winning The Battle For Information Jobs, 2018 Launch Gallery 16 images", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604148/the-technology-behind-bitcoin-is-shaking-up-much-more-than-money/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T18:47:46.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "946c35ab8548a2e4e59120fea74cda3dd29a56d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA_IlKTssuQs81EsNO55PsUNkuay5UArZzieKZHwEnUbOIXxbH3LNlMlRLdhPsFf2W1m_yWh5b1H8TY4fdUzyWdo9dbNdvn4122ETGYFCeZ2IaMIjkyEEJZd6x5iWUaoPRvoRSvjSmQp2SflATRRerHyBd_yBAigCq", "site_full": "www.forbes.com", "site": "forbes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "IBM Will Beat Bitcoin", "title_full": "IBM Will Beat Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-01T23:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.988, "main_image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F963468336%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "946c35ab8548a2e4e59120fea74cda3dd29a56d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA_IlKTssuQs81EsNO55PsUNkuay5UArZzieKZHwEnUbOIXxbH3LNlMlRLdhPsFf2W1m_yWh5b1H8TY4fdUzyWdo9dbNdvn4122ETGYFCeZ2IaMIjkyEEJZd6x5iWUaoPRvoRSvjSmQp2SflATRRerHyBd_yBAigCq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Panos Mourdoukoutas", "published": "2018-06-01T23:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "IBM Will Beat Bitcoin", "text": "IBM is a better bet than Bitcoin on Blockchain, and holds stronger promise to change the world.

The hacker who called himself IsHakdz vandalized the site by replacing the website’s content with an image of Guy Fawkes from the film V for Vendetta along with the phrase “Your security down I’m not sorry.” The page also contained links to files allegedly containing customer information, prompting Eventbrite to temporarily shut down Ticketfly until the security situation could be assessed and resolved.\n“Following recent site issues, we determined that Ticketfly has been the target of a cyber incident,” the company said in a statement. “To protect our clients and fans, and to secure the website and related data, we have temporarily taken all Ticketfly systems offline.”\nIn addition to breaching Ticketfly while keeping the site’s HTTPS certificate intact, the hack also affected Brooklyn Bowl, Pear Street Warehouse, and Lafayette Theater, according to The Verge . And because Ticketfly was unable to comment on what information may have been compromised during this attack, if you’ve recently made any transactions through Tickefly or any of the affected sites, you may want to keep an eye on your credit card statements and credit report. Motherboard was able to confirm that home addresses, emails, and telephone numbers of customers were part of the files leaked by the IsHakdz. Additionally, the hacker said that he may release more stolen information on his website, PCMag reported.\nThe hacker claimed to have initially warned Ticketfly about the site’s vulnerability that would allow him to take control of the site and all its database, but he demanded a payment of one Bitcoin to reveal the details. Ticketfly didn’t reply, and it appears that the hacker went ahead and put his knowledge to use in hacking Ticketfly’s site, Motherboard reported.\nIf you had purchased a ticket for an upcoming event from Ticketfly, a support page notes that these tickets may be available at the door. You’ll need three forms of ID, Ticketfly advised, which includes an original photo ID and a copy of the printed digital ticket. If you’re not the original purchaser, you’ll also need a note from the buyer authorizing you to pick up the tickets.

My company Bitspark – a cash-in, cash-out blockchain remittance platform – announced its surprising switch to next-generation blockchain Bitshares late last year after experiencing high fees and transaction congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain. The switch came after Bitcoin no longer gave the company its competitive edge as a cheaper and faster way to send money internationally. Bitspark looked to Bitshares as a replacement for several reasons – including access to decentralized smart asset creation, giving the company the ability to create 180+ fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies, as well as faster transactions at the fraction of the cost of Bitcoin transactions. Why Bitcoin Is Being Rejected The focus on Bitcoin’s price, which hit an all-time high last year, shadowed its original intention as a financial equalizer that promised quick and cheap peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers, and perhaps for good reason. Questions about Bitcoin’s scalability soon cropped up as an uptick of Bitcoin transactions from recent market adoption formed a bottleneck, and transaction execution began to slow down or be rejected completely due to the size limit of the blocks – the component that cryptographically conceals transactions in ‘blocks’ every 10 minutes forming the Bitcoin blockchain. The effects of transaction congestion inevitably were higher fees as transactors had to bid for their place in line, raising the network fee to unprecedented heights. While the intention of the 1Mb block size limit was to prevent system attacks, the system’s reaction highlighted Bitcoin’s weaknesses as an alternative payment system for large volume use – especially when considering it for a US$600 billion remittance market as Bitspark did. The Bitshare Alternative So what’s the alternative to Bitcoin for businesses? Well, the answer lies in the reason a business needs a blockchain. Since Bitcoin’s inception, it has paved the way for a new industry of blockchains with 1,000+ cryptocurrencies built on top of them all with unique use cases ranging from privacy, governance, finance and data transaction. With this, startups and organizations began researching, developing and implementing its use case (some in practice and others in testing) with particular focus on cryptocurrencies as a means to transfer transactions internationally for a fraction of existing prices. Put simply, as cryptocurrencies possess the qualities of money with better specifications such as fungibility (interchangeable units), divisibility and transactability on a quick and secure data infrastructure as the blockchain, it changes how value is transacted between parties. If a blockchain is built to support heavy transaction load for low cost, opportunities open wide for the future of payment technology and better services. Many Advantages Bitshares is superior to Bitcoin for payments due to what is needed in cracking the remittance industry with blockchain. Besides having an expansive cash-in, cash-out network, predictability of fees, fast transfer speeds and access to liquid exotic currencies outside of major FX pairs is not something that Bitcoin can provide. The landscape for exotic currency remittances are expensive and the reason is due to the architecture needed past the main 30 currency pairs. First, difficulty resides in the need for bank accounts to be opened in each country – however, the connectivity between them is incompatible and unreliable. Additionally for exotic currencies, buy demand is often imbalanced – making liquidity hard to generate for less-popular currencies, all in all making cashing out cheaply near impossible. The common solution for this is remittance companies to connect to gateways that hold monopoly over regions, however as usual with monopolies, high costs apply. Lowering Remittance Costs Take for instance remittances from Australia (AUD) to Papua New Guinea (PGK), one of the most expensive remittance corridors in the world where according to the World Bank the cost of sending A$200 is A$40, a large sum for migrants seeking to send money home. This is because remittance companies either have several layers of banking to transfer the funds, or have opted to connect to a gateway. Both are cumbersome solutions that contribute to the high costs of remittance today. This also proves true for inter-continent transfers. In Africa, which holds the record for the highest remittance fees in the world, sending $200 worth of CFA from Tanzania to Kenya the costs are in the $48-$50 range. There are similarities with traditional remittances and Bitcoin, especially when speaking of accessing currencies outside of the top 30 and the expenses incurred. There is just not enough Bitcoin liquidity in exotic currencies that can support the remittance industry. Besides Bitcoin’s scalability issues from block size limits and high network fees, Bitcoin remittance providers need to either settle in another currency or go through traditional channels – taking remittances to back to square one. With Bitshares, a remittance company isn’t limited to major FX pairs such as the USD, EUR or top 30, but can create one-to-one pegged fiat currencies such as BitPGK or BitCFA. This means the ability to provide 180+ fiat pegged cryptocurrencies to customers with those currency transfer requirements. Other Benefits Bitshares removes remittance providers’ reliance on banks or expensive liquidity providers such as OTC, brokers or exchanges for access to currencies with its smart asset creation functionality. Furthermore, with its built-in decentralized exchange, direct currency trading of exotic currencies is made possible without hedging USD making trades for exotic currencies cheaper with direct native currency trading. Smart asset creation is not the only benefit. It’s the speed and cost of the Bitshares blockchain, too. Bitcoin is 9,090 times slower than Bitshares, which can process 100,000 transactions per second (tx/ps) making it capable of supporting large remittance volumes. Even Visa, which can process around 200 tx/ps, is no match for Bitshares. The network fee is negligible, making it one of the cheapest blockchains out there with transactions costing under a cent. Imagine, sending A$200 to PGK for under a cent instead of $40. This is why Bitshares will be the killer blockchain for remittances.
