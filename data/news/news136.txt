Until then, bulls may find bid opportunities at prices as low as $5,500.\"\nCrypto traders were expecting the 'Blockchain Week' in New York to trigger a new bullish momentum, but instead the market lost over $50 billion after a disappointing event. Bitcoin wasn't able to break the $10,000 resistance in early May and has since been steadily returning to the 2018 lows. Willy Woo, a BTC technical analyst with 62,800 followers on Twitter, is not optimistic about where the market is going next.\nWoo expects the market to dive towards $5500-$5700. I think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can't see $7000 holding. Most likely we'll balance a bit, then we'll slide through. Long timeframes here, looking into June for rough timing of this to play out at a best guess. /1 pic.twitter.com/pCN0N97vp6 — Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 26, 2018\n“When I run the above scenarios against detoxing at a $6800-$7000 floor, it seems a very unlikely path we’ll play out at the $7000 level. This is given the time we need for NVT and volatility to baseline. (…) I don’t necessarily think we’ll fall through the 5000s… sure it’s a possibility but it doesn’t have to. It’s not a repeat, it’s not Mt Gox and Willybot pushing up price with faked orders, we aren’t detoxing from a scam bubble. Technically $5000s is a very strong support band.”, Woo said.\nHe further expects Bitcoin to steadily drop to $6,800 before plunging to $5700. According to Woo, the next bullish momentum should come in Q3/Q4 2018.

This marks a $100 spike from yesterday’s price, though that, in turn, marked a $100 fall from 48 hours ago, when bitcoin had previously been trading for $7,500. Thus, while bitcoin’s new position is a move in the right direction, it’s hardly something to get super excited about.\nPreviously, the currency had broken key support levels in the $7,000 range, but while the bears still have primary control, sentiment does suggest that this is only temporary, and that one uptrend is all that’s really needed for the bulls to step in and take the reins.

Bitcoins and Basset Hounds Last weekend, Patricia Howell lost her basset hound, Happy. She quickly took to local online forums and in-town pet communities, posting pictures of the dog and her telephone number while asking people to call her right away if they had seen him.Within a few days, she received a text message from a burner phone demanding $600 in Bitcoin or else Happy would be sold off or even killed. The scammer claimed to be using a burner phone, supposedly so that the call couldn’t be traced, and advised Howell not to go to the police.The only issue was Howell had been reunited with Happy earlier that day thanks to the help of someone who had seen the online post. Apparently, the scammer had found her personal phone number from the lost dog advertisements.Howell immediately recognized it as a scam as she could literally see her dog. She reported the call to the police, who said that they had heard of similar cases from around the country. Fake Threats Becoming Common Another North Carolina resident and his duo of dogs also fell victim to the same scam. After posting his information on websites that look to help people find lost dogs, he received an all-too-similar text message from a burner phone, demanding approximately $2,000 in Bitcoin or his dogs would be killed in less than ten days. Like the case with Howell, the dogs were already back with the owner before the text message was sent out.It seems scammers are hoping that the attachment that owners have for their pets will convince them to pay up. Not to mention the ease of Bitcoin transactions along with the lack of actually having to physically receive any ransom demand. In the end, Howell says it best when she states: They need to find a better way to make money. They need to leave people alone and realize that what they’re doing is hurtful and so cruel.

This isn’t just true for people with absolutely no technical background but also for many investors who may be well-versed in tech but still struggle to understand many projects’ white papers.\nEnter TruStory, a platform for users to research and validate claims that people make online, whether in a blog post, white paper, website, or social media post. The young company’s aim is to “bring authenticity back into the digital and decentralized world.”\nIt’s a huge and growing opportunity. Though regulators around the world are cracking down on cryptocurrency fraud, the number of of ICOs has skyrocketed and the funds raised through the mechanism are increasing. According to data collected last month by CoinDesk, ICOs raised $6.3 billion in the first three months of 2018; that’s 118 percent more than projects managed to raise by way of ICOs in all of 2017.\nIt’s not just blockchain-startups that are carrying out ICOs, either. Many other types of companies are trying to use them — and many of them are frauds. Just last week, the Wall Street Journal published analysis of 1,450 cryptocurrency offerings, in which the outlet found “271 with red flags that include plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns and missing or fake executive teams.”\nSeparating the wheat from the chaff is a tall order, but investors are willing to bet that TruStory can do the sorting. The outfit just raised $3 million in seed funding led by True Ventures with participation from Pantera Capital, Kindred Ventures, Homebrew, Coinbase Ventures, Wonder Ventures, Abstract Ventures, and former TechCrunch co-editor Alexia Tsotsis through her new fund Dream Machine.\nThe round also attracted checks from numerous notable individual investors, including Coinbase cofounder Fred Ehrsam, entrepreneur and investor Scott Belsky, and former Twitter M&A executive Jessica Verrilli, who recently joined GV as a general partner.\nAll are betting on TruStory’s founder, Preethi Kasireddy, and it’s easy to imagine why, given her trajectory so far. A USC grad who’d studied industrial and systems engineering, Kasireddy took a job as a banking analyst with Goldman Sachs after graduating, learning how tech company financials work. After less than a year, Kasireddy was searching out a new role as an engineer but that a cold call from Andreessen Horowitz led instead to a role on its deals group, where she learned from the firm’s general partners, as well as developed a fascination with everything blockchain related.\nIn fact, several years after Andreessen Horowitz wrote an early check to Coinbase, Kasireddy left the firm to work for the digital currency exchange as a self-taught software engineer. There, she says, she architected and implemented the front-end interfaces and APIs required for the integration of Ethereum onto the Coinbase brokerage platform among other things.\nThen she left, again. “I just started to teach myself how to write code that runs on Ethereum. I was contributing to different blockchain projects and just listening, and learning, and observing.” She was also taking noting of the growing number of false claims that people were making while raising millions of dollars in the process.\nHow TruStory will more effectively verify the veracity of these claims isn’t something that Kasireddy is interested in discussing publicly in great detail. (“The space is rampant with people copying other people’s ideas.”)\nWhat she can say is that it will use the wisdom of crowds — including scientists and researchers who she is currently lining up — to evaluate whether a project or person is legitimate. They won’t be doing this out of their own beneficence. When someone successfully validates a claim or else identifies aspects of an offering that doesn’t make sense, she or he will “earn tokens and reputation and influence” for their efforts, Kasireddy explains.\nIf they’re dishonest, they’ll lose on all three fronts. (The tokens are generated using the protocol itself, she says.)\nEventually, says Kasireddy, the platform will be used to validate far more than white papers. “We’re starting with crypto market and claims being made in white papers and websites and building a network to help investors and researchers who need this information make the right decisions.” But there are “other ways to use the same incentive design to validate other claims,” she says.\nThere will also be opportunities for people to buy tokens to have projects vetted, she adds, saying to “think about Facebook or Twitter” where there are plenty of claims of dubious origin that stakeholders might want to see either validated or debunked.\nAsked when TruStory will actively start reviewing what’s out there already, Kasireddy suggests the outfit isn’t ready for prime time quite yet. TruStory is currently run solely by Kasireddy, who is in the process of bringing aboard a couple of operations people and a few key engineers. But she says she’s that unlike many other founders in today’s market — including those who’ve raised venture capital — she’s not interested in orchestrating an ICO to fast fuel her company or her hiring plans.\n“We’ll fund ourselves through the development of our tokens, and we expect the tokens eventually to fund the business.\n“It’s about getting those token economics to work,” she says. “And then the engine starts up.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "icos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T13:51:03.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "293432d08a318f96021db3af5d445fd4aea18da2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4b9fHXfdSoaAy26bNfMkdMqTxJXdAFQDfwlcC8KUybALDdwWwQkQ7g_Zm2Sq5VQ4wO1c40ah4k1l9jOCXmUrTHeS6FU4BGnFMcdB7m_82zNxMTtB8ekeJrlNngx2MniQ-", "site_full": "xmr.press", "site": "xmr.press", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "title_full": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://xmr.press/upload/news/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "293432d08a318f96021db3af5d445fd4aea18da2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4b9fHXfdSoaAy26bNfMkdMqTxJXdAFQDfwlcC8KUybALDdwWwQkQ7g_Zm2Sq5VQ4wO1c40ah4k1l9jOCXmUrTHeS6FU4BGnFMcdB7m_82zNxMTtB8ekeJrlNngx2MniQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Analyst Says Bitcoin May Drop to $5,500 Before New Upside In Q3/Q4 2018", "text": "0\nThe price of Bitcoin has faced unexpected downward pressure in May as Consensus 2018 did not produce enough enthusiasm for a bullish move. Analyst Willy Woo said the virtual currency may only find its upside in Q3/Q4 2018. Until then, bulls may find bid opportunities at prices as low as $5,500. Bitcoin to Complete Downside At $5,500-$5,700, Analyst Says\nThe cryptocurrency market has been under pressure in 2018 following an extensive race to the top, with Bitcoin breaching the $20,000 level. Traders were expecting the Blockchain Week in New York to trigger a new bullish momentum, but the market lost $52 billion after a disappointing event .\nBitcoin stalled below the $10,000 area in early May and has been steadily returning to the 2018 lows. Willy Woo, a BTC technical analyst with 62,500 followers on Twitter, is not very optimistic about where the market is moving next. Woo expects the market to give in to bears for a downswing towards $5500-$5700. I think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can't see $7000 holding. Most likely we'll balance a bit, then we'll slide through. Long timeframes here, looking into June for rough timing of this to play out at a best guess. /1 pic.twitter.com/pCN0N97vp6\n— Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 26, 2018\n“NVT Signal is still too high. We need more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price, or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. To drive up transactional activity in a bear slide is very unlikely IMO”, Woo said, also referring to the extreme market moves. “Volatility is still too high. I’m looking for a sustained low band of volatility which tends to be a signal for the end of the detox and the next accumulation phase. It’s still got some time to ride down.”\nThe BTC analyst argues that his $5500-$5700 prediction is further supported by a high Standard NVT and a Volume Profile cliff below $6800.\n“When I run the above scenarios against detoxing at a $6800-$7000 floor, it seems a very unlikely path we’ll play out at the $7000 level. This is given the time we need for NVT and volatility to baseline. (…) I don’t necessarily think we’ll fall through the 5000s… sure it’s a possibility but it doesn’t have to. It’s not a repeat, it’s not Mt Gox and Willybot pushing up price with faked orders, we aren’t detoxing from a scam bubble. Technically $5000s is a very strong support band.”\nThe cryptocurrency market in 2018 is more mature compared to 2014 as there no longer “a few whales randomly pushing things around anymore”, which provides a more reliable understanding of price based on fundamentals. Woo says that BTC is not a market on long time frames. Instead, it is an adoption curve (climb, consolidation, climb, consolidation).\nThe analyst expects Bitcoin to steadily drop to $6,800 before plunging to $5700, which should be followed by a leveling out of the drop and a flat zone. The next bullish momentum should come in Q3/Q4 2018 , according to Woo.

One of the bigger upcoming developments is the Lightning Network. Over the past few months, thousands of new payment channels have been established, signalling a major step in the right direction toward mass adoption of this new technology. The Lightning Network Payment Channels\nScaling Bitcoin to offer instant and cheap transactions requires major developments. This code upgrade is known as the Lightning Network . It allows users to open direct payment channels between one another on a global scale. Doing so requires the necessary network participation. Without sufficient support, the Lightning Network will not make any meaningful impact.\nEarlier this year, things did not look all that promising. Just 89 channels existed on January 19th. To some people, it showed how this scaling solution is unfeasible. Others considered it to be a lack of adoption because the technology is still not finished. Instead, it is being tested under open beta rules and caution remains advised at all times.\nFast forward to a few days ago, and the number of channels has grown significantly. As of May 24th, over 6,600 direct connections exist. It is still a drop in the proverbial bucket when looking at the financial sector. However, it also confirms there is genuine interest in this technology. Scaling Bitcoin will remain an ongoing process for some time to come. These numbers may look very different a year from today. Looking Ahead\nEven though this growth is impressive, not everyone is convinced. Until the Lightning Network technology is fully developed, adoption will remain relatively low. Various important aspects still need to be implemented. There is no double-sided funding, no watching for offline transfers, and so forth.\nAll of these issues will – hopefully – be addressed by the developers in the future. Most small and traditional purchases do not necessarily require all of those advanced features. However, the current implementation of the Lightning Network will not necessarily suit everyone. Giving users a lot of different options will remain one of the top priorities.\nAfter nearly nine years of development, it seems things are finally looking up for Bitcoin. Scalability has always been the Achilles heel of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. The Lightning Network may not solve all of the problems in one go.

Slowly but surely it’s becoming easier to spend BTC, BCH, and a range of other cryptos throughout the continent, with payment services like Wirex and Paytomat leading the charge. It’s now possible to spend bitcoin in hundreds of restaurants and stores throughout Eastern Europe, as well as anywhere that accepts Visa in the whole of mainland Europe and the UK. Click Image Below And Get Our App For Free Wirex Rolls Out Its New Crypto Debit Cards\nWhen crypto debit cards were cancelled in Europe last year, with a Visa subsidiary to blame, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency holders were left clutching worthless pieces of plastic. But as crypto companies have forged new alliances with payment processors, crypto debit cards have started to return, and hopefully this time they’re here to stay. In the past two weeks, Wirex has begun dispatching physical cards to UK and mainland European customers who were on its waiting list. News.Bitcoin.com had a chance to put one of the cards to the test, topping it up with BTC and then spending it in-store and online, and was impressed with the results. Processing a cryptocurrency payment with Paytomat\nA full review of the Wirex crypto debit card follows below, after a quick look at what Paytomat have been up to. The cryptocurrency payment system supports 11 cryptos including bitcoin cash and zencash, and has support from over 330 restaurants and stores at present, mostly in Eastern Europe. It’s since expanded into Western Europe, however, with a launch that took place in an Amsterdam soup kitchen earlier this month.\nPaytomat CEO Yurii Olentir said: “Amsterdam is one of the most crypto-friendly places, so we chose it for our kick-off in Western Europe. With millions of tourists visiting every month, cryptocurrencies can be a very convenient payment method. For example, a transaction in Bitcoin Cash takes just a couple of seconds and the fee is miniscule.”\nIn total, Paytomat supports BCH, ZEN, XEM, DASH, WAVES, LTC, ETH, NANO, DCR, XZC and BTC, and as a video demonstration shows, paying for a meal with bitcoin cash is quick and easy: A Quick Look at the Wirex Crypto Card in Action\nI applied for a Wirex card weeks ago, and succeeded after several failed attempts at address verification. At one point I feared I was never going to convince their KYC I lived where I claimed to live, but a stamped bank confirmation letter finally did the trick. The team’s customer support was helpful throughout, to their credit. Last week, Wirex announced that its cards were finally ready to ship. Mine arrived in a beautifully packaged sleeve that folds out to reveal the slogan “The most versatile payments card in the world” accompanied by a heart emoji face.\nIf I thought the presentation was good, the activation turned out to be even slicker. With the Wirex app already installed on my phone, all I had to do was hold the card in proximity to the device and the NFC chip automatically extracted the last four digits of the card and the CVV number. I clicked the verification email link and that was it: my card was good to go. Wirex accepts BTC and LTC, but no BCH or ETH unfortunately. Hopefully they’ll add more cryptocurrency support in due course. For now, I fired over some BTC, and not long afterward a notification informed me that my coins had arrived. Click Image Below And Get Our App For Free A Few Hiccups, But Otherwise Impressive\nFor users who don’t already have cryptocurrency to hand, Wirex enables you to top up your card using your existing bank account; transfers reportedly clear within a few hours. With my BTC loaded, I tried to transfer the balance to GBP so I could spend it, but accidentally swapped into LTC instead; the process is a little confusing. At the second time of asking, I worked out how to complete the swap, and within seconds my litecoin had been exchanged for British pounds. My daughter had been pestering me to buy more reading credits for her iOS app, and so my first £10 of crypto went on purchasing virtual gems.\nI planned to test the card at a restaurant next, but when it came to pay the bill realized that I didn’t know the PIN for the Wirex card, and was forced to use an alternate method to settle up. Back home, I searched through every submenu of the Wirex mobile app and desktop platform to find where the PIN number was located. I got there, eventually, though it wasn’t intuitive at all. This minor grumble aside, the card works perfectly, and there’s even 0.5% in cashback to be earned on all purchases – paid in BTC. Every time you use your Wirex card, you’re credited cashback in satoshis\nNaturally, Wirex make their cut in terms of the exchange rate you’re offered every time you switch from fiat to crypto and vice-versa. This is still preferable to having to cash out crypto through Localbitcoins.com or similar every time you need to spend money in the “real world.” On first impressions, the Wirex card looks very good. My only concern is that now my kids and girlfriend have a direct line to my bitcoin, I fear for my crypto.\nDo you use a crypto debit card and if so what’s your experience of it?

Forensic Analysis of the BTG hack\nOn May 18, Edward Iskra, the BTG communications director alerted the crypto community to the attack via a blog post on the Bitcoin Gold forum. According to Iskra:\nAn unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use ‘51% attacks’ to perform ‘double-spend’ attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.\nA 51 percent attack is no mean feat, even on a small blockchain as a significant amount of computing power is required to pull it off successfully. However, if an attacker were able to hijack a blockchain, combining it with a double-spend would monetize the effort, and this is precisely what the suspected BTG hacker did.\nThe image above is the Bitcoin Gold address of the suspected hacker. The attacker sends a particular number of BTG tokens to an exchange, trades them for another coin and makes a withdrawal. The hacker then returns those same coins in his/her wallet, hence the double-spending problem. Thus, the attacker can spend and hold the same coins at the same time. Looking at the image above, if all 76 transactions were indeed part of the hack, then the hacker has stolen about $18 million based on the current BTG price. 51 Percent Attacks are All the Rage Now\nThere have been no transactions since May 19. However, the hacker could theoretically continue the attack, especially if they still control 51 percent of the blockchain. According to Iskra, the onus is on exchange platforms to be vigilant against such attacks. He also urged them to increase the number of confirmations for large deposits. The BTG communications director also added:\nThere is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets.\nBitcoin Gold joins Verge and Monacoin as blockchains hacked within one crazy week for cryptocurrency networks. The Verge attacker gained control of two of the five mining algorithms, successfully mining 35 million XVG tokens valued at $1.75 million in only a few hours.\nCan BTG overcome its present predicament?

Using virtual reality, students will be able to review the blockchain from a new angle. This was announced by Director General of IOHK Charles Hoskinson (Charles Hoskinson).\nModel virtual reality will have the same interface that is used in another development of the company — Symphony of the Blockchain, but will be extended with a set of tools that allow you to look more closely at the blockchain of Bitcoin. Charles Hoskinson said:\n«IOHK has obligations in the sphere of education and design, and this fascinating and complex data visualization — the perfect combination. She’s as beautiful as it is functional, and we hope that it will help to make the blockchain accessible to new audiences.»\nDevelopment IOHK Symphony of the Blockchain called the community interest – it was called «captivating work of art» and «exciting tool». Mark Lundin (Lundin Mark), a partner in Kuva, commented on the release of a new tool as follows:\n«The best part is that we will continue to work with IOHK on creating other visualizations of the blockchain, which are able to demonstrate the unique essence of this challenging technology.»\nSymphony of the Blockchain\nOn the website Symphony of the Blockchain says that this tool gives users the ability to interact with the 3D model of the blockchain. This three-dimensional representation of the blockchain where each block is located at a different distance from the viewer. This means that the oldest unit is on the farthest level, and most recently mined blocks closer to the user.\nEducational tool uses high quality graphics and sounds to make learning more interesting, and the viewer can select any date using the calendar button. After the user has selected a block in the left part of the screen displays data such as the total Commission values input and output. Below is other information such as block number, block hash, and the number of transactions in the block.\nIOHK describes his tool as «an interactive, visual, and auditory study of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology».\nBlockchain Cardano was programmed using Haskell, a purely functional programming language. Blockchain company teaches to program in Haskell students of the National technical University in Athens. Cardano believes that dissemination of knowledge about the technology of the blockchain in developing countries needs to be spread flexible languages like Haskell.

Reports about these promising developments in the labor market and the public sector come from Australia. Also, the Slovak tax authority intends to use blockchain technology for more efficient tax collection.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash Crypto-Based Hiring Platform Supports Instant Pay Option\nA new employment service offers to cut out banks and pay workers in real-time using cryptocurrency. Another feature will rate employees using a blockchain-based reputation and review process, designed to ensure that higher quality work gets paid better. The “Pay As You Go” system has been launched recently in Australia.\nSergei Sergienko, the entrepreneur behind the project, claims that instant salary payments are possible with cryptos, tokens, and thanks to the underlying technology – blockchain. His “global job platform” Laborx is developed to do exactly that – pay employees while they are working, so that everyone can start spending on the way home.\n“The way for people to be remunerated is based on pre-Industrial Revolution kind of wages – you spend the time in the factory, and you get paid,” he said, quoted by Business Insider Australia . “If you look around, everything else has changed. And it’s really, really weird that the way people get paid for their services, for their time, for their work, has not gone through any revolution of sorts,” Sergienko noted.\nThe businessman, who owns a successful labor hire, staffing and training company called the Edway Group, believes that the revolution comes in the form of the “Labour-Hour Tokens” (LHT) and the hiring ecosystem of Laborx, which is now live in beta version. Using it, companies can hire anyone – from top experts from around the world, to local fruit pickers – and pay them instantly with cryptocurrency. “A fair hour’s pay for a fair hour’s work” has been promised.\nLaborx also features a tokenized reputation system. Its developers say that it combines dozens of candidate data points and stores the information on a blockchain. The platform is said to ensure job seekers get their best market rate, while also eliminating payment delays and disputes. “If your reviews are consistently good, you can charge more per hour for your services. And the person who hires you knows you’re worth it,” Sergei Sergienko explains. Other cryptocurrency projects to be trialing this model include time-based “knowledge transfer” service Whenhub , founded by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. Distributed Ledger to Be Used For Welfare Delivery\nWhile the private sector has been developing a crypto-hiring platform, Australian authorities have been planning to employ blockchain technology to improve the welfare payments delivery in the country. The intentions were made public recently by the Digital Transformation Agency, a government body tasked with the digitization of public services and government institutions. The project to put social security payments on blockchain will pilot the wider implementation of the technology.\n“Our plan is to look for use cases across the Commonwealth with an initial focus on the welfare payment delivery system. Then, working with our digital service standard, we’ll conduct user research with a view to having a prototype by the end of next financial year,” said DTA’s acting CEO Randall Brugeaud during the Cebit Australia conference in Sidney last week.\nRecently, The DTA received AU$700,000 from the 2018-19 budget to probe the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the public sector. Brugeaud commented that the funds will give his agency an opportunity to explore innovative ways to securely and efficiently deliver government services using blockchain. Slovak Tax Authority Eyes Blockchain for Efficient Collection\nThe Financial Administration of Slovakia aims to become a pioneer in blockchain technology implementation. The tax authority in Bratislava intends to use it to streamline its processes and procedures. The main objective is to make tax collection more efficient, the president of Finančná Správa , František Imrecze told Hospodárske Noviny .\nThe technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, will be implemented in Slovakia’s taxation system to initially process about 2 percent of all tax payments, the publication details. The use of blockchain technologies is expected to increase the trust of taxpayers and protect their personal data. Authorities also hope to increase the transparency of tax collection, reduce red tape and minimize costs, Imrecze explained.\nMembers of the local crypto community and the non-government sector are not sure about the prospects of the project. According to Martin Lindák, analyst with the liberal think-tank F. A. Hayek Foundation, the transparency and security of blockchain applications are there only when they are decentralized. A blockchain lacking this key feature would be just an overpriced database for the public administration, Lindák warned in conversation with the newspaper.\nDo you think crypto and blockchain technologies can be successfully implemented in public services and labor relations?

Albeit it is evident there is still some room for improvements, most of the declines have been stemmed, for the time being. By the look of things, the Bitcoin price may be on its way to reaching $7,500 once again. Reaching that value may prove extremely difficult, though, as the bears remain in control of the market, for the time being. What Comes Next for the Bitcoin Price?\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, things hardly ever go as people expect them to. Despite the lack of news warranting a massive drop in value, the Bitcoin price has seen its fair share of setbacks through most of 2018. It is evident this situation may not necessarily improve in the near future, although things are never set in stone in this industry.\nWith another 1.38% Bitcoin price decline over the past 24 hours, it is rather evident things are not looking overly impressive by any means. While that doesn’t necessarily mean this negative trend will continue for much longer, it seems there will be little improvement throughout the weekend. After all, Saturdays and Sundays are notorious for very unusual trading behavior, which usually results in pretty negative market pressure.\nWhether or not the Bitcoin price can reach $7,50 again this weekend, remains one of the bigger questions waiting to be answered. Even so, reaching that value is only part of solving the problem. After all, there is still the question as to whether or not this value can be maintained for more than a few hours, as the bears will undoubtedly try to push the Bitcoin price well below this threshold sooner rather than later.\nThanks to $4.56bn in 24-hour trading volume , things are not looking all that bad for the Bitcoin price. Although one would assume this is decent volume, it has become apparent the overall interest in trading cryptocurrencies is on the decline. With less than $45bn in volume over the past 24 hours, things are simply not adding up to warrant any major increases in the next day or two.\nAs of right now, OKEx is the leading exchange when it comes to Bitcoin trading volume. That in itself is interesting, as it generates more volume than Binance and Bitfinex. Huobi and OKEx’s TRUE pair are also in the top five right now, but only one of these five trading platforms has a fiat currency pair. That means very little fresh capital is entering the Bitcoin market, and by extension, the rest of the cryptocurrency industry.\nFor the time being, it remains unclear what the future will bring for all cryptocurrencies. Unless the Bitcoin price recovers in a meaningful manner, none of the altcoins will see any real improvements either. This uneasy status quo should not be underestimated, as it may very well remain in place for quite some time to come. Eventually, things will pick up for all cryptocurrencies but now does not appear to be that time whatsoever.

Traditional Databases\nTraditional databases use client-server network architecture. Here, a user (known as a client) can modify data, which is stored on a centralized server. Control of the database remains with a designated authority, which authenticates a client’s credentials before providing access to the database. Since this authority is responsible for administration of the database, if the security of the authority is compromised, the data can be altered, or even deleted. 1_xq5685u-TfB_sBzfRaI0pQ.jpg 1162x856 111 KB Blockchain Databases\nBlockchain databases consist of several decentralized nodes. Each node participates in administration: all nodes verify new additions to the blockchain, and are capable of entering new data into the database. For an addition to be made to the blockchain, the majority of nodes must reach consensus. This consensus mechanism guarantees the security of the network, making it difficult to tamper with.\nIn Bitcoin, consensus is reached by mining (solving complex hashing puzzles), while Ethereum seeks to use proof of stake as its consensus mechanism. To learn more about the difference between these two consensus mechanisms, read my earlier post. Integrity and Transparency\nA key property of blockchain technology, which distinguishes it from traditional database technology, is public verifiability, which is enabled by integrity and transparency. Integrity: every user can be sure that the data they are retrieving is uncorrupted and unaltered since the moment it was recorded Transparency: every user can verify how the blockchain has been appended over time 1_pOkQ-nhgNg6yyZXlMsAFQQ.jpg 1600x637 152 KB CRUD vs Read & Write Operations\nIn a traditional database, a client can perform four functions on data: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (collectively known as the CRUD commands).\nThe blockchain is designed to be an append only structure. A user can only add more data, in the form of additional blocks. All previous data is permanently stored and cannot be altered. Therefore, the only operations associated with blockchains are: Read Operations: these query and retrieve data from the blockchain Write Operations: these add more data onto the blockchain Validating and Writing\nThe blockchain allows for two functions: validation of a transaction, and writing of a new transaction. A transaction is an operation that changes the state of data that lives on the blockchain. While past entries on the blockchain must always remain the same, a new entry can change the state of the data in the past entries. For example, if the blockchain has recorded that my Bitcoin wallet has 1 million BTC, that figure is permanently stored in the blockchain. When I spend 200,000 BTC, that transaction is recorded onto the blockchain, bringing my balance to 800,000 BTC. However, since the blockchain can only be appended, my pre-transaction balance of 1 million BTC also remains on the blockchain permanently, for those who care to look. This is why the blockchain is often referred to as an immutable and distributed ledger. 1_qH_LCkiBBz_IATYGzFaPKA.jpg 896x364 56.6 KB In short, the difference is Decentralized Control\nDecentralized control eliminates the risks of centralized control. Anybody with sufficient access to a centralized database can destroy or corrupt the data within it. Users are therefore reliant on the security infrastructure of the database administrator.\nBlockchain technology uses decentralized data storage to sidestep this issue, thereby building security into its very structure.\nThough blockchain technology is well-suited to record certain kinds of information, traditional databases are better suited for other kinds of information. It is crucial for every organization to understand what it wants from a database, and gauge this against the strengths and vulnerabilities of each kind of database, before selecting one.

This marks a $100 spike from yesterday’s price, though that, in turn, marked a $100 fall from 48 hours ago, when bitcoin had previously been trading for $7,500. Thus, while bitcoin’s new position is a move in the right direction, it’s hardly something to get super excited about.\nPreviously, the currency had broken key support levels in the $7,000 range, but while the bears still have primary control, sentiment does suggest that this is only temporary, and that one uptrend is all that’s really needed for the bulls to step in and take the reins.\nOne of the reasons behind bitcoin’s latest price drop may stem from India . The country isn’t exactly known for being entirely friendly towards crypto (the RBI has already banned banks from working with companies that deal in bitcoin and digital assets), but now, the government is considering an 18 percent goods and services tax (GST) on cryptocurrency trading.\nA new report is being considered by India’s Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. A hearing is set to take place on July 20; until then, all courts in India are barred from hosting any case related to the matter.\nIndia seems to have a solid grip on cryptocurrencies. Back when the RBI first announced its ban on bitcoin business-bank relationships, the asset took the first of several nasty falls that would ultimately bring it down to the $6,000 range, where it hovered for quite some time. Now that recovery has begun, it appears India is once again stepping into the mix and enforcing its power. Bitcoin just can’t seem to catch a break…\nHowever, one source suggests that the long-winded price bends of the last few weeks (or months, considering bitcoin’s high of $19,000 in December) may finally be coming to an end . A new theory suggests that many institutional investors bought stakes in bitcoin just before the launch of bitcoin futures. Futures trading – which many now believe may have been the cause for bitcoin’s subsequent price drops – allowed these holders to short their coins with ease. From there, fake-out dumps, failed rallies and major price dumps could occur accordingly.\nThe theory was suggested in a series of tweets by a cryptocurrency community known as the Crypto Fam. Analysts in the group suggest that the bears’ hold on bitcoin may be coming to an end relatively soon, as institutional bitcoin holders’ stashes are starting to run short.\n“The bear market is running out of gas,” the researchers said. “This is a very simplified explanation of how markets work. A great deal of the total BTC supply is not traded. Some is lost forever in idle or forgotten wallets, while other bitcoins are hodled by strong hands who never sell. This gives [market markers] greater power with their share of BTC.”\nThe researchers further claim that despite falling to $6,000 in March, bitcoin has ultimately failed to test new lows, and suggest that rallies to $10,000 and $12,000 could occur sooner than investors anticipate.

Users send and receive bitcoins, the units of currency, by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the network using bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet software. Transactions are recorded into a distributed, replicated public database known as the blockchain, with consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system called mining.

Based on these stakeholders, “unhealthy actors” have to be eradicated from the business. By so doing, they imagine that cryptocurrencies will turn into legitimized, thus attracting vital curiosity from institutional buyers. Rules Will Sanitize the Market\nRan Neu-Ner, the CEO of OnChain Capital, believes clearly outlined crypto legal guidelines will sanitize the market. Based on him, such a transfer opens up the business to an inflow of latest cash from mainstream buyers like hedge funds and household workplaces. Talking to CBNC , Neu-Ner said that there couldn’t be strong laws with out significant crackdowns on shady enterprise practices out there.\nCommenting on the matter, the OnChain CEO said :\nI hope that they will catch the folks [responsible for the spoofing and wash trading] as a result of we now have to weed out the unhealthy actors. If we now have unhealthy actors, it’s going to create a scarcity of belief on this asset class. If we wish to make this an actual asset class, with actual folks, then let’s weed out the unhealthy actors. However step one is, let’s legislate first; let’s regulate first, so we all know what the taking part in area seems to be like. DOJ Probe Good for the Business\nOn Could 24th, reports emerged of a Division of Justice (DOJ) probe into suspected worth manipulation within the cryptocurrency market. Inside sources throughout the division revealed that the DOJ would collaborate with the Commodity Futures Buying and selling Fee (CFTC) to research crypto buying and selling malpractices.\nBrian Kelly, the CEO of crypto funding agency BKCM, believes the DOJ probe is a constructive growth for the business. Based on him, an inquiry of that magnitude might help get rid of incidents of manipulation in cryptocurrency change platforms.\nThese merchants are of the opinion that lack of oversight available on the market facilitates nefarious crypto offers. Below the watchful gaze of economic regulators, it will likely be a lot tougher to control the market.\nSome crypto screens allege that merchants with vested pursuits manipulate digital forex costs to maneuver in sure instructions. The 2017 article by a blogger with the moniker Bitfinex’ed described how a shadowy buying and selling clique referred to as “ Spoofy ” was accountable for manipulating Bitcoin costs by inserting purchase/promote orders value hundreds of thousands of {dollars} on the Bitfinex change platform.\nDo you agree that elevated regulatory oversight will create the framework for a extra legitimized cryptocurrency market? Tell us your ideas within the remark part under.\nPhotographs courtesy of Wikipedia/@RJ Thomas , CNBC, and Shutterstock.

Both of those conditions also have signaled bearish conditions if price action is near a swing high. The divergence with these lunar cycles lies not only with the divergence in price action but along with the planetary aspect of Mars-Square-Jupiter.Historically, this planetary aspect has been shown to be a signal for bullish trends and conditions – regardless of the current trend. You only get to confirming analysis when you use more than one approach (fundamental, technical, financial astrology). To me, if there is a confluence of financial astrological factors but price action isn’t in a condition to support the highest probable response from that fin-astro factors, those factors still remain as strong triggers for change.The current value area that Bitcoin is trading in is a very, very strong support zone (it actually extends all the way down to 6800). So when I see price finding some initial stopping pressure at the current value area, as well as approaching 21-days (Gann day counts, 7×3=21) in this down trend and the extended bullish divergence – I see a bounce.

One issue that seems to be a sticking point when compiling these frameworks is determining the definition of cryptocurrencies. According to BusinessTech, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) is one such authority.It seems as if most of these authorities are reading the same book as Groepe’s reasoning is eerily familiar to that of other some governments, SARB is also establishing a task team with the specific aim of determining where the bank stands on the crypto issue as well as developing a guideline and regulations with regard to virtual currencies. Regardless of the definition, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) has confirmed that cryptocurrencies will be will adhere to regular SARS rules. The country’s law enforcement authorities are also familiarizing themselves with cryptocurrency, albeit through unfortunate circumstances.In March, some South African crypto enthusiasts were victims of a multi-million dollar crypto ponzi scam run by Steven Twain of BTC Global. Even with the uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies in the country, enthusiasts in South Africa are still interested in investing in digital currencies or according to SARB, cyber-tokens. What do you feel about SARB’s definition of cryptocurrencies? Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service. All copyrights belong to their respective owners.

The cryptocurrency community believes in a monetary system free from centralized oversight, with decisions driven by the masses rather than regulators.\nSame difference, right?\nLibertarians and crypto enthusiasts have some serious overlap, as first brought to my attention by Kate O’Neill, a human-centric tech strategist.\nBoth are overrepresented by white dudes partial to ostentatious displays of wealth, among other things. It’s no wonder, then, that the libertarian “hippies of the right” and some corners of the crypto community have become chummy. They make great bedfellows.\nOnce firmly on the fringe, both libertarians and cypherpunks are having a moment. According to a recent study, more than 44% of bitcoin holders call themselves libertarian. Meanwhile, around 10% of Americans now identify as libertarian, and the 2016 US presidential election had the largest Libertarian Party turnout in history, with 3.3% of the vote. Core tenets\nFrom its inception, bitcoin has had libertarian connotations. “It’s very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly,” wrote Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s anonymous creator, in 2008. Likewise, blockchain, the decentralized system on which cryptocurrencies are built, is in its nature a libertarian construct: It does away with the need for an intermediary in transactions, allowing people to have complete control of their assets.\nIn other words, individual liberty is a core tenet of both groups.\nThere’s even talk of starting a country they could tie it all together, as part of a plan dubbed Free Society. This proposed utopia announced by Olivier Janssens and Roger Ver in 2017 would “establish a rule of law based on libertarian principles and free markets.” The seed funding for the purchase of land is coming mostly from the crypto classes, with $100 million reportedly already in the bank. The two founders reportedly hold some 200,000 bitcoins between them, which would equate to roughly $1.5 billion at today’s rates. “Dying with a pile of money isn’t any fun, so let’s make the world a better place,” Ver told Bitcoin magazine.\nWhat would a crypto-libertarian world be like? Both communities feature their fair share of paradoxes. For example, libertarians’ desire for radical freedom from government intervention make them generally pro-choice on abortion and also in favor of few restrictions on gun ownership. Likewise, cryptocurrency’s privacy-minded nature gives users the ability to conduct trade anonymously, which has helped black markets flourish for a range of illicit activities. Cast of characters\nCrypto-holding libertarians can count some illustrious names in their mix. Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, which accepts bitcoin donations, says his group has made a 50,000% return on its crypto holdings. Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, started buying bitcoin in 2014. Julian Assange (tweets by #FreeJulian campaign)⌛ (JulianAssange) My deepest thanks to the US government, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman for pushing Visa, MasterCard, Payal, AmEx, Mooneybookers, et al, into erecting an illegal banking blockade against @WikiLeaks starting in 2010.

Thus, customers will be able to buy the two added cryptos from the Revolut mobile app. This move signals the company’s desire to establish itself in the emerging cryptocurrency fintech market. Bitcoin Cash Added to the Mix\nRevolut was founded in London in 2015 as a fintech firm with a core focus on providing alternative digital banking solutions. The company dabbled in cryptocurrency in 2017, offering exchange services for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Revolut has a partnership with Luxembourg-based Bitstamp to facilitate its cryptocurrency transactions. Bitstamp is reportedly the oldest surviving cryptocurrency exchange platform in the world. The addition of Bitcoin Cash and Ripple brings the London-based firm’s crypto catalog to five supported cryptocurrencies.\nThe firm charges 1.5 percent on every cryptocurrency transaction, and it reportedly facilitates 100,000 such deals per day. Not bad for a company whose primary focus isn’t digital currency trading. Revolut supports about 120 different fiat currencies, allowing people from different parts of the world to make use of its services. The firm differs from most traditional crypto exchange platforms in a few ways. Account holders cannot use the Revolut app to transfer or receive cryptocurrency tokens. The platform only enables the buying/selling and holding of cryptocurrency tokens. Revolut also has a vault service that allows users to save small amounts of cryptocurrencies. Recent Revolut Developments\nRevolut currently has a user base of 1.95 million customers with more than 20 percent of that figure engaged in the company’s cryptocurrency exchange service. The company wants to increase its user base to 100 million in the next five years. As part of these expansion efforts, Nikolay Storonsky, the CEO of Revolut announced recently that the firm plans to issue a new debit card. He went on to say :\nIn the next three months, we’re going to launch Platinum cards; it’s a metallic card that allows you to get 1% cash back in cryptocurrencies and also provides you a concierge service.\nDespite being only three years old, Revolut is already a fintech unicorn valued at more than $1.7 billion. The company recently completed a $250 million fundraising round targeted at expanding its operations. The London-based fintech firm also plans to apply for a European banking license.

His kidnappers had demanded a Bitcoin ransom of roughly $120,000.\nThere is likely no greater fear for a parent than to have their child abducted and held for ransom. Far too often, such crimes end in tragedy. Fortunately for a young man in South Africa, his kidnapping has a happy ending. Grabbed While Playing\nKatlego Marite, a 13-year-old boy, was playing with two friends at a playground in the South African province of Mpumalanga last Sunday. Suddenly, three men in a car pulled up and grabbed him. His parents later received a Bitcoin ransom demand of roughly $120,000 (15 bitcoins).\nThe demand was for a payment of 1 Bitcoin by May 21st, with the remaining 14 coins to be paid by May 27th. A wallet address was included. If the parents did not pay, the kidnappers threatened to kill Katlego.\nWhat makes the case unusual is that Katlego’s parents are not wealthy, and they had no idea what cryptocurrency is. Three Taken into Custody\nAn apparent break in the case occurred when a family friend showed up shortly after the kidnapping. After seeing CCTV footage of the crime, he drove around to various bars, looking for the car, a Toyota Corolla. The friend eventually found the car in question and alerted authorities, who then took three men into custody.\nThe police have not stated if the three men are involved in the kidnapping, and it is unclear if they are still in police custody. However, the car is still being held by law enforcement. Safe and Sound\nFortunately, the parents’ ordeal is now over. On Thursday, police announced that they have found Katlego Marite and that he is alive and well.\nPolice spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi commented:\nThe combined efforts by the police and the community paid off when Marite was found safe and sound. The circumstances under which he was found are a subject of investigation.\nPolice have not said if the Bitcoin ransom was paid. Nor have they released any further details of the crime and subsequent finding of the victim. Of course, the most important thing is that Katlego Marite is safe and back with his family.\nNeedless to say, this isn’t the first time a Bitcoin ransom was demanded by kidnappers. A cryptocurrency exchange managing director, Pavel Lerner, was abducted last December in Kiev and was only released after he paid a $1 million ransom in bitcoins.\nDo you think the media will play up the cryptocurrency angle for this kidnapping story?

In addition to making crowdfunding in crypto available, the company will also accept digital currencies as a form of payment for their services. Pavel Janeček, chairman of the board at Pražská plynárenská, said the company’s initiative is a means to attract a younger generation of customers, saying: “We are trying to go to the young customers across the street, we do not want to be perceived as old dysfunctional moths.” According to Janeček, the company will have an operational payment gateway as soon as June. Digital currencies which are used for payment will be automatically converted into fiat currency. Janeček said, “…we will not speculate on the development of crypto. But if someone wants to pay [with] an alternative, we want to make it possible.”\nWith over 42,000 consumers, Pražská plynárenská is reportedly the only Czech company in the industry to accept cryptocurrency for the services it provides.\nThe announcement comes shortly after the company reported record profits. Helped in part by the hard winter, net profit rose by 30 mln koruna to 1.19 bln koruna ($53.9 mln), while sales totalled nearly 12 bln koruna ($544 mln). The company forecasts higher turnovers and more customers this year, but expects overall profitability to be lower.\nIn August last year, the Czech National Bank claimed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do not pose a threat to the conventional banking system. A statement posted by the bank entitled “Don’t be afraid of Bitcoin,” argues that fiat currencies are still more suitable for commerce.\nFuente: https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-energy-company-to-crowdfund-projects-sell-gas-with-crypto ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "janeček", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakamoto jr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pavel janeček", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hospodářské", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech energy company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pražská", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "crowdfund projects", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T10:35:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f2351f86ea508e1b681c7a4b3b70f3d14b35388", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLskzjTLOqpnK36_3P_I.F3jSkYrKXq2kJPdfqk9pAtvaggUvPPQwH5t1ZLezSDVmqbJf4ASpvZlWLPuSzeNjfEudeFB2QZs8L4-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python?page=9&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'python' Questions - Page 9 - Stack Overflow", "title": "bitcoin - Can't open electrum wallet files form a script", "title_full": "bitcoin - Can't open electrum wallet files form a python script - Stack Overflow", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f2351f86ea508e1b681c7a4b3b70f3d14b35388", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLskzjTLOqpnK36_3P_I.F3jSkYrKXq2kJPdfqk9pAtvaggUvPPQwH5t1ZLezSDVmqbJf4ASpvZlWLPuSzeNjfEudeFB2QZs8L4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xicur", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin - Can't open electrum wallet files form a script", "text": "I'm trying to make a script that recovers bitcoin wallets but the following code\nimport os files = os.listdir('/home/user/.electrum/wallets') for f in files: with open(f, 'r') as lines: array= [] for line in lines: array.append(line)\nGives me this error FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'default_wallet'\nAt first i thoughtn this was a permissions problem but eletrum has never asked for my root password and changing the permissions did nothing.

Transactions are recorded into a distributed, replicated public database known as the blockchain, with consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system called mining. Satoshi Nakamoto, the designer of bitcoin claimed that design and coding of bitcoin begun in 2007.[2] The project was released in 2009 as open source software.\nThe network requires minimal structure to share transactions. An ad hoc decentralized network of volunteers is sufficient. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will. Upon reconnection, a node downloads and verifies new blocks from other nodes to complete its local copy of the blockchain.\nhttps://www.hashmania.net/?ref=25307 (Just highlight the link including the \"ref=25307\" For 150GH/s and click goto link)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:19:22.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b31bc62d8b7d35f4adc1e41ba205ddc4058a24ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zWLsXhUsHXPFh6kvJCbMK2KjpcrYrEZLv_uZKN3aD45aeN8NS65GaPjDKTf35k_SvFfJUR_Pxe6pvOgGAYdKXpLWrpPFDmoTVQ--", "site_full": "btcmanager.com", "site": "btcmanager.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "South African Authorities Investigate $80 million Bitcoin Scam | BTCMANAGER", "title_full": "South African Authorities Investigate $80 million Bitcoin Scam | BTCMANAGER", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "BZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Art-of-the-Crypto-Scam-What-To-Watch-Out-For.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b31bc62d8b7d35f4adc1e41ba205ddc4058a24ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zWLsXhUsHXPFh6kvJCbMK2KjpcrYrEZLv_uZKN3aD45aeN8NS65GaPjDKTf35k_SvFfJUR_Pxe6pvOgGAYdKXpLWrpPFDmoTVQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cindy Huynh", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "South African Authorities Investigate $80 million Bitcoin Scam | BTCMANAGER", "text": "South African Authorities Investigate $80 million Bitcoin Scam May 26, 2018 30 Views\nOn May 25, 2018, South African authorities announced further information of an ongoing investigation of a cryptocurrency scam that has cost investors one billion rands ($80 million). False Claims and Investor Pitfalls\nAccording to Reuters , South African police mentioned that the investigation involved BTC Global, a cryptocurrency trading company. The cryptocurrency company told clients they would earn substantial returns starting with two percent per day, to 14 percent a week, and eventually 50 percent in a month.\nOn BTC Global’s website , they stated that they suspended their services. The note on the site lists Steven Twain as the company’s “primary trader.” The website also stated that “until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.” The admin team left Steven’s contact details. While Reuters reached out to Twain’s email address, they received no response.\nSouth African police mentioned that “members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global. Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nMore important is the fact that BTC Global had already scammed cryptocurrency investors for more than $50 million by March 2018. Related reports indicated that investors “should have seen that BTC Global was a scam from a mile away” since their unusually high returns are similar to other cryptocurrency scams like Bitconnect .\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” said Yolisa Matakata, a police investigator on the BTC Global Case. BTC Global Suspends Services\nAccording to the BTC Global website , the “payment info was sent to Steven Twain on Sunday 18 February 2018 as has been done by the admin team each week since last year. Steven did not acknowledge receipt of the information. Steven has not contacted anyone in leadership or admin team. No payments have been made by Steven. The admin team cannot locate him. If anyone has any information on how we can get in contact with him, please get in touch and let us know.”\n“We are as shocked and angry as everyone. But we all knew the risks involved in placing funds with Steven. We all became complacent with Steven. And all of us funded him independently.”\nA reported 27,000 people were scammed in the heist. While many South Africans were involved, there are reports of other international victims from the United States and Australia. South Africans did, however, lose between 16,000 to 1.4 million rands ($1,280 to $112,000). Do Your Due Diligence\nWhile many cryptocurrency scams can be very convincing, even novice investors should have been privy to all the red flags on BTC Global’s website. By bringing back an archived version, Mybroadband , a regional technology news site, deconstructed the website. They commented that the extremely high returns, referral commissions, and poor web design were factors retail investors should have noted before investing in the company. ( Source : Mybroadband )\nFurthermore, the fact that BTC Global only has one image of their “master trader” drinking a vanilla milkshake is a far cry from any sort of financial legitimacy. There is also very little information online concerning Twain’s background knowledge and trading experience.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T03:11:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f1e069fd1d50cec7eb4083445edf962534ea1dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_RxM_HmSNP8cBu1XD318jLla50ocISc5ozCXT5pnB.c8rqbkg_EbqwFw6HDm4L2B37rC1aBX1S.x.HjL.m9pL7RNwJPCTWV9y44vaXGVXWJ_Vf6xBHYUUW", "site_full": "www.livebitcoinnews.com", "site": "livebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "John McAfee Expects a Bitcoin Price of $15,000 by June 2018", "title_full": "John McAfee Expects a Bitcoin Price of $15,000 by June 2018", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.081, "main_image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/05/26125857/shutterstock_707873287.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f1e069fd1d50cec7eb4083445edf962534ea1dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_RxM_HmSNP8cBu1XD318jLla50ocISc5ozCXT5pnB.c8rqbkg_EbqwFw6HDm4L2B37rC1aBX1S.x.HjL.m9pL7RNwJPCTWV9y44vaXGVXWJ_Vf6xBHYUUW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jp Buntinx", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "John McAfee Expects a Bitcoin Price of $15,000 by June 2018", "text": "Sponsored by Binance .\nJohn McAfee always has interesting opinions on cryptocurrency . While most of his social media posts can be ignored, a recent Bitcoin price prediction attracted a lot of attention. In his opinion , BTC will hit $15,000 again this year. This is supposed to happen in June, albeit the current market conditions tell a different story.\nThe Bitcoin price is subject to speculation and manipulation at all times. This most recent bearish pressure wave further illustrates that point. In situations like these, one always has to keep the bigger picture in mind. Easier said than done when things are looking rather gloomy. For John McAfee, there is absolutely nothing to worry about. He predicts a Bitcoin price of $15,000 by June 2018. A Remarkable Prediction by John McAfee\nCompared to the current Bitcoin value, that would be a 100% increase. It is not unfeasible, as Bitcoin has seen some interesting price rollercoasters for some time now. However, given the current sour sentiment, such an increase seems highly unlikely. Stranger things have happened in the cryptocurrency world over the years. Additionally, the momentum will turn against the bears at some point this year. June may be a bit too early, though.\nWhat is rather interesting is how McAfee doesn’t use any technical analysis for this prediction. Unlike other speculators, he simply calls things as they happen and goes with the flow. He does claim to use some “algorithms”, but no one really knows what that means exactly. It is a good an indicator as any other we have seen being thrown around. Predicting is not part of humans’ skill sets, unfortunately.\nEven so, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the Bitcoin price. Since the crazy end of 2017, there has been no positive momentum to speak of. Instead, the Bitcoin value has only dropped further and further. Such a massive correction cannot go on indefinitely by any means. However, it may take years until we see $15,000 or more again.\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T01:46:07.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07908bbb5429c5afdeff1dbddf17099428bdff9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpILZSe7QjGBhuCrofHC5qrkV0XFSSdHVMLXebh3yRsYeTGuc3sHso2vTUzSNjX2IBhm5wQv.iFMG8huuL_oTdEfjSS.TuLa7N6lwEr.s6FTtViOoN2M_9KzqswjgHvYFH04_XNoSqmuCOdEXFW4CLxA904s72MTlA6GsT.lF3T4w--", "site_full": "tribetica.com", "site": "tribetica.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin as a Store of Value Could be Worth $40K Within the Next Decade, Says Matt Hougan – tribetica.com", "title_full": "Bitcoin as a Store of Value Could be Worth $40K Within the Next Decade, Says Matt Hougan – tribetica.com", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07908bbb5429c5afdeff1dbddf17099428bdff9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpILZSe7QjGBhuCrofHC5qrkV0XFSSdHVMLXebh3yRsYeTGuc3sHso2vTUzSNjX2IBhm5wQv.iFMG8huuL_oTdEfjSS.TuLa7N6lwEr.s6FTtViOoN2M_9KzqswjgHvYFH04_XNoSqmuCOdEXFW4CLxA904s72MTlA6GsT.lF3T4w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin as a Store of Value Could be Worth $40K Within the Next Decade, Says Matt Hougan – tribetica.com", "text": "Bitcoin , Bitcoin Acceptance , bitcoin price , Bitcoin price forecast , Blockchain , crypto , cryptocurrency , digital gold , Emerging Markets , Markets and Prices , Matt Hougan , News , News teaser , store of value\nMatt Hougan of Bitwise Asset Management believes that the price of Bitcoin could increase by 500 percent in the next ten years. Hougan hinges his prediction on the cryptocurrency becoming an actual store of value and the blockchain permeating several facets of human life. Is Bitcoin a Store of Value?\nFinding a consensus on any argument related to Bitcoin is almost a futile effort at this point. There’s the bubble argument , the economic definition argument, and of course, the store of value argument. Matt Hougan, in a recent op-ed for Forbes , examines the store of value debate for Bitcoin, drawing some interesting parallels with gold.\nRight from inception, the virtual currency has been compared with gold. Some proponents are even in the habit of calling the crypto “ digital gold .” Critics, however, dispute this idea, saying that the cryptocurrency cannot be compared to gold because it is highly volatile and, as such, cannot be a store of value.\nOne of the most basic definitions of a store of value is an asset that is both tradable and can be stored for future use. By this definition, a store of value must maintain some stability over a reasonable period. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, no arguments there. However, is the volatility exhibited by the number one crypto a misnomer in the finance world? It turns out the answer is no, and Hougan provides hard evidence. A Little Bit of History Featuring the Post-1971 Gold Market\nToday, gold is not only solid based on its physical form, but as an asset, it maintains some level of price rigidity. However, it wasn’t always so. In 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon dropped the gold standard for the USD. The price of gold and the value of the dollar was no longer tethered together. What happened next? Well, the table below gives an idea of the wild volatility in prices of gold in the decade following 1971.\nToday’s crypto critics would be bellowing that gold isn’t a store of value if they examined these figures. However, today, it is universally accepted that the precious metal is indeed a store of value. So, what has changed? The answer isn’t utility as some might point out. Gold has some industrial application use cases but that it is not enough to justify its current price. According to Hougan:\n[Gold] is worth $1,300 per ounce because people are willing to pay $1300 per ounce for it as a store of wealth. Bitcoin Mirrors Post-1971 Gold\nBitcoin is less than a decade old, which means it isn’t yet a fully formed asset. Hougan believes that expecting the cryptocurrency to behave like a fully matured asset is an argument that lacks economic merit. According to the cryptoanalyst, Bitcoin is passing through the two-stage process of rapid appreciation and declining volatility over time.\n2017 saw a parabolic rise in prices that seem to have plateaued in 2018. The Bitcoin volatility, while still considerably high, is declining over time. This pattern exhibited by the number one crypto bears striking similarities to gold after 1971. Speculative Investment Will Give Way to Real World Use\nIf Bitcoin follows the pattern set by gold, then it is well on its way to establishing itself as a store of value . Right now, the crypto is held as a speculative investment, but within the next decade, as blockchain utility increases, Bitcoin will become an even more significant part of global finance. The current market capitalization for the virtual currency is $130 billion , which is approximately two percent of the $7.5 trillion gold market cap.\nIn ten years, Bitcoin could comfortably hold 10 percent of the value of gold, which would mean a conservative price estimate of $40,000. A lot of this depends on how quickly real-world utility applications can be implemented for the cryptocurrency and the assumption that it continues on a similar trajectory to gold.\nDo you agree with the argument that Bitcoin is like gold, and as such, a store of value? Will an increase in real-world utility drive the price of Bitcoin higher?

This mode generates private keys in bursts compared to the traditional version's one at a time, in an attempt to improve the speed and efficiency of the program. However, activating this mode risks greater chances of the API getting overloaded, possibly causing your IP address to get temporarily blocked. If you are running this program for long periods of time, it is recommended to run the traditional version.\n#\n# Proof of Concept\nThis program is meant to analyze possible ways Bitcoin could be stolen. Because it is impossible to convert a wallet address back into its private key, this program goes the opposite way and generates a completely random private key, then converts it into its respective Bitcoin address. It then queries the calculated address for a balance and <a href=\"#expected-outputs\">prints the result</a> to the user.\nThis program does this in a brute-force style, repeatedly generating and converting private keys, and querying balances. The ultimate goal is to randomly find a wallet with a balance out of the 2<sup>160</sup> possible wallets in existence. In the event that a wallet with a balance is found, the wallet's private key, public key, wallet address, and balance is stored in a text file `plutus.txt` for later use.\nAlthough this project can be used maliciously, it is simply an exploration into the Bitcoin protocol and advanced encryption and hashing techniques using Python.\n#\n# How it Works\nPrivate keys are generated randomly to create a 32 byte hexidecimal string using the cryptographically secure `os.urandom()` function.\nThe private keys are converted into their respective public keys. Then the public keys are converted into their Bitcoin wallet addresses using the `binascii`, `ecdsa`, and `hashlib` Python modules.\nThe wallet addresses are queried using <a href=\"https://bitcoinlegacy.blockexplorer.com/api-ref\">Block Explorer API</a> to collect balance details.\nIf the wallet contains a balance, then the private key, public key, wallet address, and balance are saved to a text file `mobbus.txt` on the user's hard drive.\n#\n# Expected Outputs\n<br><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8mRFQ0WDxEDJ5K/giphy.gif\"> <br><br>\nIf the wallet is empty, then the format `Wallet Address = 0` will be printed. An example is:\n>1A5P8ix6XaoCqXmtXxBwwhp5ZkYsqra32C = 0\nHowever, if a balance is found, then the output will include all necessary information about the wallet. A copy of the output will also be saved in a text file titled `plutus.txt` with all balances in Satoshi. An example is:\n>address: 1JGM6sREUwt5paFEfHNuzvRy7nXtQdaamn<br>\n>private key: 6694e2d40e786839d48b1b699ab9c318514dc0a0f27f2ccaf7f9f32224ead3a8<br>\n>WIF private key: 5JbTtbihnAnNbBtqZKmkWbrDUeei1bCamqKPrHJ49vQx1CT8oUQ<br>\n>public key: 04475C43E9E58637630E10DB01F2FF38C64430E07E272E4C82C877653B8AF15720E4F98F66B49BB4E91B36D4C08FC4F2E13F0A5079DFCEB1821FA05A9F9F30F361<br>\n>balance: 10000000\n#\n# Warnings\nIf you are receiving:\n>HTTP Error Code: (number)<br/>\n>Retrying in 5 seconds\nOr\n>Unable to connect to API after several attempts<br>\n>Retrying in 30 seconds\nThis program queries Block Explorer API for wallet balances making a HTTP request necessary for complete operation. If connection to the API is found to be unresponsive (failing to return a 200 HTTP status) the program will pause for 5 seconds and attempt to continue.\nIf you are receiving a lot of errors, visit <a href=\"https://bitcoinlegacy.blockexplorer.com/\">Blockexplorer.com</a> to see if their API might be down.\nThis program also responds to 429 HTTP responses because of the high frequency of server requests. When a 429 is encountered, the program will print the error `HTTP Error Code: 429`, but will not pause. However, if several 429's are received consecutively, the user will get the result `Unable to connect to API after several attempts` and will be forced to wait 30 seconds until the program continues again.\n#\n# Efficiency\nThis program is able to handle, generate, and query a private key in 0.5 seconds.
