This project's main goal is to raise awareness/adoption for Bitcoin Cash by using bright LED screens to display BCH promotional materials and by giving away Bitcoin Cash. $4000 CAD in BCH will be given away throughout the course of the day on July 1st.

At a conference in April, former CFTC chairman Gary Gensler had come down hard on XRP and said there was “a strong case” to classify it as a security.\n(See also: ICO Tokens Are Securities: Former CFTC Chair). Bitcoin, which has never sought public funds to develop its technology, does not pass the Howey Test used by the SEC to classify securities.

Advertisements Bitcoin Price Stagnant, but Not for Long As of late, uncertainties with regard to regulations and the seizure of Bitcoin in legal cases like Mt. Gox, which led to the unloading of coins on exchanges , has caused some stagnation. This means that, according to experts, the short-term crypto forecast is expected to remain relatively static — though not for long. “I believe Bitcoin’s price will continue to fluctuate between $6,500 and $8,500 in the coming weeks,” David Hanson, a blockchain expert and CEO of the gaming platform Ultra, told the Independent . He continued: “In the medium-to-long term, Bitcoin’s value should go up, as big institutions enter the crypto space in a bid to gain first-mover advantage, further legitimising the market.” This idea that institutional investors will provide a boost to the digital currency (and altcoins) is shared by other figures in the space, who are looking at the cryptocurrency to break the $10,000 barrier again in coming months. Despite the drop from almost $20,000 in December, and the fact that the number one crypto has not gone above $10,000 since March (though it came awfully close in early-May), more people and companies alike are getting interested in the coin — and this is set to show, according to Iqbal Gandham, the U.K. managing director of eToro. “As the regulatory landscape clears up we can expect far more investors, including big ticket institutions, to make their first cryptocurrency investments,” he said. He went on to say: “For the first few months of this year, the crypto industry has been jogging along at a relatively slow pace, waiting for the opportunity to stretch into a sprint. This may just be that moment.” Bitcoin Predictions Look to 95% Gains by Year End At the beginning of the year, following the register of all time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at the end of 2017, price predictions were very positive. Tim Draper, an early backer of Tesla, Skype, and SpaceX, and one of the most high-profile Bitcoin investors, said that it could hit $250,000 by 2022 . Although Draper did not disclose the method he used to calculate his forecast, a comparable number was provided by Horizon Kinetics’ Murray Stahl, who argued that the digital currency could be worth the value of all the currency in the world. He believes this is the case because fiat money can be ‘debased,’ but there will be only 21 million Bitcoins ever made. Another person with positive price predictions is Alistair Milne, the self-described ‘Bitcoin evangelist.’ Milne has stated that he believes Bitcoin will reach between $35,000 and $60,000 by the end of 2019. Following Milne’s lead, similar numbers were suggested by a panel of crypto experts put together by price comparison site Finder.com, who originally stated that Bitcoin would hit $33,000 by the end of this year. This week the panel released a revised figure , bringing the prediction to less than half the initial outlook at just $14,638 — but those are still great gains on Bitcoin’s current price of just under $7,700, according to CoinMarketCap.

In most of the cases, the things of day to day life are available at the price of Bitcoin transaction fees so why would someone use Bitcoin if technically he can get it for free?

Bitmain's founder, cryptocurrency billionaire Jihan Wu, told Bloomberg that Bitmain is considering an initial public offering as it expands into producing hardware for AI computing. Bitmain Technologies, the world's largest producer of mining chips, might be considering an IPO, Bloomberg reports.\nThe company, which is run by 32-year-old cryptocurrency billionaire Jihan Wu, has become a global force in the burgeoning cryptocurrency mining industry since it was founded five years ago. In June, Wu told Bloomberg that Bitmain made $2.5 billion in revenue in the year 2017 alone. Now, the company's success might have Wu considering taking it public.\nRecently, Bitmain has been tinkering with another kind of hardware beyond mining chips. The company has expressed interest in developing custom chips to compute in the field of artificial intelligence, called application-specific integrated circuits .\nWu suggested to Bloomberg that Bitmain's interest in expanding into AI hardware might eventually lead to an initial public offering. The listing, Wu said, would most likely occur overseas; Hong Kong was mentioned as a possible option.\n“Bitmain is trying very hard to maintain its advantage,” Wu told Bloomberg.\nRead the full story over at Bloomberg here.\nNOW WATCH: Here's why coating our streets white could help lower temperatures in the summer\nSee Also:\nAn FBI agent mapped out the countries capable of unleashing a crippling cyber attack on the US Japan's $2,700 answer to the Amazon Echo could make the country's sex crisis even worse Las Vegas casinos prepare to hemorrhage $10 million a day as their workers, fearing their jobs will be replaced by robots, get ready to go on strike", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-aristedes-mahairas-these-4-nations-pose-biggest-cyber-risk-to-us-2018-6?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-17/china-s-crypto-chips-king-sets-his-sights-on-ai", "http://www.businessinsider.com/las-vegas-casinos-strike-robot-fears-2018-6?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8Xxm6xsJ6u5zgCmjWZHm9Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/businessinsider.com/61416257c3ee3769a7011d1a76da78d8", "http://www.businessinsider.com/gatebox-ai-the-japanese-amazon-echo-photos-2016-12?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/crypto-s-32-year-old-billionaire-mining-king-is-mulling-an-ipo", "http://www.businessinsider.com/coat-city-streets-white-cliimate-change-2018-5?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&quot;", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-17/china-s-crypto-chips-king-sets-his-sights-on-ai&quot;", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/crypto-s-32-year-old-billionaire-mining-king-is-mulling-an-ipo&quot;", "http://www.businessinsider.com/coat-city-streets-white-cliimate-change-2018-5?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jihan wu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitmain technologies", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T19:20:50.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9e17b35b16a1886645ef8f50423e79361b340f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbAGexWc7OXgipAlLtMDoLw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How can you verify if a bitcoin is real?", "title_full": "How can you verify if a bitcoin is real?", "published": "2018-06-07T23:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9e17b35b16a1886645ef8f50423e79361b340f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbAGexWc7OXgipAlLtMDoLw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Erlinda Santiago", "published": "2018-06-07T23:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "How can you verify if a bitcoin is real?", "text": "Quote: from: StaffsLebowski on January 14, 2018, 11:13:09 AM Hi All,\nFirst post so please be gentle!. I'm trying to get familiar with crypto currency and understand 'how it works'. I've reached a block and I'm hoping someone can shed some light on a particular point.\nI understand the process of using public and private keys, back from the time when Phil Zimmermann created PGP. PGP allowed a user to encrypt a file, eg: an email/file (technically, just a bunch of ones and zeros) so that when the other user decrypted the file, they would see the words/file again. Or, to phrase it another way, the encryption was just a 'wrapper' for the content - ie, the words in my email or the file I sent.\nNow, if someone sent me a bitcoin, how would I know what I was looking at? With an encrypted email, once decrypted I would be able to see something (text/file) and realise that I had actually received something. But, if someone sent me a bitcoin, what would I be looking at when I decrypted with my private key? A file filled with ones and zeros? Or maybe a simple text file with words inside saying, \"Hey, this is 1 bitcoin!\"\nCan someone shed some light on what it I actually receive when I purchase a bitcoin and how I can verify that what I have 'in my hands', is actually a bitcoin and not just a bunch of ones and zeros? I understand that the blockchain is supposed to verify what is what but, what if I wanted to pass my bitcoin directly to you without the blockchain. Again, how would I know, what I received - was a bitcoin?\nThank you for your time and patience with my lack of understanding!\nRegards,\nStaffs Lebowski.. if you really wabt to verify it search pr find some reviews or experience about people who invest bitcoins and what happened to them if the are satisfied or not", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T04:14:19.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f65b6e856fa49a79217bcdd73422cb61f944e1e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYagglScZfQUViAT.ut1ArAI51hoKcwTfr5OksvhVeHkW0VbrDuGTYb0tQg1xiSFG6FVrtiV44hKZJ1rg--", "site_full": "sg.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business finance, stock market, quotes, news", "title": "Cryptos Continue to Rise; Dimon Says to “Beware” of Bitcoin", "title_full": "Cryptos Continue to Rise; Dimon Says to “Beware” of Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-07T23:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0qbCGkpC_qb3yeGxnk77.Q--~B/aD0zMDY7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/investing_com_631/b47ca93236e79f4dd671ec38bf82a387", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f65b6e856fa49a79217bcdd73422cb61f944e1e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYagglScZfQUViAT.ut1ArAI51hoKcwTfr5OksvhVeHkW0VbrDuGTYb0tQg1xiSFG6FVrtiV44hKZJ1rg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investing.com", "published": "2018-06-07T23:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptos Continue to Rise; Dimon Says to “Beware” of Bitcoin", "text": "Bitcoin was higher on Thursday.

I don't know whether Jamie can top me or not.\" Buffet told shareholders in May that bitcoin is \"probably rat poison squared.\"\nIn other news, U.S. investment giant Fidelity is looking to enter the cryptocurrency space and could set up its own exchange. The firm is hiring a number of peronall for crypto, digital asset and blockchain projects, including a DevOps System Engineer to help create a new crypto exchange, according to media reports.\nIf the firm does move into the digital exchange space, that could be good news for cryptos, as it would help legitimise the digital coins and give many Americans access to investing in the sector.\nRelated Articles\nSoftware Multinational SAP Announces Launch of Cloud Blockchain Platform\nMysterious Chinese Bitcoin Whale Hoarded 94,000 BTC\nSAP Opens Blockchain-as-a-Service Platform to All Customers", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/sap-opens-blockchainasaservice-platform-to-all-customers-1484304?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo_finance&quot;", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/software-multinational-sap-announces-launch-of-cloud-blockchain-platform-1484310?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo_finance&quot;", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/sap-opens-blockchainasaservice-platform-to-all-customers-1484304?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/mysterious-chinese-bitcoin-whale-hoarded-94000-btc-1484305?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/mysterious-chinese-bitcoin-whale-hoarded-94000-btc-1484305?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo_finance&quot;", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/software-multinational-sap-announces-launch-of-cloud-blockchain-platform-1484310?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FORvsUvNtlIcHZHXghDHJA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjUwO2g9NDEw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/investing_com_631/b47ca93236e79f4dd671ec38bf82a387"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dimon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jp morgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brka", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T19:11:58.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62ffe7fce476580c9bb4fb4230e7c7146fa9ec6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZHqMtqmRnQ0EW3VLPbEEDM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=238.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bounties (Altcoins)", "title": "🔴 🔴 MONETO -

Troops tend to be made of one adult male or silverback, multiple adult females and their offspring.[35][36][37] However, multiple-male troops also exist.[36] A silverback is typically more than 12 years of age, and is named for the distinctive patch of silver hair on his back, which comes with maturity. Silverbacks also have large canine teeth that also come with maturity. Both males and females tend to emigrate from their natal groups. For mountain gorillas, females disperse from their natal troops more than males.[35][38] Mountain gorillas and western lowland gorillas also commonly transfer to second new groups.[35] he U.S. economy. Three economists said rising nuclear tensions with Iran are a concern.Even without an outside jolt, the economists expect barely enough job creation in 2012 to stay ahead of population growth and the return of discouraged workers into the labor force.\"I just don't know if it's going to be enough to bring the unemployment rate down,\" says Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.The AP economists expect the unemployment rate to be stuck at a recession-level 8.4 percent when voters go to the polls in November. Unemployment was 8.6 percent in November.A majority (56 percent) of the economists say the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve policies. The Fed has said it plans to keep short-term interest rates near zero through at least mid-2013 if the economy remains weak. The central bank also has begun a campaign to try to push down mortgage rates and other long-term interest rates through next June.Those Mature males also tend to leave their groups and establish their own troops by attracting emigrating females. However, male mountain gorillas sometimes stay in their natal troops and become subordinate to the silverback. If the silverback dies, these males may be able to become dominant or mate with the females. This behaviour has not been observed in eastern lowland gorillas. In a single male group, when the silverback dies, the females and their offspring disperse and find a new troop.[38][39] Without a silverback to protect them, the infants will likely fall victim to infanticide. Joining a new group is likely to be a tactic against this.[38][40] However, while gorilla troops usually disband after the silverback dies, female eastern lowlands gorillas and their offspring have been recorded staying together until a new silverback transfers into the group. This likely serves as protection from leopards.[39] Silverback gorilla The silverback is the center of the troop's attention, making all the decisions, mediating conflicts, determining the movements of the group, leading the others to feeding sites, and taking responsibility for the safety and well-being of the troop. Younger males subordinate to the silverback, known as blackbacks, may serve as backup protection. Blackbacks are aged between 8 and 12 years[37] and lack the silver back hair. The bond that a silverback has with his females forms the core of gorilla social life. Bonds between them are maintained by grooming and staying close together.[41] Females form strong relationships with males to gain mating opportunities and protection from predators and infanticidal outside males.[42] However, aggressive behaviours between males and females do occur, but rarely lead to serious injury. Relationships between females may vary. Maternally related females in a troop tend to be friendly towards each other and associate closely. Otherwise, females have few friendly encounters and commonly act aggressively towards each other.[35] Females may fight for social access to males and a male may intervene.[41] Male gorillas have weak social bonds, particularly in multiple-male groups with apparent dominance hierarchies and strong competition for mates. Males in all-male groups, though, tend to have friendly interactions and socialise through play, grooming, and staying together,[37] and occasionally they even engage in homosexual interactions.[43] Severe aggression is rare in stable groups, but when two mountain gorilla groups meet, the two silverbacks can sometimes engage in a fight to the death, using their canines to cause deep, gapiknown as botany, a branch of biology.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0", "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/", "http://www.typepad.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tony wilson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T00:28:44.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56030df965f79aac2744dd89f9986eaebb3618f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SK194CP._3I4qZwp2WAwjQB_7d6R9lwzMO1kQ7WmKU.UcifbDOPqjm7SPCbh_Wslp_0OncDIqIfBJP0YCRVr3SzS1O5.wuyu2_VgvvS78WSelTVLNYN7oKqh5CGQMOoa4-", "site_full": "ask_tony_wilson.blogs.com", "site": "blogs.com", "site_section": "http://ask_tony_wilson.blogs.com/folder/atom.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "I'm Tony Wilson", "title": "Chance To Profit From Bitcoin.

For much of the fund’s history, that allocation was relatively stable in number of shares, and hovered between 6 percent and 10 percent of the portfolio, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin often led the list of top holdings in ARKK. Only one other ETF on the market offered parallel access to bitcoin ARKK’s internet-focused counterpart ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW).\nMore from ETF.com:\nThe next bond crash: An ETF story\nWhy I don’t use target date funds\nWorld’s cheapest ‘do good’ ETF\nBitcoin, accessed through the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), was a major driver behind both these funds’ returns last year. ARKK and ARKW were each up more than 87 percent in 2017. GBTC itself was up a whopping 1,550 percent.\nHere’s the ETFs’ rally last year, and that impressive rally relative to GBTC’s, in two charts:\nBut these ETFs’ big bet on bitcoin is no longer the case. In mid January of this year, ARK began trimming exposure to bitcoin in both funds, and today bitcoin represents only 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent in ARKK and ARKW, respectively. The cryptocurrency is almost a negligible allocation in these portfolios now.\nWhy? According to ARK, the “complicated decision” to dramatically trim bitcoin exposure was more driven by regulatory and tax-related concerns than by the “merits” of bitcoin itself.\nBut performance probably played a major role in this portfolio shift. Bitcoin as measured by GBTC rose dramatically in 2016 and in early 2017, and then began to fall later in the year. So far in 2018, GBTC has already dropped 37 percent, bringing its losses from its mid-December 2017 high to more than 63 percent in just five months. (ARKK and ARKW are each up about 15 percent year-to-date.)\nshow chapters\nEarly bitcoin investor reveals which cryptocurrencies he would HODL or FODL 21 Mins Ago | 10:16\nIt could very well be that ARK was simply taking profits on its bitcoin allocation earlier this year, and has been trimming that position since as bitcoin prices continue to struggle. If GBTC price performance did in fact motivate the move, any recovery in bitcoin prices could mean an increase in allocation down the road.\nFor now, however, given that the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve the launch of a bitcoin ETF many issuers have thrown their hats into that ring investors who want access to the cryptocurrency through an ETF wrapper have slim pickings at best.\nBy Cinthia Murphy, ETF.com.

Such an attack would allow for retrieving the private key that gives access to the Bitcoins stored on the TREZOR. Usually the discussions of side-channel attacks mention the code that signs a Bitcoin transaction. To sign a transaction on the TREZOR, you need to enter the secret PIN first. So this is not useful in the scenario where the attacker has physical access to the device but does not know the PIN.\nHe explains how you can recover a private key from a TREZOR, if it still runs with firmware 1.3.1. It is an interesting read on how to take a device and see what is happening inside based on the power it is drawing.\nJochen did the right thing and informed Satoshi Labs of his result first. This is why the latest firmware, 1.3.3, will ask for a PIN when computing the public key. Also Satoshi included his suggested patches in the latest firmware that will reduce the information leaked through side-channels during computation of public keys, signatures, and decryption.\nDo you like this type of investigation, let us know in the comments!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://jochen-hoenicke.de/trezor-power-analysis/", "https://buytrezor.com/?a=15504cc10984", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jochen hoenicke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "trezor", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T00:17:51.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4933b6b7342d0c34b4e224ec868efcd57afe51cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17S3iUKSDeYaj2bAwNHnthfq5pAZHtNgsL0.7yG7GnLZJ3B2_J9xioZPs-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-07T23:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4933b6b7342d0c34b4e224ec868efcd57afe51cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17S3iUKSDeYaj2bAwNHnthfq5pAZHtNgsL0.7yG7GnLZJ3B2_J9xioZPs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T23:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 7.

While large corporations and other institutional investors seek to make millions off the buying and selling of virtual currencies, it is the small, individual investor who is seeing their life altered for the better through cryptocurrency.\nOne group that is truly feeling such benefits are young professionals in Africa. As the popularity of Bitcoin in Africa continues to soar, these young professionals are fully embracing the \"gospel of Bitcoin\" and are preaching the tremendous possibilities offered by crypto to their peers.\nMaking a Difference One such evangelical for using Bitcoin in Africa is Richard M. Bagorogo, a teacher in Uganda. Bagorogo recently told a group of individuals at a conference:\nWhat I have earned in one-and-a-half years from bitcoin is more than I earned in 10 years as a teacher. I am living on bitcoin because getting a job in this country is not easy.\nBagorogo added that he was unable to actually enroll his own children at the very school he taught at due to limited funds. However, Bitcoin changed this situation dramatically when Bagorogo began trading the cryptocurrency on P2P finance exchanges like Paxful. With just a smartphone, an internet connection, and a Bitcoin wallet , he earned enough money trading Bitcoin to give his children a better education, take his family on a well-deserved vacation, and financially help out his father.\nHigh Inflation in Africa Crippling Young Professionals Other young professionals like Richard M. Bagorogo understand the promise that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer. Inflation is rampant across Africa, making currency printed by the central governments essentially worthless. Inflation in South Africa is 4.5 percent on a monthly basis. Ghana checks in at 9.6 percent on a monthly basis, and Sudan features a staggering 54 percent monthly inflation rate.\nThese high rates of inflation kill the hopes and dreams of young African professionals who seek a better life for themselves and their families. Yet the power of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges are offering a proverbial economic lifeline. The beauty of the cryptocurrency marketplace is that it is not dependent upon national governments or centralized banks for success. The marketplace instead relies upon the power of P2P finance generated by tens of millions of people across the globe.\nMany young professionals in Africa have turned to Bitcoin as their sole means of revenue or to supplement their regular salary. Money can be earned in several ways. Some advocate joining a mining pool while others prefer buying and selling Bitcoin on exchanges.\nPaxful is one popular peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange in Africa, with their second and third most popular countries by trading volume being Nigeria and Ghana. The ability to use gift cards, such as those for Amazon or iTunes, allows a tremendous amount of flexibility for young professionals to trade Bitcoin.\nCryptocurrency offers young African professionals many benefits, which is why they are preaching the \"gospel of Bitcoin\" to others. While Bitcoin can be volatile, it far less so than the average national fiat currency of African nations.\nCryptocurrency is proving itself to be a useful store of value for Africans. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also allow users to bypass the many fees and taxes levied by banks and other central financial institutions while trading, not to mention that P2P finance trades are carried out in a very short time frame as opposed to the far more lengthy periods associated with central banks.\nLastly, young professionals do not need a bank account in order to be an active participant in the cryptocurrency sphere. This is an important consideration as many people in Africa, young professionals included, do not have a bank account or lack access to basic financial services.\nBitcoin is making a vast difference in the lives of young African professionals. The circumstances of their location, such as inflation and lack of infrastructure, are not dragging them down due to the growing use and popularity of Bitcoin in Africa. Young people are turning to cryptocurrency for a better economic future, and others are taking note.\nOne example is that the prestigious Red & Yellow business school in South Africa is now accepting tuition in Bitcoin, and the country has received its first Bitcoin ATM as well. From Ghana to Zimbabwe, young professionals have discovered the economic opportunities offered by cryptocurrency, and they are embracing it.\nNot only that, they are looking to help others by sharing their experiences by extolling the power of the \"gospel of Bitcoin.\"\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock\nThe post Young Professionals in Africa Are Embracing the 'Gospel of Bitcoin' on Exchanges Like Paxful appeared first on Bitcoinist.com .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bagorogo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard m. bagorogo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uganda", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T23:28:35.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ef80240e37dfbb630c3b2b1a44b73beeb6cac21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf39pTwh2NCtp6lAQMRWrYREwWLYVOxLcFQK09yYuD2Sw1DoKm8cf6R4AZYHHrDW1gsV7t5y44LA4p", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "The value of all the world securities and currencies is 5 Quintillion dollars today and only growing bigger.

Photos - By Inegvin\nIt wouldn’t be wrong to say cryptocurrencies have created the greatest wave since the dot com era came into being. In 2017, a single bitcoin was valued at a whopping $19,000, and it has continued to mostly rise since then. This certainly puts it at top of mind when discussing cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has become a major trendsetter in the business of decentralized peer-to-peer network. Blockchain systems have brought in a revolution in the cryptocurrency market. They are capable of recording all transactions of value. That said, there are also plenty of fascinating alternatives to bitcoin to consider\nLike most things in the world, bitcoins have their flaws too. Newer currencies are coming up as we speak, to fulfill the gaps in bitcoins. These alternatives to bitcoin are called altcoins. They come with the intention to be improvised and faster in comparison. Altcoins are becoming popular among investors because they have kept the benefits of bitcoins and have worked on its lacunas. Altcoins are known to be easier to mine too. But they have limitations like lesser acceptance, skewed liquidity, and skeptic value retention.\nEven with the versatile nature of bitcoin, it fails to fulfill certain gaps that altcoins are flourishing at. Curious to know about these trending altcoins in business? Read on. 1. Ripple (XRP)\nAmong alternatives to bitcoin, this one stands out as a real-time global settlement network that allows instant and low-cost international payments. It is based on a public ledger and is the third largest cryptocurrency. Additionally, it doesn’t require mining, unlike other bitcoin and altcoins. The creators of ripple plan to make use of the digital currency for other deals and transactions. It’s designed to be used by financial organizations and validates transactions by using a consensus process. Unlike other currencies, it isn’t completely decentralized and is managed/validated by a company. Fortunately for businesses, it is faster than bitcoin’s network. Today, its market cap ranks at half of Ethereum and quarter of bitcoin. 2. BarterCoin\nThis bitcoin alternative hasn’t been launched in the market yet but is already pretty popular among enthusiasts and investors. Currently, it is produced by Bartercoin Exchange Limited, under the laws of Trinidad and Tobago. They plan to offer around 1 billion coins, in an effort to spend on the rebranding of Port of Spain. They view this as the financial hub of the 22nd century. What makes it unique from bitcoin is that it allows its users to cash out after six months at will. It has an easy-to-use POS which enables consumers and merchants to purchase barter coins directly. It also has an e-commerce payment system that is known to be secure and trustworthy. These 5 Buzzworthy Big Data Trends Are Huge In 2018 3. Litecoin (LTC)\nThis decentralized digital currency was developed and designed by MIT graduates. This functions very similarly to Bitcoin but has certain added advantages that sets it apart. It functions on “Scrypt” as a proof of work, which can be decoded easily even on CPUs. Digital coins are becoming popular among investors rapidly. This has led the way to the very popular Litecoin debit cards, or otherwise used as Bitcoin debit cards. It has worked on ranking down the risks involved with the fluctuations of the well-doing cryptocurrencies. Litecoin is easily buyable and sells equally at ease in return for cash. It has a much speedier block generation rate, hence confirms transactions faster. Its speed is what sets it apart in the marketplace today. 4. Ethereum (ETH)\nThis digital currency ranks second today as the most highly priced currency in the market, so it definitely stands out among alternatives to bitcoin. The value and the market cap of this currency has been rising steadily since its inception three years ago. Fortunately, experts suggest the value to grow fast and steady in the times to come too. After the sad drop of the DAO project , it has further subdivided itself into Ethereum classic and Ethereum. It allows apps to be developed and run without the interference of fraudsters or third parties. It is also a decentralized software platform allowing Smart contracts and Distributed Applications. Beyond RDBMS: Databases for Modern Applications 5. Zcash (ZEC)\nZerocoin project had taken the initiative to provide anonymity to its users, and Zcash was born. This digital currency was developed somewhere in the latter half of 2016. It’s an open-source cryptocurrency which is decentralized. What makes it special is the privacy and the choice of transparency it offers. It provides added privacy and security, to the point where all transactions are recorded and published in the blockchain. There is the concept of “Shielded Transaction” with Zcash. This allows the user to choose if they want the content to be encrypted by advanced cryptogenic techniques. It uses zero-knowledge cryptography to secure the network and maintains a secured ledger of your balances. 6. Dash\nThis altcoin was earlier known as Darker coin. As the name suggests, it was a more secretive or mysterious version of Bitcoin. Dash functions on a decentralized master code network, thus making transactions very hard to trace. Launched in 2014, it garnered much attention very quickly. Additionally, it can be mined using both CPU and GPU. It was rebranded to DASH in 2016. Much of its technological features remained the same and so did its algorithms. What separates it from others is the use of a two-tier network that allocates separate tasks to each network. The process of creating new blocks and coin specific features are handled separately.\nMajor MNCs are bringing out their own versions of digital currencies. More and more people are seeing the scope in them. It’s no longer just limited to investors and Businesses, students around the world aren’t willing to miss out on their piece of the cake either. Going by the trend around the marketplace, cryptocurrencies are here to stay for long.

It functions on “Scrypt” as a proof of work, which can be decoded easily even on CPUs.\nDigital coins are becoming popular among investors rapidly. This has led the way to the very popular Litecoin debit cards, or otherwise used as Bitcoin debit cards. It has worked on ranking down the risks involved with the fluctuations of the well-doing cryptocurrencies. Litecoin is easily buyable and sells equally at ease in return for cash. It has a much speedier block generation rate, hence confirms transactions faster. Its speed is what sets it apart in the marketplace today. 4. Ethereum (ETH) This digital currency ranks second today as the most highly priced currency in the market, so it definitely stands out among alternatives to bitcoin. The value and the market cap of this currency has been rising steadily since its inception three years ago. Fortunately, experts suggest the value to grow fast and steady in the times to come too. After the sad drop of the DAO project , it has further subdivided itself into Ethereum classic and Ethereum. It allows apps to be developed and run without the interference of fraudsters or third parties. It is also a decentralized software platform allowing Smart contracts and Distributed Applications.\n5. Zcash (ZEC) Zerocoin project had taken the initiative to provide anonymity to its users, and Zcash was born. This digital currency was developed somewhere in the latter half of 2016. It’s an open-source cryptocurrency which is decentralized. What makes it special is the privacy and the choice of transparency it offers. It provides added privacy and security, to the point where all transactions are recorded and published in the blockchain. There is the concept of “Shielded Transaction” with Zcash. This allows the user to choose if they want the content to be encrypted by advanced cryptogenic techniques. It uses zero-knowledge cryptography to secure the network and maintains a secured ledger of your balances.\n6. Dash This altcoin was earlier known as Darker coin. As the name suggests, it was a more secretive or mysterious version of Bitcoin. Dash functions on a decentralized master code network, thus making transactions very hard to trace. Launched in 2014, it garnered much attention very quickly. Additionally, it can be mined using both CPU and GPU. It was rebranded to DASH in 2016. Much of its technological features remained the same and so did its algorithms. What separates it from others is the use of a two-tier network that allocates separate tasks to each network. The process of creating new blocks and coin specific features are handled separately.\nMajor MNCs are bringing out their own versions of digital currencies. More and more people are seeing the scope in them. It’s no longer just limited to investors and Businesses, students around the world aren’t willing to miss out on their piece of the cake either. Going by the trend around the marketplace, cryptocurrencies are here to stay for long. But what’s important to note is how many of them will fare through and come out successful.\nThe post Bitcoin Alternatives: 6 Rising Cryptocurrencies Worth Keeping An Eye On appeared first on SmartData Collective .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T23:53:57.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee83154c5d2b1deac41a24d30e0bec984b6eac8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnCeATpmdqFAf6Mj72p5kyrGIBVdUM0vdzkKD1Eib.kdbwLCH7KTHfKeEbMkpOVZA18fAJI5V4rATbytRdZ4svA00rej7uWG_tVntm0odN8cU-", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Stockpiling a Medium of Exchange Opposed to a Supercomputer", "title_full": "Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Stockpiling a Medium of Exchange Opposed to a Supercomputer", "published": "2018-06-07T23:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee83154c5d2b1deac41a24d30e0bec984b6eac8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnCeATpmdqFAf6Mj72p5kyrGIBVdUM0vdzkKD1Eib.kdbwLCH7KTHfKeEbMkpOVZA18fAJI5V4rATbytRdZ4svA00rej7uWG_tVntm0odN8cU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-07T23:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Stockpiling a Medium of Exchange Opposed to a Supercomputer", "text": " Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Stockpiling a Medium of Exchange Opposed to a Supercomputer\nBitcoin and Ethereum have radically different use casesHow would you compare Apple to Amazon?

Proposes New Protocols to Decentralize Bitcoin Mining", "text": "‘BetterHash’: Bitcoin Core Dev. Proposes New Protocols to Decentralize Bitcoin Mining\nBitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo has published a draft of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to further decentralize bitcoin mining through the adoption of a new mining protocol.\nPublished by Corallo — perhaps better known by his social media handle TheBlueMatt — on his personal GitHub repository this week, the “ BetterHash Mining Protocol(s) ” seeks to address one of the many “pressures” in bitcoin mining that push the ecosystem toward centralization: Stratum , the most widely-used mining protocol.\nAs Corallo explains, deficiencies in the design of Stratum, combined with the fact that most bitcoin miners point their hashpower toward mining pools, limit the diversity of block templates used across the network. This, he claims, gives pool operators undue influence over network upgrades and reduces Bitcoin’s censorship resistance.\n“Difficult to implement and poorly documented, the design of the Stratum protocol requires pool operators to build and distribute block templates to their clients. Without a diverse body of miners constructing block templates, the network’s censorship resistance is jeopardized (e.g. pool operators may use their position of power to restrict the flow of protocol upgrades).”\nCorallo seeks to replace the Stratum protocol with a new system that divides block construction and payouts into two protocols — Work and Pool — collectively known as BetterHash. This will allow individual miners to select the transactions they include in blocks, rather than letting mining pool operators make that choice for them, while still benefiting from the stable payouts that connecting to a pool provides.\nAt present, miners who want to use their own block templates must either solo mine or connect to small decentralized mining pool p2pool, which increases their autonomy at the cost of being unable to receive stable payouts.\nUnder BetterHash, pool operators would not be able to use their position to tell miners whether to adopt particular network upgrades. Moreover, giving miners more control over block templates also helps mitigate the risk of a government ordering a locally-operated mining pool to censor particular types of transactions.\nNotably, BetterHash does not force miners to construct their own block templates if they do not want to, but it does give them the option to utilize the Work protocol to connect to another pool’s block template — even if they want to direct their hashpower somewhere else.\nIn addition to decreasing centralization within the bitcoin mining ecosystem, BetterHash also introduces some performance improvements over Stratum.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Stratum_mining_protocol", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/betterhash/bip-XXXX.mediawiki"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "corallo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt corallo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T00:17:04.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e54037418f9846e2f8dbeeff6da0157360716dad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRDvRM2PrjdrNTGM.OAyPyU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will Bitcoin be beaten by other coins?", "title_full": "Will Bitcoin be beaten by other coins?", "published": "2018-06-07T23:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e54037418f9846e2f8dbeeff6da0157360716dad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRDvRM2PrjdrNTGM.OAyPyU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GrayFullbuster", "published": "2018-06-07T23:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will Bitcoin be beaten by other coins?", "text": "Quote: from: CryptoKing1992 on June 04, 2018, 08:56:16 AM As the crypto market gains more mainstream popularity, one thing is apparent--increasingly more altcoins are gaining in status, relative to the (still) most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\nIt's a common belief today in the crypto investment world, that Bitcoin is losing dominance--and history of its market cap relative to all other cryptocurrencies shows exactly that.

Goldman Sachs-backed cryptocurrency platform Circle is seeking a federal banking license and plans to register with the SEC as a brokerage and trading venue, Bloomberg reported this week.\n\"We believe both companies would only make these moves if their perception of regulatory risks in crypto was improving,\" Lee said, calling their announcements \"implicit acknowledgement\" that the regulatory tide is shifting.\nRegulatory crackdowns and announcements from the SEC have been a headwind for bitcoin prices this year. Prices fell below $10,000 in March after the agency said it would require digital asset exchanges to register with the agency and have struggled to recover since.\nBitcoin has slumped more than 45 percent since January, according to CoinDesk. The digital currency was trading near $7,689 as of 2 p.m. ET Thursday.\nLee and others in the space have argued that uncertainty from regulators has held back demand for cryptocurrency and prevented institutional investors from entering the market.\nA key debate is how to classify what cryptocurrency is, and how it should be regulated. In a CNBC interview Wednesday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said while bitcoin is not a security, tokens from initial coin offerings are. The CFTC, on the other hand, regulates them as commodities.\nThe supply-demand dynamics have changed drastically from last year, when investors flooded the market as bitcoin neared the $20,000 mark in December. Lee, the only major Wall Street strategist to issue formal price targets on bitcoin, pointed to a sharp increase in cryptocurrency supply in 2018 and lower demand after investors sold bitcoin holdings to meet tax requirements.\nMore than $9 billion has been raised in ICOs this year, according to data from Autonomous Next, more than 2.5 times the entire ICO market last year. Meanwhile, households sold roughly $25 billion in cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars in order to pay for capital gains taxes they owed, according to Fundstrat. Lee estimated a $37 billion net drop in demand this year.\nThe SEC and other U.S. regulators have been tasked with policing fast-paced innovation and protecting investors from fraud.\nRobert Cohen, chief of the Cyber Unit in the Division of Enforcement at the SEC, said Thursday that while the agency is heavily focused on fraud, it is being cautious not to hurt innovation.\n\"We want to encourage innovation and new ways of raising capital,\" Cohen said at the New York Blockchain and Digital Assets Summit Thursday. \"If there's a new and exciting tech people should have an opportunity to invest in it.\"\nThe agency created the website HoweyCoins.com to show investors some of the ways a site can look valid when it actually could be a scam. The agency has cracked down on ICOs this year: It has continuously warned of pump-and-dump schemes, issued subpoenas and charged multiple coin projects with fraud.\n\"Every time there's an exciting new technology, people are afraid of missing out they see people becoming millionaires overnight, there's a high risk of people falling victim to fraud,\" Cohen said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/circle-in-talks-with-u-s-to-become-licensed-bank-trading-venue", "https://www.howeycoins.com/index.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keystone capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T22:18:28.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89d47739a3ff31f599b6a6021476cf14398d94dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdF0WaYtVeMq0mMjmVV9LSk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=224.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation (Altcoins)", "title": "What is going to replace bitcoin?", "title_full": "What is going to replace bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-07T23:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89d47739a3ff31f599b6a6021476cf14398d94dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdF0WaYtVeMq0mMjmVV9LSk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bybox", "published": "2018-06-07T23:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is going to replace bitcoin?", "text": "I think nothing will replace Bitcoin since bitcoin is more like digital gold than a platform like ethereum, so bitcoin does not have direct competitors.

The move, which was approved in February , will see the mining service invest up to $700 million and the creation of 150 jobs in the coming months.\nThe company remains unfazed by the slump in bitcoin prices, which has seen a drop of almost 50 percent this year, according to data from Coinmarketcap .\nIn correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine , Coinmint CTO Prieur Leary said, “Current bitcoin prices affect the value proposition. That being said, we are very comfortable with current metrics, given our technology and infrastructure.”\nCoinmint sees upstate New York as the perfect environment for them to set up shop. Operations have begun at the complex through Coinmint’s wholly owned subsidiary North Country Data Center Corporation, and the facility is expected to be at full capacity within 12 months.\nThe company believes this move will impact the crypto industry in a positive way. Leary went further by saying that “given the current concentration of digital currency data centers in Asia, launching the largest of such facilit[ies] in the U.S. makes a bold statement that the West is active within the industry and is a driver of growth and innovation within the space.”\nNew York is not known for being friendly to crypto companies or to miners, but as Steven O’Shaughnessy, Massena’s town supervisor, remarked in a local interview , “Our main marketing point is that we have cheap, reliable power.”\nMining is a power-hungry activity that has been getting a lot of attention lately.\nIn May, an expert panel met at a mining conference to discuss the implications of high energy consumption among miners worldwide, where they refuted the notion that energy devoted to proof-of-work operations is a wasteful by-product of cryptocurrency mining.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-largest-digital-currency-data-center-commences-operations-300659812.html", "http://www.wwnytv.com/story/37398396/bitcoin-miner-plans-to-locate-in-massena-employ-150", "https://www.coinmint.io/", "https://www.nypa.gov/-/media/nypa/documents/document-library/notices-and-agendas/trustees013018.pdf", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/first-bitcoin-mining-conference-hashes-over-high-cost-energy/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prieur leary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinmint cto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alcoa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massena", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T03:30:53.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2167b5c4a59435f4bb42f8d0267bcb04131dcc84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr40CmssZleNmT01NMKNDu._IR87FMEKjTQx1R_PMWGqcWjM5IxkU4FPHcLICDVWGSo72.RslqEU7sYO3nw.8VEJ.mHMTBSykvkCc3jkUiHFuQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin [BTC] and other altcoins’ hardware wallet partners with ShapeShift", "title_full": "Bitcoin [BTC] and other altcoins’ hardware wallet partners with ShapeShift", "published": "2018-06-07T22:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2167b5c4a59435f4bb42f8d0267bcb04131dcc84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr40CmssZleNmT01NMKNDu._IR87FMEKjTQx1R_PMWGqcWjM5IxkU4FPHcLICDVWGSo72.RslqEU7sYO3nw.8VEJ.mHMTBSykvkCc3jkUiHFuQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-06-07T22:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin [BTC] and other altcoins’ hardware wallet partners with ShapeShift", "text": "Bitcoin [BTC] and other altcoins’ hardware wallet partners with ShapeShift Jun 8, 2018\nThe XEEDA alliance with ShapeShift was announced on June 5th, 2018, with the hope of integrating ShapeShift onto XEEDA’s hardware wallet.

In the coming days, Hydro-Quebec will file an application to the province’s energy regulator proposing a selection process for blockchain industry projects.\nHydro-Quebec has been courting cryptocurrency miners in recent months in a bid to soak up surplus energy from dams in northern Quebec. Power rates in the province are the lowest in North America, both for consumers and industrial customers.\nRegie de l’energie, as the provincial regulator is called, will be instructed to reserve a block of energy for cryptocurrency miners and to set a specific rate for the industry while considering issues including peak winter demand. Quebec wants to make sure Hydro-Quebec can maximize revenue while ensuring economic benefits such as job creation.\n“The blockchain industry is a promising avenue for Hydro-Quebec,” Eric Filion, president of Hydro-Quebec Distribution, said in the statement. “Guidelines are nevertheless required to ensure that the development of this industry maximizes spinoffs for Quebec without resulting in rate increases for our customers. We are actively participating in the Regie de l’energie’s process so that these guidelines can be produced as quickly as possible.”\nStrong Demand Chief Executive Officer Eric Martel said in a February interview that the utility had received “hundreds of applications” from bitcoin miners in the previous weeks, which would need more than 9,000 megawatts of energy -- about one-quarter of the utility’s total generating capacity of 37,000 megawatts.\nBitcoin miners active in the province include Backbone Hosting Solutions Inc. ,\na Quebec-based company also known as Bitfarms that’s in the process of\nexpanding its operations locally.\n“We understand that Hydro-Quebec wants to welcome the most serious players in this emerging industry, and we definitely are part of that group,” Bitfarms\nPresident Pierre-Luc Quimper said in an e-mailed statement. “Other places in Canada offer rates that are as competitive, if not more competitive, than those of Hydro-Quebec.”\nCryptocurrency mining pales in comparison with other industries in terms of job creation, according to a February study prepared by KPMG for Hydro-Quebec.\nUnidentified projects submitted to Hydro-Quebec in recent months could create as few at 0.4 direct job per megawatt used, and as many as 1.2 jobs, KPMG said. Data centers, by contrast, create between 5 and 25 jobs per megawatt, KPMG said.\n— With assistance by Doug Alexander, and Sandrine Rastello\nLISTEN TO ARTICLE 2:42 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://news.hydroquebec.com/en/news/204/cryptocurrency-mines-limited-economic-impact/", "https://bloom.bg/dg-ws-core-bcom-a1", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2018-06-07%2Fquebec-halts-bitcoin-mining-power-requests-amid-booming-demand", "https://assets.bwbx.io/s3/readings/P9YVTK6JIJUO1528404338655.mp3", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Hydro-Quebec%20temporarily%20halts%20processing%20requests%20from%20cryptocurrency%20miners&via=technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2018-06-07%2Fquebec-halts-bitcoin-mining-power-requests-amid-booming-demand"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hydro-quebec", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T00:17:59.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39166104ad9cd0448480089bd2c4e355fde5594d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSWiUzmFrjV3PQtD46s9oo8S60xdqSOJYUohly62l.Ld_LVVBtkCbI3lk4NyKLlifWw--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Weekly Crypto-Centric Radio Show Launches, Joins Booming Bitcoin Podcast Market", "title_full": "Weekly Crypto-Centric Radio Show Launches, Joins Booming Bitcoin Podcast Market", "published": "2018-06-07T22:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39166104ad9cd0448480089bd2c4e355fde5594d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSWiUzmFrjV3PQtD46s9oo8S60xdqSOJYUohly62l.Ld_LVVBtkCbI3lk4NyKLlifWw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T22:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Weekly Crypto-Centric Radio Show Launches, Joins Booming Bitcoin Podcast Market", "text": "Weekly Crypto-Centric Radio Show Launches, Joins Booming Bitcoin Podcast Market\nSamantha Chang\nA weekly cryptocurrency-focused radio show called \"Cryptomania – Bitcoin and Beyond\" has just launched, joining a flourishing cottage industry of crypto-centric edutainment (education + entertainment).

Thriving Cottage Industry Of Crypto Content\nCryptomania bills itself as the first weekly FM radio show about cryptocurrencies in the United States but in reality, there’s already a popular twice-weekly FM radio show called The Crypto Show .\nThe Crypto Show, which launched in 2014, has interviewed a long list of prominent industry leaders, including Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, and John McAfee.\nThe Crypto Show airs on 89.1 FM TXLR in Austin, Texas, every Wednesday and Sunday night, and boasts an estimated audience of 20,000 listeners. (Pixabay)\nThe Crypto Show proudly declares its gangsta mission statement as “crypto-anarchism,” saying it hopes “to inspire the smartest 1% to create open-source, distributed systems of resistance to render the state irrelevant through technology and encryption.”\nWhile news of crypto-centric radio shows may come as a surprise to some, there has been a growing groundswell of similar podcasts and online radio programs during the past three years as bitcoin’s name recognition has soared amid skyrocketing media coverage.\nTake Bitcoin Talk Radio, which broadcasts nonstop 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with news about bitcoin, altcoins, blockchain, and other industry developments. Bitcoin Talk Radio, which launched in 2015, also broadcasts music and entertainment news. Bitcoin Has Entered the Zeitgeist\nThere’s also a teeming universe of popular cryptocurrency podcasts, such as “Invest Like the Best,” hosted by Patrick O’Shaughnessy, a portfolio manager at O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, and “Unchained and Unconfirmed,” hosted by former Forbes senior editor Laura Shin.\nAll this underscores that despite the naysaying of skeptics like Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller , digital currencies are slowly but surely carving out a niche for themselves as the ecosystem gears up for mainstream adoption.\nOther clues that cryptocurrency has entered the zeitgeist include the now-regular references to crypto on the hit Showtime TV series “Billions.” Ledger featured again in the latest episode of @SHO_Billions Bobby Axelrod is confirming his interests in crypto for large payouts!

The Top Cryptocurrency Stories for June 7, 2018 The business of stealing cryptocurrency remains extremely lucrative, and it's not going to be slowing down any time soon. According to cybersecurity firm Carbon Black, roughly $1.1 billion in crypto has been stolen during the first six months of 2018. A week after Venezuela announced plans to ban cryptocurrency-mining equipment, another nation is on the verge of taking a similar step. Vietnam's Ministry of Finance has issued a proposal that would curb mining across the country. The proposal comes in the wake of a massive, $660 million crypto fraud scheme that affected 32,000 investors. The government has said it is too \"difficult to regulate\" the cryptocurrency and payment industry, and it has chosen to tackle the mining process as a starting point. Bloomberg reports that controversial Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu is preparing what could be a massive initial public offering. Wu's company is a major player in the global cryptocurrency-mining industry. The firm controls up to 80% of the international market for application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining devices. Wu believes that his firm is worth roughly $12 billion, while other analysts have pegged the figure closer to $8.8 billion.
