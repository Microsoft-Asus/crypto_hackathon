Chanos said that in the event of a global crisis, it would be “better” to own food, or a government-backed ( fiat ) currency. Speaking to the Institute for New Economic Thinking and quoted by various media outlets, Chanos, who last year stated he “didn’t understand” Bitcoin or blockchain technology, issued stark warnings about cryptocurrency investment. “We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate,” he told Bloomberg. He also called the past year’s increased public interest in Bitcoin part of the “fraud cycle,” adding: “This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.” Chanos added that in the event of a global crisis, governments would step in with fiat currency as lenders of last resort, an option unavailable to cryptocurrency, given its decentralized nature: “For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. The last thing I’d want to own is Bitcoin if the grid goes down.” The well known short-seller, who predicted the fall of Enron, joins an ever-decreasing pool of steadfast Bitcoin naysayers. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who in December 2017 told Bloomberg Bitcoin “isn’t for him,” has since presided over a policy of increasing exposure to crypto assets.\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet and vice president Charlie Munger nonetheless remain committed to denouncing Bitcoin investment in increasingly grotesque language , with Munger most recently comparing crypto trading to dealing in “freshly harvested baby brains” last month.

This fosters a healthy competitive fee marketplace among miners, which will keep fees low for users and support BCH growth.\nEditor ' s Note :\nCoinGeek is the Calvin Ayre-owned media site and bitcoin mining firm, and nChain is the global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies. nChain's mining business is BMG Operations.\nSOURCE CoinGeek", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coingeek.com/coingeek-nchain-announce-miners-choice-initiative-bitcoin-cash-transaction-fees-values/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coingeek", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nchain group", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T19:25:46.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2ab9bc30939d2c28288a11567ed134079ff1fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcognPaAEqUkcF2Ru3D_dPaD.zdFNUPxMN9A8N7f58ScwotyAAIM5ylEI6Imb96_WeGPhlp9xwuB2ZuMe99wQIKRT", "site_full": "news.bitcoin-babe.com", "site": "bitcoin-babe.com", "site_section": "http://news.bitcoin-babe.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "title_full": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "published": "2018-06-05T20:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2ab9bc30939d2c28288a11567ed134079ff1fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcognPaAEqUkcF2Ru3D_dPaD.zdFNUPxMN9A8N7f58ScwotyAAIM5ylEI6Imb96_WeGPhlp9xwuB2ZuMe99wQIKRT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoinbabeau", "published": "2018-06-05T20:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "text": "\nJapanese IT giant GMO Internet has revealed specs and prices for its brand new from the ground-up bitcoin miners – the world’s first according to a 7nm chip. At a media conference, the business said Tuesday that his ASIC 7nm which will power the new B2 miner is designed in Japan, but fabricated in Taiwan. The coming of the 7-nm chip is remarkable as it ushers in more hashing power for bitcoin miners, while at the same time reducing power consumption, an essential aspect for miners in seeking yield on their investment. Based on a Bloomberg reporter that tweeted from the event, the B2 will provide a hash rate of 24TH/s, with power consumption at 1, 950W per unit – which breaks down in 81W per 1 TH/s.\nIn comparison, the current market leader – Bitmain’s Antminer S9 – provides 14TH/s in a power consumption of around 1, 300W. The B2 can provide market leading power, if GMO’s figures prove to be true, but it’ll come at a cost – $1, 999 to be accurate. That is compared with $837 for the Antminer S9. As if there is a doubt that GMO plans to knock Bitmain with his base, the company’s Chief executive officer Masatoshi Kumagai reportedly statedI respect Bitmain, but we’ll top them. As reported by CoinDesk, the B2 was shown on May 24, with GMP saying pre orders will begin on June 6 and shipments to follow in October.\nThe launch comes following several months long testing period, as the company initially revealed it was researching and developing the brand new mining chip in September 2017.

Tue 05 Jun 2018, 17:15:28 Businessman Raj Kundra was summoned and questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) here on Tuesday. Kundra is the husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. Kundra was questioned in connection with a Rs 2000-crore Bitcoin scam that ED is probing. His name reportedly cropped up when Amit Bharadwaj, an accused in the case, was being questioned. The Income Tax Department had recently sent notices to bitcoin users who were dealing in bitcoins worth Rs 1 crore or more daily. These names were also forwarded to ED and a probe into possible money laundering and fraud was initiated. It is learnt that many well-known names - especially those of Bollywood celebrities - may come up during investigations. While the nature of Kundra's questioning is not yet clear, he is not new to controversies and was previously embroiled in the infamous IPL betting scandal. He is serving a life ban from all cricket-related activities. In March, Kundra did file a petition in Supreme Court challenging the ban. Rajasthan Royals, a franchise he co-owns, was also banned for two years and made a comeback in the recently-concluded IPL season.

And with the second highest inflation rate in South America, behind Venezuela, the case for Bitcoin is becoming stronger.\nArgentina is a country rich with culture, natural beauty, and resources; however, especially in recent years, it has been plagued with economic struggles and populist policies which have left one in three of its capital citizens in poverty.\nSince 2001, Argentina has been largely shunned by international investors, but things finally began to look up when President Mauricio Macri took power in 2015. The country paid down some of its debts, even began selling 100-year yield bonds, and investors ate them up.\nNow, less than a year later, a strong U.S. dollar (USD), rising interest rates worldwide, and some questionable moves from the administration and central bank, have all contributed to Argentina once again turning to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout—a move which has received a lot of political backlash, as many Argentinians still blame the fund for the country’s economic downturn during the early 2000s.\nAs it stands, Argentina’s current economic troubles are likely to get worse before they get better. And with the second highest inflation rate in South America, behind Venezuela, the case for Bitcoin is becoming stronger.\nThe USD\nHistorically, Argentinians looked to the USD to maintain their wealth in the face of rising inflation, but a policy change initiated by ex-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner made it impossible for citizens to access USD, outside of the black market , in order to secure the central bank’s reserves of the currency. Under de Kirchner’s laws, capital flight from Argentina plummeted, though many citizens still went to great lengths to secure dollars: some even traveling to Uruguayan casinos, not to gamble, but to buy chips and convert them to USD . Related: The Stock Market Is Defying A Strong Jobs Report\nThough President Macri has eased up on these controls, the Argentine peso has plummeted since he took power.\nSource: Quartz\nWhile trying to defend the peso, the government may have incidentally accelerated its fall in early May, with a series of interest rate hikes that shattered international investors’ confidence in the currency.\nEdward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics noted : \"This crisis looks set to continue unless the government steps in to reassure investors that it will take more aggressive steps to fix Argentina's economic vulnerabilities.”\nNow, the country is looking to the IMF for $30 billion in relief—a move that will likely threaten President Macri’s political and fiscal agenda.\nCan Bitcoin help?\nBecause Bitcoin is a currency free from government manipulation and is globally transferable, it can offer citizens a hedge against instability and inflation: as it has in Venezuela . Nathaniel Popper stated:\nCitizens of countries such as Argentina, whose governments have a near perfect track record of debasing their own currency and destroying the savings of their citizenry, have shown signs of preferring bitcoin to their own state’s money.\nBitcoin penetration in Argentina is relatively low compared to other Latin American countries, though it is gaining speed. Recently, the central bank even eased regulations that prevented independent companies from installing cash machines, sparking an influx of new bitcoin ATMs in the country.\nAdditionally, in a world first, Argentina’s Banco Masventas ditched SWIFT, an international standard in money transfer, in favor of Bitcoin for cross-boarder transfers.\nThese moves, along with a wobbly regulatory landscape in neighboring Latin American countries have put the spotlight on Argentina for crypto-businesses in the region, with exchanges such as Buda.com expanding into the country.\nPablo Chávez, general manager of Buda.com, explained: “It is a relevant market not only for obvious reasons, such as its size, but also because it has a large community around cryptocurrencies…Argentina has the potential to become our most important market in the course of a year.”\nWith the Argentine peso continuing to slip, it’s clear to see why Bitcoin usage is accelerating. And because of its relaxed regulatory stance, it's a hopeful market for potential crypto-entrepreneurs. Related: Silver Stocks Continue To Struggle\nThough Argentina typically follows the United States and Europe in regard to policy changes, President Mauricio Macri campaigned on the promise of embracing tech, so there are no regulatory crackdowns in sight, at least for now.\nLessons to learn?\nWhile Argentina struggles to figure out its next move, another potential crisis is unfolding on the other side of the world. Italy, the Eurozone’s third largest economy, is also falling into a populist tailspin, threatening to pull the European Union down with it. And though the power of Bitcoin does not lie in its price, it did see a welcome (though short lived) rally, as Italy flooded global headlines.Just for the fun of it. Here's a graph comparing Bitcoin to the Euro since the beginning of April.\n(Click to enlarge)\nAs of late, safe-haven assets seem to be missing out on the geopolitical risk factor; yet, one can’t help but wonder how a decentralized, digital, and global currency might be able to change a world wrought with currency woes.\nBy Michael Kern via Crypto Insider\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-30/argentina-senate-poses-threat-to-macri-agenda-amid-imf-talks", "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-44001450", "https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/argentina/articles/is-there-still-a-black-market-in-argentina-a-brief-history-of-argentinas-economic-problems/", "https://cryptoinsider.21mil.com/bitcoin-help-venezuela-crisis/", "https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1017&context=international_immersion_program_papers", "https://qz.com/1274875/how-argentina-went-from-selling-100-year-bonds-to-an-imf-rescue-in-a-matter-of-months/", "http://bitcoinist.com/easing-regulations-bring-4000-new-bitcoin-atms-argentina/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006236250X"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael kern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mauricio macri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T07:02:34.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17d803e5777c845bf78713fe4bd8fd20549c57cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSWiVxMpVHIRxnSueB_tMK4B5lvwc9nFynID9MM.kznNcpPSeJhU.ERajlhCv3rY2qnutmedQBkFd", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "title_full": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "published": "2018-06-05T19:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "17d803e5777c845bf78713fe4bd8fd20549c57cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSWiVxMpVHIRxnSueB_tMK4B5lvwc9nFynID9MM.kznNcpPSeJhU.ERajlhCv3rY2qnutmedQBkFd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T19:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "text": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner\nDaniel Palmer\nJapanese IT giant GMO Internet has revealed prices and specs for its new-from-the-ground-up bitcoin miner – the world's first based on a 7nm chip.

According to a report in NDTV, officials said that the businessman was summoned by the ED officials and was asked questions related to his trade which they termed as \"illegal.\" Kundra was asked to record his statement as his name was linked to several instances in the case. A criminal case was filed against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. About 2000 crore funds belonging to 8000 investors were lost in this scheme, according to the reports. Midst this, Raj's spokesperson in a statement clarified that he was merely called as a witness and had no connection to the case whatsoever. \"This is to clarify that Raj Kundra has no involvement or connection to the Bitcoin scam whatsoever. He has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate merely as a witness.

I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that,\" he said.\nChanos expressed scepticism about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. Huge amounts of capital flowed into the sector last year, which peaked at over $800 billion in value in December.\nBitcoin's original enthusiasts were drawn to the fact that the cryptocurrency was independent of any nation state or central bank, making it theoretically immune from things like quantitative easing. They also argued that its independence made it a more viable long-term currency.\nChanos said: \"For those who believe it’s a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you’re going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it — for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!\"\nThe interviewer then suggested bitcoin is a \"libertarian fantasy,\" to which Chanos replied: \"That’s exactly what it is. And if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\"\nHe added: \"Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions.

Both digital assets saw a major increase in global trading volume compared to the month prior. BTC held steady, averaging $200 billion a month, but ripple didn’t fare so well, recording trading volume that was down 86% since January, mirroring its decline in price.\nAlso read: Decentralized Exchange Compendium ‘Index’ Lists Over 200 Dex Platforms\nBitcoin Cash Is May’s King of Coins There are various ways to measure a cryptocurrency that’s in demand, with trading volume the most useful indicator after price. A lot of bitcoin cash changed hands in May – 140% more than in the month prior in fact. Diar’s weekly update highlights the big winners and losers in the cryptocurrency market in May, and shows the substantial demand for BCH. In total, $30 billion of bitcoin cash changed hands in May. The next biggest gainer was ethereum, whose trade volume was up 50% on April, resulting in monthly trading volume of over $80 billion.\nMost major cryptocurrencies saw an increase in trading volume in May including litecoin, which had a modest increase. There was one notable loser however – ripple. XRP trading volume has been on the decline since January, back when $100 billion of tokens were traded in a month, pushing the price of XRP north of $3. Reality has since settled in, and May saw just $16 billion of ripple traded.\nFake Volume Rears Its Head When it comes to analyzing trading volume, one topic that often crops up concerns fake volume. Exchanges and their traders are frequently accused of creating orders that they have no intention of fulfilling, which creates a false impression of liquidity. If traders are doing so, it’s likely bot-based as a means of market manipulation in the pursuit of profit. If exchanges are responsible, it’s likely to make their platform look more popular than it is, and to benefit from the additional custom that comes from being a top ranked global exchange by volume.\nBinance is the latest exchange to have faced accusations of fake volume, with certain coins displaying unusually high volume for short periods of time, comprising fluctuations that appear outwith normal trading patterns. Given the hundreds of thousands of traders who can be using a platform such as Binance at one time, including countless bots connected via API, determining which orders are real, which are fake, and who’s responsible for any manipulation, is virtually impossible.\nDo you think fake volume is a problem on major exchanges?

What i'm saying is we also need to improve our understanding about cryptocurrency in order to use it. I know that it's complicated but as a human we should also upgrade just like what technologies do.\nIn regards \"why bitcoin didn't become popular as an online payment method\" Actually you're wrong bitcoin is now used as an online method and yes it's popular in the internet but the things is that some of the countries didn't allow their community to use cryptocurrency and some of the people are just lazy or didn't give any attention to learn in order to use the cryptocurrency as a mode of payment.\nActually people are very keen to be paid with bitcoin in every service. But the world government does not allow us to do that.\nBitcoins are actually being exploited by dark forces and we can not do much to overcome them. We can still pay by credit card, the function is not too different when paying by bitcoin.\nyes it is true our government has not been allowed to allow the baths though we can still have bitcoin and

This will makes it is possible for users to send as little as 1 Satoshi (one hundred millionth of a single Bitcoin Cash coin) via a BCH transaction. Any miner can accept a 1 Satoshi transaction amount, and it should be included in a valid block that all other miners will accept.\n(2) Accept some free (zero mining fee) transactions in each block they mine. CoinGeek and nChain believe that miners should be able to accept free transactions, rather than requiring users to pay a minimum of 1 Satoshi per byte. Their mining firms will each designate a number of free transactions they will accept in each mined block.\nFor the full techy download see full article.\nSignificantly, if miners choose to accept some transactions with zero mining fee, this further encourages more Bitcoin Cash transaction usage. If free transactions are possible, miners will have freedom to set more fee level ranges, from zero to small amounts. Users will have more choice about how much (if anything) they wish to pay for sending a BCH transaction, depending on the speed they want.

Its community members are controversially claiming that their cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash is the “real Bitcoin” . This is because the Bitcoin Cash community believes their blockchain operates much more closely to what Satoshi envisioned at Bitcoin’s advent.\nLow transaction fees, ‘on-chain’ scaling, a reliable payment network-this is what Bitcoin was supposed to do, but the Bitcoin Core developers strayed from these ideals, and Bitcoin Cash was born. Over the recent months, many projects have chosen the Bitcoin Cash technology to build their platform on.\nBlockpress is a social media application in its beta phase that works on the BCH blockchain and uses IPFS. The IPFS, just like Twitter, users can set an avatar, add their names and set cover photos. Each action costs a microtransaction of BCH.\nEach user has something like a ‘handle’. This is their BCH wallet address, and there is also a QR code, so one can send (BCH) to specific people.\nCoinText is yet another project that allows people to conduct transactions over their mobile phones without connection to the internet. This is aimed at bringing market opportunities to the many millions who don’t have bank accounts or can’t afford the internet. It is a software wallet that works on Android, Apple and Windows phones.\nThe CoinText service focuses on Bitcoin Cash . It promises instant transaction, sub-cent transaction fees, and on-chain settlements.\nHow Bitcoin Cash Beats Other Bitcoin Forks?\nBitcoin Cash Upcoming Hard Fork ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T20:22:38.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9101677688f053e610030fa798518efa7c912cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcaSlwpFQzXz4.KBVZrT9iU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "bitcoin worth it or not?", "title_full": "bitcoin worth it or not?", "published": "2018-06-05T19:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9101677688f053e610030fa798518efa7c912cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcaSlwpFQzXz4.KBVZrT9iU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "s2sallbygrace", "published": "2018-06-05T19:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin worth it or not?", "text": "Quote: from: mrado2 on January 03, 2018, 10:17:16 PM Hi guys!\niam kind of noob of this bitcoins and i have some questions i need to have answer on.\nis it worth to invest right now? do guys think its gonna rise up much more or just crash?\nshould i buy btc, or just mine it by my self?\nbest regards\nThe answer for that question would depend on a persons beliefs.

They are all funded by newly mined BTC, and fully funded to the face value of the coin. To differentiate these from the pre-fork Bitcoins (prior to August 2017), these new coins now have the backside tamper-evident hologram sticker in Orange color. Beneath the hologram sticker is the MINI-format private key, and also the QR code version of it. Each coin shows a unique serial number and address prefix, both visible from the window on the orange hologram sticker.\nWe will be auctioning off the first 25 serial number of each coin, from #1 to #25. (If interested, you can also bid on serial numbers #26 through #100.)\nThe 2018 V-Series One Bitcoin (similar to the 2016 One Bitcoin):\n- 43 mm size, made of Titanium\n- 3.25 mm thickness, weighing about 20 grams\n- Funding: 1.0 BTC\n- Serial number starts with  V \n- Starting bid: 1.20 BTC\n- Bidding increment: 0.01 BTC\n- Item name: V nn (replace  nn  with the serial number 01 to 25 )\nThe 2018 V-Series One Tenth Bitcoin (similar in size, to the 2016 Half Bitcoin):\n- 39 mm size, made of Titanium\n- 3.25 mm thickness, weighing about 16 grams\n- Funding: 0.1 BTC\n- Serial number starts with  W \n- Starting bid: 0.125 BTC\n- Bidding increment: 0.001 BTC\n- Item name: W nn (replace  nn  with the serial number 01 to 25 )\nWe will officially launch these two new coins on the BTCC Mint Store in the coming weeks. We expect these two coins to sell for an introductory price of around 1.08 BTC and 0.11 BTC , respectively. However, when you purchase on the BTCC Mint Store, you will NOT be able to specify or choose the serial numbers.\nRight now, you have your chance at getting the exact serial number you want, by bidding on this auction.

He called bitcoin a “libertarian fantasy” as so many of its supports hail its decentralized and anonymous nature as among its strengths in the currency market. And he said it’s wrong to believe cryptocurrencies would ever replace fiat currencies .

Its graphics user interface allows it to trade with counterparties electronically in a way that leaves a clear audit trail and records, rather than via phones or Skype. The development shows the company is seriously exploring the crypto market and is a sign that market is maturing. Cryptocurrencies are viewed by many of their evangelists as one of the most groundbreaking financial innovations of the modern age. But the way crypto trades looks like something out of an old-school Wall Street flick.\nFor the most part, trading firms are making multimillion-dollar crypto trades over the phone, not electronically. DRW's crypto arm, Cumberland, uses Skype calls to conduct its bitcoin dealmaking, Reuters reported .\nBut Jump Trading, the Chicago-based firm, has built a platform that will allow it to take the other side of large crypto trades electronically with its counterparties, according to people familiar with the matter. The so-called graphic user interface allows those counterparties to interact with Jump on a desktop. It does not allow users to connect to external trading exchanges.\nJump is known for its ultra-high-speed trading strategies, but it has also been developing what it calls a \" lower frequency trading strategy .\" It's also known for its discretion, with little information on the firm available on its website .\nAdvertisement The new platform shows that Jump is taking the new market for cryptocurrencies seriously, according to a person familiar with the firm's thinking. Also, the firm believes that voice and chatroom environments don't leave a clear audit trail, the person said.\nJump Capital, the venture-capital firm affiliated with Jump Trading, has made crypto a focus for 2018, as previously reported by Business Insider .\n\"GUIs are not unique,\" Michael Dunworth, the CEO of Wyre, a blockchain tech company, told Business Insider. \"But it is impressive that Jump built it.\"\nThe move shows the cryptocurrency market is maturing in a similar way to the now multitrillion-dollar foreign-exchange market, which in its earliest days saw trades conducted mostly over the phone, says John Spallanzani, a former FX trader at Sumitomo Mitsui who is now a portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners.\n\"We used to call 20 banks at once for spot FX prices,\" Spallanzani said of forex trading in the 1990s. Advertisement\n\"It's without a doubt maturing just by the fact that there's so many OTC desks out in the mix,\" Dunworth added.\nThe crypto exchange Kraken set up an OTC desk in New York, Business Insider first reported . There's also Genesis Global Trading and itBit, the OTC run by Paxos.\nAt the same time, crypto-focused investment funds are opening up at a record pace, according to new research by Crypto Fund Research. Sixty-one new funds have launched in 2018, according to the firm's research, bringing the total number above 366 globally. Such funds together manage only a paltry $5 billion, however, a fraction of the $3.2 trillion managed by the hedge fund industry.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-otc/otc-crypto-market-flourishes-powered-by-skype-idUSKCN1H91P4", "http://www.jumptrading.com/apply.html?gh_jid=564222", "http://www.jumptrading.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cumberland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T14:09:08.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "079c07a8ea7aa939afaeab92e9ab5103b962ae36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cLceqjGOI73263vEwZAFGRTqWkZ9ke5ibzsZ._dTngNzfnwKoyXeJ_LxKn1N96qoFTv25c_85Iynr7nqwUfIELuqMZCNNQ5kM9ZvhrKnqTsjJH0zGclGI2UKSmsd.Lzhhtx5Xc_skjWOH08YJJDrqP.8BmakqPOU-", "site_full": "www.navigantresearch.com", "site": "navigantresearch.com", "site_section": "http://www.navigantresearch.com", "site_categories": ["business", "green_solutions"], "section_title": "Blog – Navigant Research", "title": "The Dynamics of Bitcoin Mining and Energy Consumption, Part I: A Problem in the Here and Now", "title_full": "The Dynamics of Bitcoin Mining and Energy Consumption, Part I: A Problem in the Here and Now", "published": "2018-06-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "079c07a8ea7aa939afaeab92e9ab5103b962ae36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cLceqjGOI73263vEwZAFGRTqWkZ9ke5ibzsZ._dTngNzfnwKoyXeJ_LxKn1N96qoFTv25c_85Iynr7nqwUfIELuqMZCNNQ5kM9ZvhrKnqTsjJH0zGclGI2UKSmsd.Lzhhtx5Xc_skjWOH08YJJDrqP.8BmakqPOU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Johnathon de Villier", "published": "2018-06-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Dynamics of Bitcoin Mining and Energy Consumption, Part I: A Problem in the Here and Now", "text": "\nI’ve written quite a bit about use cases for blockchain, the technology that supports applications like Bitcoin, outside the world of digital currencies. I have spent much less time diving into the impacts of digital currencies themselves. This is because the most exciting and potentially transformative applications for blockchain in the energy world have little to do with them, or with the proof of work consensus algorithm.\nThe downside of taking a future-focused view, however, is that it tends to gloss over the real challenges faced by utilities and other energy stakeholders today. The rapid rise in the valuation of proof of work-based digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has created a new, power-hungry digital mining industry that utilities have to confront.\nDigital Currency Farms Require Huge Amounts of Power Take the example of this bitcoin farm in inner Mongolia, which demands 40 MW of electricity per hour and, at the time Digiconomist’s article was written, earns the equivalent of $250,000 per day in bitcoin. At $0.09 per kWh, that’s about $86,000 per day in electricity costs. Even after taking hardware, maintenance, oversight, and facilities costs into account, the farm is turning a substantial profit, and a percentage goes back to the power provider. This farm is one of many around the world that collectively accounts for 65 TWh of electricity consumption annually.\nAt first glance, this might not seem like a bad deal for power providers. If the deal is structured properly, they get a cut of a profitable and fast-growing business, provided they can support the miner’s power needs. That’s likely why the Chinese government offered them a rate discount as an incentive for setting up shop.\nBut mining farms aren’t a typical client. The value of digital currencies like bitcoin in real money is highly volatile, which makes continued profits uncertain in the future—and that has serious implications for utilities that are considering developing new capacity to account for a surge of new facilities like the one in Mongolia. If the bubble bursts and mining becomes unsustainable, these farms could disappear as quickly as they sprang up.\nA Rock and a Hard Place Utilities with decades-long planning horizons revolving around rate cases should want little to do with an industry that thrives on short-term volatility, and whose loads could be here today and gone tomorrow. But in the short term, the energy consumption associated with proof of work gives them little choice. Worse yet, not all mining companies bother to speak with utilities directly. Some simply truck in their equipment, plug in, and get to work. They’ve been blamed for rate spikes and other problems in distribution networks around the country.\nExamining the Cost of Digital Currencies Over the next several weeks, look for my blog series on energy consumption associated with bitcoin and other digital currencies and its impacts on utilities and energy systems. The series will build off of work by others in this area—notably the folks over at Digiconomist and the recent paper (no paywall) published by Alex de Vries in the peer-reviewed journal Joule earlier this May.\nMy intent is to add a systems-level perspective to the conversation that will help build an understanding of the main drivers of mining activity, how it might change in the future, and what utilities can do to make the best of a bad situation that many analysts expect to get worse. The second part of this series will look at the situation from the miner’s perspective, exploring why farms like the one in Mongolia arise, what determines where those facilities pop up, and what causes them to move or shut down.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "digiconomist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dynamics of bitcoin mining and energy consumption", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital currency farms", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mongolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T19:20:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "823843773e5357a794b89529014cd4588535a37e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfONdkbMuiRJz5rHV4hLmrZsqKJMwb_ZHxM97vuccqbq09jkTII5MkJ.69TSaCBQk00f8z89S_39_uzENJIcGAZwM-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Increasing privacy on Bitcoin Cash: Private sweep", "title_full": "Increasing privacy on Bitcoin Cash: Private sweep : btc", "published": "2018-06-05T18:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "823843773e5357a794b89529014cd4588535a37e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfONdkbMuiRJz5rHV4hLmrZsqKJMwb_ZHxM97vuccqbq09jkTII5MkJ.69TSaCBQk00f8z89S_39_uzENJIcGAZwM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CatatonicAdenosine", "published": "2018-06-05T18:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Increasing privacy on Bitcoin Cash: Private sweep", "text": "I've recently been thinking about ways to increase privacy on Bitcoin Cash, and I think there's more that can be done to mitigate the loss of privacy in situations where users are encouraged to combine UTXOs. One such situation is sweeping an HD wallet.\nBackground: We know that using an HD wallet and avoiding address reuse massively increases your privacy on the blockchain, because no one knows which of these multiple addresses belongs to whom. Even if exchanges provide a means for matching addresses to users, after enough transactions it becomes difficult to know with any reasonable degree of certainty who owns what. However, this privacy is undermined the moment HD wallets combine UTXOs in a single transaction. From this point on everybody can see that these coins belonged to the same wallet, and via blockchain analysis, can fairly easily uncover this wallet's transaction history.\nProblem: We can mostly avoid compromising privacy in this way by not combining UTXOs until new methods (like cashshuffle) make it possible to do so without compromising privacy. However, combining UTXOs is also almost unavoidable when one changes wallets. For example, a user has just purchased a hardware wallet to safely store the bitcoins that have been piling up on their bitcoin.com mobile wallet. But if they sweep the bitcoin.com wallet using electron-cash then all of their UTXOs will be linked in the blockchain. Of course, this is just one scenario and there are many others, like concern that private keys have leaked etc. etc.\nSolution: More advanced SPV wallet like electron-cash already have the functionality to send to multiple addresses, to spend a particular address, and even to use multiple change addresses to further obfuscate. Perhaps it would be possible for these wallets to introduce a \"private sweep\" function that would: (1) generate two new addresses for each UTXO, (2) assign these addresses a random, unequal split of the UTXO, (3) sweep all addresses from the old wallet to the addresses in the new wallet. Under blockchain analysis, I believe such a sweep would be indistinguishable from regular transactions.\nThoughts?\n submitted by /u/CatatonicAdenosine\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T14:34:36.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "360d6453cbb2b4462f53998d0d1bf984b7372ec6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_Lin8Qh2qniyHH0QNNT7u8sc-", "site_full": "www.instaforex.com", "site": "instaforex.com", "site_section": "http://news.instaforex.com/en/analytics/rss/?x=BAED", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex analysis review", "title": "BITCOIN Analysis for June 5, 2018", "title_full": "BITCOIN Analysis for June 5, 2018", "published": "2018-06-05T18:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "360d6453cbb2b4462f53998d0d1bf984b7372ec6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_Lin8Qh2qniyHH0QNNT7u8sc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T18:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN Analysis for June 5, 2018", "text": "05.06.2018 17:58 BITCOIN Analysis for June 5, 2018\nBitcoin has been quite bearish with the gains today as expected which was quite slower today in comparison to yesterday's daily close.

However, at the start of this trading week the situation changed drastically. The bitcoin quotes are trading slightly above $7,400 per coin, failing to rise above $8,000. According to 99Bitcoins, a website that keeps record on crashes of the most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin has already died 300 times. This time, the cryptocurrency was killed by the information about unreasonably huge energy consumption by miners. Meanwhile, the crytocurrency with the second biggest capitalization is also trading under pressure, hovering near the level of $590 despite some good news.\nParticularly, coinbase cryptocurrency exchange announced plans to open an office in Japan, signing a deal on cooperation with the Japanese financial services agency. On the other hand, ripple is gaining solid ground. its quotes reached as high as $0.6587. This cryptocurrency surged after the ripple platform granted about 50 million dollars to 17 universitiies all over the world to spread information about the blockchain technology. Besides, it aims to promote academic research of the cryptocurrencies and digital payments. However, analysts think that the market participants are still skeptical about the cryptocurrency market, so the virtual money is likely to remain under the bearish pressure.\n© Prabhu for Forex Videos , 2018. | Permalink | No comment | Add to del.icio.us\nPost tags: Bitcoin , Cryptocurrency , news , ripple\nFeed enhanced by Better Feed from Ozh ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T18:46:23.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "71b413a22bfc0c90a77be52f198406bd6e8ba2a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSaOvCSlfpb5kngahhvxykFktV8_wxjrSiV04S8PBPnmasnD4D4LAAK91_kwvCgN5jGzjmIHORf4ZKbRmnILcofcjvXZq3tf3vffO5U_lBnmjgiRysUjRG5SLQxD_09rcSqA.9y8qq5ZtI0lEWfdAGd", "site_full": "www.scotsman.com", "site": "scotsman.com", "site_section": "https://www.scotsman.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Scotsman - Scottish News", "title": "Should I invest in bitcoin or has the bubble burst?", "title_full": "Should I invest in bitcoin or has the bubble burst? - The Scotsman", "published": "2018-06-05T18:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.074, "main_image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4749918.1528214465!/image/image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "71b413a22bfc0c90a77be52f198406bd6e8ba2a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSaOvCSlfpb5kngahhvxykFktV8_wxjrSiV04S8PBPnmasnD4D4LAAK91_kwvCgN5jGzjmIHORf4ZKbRmnILcofcjvXZq3tf3vffO5U_lBnmjgiRysUjRG5SLQxD_09rcSqA.9y8qq5ZtI0lEWfdAGd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chris McCall", "published": "2018-06-05T18:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should I invest in bitcoin or has the bubble burst?", "text": "Heroes Should I invest in bitcoin or has the bubble burst? A customer uses a 'modest comission' Bitcoin vending machine in a CeX store in Glasgow. Picture: John Devlin Updated: 17:14 Tuesday 05 June 2018 Share this article Sign Up To Our Daily Newsletter Sign up Have your say\nThe value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate wildly but the blockchain technology they utilise is here to stay, writes Chris McCall\nFollowing the fluctuating value of crytpocurrencies like bitcoin can be like watching a rollercoaster. There are a lot of ups and downs, but many of those strapped in for the ride seem to be enjoying themselves. The value of bitcoin rose sharply during late 2017, but has since dropped. Picture: John Devlin\nThe digital currency, launched in 2009, long ago moved beyond the online cryptography community and into the business mainstream.\nWhile it now makes the pages of the Financial Times, it’s not lost its ability to baffle those unfamiliar with the terminologies involved, while even dedicated followers of the financial technologies (FinTech) sector retain a degree of scepticism.\nThat’s in part because unlike other tradable commodities, like gold or oil, bitcoin is not a physical product. The lack of a centralised regulator can also be off-putting to new investors, as does the quasi-anonymous status of users.\nNone of that matters to those who have already cashed in. They point to the ability to send and receive money anywhere in the world, very low transaction fees, and value the high degree of privacy.\nThen there was the bitcoin goldrush of late 2017.\nThe value fluctuated wildly from day to day and sometimes hour by hour. One bitcoin in April 2013 could be bought for £20 - in January 2018 it was worth more than £13,000. Today, it’s worth a little more than £5,500.\nThat price rise and subsequent crash have led to a steady stream of comment pieces in the financial and technology press asking if bitcoin has peaked and interest in cryptocurrencies is in decline.\nThe number of people searching for bitcoin online both in Britain and worldwide has fallen sharply since the start of the year, the This is Money website found.\nSearches for the digital currency reached their summit in the week starting 17 December 2017, which is exactly when the price peaked at nearly $20,000 a coin.\nREAD MORE: Insight: The Scots investors in the Bitcoin boom\nBut David Low, co-owner of Scotcoin, argues cryptocurrencies are going no where and the value of the blockchain technology they utilise is only going to increase.\n“I don’t believe bitcoin is a bubble or that it will die,” he told The Scotsman. “The genie is out of the bottle. Anyone who thinks they can cap it is following the King Canute business school of thought.\n“The underlying technology, blockchain, is revolutionary and is here to stay. Crytocurrencies are no less than the first asset class to use blockchains and many other applications will follow.\n“I take the view that as soon as the crypto-markets are large enough - or disruptive enough - governments and regulators will step in and tax it. That’s the direction it’s heading. They won’t kill it - but they will treat it as a revenue source.”\nScotcoin is one of around 1,000 cryptocurrencies currently trading online. It is in the process of constructing its own blockchain – the un-hackable software and public ledger of online transactions.\n“Bitcoin is the dollar, or the reserve currency, of crpto-land,” said Low. “I view it more as an alternative invesment, akin to gold. I don’t ever perceive bitcoin being used on any grand scale for the exchange of goods and services. It is too big, too expensive to operate, the transaction costs are too much. You can’t pay £20 for a £5 cup of coffee, and then wait 30 minutes for the transaction to process. I think other tokens and currencies will emerge to fulfil that role.”\nLow added that as cyrptocurrency remains a relatively new asset class, “one still in its kindergarden phase” it was impossible to predict when it would become much more mainstream.\nSo is now a good time to invest? “Anyone interested should speak to an appropriately qualified person for advice,” said Low.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john devlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris mccall", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "financial times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T19:59:14.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a318a18b789e32c8b8b53c443f7688cb60b089d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSAmHNliXJPjATxWqhbRo60-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=9.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Off-topic", "title": "MAKE ALL YOUR BITCOIN TALK BOUNTY POSTS ON THIS THREAD", "title_full": "MAKE ALL YOUR BITCOIN TALK BOUNTY POSTS ON THIS THREAD", "published": "2018-06-05T18:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a318a18b789e32c8b8b53c443f7688cb60b089d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSAmHNliXJPjATxWqhbRo60-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "naomi56", "published": "2018-06-05T18:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "MAKE ALL YOUR BITCOIN TALK BOUNTY POSTS ON THIS THREAD", "text": "Eternal Trust's objective is to become the central hub that stores the dreams of humankind.

Notably, all through 2001, Chanos was a short seller of Enron and increased his short position as more information on Enron was revealed. Subsequently, Kynikos Associates made a profit.\nJim says that fiat is preferable to cryptocurrencies in event of a crisis because the government can enforce the use of fiat and can act as lenders as a last resort. There are many policies that a government can employ to prevent or combat a recession, like cutting interest rates, increasing government spending or devaluation on an exchange.\nUnfortunately for cryptocurrencies, due to their decentralized nature, such measures are not possible to keep its value from plummeting in case of a crisis. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s price has been rising, sometimes sensationally jumping in value. This led people into believing that the value of Bitcoin will continue to stay near the stratosphere, but holding this belief may be catastrophic.\nJim says:\n“For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. “\nShort selling is a practice where the short seller borrows a number of shares from an institution/company, immediately sells them, then waits for the price of the share to go down.

XRP is the digital token that financial institutions on the network can use to transact quickly. The currency and the company were founded by the same people.\nXRP is traded on cryotocurrency exchanges and one is currently worth 65 cents. Garlinghouse, who emphasized that Ripple is independent of the XRP token, said bitcoin will have a role in the future, but not one that will see it solve major problems, such as becoming a global currency.\n\"I think it's (bitcoin) not going to be the panacea that people once thought it would be, where it would solve all of these different kind of problems... Instead, you're seeing specializations of different kind of ledgers, different kinds of blockchains,\" Garlinghouse told CNBC at the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\nHe explained that the bitcoin blockchain, the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency, is \"quite slow,\" whereas XRP transactions are \"a thousand times faster.\"\nThe average transaction time for bitcoin was 42 minutes as of Tuesday, according to data tracked by Blockchain.info . XRP has a transaction time of four seconds, according to Ripple's website.\nWhile many see XRP as a rival to bitcoin, Garlinghouse said it's not necessarily a case of one digital coin versus another.\n\"Well, I don't really think about it as one versus the other. I mean, it's actually unfortunate, I think, that there's some people in this, the crypto space, the blockchain space — for them, it's almost a holy war of one versus the other. I don't look at that at all.\"\n\"I think that what we're seeing is the overall growth of this space and there will be many winners,\" he added.\nBitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In another recent interview with CNBC , Garlinghouse said that cryptocurrency prices are influenced by bitcoin, but that could soon change as people realize the differences between different digital coins.\nLawsuit claims 'outrageous' Elsewhere, Ripple has been hit with a class action lawsuit by a person who allegedly lost money buying and selling XRP. Ryan Coffey claims that Ripple violated U.S. securities law.\nIn 2013, Ripple Labs created 100 billion of the XRP coins in existence. Ripple owns about 60 percent of those 100 billion XRP, some of which are owned by the blockchain's founders. The lawsuit alleges that the founders \"earned massive profits by quietly selling off this XRP to the general public, in what is essentially a never-ending initial coin offering (ICO).\"\nAn ICO is a way for a company to issue a new digital token in exchange for money in order to raise funds. Garlinghouse called the lawsuit \"outrageous.\"\n\"Here's somebody who held XRP for, I think, two weeks... and is making some claims,\" he said.\n\"Whether or not XRP is a security is not going to be dictated by one lawsuit... I think it's very clear that XRP is not a security, it does exist independently of Ripple the company. If Ripple the company is shut down tomorrow the XRP ecosystem would continue to exist. It's an independent, open-sourced technology.\n\"From an ownership point of view, owning XRP doesn't give you any ownership of Ripple equity. And also, as we just talked about, XRP has a lot of utility, so to me it's quite different than what a security you know looks like and I think ultimately we'll find that conclusion.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time?daysAverageString=7", "https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time?daysAverageString=7&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco-based", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T15:21:13.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64fe8db2fa5435c892b53c8bc145c746ac0eaed2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuDoSvsdcMkA6SsS2X42BDstoCW6rqNpuZCHfhanutGNwp9liCdsoLDR2oFQaEQfaxOXXCBiwnarIyYS9k3QXGTTli4iiDbUbo1BY7xuFCwS7bq73F5WDWUlw4LFQbskwZvMFD5u32ahY-", "site_full": "www.benzinga.com", "site": "benzinga.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.benzinga.com/benzinga", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Benzinga - Stock Market Quotes, Business News, Financial News, Trading Ideas, and Stock Research by Professionals", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum & Ripple Price Prediction: Technical Contradictions, Price Action To Dictate Decision-making", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum & Ripple Price Prediction: Technical Contradictions, Price Action To Dictate Decision-making", "published": "2018-06-05T18:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23263, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64fe8db2fa5435c892b53c8bc145c746ac0eaed2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuDoSvsdcMkA6SsS2X42BDstoCW6rqNpuZCHfhanutGNwp9liCdsoLDR2oFQaEQfaxOXXCBiwnarIyYS9k3QXGTTli4iiDbUbo1BY7xuFCwS7bq73F5WDWUlw4LFQbskwZvMFD5u32ahY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tomas Salles", "published": "2018-06-05T18:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum & Ripple Price Prediction: Technical Contradictions, Price Action To Dictate Decision-making", "text": "June 05, 2018 11:37am Comments Share:\nThis article originally appeared on FXStreet . Bearish action across the Crypto board might extend until the weekend Technical scenarios have been developing sticking to expectations, taking prices back to targeted supports\nThe falls seen yesterday in the Cryptocurrency markets didn't catch us by surprise. First targets were reached but didn't hold as the bullish leg run out of gas, necessary making way for a consolidation phase.\nLower price levels are not out of the cards, but it is not the most probable scenario. The moving averages location, just above the price level in the 4-hour charts, favor a bearish lateral scenario, with a possible increase of volatility as the day advances.\nBTC/USD 4H chart\nBitcoin reached the primary target at $7400 during the early Asian trading session, right where BTC/USD has stopped its run. Bitcoin has left a Doji after a mid-sized candlestick, so we could see a turning formation during the American session.\nOn the upside, the first target is at the 50-EMA, located now at the $7550 mark, followed then by the 100-SMA at the $7650 level. Breaching that level would be very bullish for BTC/USD, although it is not the most likely scenario. Further above, there is another price resistance level at $7870 that would leave Bitcoin at the doors of a technically important trendline at $7950.\nOn the bearish side, the first support is at the current price ($7400), with a possible extension down to $7359. If that level is lost, Bitcoin would fall straight down to the more accelerated trendline that is located at the $7230 level.\nMACD in the Bitcoin 4-hour chart is still showing some room to cover on the bearish side, particularly if we consider that it is trading on the positive side of the indicator, losing some strength. Potential bearish lateral moves look quite likely with an increase of volatility, which could lead to a change of direction.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart is showing buyers in retreat since the $7700 level was reached. Sellers, on the other hand, have been increasing their positions as the price action started weakening, but have quieted in the last hours, not showing much confidence in more falls.\nETH/USD 4H chart\nEthereum fell down yesterday to $580 just before bouncing to the price congestion support at $587. However, the 50-EMA at the $590 mark was lost and has been barely recovered at the time of writing this article.\nETH/USD is stuck in a tight falling wedge, barely in a $70 range, where the 50-EMA, the 100-SMA and two significant price levels ($587 and $565) meet.\nGiven the current scenario, every level is important, with the most important one to track on the upside being the 100-SMA located at the $602 mark and the falling wedge superior trendline at $605. If those levels are broken to the upside, Ethereum would enter a much more positive scenario that would quickly take the $620 mark back.\nOn the bearish side, the first support is on the 50-EMA at $590, which would take the price back to the inferior trendline located at $570. If that level is lost, ETH/USD would enter a scenario open to new falls, with the first support being very close to the $567 mark. That would be the last stop before very important falls that would target $520.\nMACD in the Ethereum 4-hour chart shows how the bearish movement is losing steam and both the mid-line and the signal one are flattening quickly, proposing a bullish cross attempt. This is a very premature try and will probably fail. We should still consider this as lateral with a neutral profile.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart is gifting us another setup favorable for confusion. Buyers and sellers are close to being even, with a profile that proposes an increase on the buyers' side. Technical setups such as this one usually allow confusing movements that might result in a contrarian outcome. The outlook is lateral with bullish potential, but we should wait and see.\nXRP/USD 4H chart\nRipple is trading inside a wide-open technical scenario, but with multiple resistances and supports complicating any development. The indicators are set up quite differently than the other two assets analyzed.\nOn the upside, the first resistance is located at $0.66, immediately followed by the trendline located at $0.67 that protects the doors to a net bullish territory. We can find another price congestion resistance at $0.679, which strengthens the wall behind the bulls paradise.\nOn the downside, the first support is at the 50-EMA ($0.635), followed by a price congestion support at $0.63. If that level was lost, the bearish target would clearly be at $0.60.\nMACD in the Ripple 4-hour chart shows a similar profile than the Ethereum one, although a bit more advanced. This is an optimal profile for a bullish cross, but also for a bull trap. We recommend to wait to confirm the breakout and latter consolidation before taking any positions.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart still gives some edge to the buyers, that might take back the ADX line. If that happens, it would be a very strong bullish signal. Sellers have increased a lot during the last dip, but are losing some strength today, not showing much confidence to more falls. © 2018 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

He echoed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who recently said that he believes bitcoin will become the single currency worldwide. \"I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,\" Wozniak told CNBC on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 conference in Amsterdam. The tech guru who bought bitcoin when the single coin cost around $700 said recently that he was not interested in turning a profit and was instead focused on the blockchain technology behind bitcoin. Wozniak explained that he used blockchain to make secure payments while travelling abroad. \"Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there's a way it's distributed... and it's pure and there's no human running, there's no company running and it's just... growing and growing... and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions,\" said Wozniak, who also owns two ether crypto coins. He announced recently that he has sold all but one bitcoin. The world's top digital currency was trading at $7,454 on Tuesday. Currently, there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, but Wozniak says that bitcoin is the only one that remains \"pure\" because others have had to give up some of the aspects that makes bitcoin what it is. \"Only bitcoin is pure digital gold... and I totally buy into that.

The ED will summon these Bollywood stars soon. Raj Kundra was summoned at the ED office here and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government. There are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating, ED officials said. Kundra’s name turned up in the report following alleged links with Bitcoin scamster Amit Bhardwaj. According to media reports, Bhardwaj had started the country’s first online marketplace which accepted bitcoins and had also started bitcoin mining start-ups. He reportedly lured in investors with promises of hefty returns, assuring the investors of access to the bitcoin mining system that would let them mine their own bitcoins. Kundra had allegedly promoted one of Bhardwaj’s operations. During the questioning, it was revealed that Shilpa Shetty, Huma Qureshi and Nargis Fakhri promoted Bharadwaj’s company in Dubai and Singapore. Sunny Leone, Zareen Khan, Prachi Desai, Karishma Tanna and some other actresses met people running Bitcoin in Dubai and invited people to invest in it.

I often look to our bellwethers, Bitcoin(BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD), as signals for the larger crypto market. I wanted to see $7085 hold in bitcoin and $495 in Ethereum. On May 28, bitcoin hit $7075, a nominal break and ethereum $505. So far, those levels have held, and we appear to have set up bullishly. As long as they do, we have a very bullish setup - the five-wave pattern off the April lows, which suggests this wave ii we believe bottomed that proceeds a larger third wave rally. Below are six-hour charts that show the expected extent of the coming rally, if these levels hold. See the charts provided in this article in an expandable format. Now, let's take a look at the 15-minute chart again for an update. Unfortunately, ethereum, while it started in a 5 wave move off the lows, it did not hold key support for an impulsive third wave. So, as of Monday morning I am tracking the pattern as a diagonal, with the expectation that we have another high over Sunday nights high at $628. If we break down below $538, the probability is well see the May 28 low give way. Bitcoin did not get as far as ethereum did before dropping Sunday night, so it may be called a 1-2,i-ii, where ii is the second wave in a minor third wave. It is immediately bullish as long as $7375 holds. Note the green line on the charts. This is a key level on both, where we retrace .618 of the drop from the May highs. If impulsive over those levels, $8720 in bitcoin and $685 in ethereum, we'll have the strongest confirmation we can have without a direct breakout. I currently consider sentiment to be very doubtful to apathetic. The apathetic holder feels shocked that theyve seen such a drawdown but feels trapped and certainly doesnt have the money to buy more. The doubtful holder believes bitcoin is in a large-scale correction and will remain in it for many months. One trader I follow called for a 1.5-year correction. Some analysts I watch are calling for bitcoin to go below $5000. While I can see that price level possible, I cannot see it as probable at this time. Granted, if the key levels Im watching and call out above, actually break, I will look down. And, those levels are quite tight to price here, so we have an early warning. It seems, anecdotally, that we have sentiment conditions ripe for a larger rally to begin. But price must prove. Conclusion In short, so far price has held over the bottoms struck on May 28.

That’s compared with $837 for the Antminer S9.\nAs if there was any doubt that GMO plans to knock Bitmain of its pedestal, the firm’s CEO Masatoshi Kumagai reportedly stated: \"I respect Bitmain, but we will top them\"\nAs reported by CoinDesk, the B2 wasrevealed on May 24, with GMP saying pre-orders will start on June 6 and shipments to follow in October.\nThe launch comes following a months-long testing period since the firm initially revealed it was researching and developing the new mining processor in September 2017.\nGMO B2 miner image via Yuji Nakamura/Twitter\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .
