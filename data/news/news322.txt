Cohn believes that world will have global cryptocurrency in future but it will not be a Bitcoin. Cohn told on CNBC on May 8th Squawk interview.\nThe future will have simpler global cryptocurrency\nIn an interview with Squawk on the Street, the former president of Goldman Sachs, Gray Cohn said,\nI'm not a big believer in bitcoin. I am a believer in blockchain technology. I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it's not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that.\nEven after a rapid growth in bitcoin there are several issues like it price volatility, high transaction volumes. Accordingly, the Cohns believes that global cryptocurrency in the future will be simplest and easier to understand compared to Bitcoin.\nHe said,\nIt will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how its created, how it moves and how people can use it.\nFurthermore, he thinks that the global cryptocurrency in the future will not be on mining costs or electricity cost. However, Bitcoin mining is completely depending on miners system to solves hashes in return to get rewards via PoW protocol. In last October, bitcoin mining required 56 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day at an expense of $6.7 million.\nOn the note, Cohn was asked about the Goldman Sachs recent reports like it is offering Bitcoin contracts and aiming to open a trading desk. He replied, Goldman Sachs must consider only the best interests of their shareholders. Later on, he also mentioned saying that he owns no share in Goldman Sachs.\nAdditionally, he said about his March departure from the Trump administration, that he was considering running a regulated bank, but in digitized world.\nI do have an idea for a company. It would be an interesting concept playing on the knowledge I know from the banking world.\nSimultaneously, bitcoin price is floating towards the mark of $10,000, still many believes and hopes that bitcoin will hit the heights.\nAlso Read here: Goldman Sachs Predicts a Global Cryptocurrency Other Than Bitcoin\nDo you think there will be other global cryptocurrency in the future?

Where are the best places to shop with bitcoin?\nWell, as it turns out, quite a few places accept bitcoin now. Here we have picked out some of our favorite bitcoin-friendly shopping places. The Best Places to Shop with Bitcoin Overstock\nOverstock.com will take your bitcoin , and you can even get a good deal as you shop. One of the first major retailers to accept bitcoin, it has been doing so since January 2014. Overstock offers a wide variety of items to purchase, including fashion, electronics, and products for your home.\nChecking out with bitcoin couldn’t be easier, just select the cryptocurrency of your choice. Everything will be converted on the fly to bitcoin, making it easy to track and use your preference. Newegg\nDid someone say gadget shopping? Newegg will take your bitcoin, and give you back some shiny new toys in the process. Just note that some merchants that sell through the Newegg website may not accept cryptocurrency. But as long as you stick with Newegg itself, you can buy happiness (or a new gadget, however you want to phrase it.) Shopify\nThe 75,000 plus merchants on Shopify have the option to accept bitcoin. Shopify has been accepting cryptocurrency since November 2013, so it is one of the more established retailer platforms supporting it.\nThe shopping experience is similar to Etsy or eBay, so there is no telling what kind of treasures you may discover.\nIf you like searching for a good deal using those sites and you have a little bitcoin burning a hole in your digital pocket, don’t hesitate to check out Shopify. PizzaForCoins\nA girl can’t live on shopping alone (although I am willing to try.) When shopping has zapped your strength, and you need some fuel to get back at it, go grab a nice slice or two at PizzaForCoins.\nPizzaForCoins acts like your cryptocurrency middleman. They take your bitcoin and then hand off the order to a local pizza joint. No waiting is involved, so you can eat now and shop more very soon. It’s like eating your bitcoin, only tastier. eGifter\nOf course, you don’t want to be greedy when doing this bitcoin shopping spree. So make a visit out to eGifter and use your digital money to buy some gift cards for those you love, admire, and/or just want to buy off.\neGifter is also a convenient way to use bitcoin at places that currently don’t accept it. You’ll find many different gift cards available here for purchase, everything from Home Depot to Amazon.\nOn second thought, maybe a gift card would work best as a personal gift to yourself. You have to treat yourself sometimes, you know. Expedia\nMaybe you want to forgo all the shopping and take a trip instead. Expedia allows you to pay for hotel bookings using bitcoins, and they have since June 2014.\nSo, let’s spend some bitcoin and hit the cryptocurrency beach, as Mark Dukas Charlotte might say. Don’t worry, there will be shopping places there too when you get tired of soaking up the sun.\nMany other places accept bitcoin as a form of payment, but these are just a few of my favorite best places to shop with bitcoin. Cryptocurrency traders like Mark Dukas have known about the flexibility of bitcoin for a while now.\nFor me, as long as I can shop, eat, and travel, well, let’s just say I will be happy to accept any bitcoin you see fit to give me. I am just agreeable like that, I guess.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinreviews.io/mark-dukas-cryptocurrency-consultant-with-bitcoin-smart-money/", "https://www.egifter.com/giftcards/", "https://angel.co/btcsmartmoney", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donna chaffins", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "overstock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "overstock overstock.com", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T13:00:35.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0feadf600095e1327c6b0afcbb13e5c2274b4272", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRFOIXZXSNcVMgUuph8tO02yZ6CNGcQb7NrRBzA91Zy_dCR80spfZ0Ce0ouSUZZlwQ4I15NzBwo6iItqRJ_lUEc5lmq14ycxc.iCUPCDa1jhBsP_EiwxYjeGzrtlPvP_4M-", "site_full": "elartedepilotearunnavio.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://elartedepilotearunnavio.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "El blog de Carlos Garcia", "title": "Bitcoin y Wall street https://t.co/k1qCLtxKgQ", "title_full": "Bitcoin y Wall street https://t.co/k1qCLtxKgQ", "published": "2018-05-09T14:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0feadf600095e1327c6b0afcbb13e5c2274b4272", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRFOIXZXSNcVMgUuph8tO02yZ6CNGcQb7NrRBzA91Zy_dCR80spfZ0Ce0ouSUZZlwQ4I15NzBwo6iItqRJ_lUEc5lmq14ycxc.iCUPCDa1jhBsP_EiwxYjeGzrtlPvP_4M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carlos Garcia (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-09T14:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin y Wall street https://t.co/k1qCLtxKgQ", "text": "Bitcoin y Wall street https://t.co/k1qCLtxKgQ\n— Carlos Garcia (@charlygarcia120) May 9, 2018\nUna nueva entrada en mi blog personal\nFecha de Creacion May 09, 2018 at 06:35AM\nvia enlaces de manizales , enlaces de colombia\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carlos garcia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T16:45:42.054+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03c602b57958f6e1a28e2a315cdbfd71865d2638", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmToC.lvhh7wpPNZ2zTgH_qA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Are Crazier, Speculative Things Says Bill Gates", "title_full": "Bitcoin Are Crazier, Speculative Things Says Bill Gates", "published": "2018-05-09T14:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.614, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03c602b57958f6e1a28e2a315cdbfd71865d2638", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmToC.lvhh7wpPNZ2zTgH_qA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "coinpediaJordan", "published": "2018-05-09T14:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Are Crazier, Speculative Things Says Bill Gates", "text": "Bill Gates, Microsoft founder comments about bitcoin on May 7th.

по-прежнему с оптимизмом смотрит на перспективы роста цены биткоина в мае.\nНа следующей неделе, с 14 по 17 мая в Нью-Йорке будет проходить ежегодная конференция по криптовалютам Consensus  и Том Ли уверен, что эта конференция подтолкнёт биткоин к росту,  сообщает Bloomberg.\nКурс биткоина традиционно повышается во время данного мероприятия. И залогом роста цены в этом году служит относительно невысокая цена первой криптовалюты,  считает Ли.\nКонференция Consensus проводится уже четвертый год. Ожидается, что на этот раз она привлечет около 7000 сторонников цифровой валюты или почти в три раза больше, чем в прошлом году. Том Ли написал в заметке клиентам, что в предыдущие годы это событие совпадало с ростом цены биткоина от 10 до 70 процентов.\nВ прошлом году, в день старта конференции Consensus-2017, стоимость биткоина подскочила на 69%, а в течение следующих двух месяцев выросла на 138%. «Мы готовимся к тому, что в этом году рост на фоне Consensus превзойдёт показатели последних лет»,  написал Том Ли в обращении к клиентам.\nЕсли анализ Ли в предыдущие годы подтвердится и на этот раз, можно будет увидеть, что биткоин вернется к 15000 долларов. Возможно криптовалюта снова достигнет максимальных значений.\n«Мы рассчитываем на то, что BTC и криптовалюты будут вести себя так же, как и в предыдущие годы, и поднимутся во время Consensus»,  подводит итог Том Ли.\nОднако Ли признал, что нет полной уверенности в том, что криптовалюта достигнет таких огромных успехов. Он привел вопросы регулирования как потенциально ограничивающие повышение цены после конференции.\nРанее создатель Ethereum Виталик Бутерин и некоторые другие деятели криптовалютной отрасли призвали бойкотировать конференцию Consensus, проводящуюся порталом CoinDesk, с редакционной политикой которого они не согласны.\nИсточник: https://www.fxteam.ru/finance/186565.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxteam.ru/finance/186565.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:33:10.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e880d5788eba6b36231eeebfc3508b22c2dba01f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSW0tlBzK8.YLzDLlQ8wkkrSOUeGAMIjPKZLZfGGvNUvzfy.h3BxkWxWdVPiUzk05iaIAVwlCZWkEmBVhpj3fVF", "site_full": "tradingstrategyguides.com", "site": "tradingstrategyguides.com", "site_section": "http://www.winnersedgetrading.com/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Trading Strategy Guides", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Trading Strategy – Heikin Ashi Technique", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gold Trading Strategy – Heikin Ashi Technique", "published": "2018-05-09T12:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e880d5788eba6b36231eeebfc3508b22c2dba01f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSW0tlBzK8.YLzDLlQ8wkkrSOUeGAMIjPKZLZfGGvNUvzfy.h3BxkWxWdVPiUzk05iaIAVwlCZWkEmBVhpj3fVF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TradingStrategyguides", "published": "2018-05-09T12:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Trading Strategy – Heikin Ashi Technique", "text": "by TradingStrategyguides | May 9, 2018 | All Strategies | 0 comments Bitcoin Gold Trading Strategy – Heikin Ashi Technique\nOur trading community is composed of long-time crypto enthusiasts, and in today’s article, we want to bring to your attention the Bitcoin Gold trading strategy that uses the Heikin-Ashi technique to forecast the Bitcoin Gold price.\nOur team at Trading Strategy Guides is working hard to put together the most comprehensive PDF guide to different cryptocurrency strategies. We encourage you to explore other alternative coins, and the new Bitcoin of China Tron TRX coin can attract your attention because it’s one of the most popular coins on social media these days.\nThe Heikin-Ashi technique is simply another form of looking at charts that traders can use to spot trading opportunities. This new revolutionary way to look at charts can be applied to any time frames. So, no matter of our trading style (daytrading, swing trading, trend following) you can implement this trading method into your trading cryptocurrency strategy.\nYou can put to use the Heikin-Ashi charts to many markets even though they initially were designed for commodities and stock market price; it has the same kind of success on Forex currency pairs as well as on cryptocurrencies.\nLet’s first start to try and understand what is Bitcoin Gold , how Bitcoin Gold works and why it’s important to HODL Bitcoin Gold in your cryptocurrency portfolio. What is Bitcoin Gold?\nBitcoin Gold is another version of Bitcoin , and it’s an electronic currency. BTG can be considered the newest hard fork from Bitcoin blockchain and the only difference between the two is the way you can mine Bitcoin Gold.\nSo, Bitcoin Gold BTG will use a type of proof of work called Equihash, which is similar to what Ethereum uses. We don’t really need to understand, but it’s good to reinforce the reasons why Bitcoin Gold has potential.\nBTG was launched on October 25 th , 2017 so it’s a relatively new coin currently being the 23 th most valuable cryptocurrency.\nThe primary goal of BTG is to decentralize Bitcoin completely and to give the opportunity to everyone to become a miner with only basic hardware requirements.\nIn a nutshell, we hope this gives you clear answers on what is Bitcoin Gold and what it stands for.\nNext, we’re going to discuss what technical tools we need to make money trading cryptocurrency strategy.\nThe only tool we need to trade Bitcoin Gold is the Heikin-Ashi charts. The Heikin – Ashi Charts\nHeikin – Ashi in Japanese means average bar and are a type of candlesticks different than the typical Japanese candlesticks that you encounter when learning how to trade. However, we’ve found that the Heikin – Ashi candlesticks are much more accurate in helping us determine Bitcoin Gold price movements.\nHere is a typical Bitcoin Gold chart:\nAnd, here is the Heikin – Ashi Bitcoin Gold chart:\nAs we can see, there is a notable difference between the two types of charts and that’s because the Heikin – Ashi candlesticks use some complicated mathematical formula to determine the OHLC prices.\nThe good news is that you don’t have to be a genius to trade our Bitcoin Gold trading strategy.\nNow, the way the Heikin – Ashi candlesticks can help us to buy Bitcoin Gold is straightforward.\nThere are two primary trade signals that we can identify through the Heikin Ashi candlestick: Bullish candlesticks with no wicks or very small wicks indicate a strong uptrend and good buying Bitcoin Gold opportunities. Small candlestick characterized by a small body and big upper and lower wicks signal a potential reversal.\nNote* The same rule can be applied in reverse for Heikin Ashi bearish candlesticks.\nThe special formula behind the Heikin Ashi candlesticks makes the Bitcoin Gold trend clearly visible, eliminating all the extra noise.\n the Bitcoin Gold trading strategy . For this demonstration, we’re going to look at the buy side. Bitcoin Gold Trading Strategy\nIn this trading cryptocurrency strategy, we look at a high-low breakout strategy .\nOur team at Trading Strategy Guides has developed one of the best breakout trading strategies because it can tell you straight away when you’re wrong which means that you can minimize losses.\nStep #1: Identify three consecutive bullish candles that have no lower wicks.\nAfter you switch to the Heikin Ashi candlestick chart on your trading platform, the first step is to identify three consecutive bullish candles.\nIt’s mandatory that all the three Heikin Ashi candlesticks have NO lower wicks.\nRemember that bullish candlesticks with no wicks indicate a strong uptrend and further increase in Bitcoin Gold price.\nWe also have to make sure that these three consecutive candlesticks are placed at the right location.\nThis brings us to the second rule of our Bitcoin Gold trading strategy:\nStep #2: Before the three consecutive bullish candles we need to have no more than 5 consecutive bearish candles\nLocation, location, location is the key word and a fundamental concept if you want to improve your trading instantly.\nSo, prior to the three bullish candles spotted earlier, we need the location of this pattern to be located in such a way that behind it we can’t count more than five consecutive bearish candles.\nThe first chart below illustrates this Bitcoin Gold trade setup:\nIdentifying trends and opportunities to buy Bitcoin Gold are much easier now that we have a trade setup with a good location.\nThe Bitcoin Gold coin satisfies both of our trading conditions which mean that we can move forward and outline what the trigger condition for our entry strategy.\nSee below:\nStep #3: Buy at the market at the opening of the next 4 th candle\nWhen to buy Bitcoin Gold is very easy to understand.\nTo initiate a position, wait for the opening of the 4 th candle after the three consecutive bullish candles.\nIn the figure below, you can see the long Bitcoin Gold example:\nPreferably, after you spotted the three candle trade setup, you need to get ready to pull the trigger.\nThe next important thing we need to establish when trading cryptocurrency strategy is where to place our protective stop loss.\nSee below …\nStep #4: Place protective Stop Loss below the most recent swing low\nThere is a very obvious predictability in our approach to the stop loss strategy.\nWe hide our protective stop loss few pips below the most recent swing low. Alternatively, you can place your stop loss below the three candlestick pattern, but you risk to be taken out prematurely when we’re in a trading range.\nSo, you need to adapt your stop loss strategy to the current market conditions.\nLast but not least, we also need to define where we take profit when trading Bitcoin Gold.\nSee below …\nStep #5: Take Profit equals 2 x risk or 3 x risk\nDepending on how strong the Bitcoin Gold trend is, you want your take profit target to be two or three times more than your stop loss. This is a simple exit strategy that potentially can reward you with a positive risk to reward ratio .\nFor take profits, you can also cash out at regular trading intervals partial profits.\n BUY trade using the Bitcoin Gold cryptocurrency trading SELL trade – but in reverse. SELL trade example. Conclusion – Trading Cryptocurrency Strategy\nOur favorite Bitcoin Gold trading strategy is really useful for making the BTG trend more readable, and buying Bitcoin Gold can be spotted at a glance. If you believe in the decentralized blockchain environment, then Bitcoin Gold coin seems a steal at the current market price.\nThe more you use the Heikin Ashi chart, the better you’ll get at trading BTG coin.\n what is Bitcoin Gold!

I am a believer in blockchain technology I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it's not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that.\"\nHe further said that the new digital coin will be a more easily understood and simpler coin than the current major cryptocurrency.\nCohn added, \"It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it's created, how it moves and how people can use it.\"\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created by solving complex mathematical problems in a process known as mining, which requires highly powerful computers and consumes enormous electricity. The owners of the computers involved in mining will be rewarded with new digital tokens or coins.\nThe process creates excess energy, raising concerns of environmental impact, with people around the world trying to find new ways to tackle the issue.\nAbout Goldman, Cohn said the bank should do what it think's in the best interests of shareholders.\nGoldman Sachs was one of the few major financial firms to clear Bitcoin futures offered by Cboe Global Markets Inc. and CME Group Inc. when it was launched in December. Meanwhile, Goldman CEO Blankfein, in a November interview with CNBC, had said that maybe bitcoin is a kind of bubble, and that he was not comfortable with it.\nThe New York Times reported recently that the investment banking major is planning to establish a bitcoin trading operation. The bank reportedly made its first crypto-specific appointment recently with Justin Schmidt, a former cryptocurrency trader, as the first head of digital asset markets in securities division, aiming to explore options to create a bitcoin trading desk.\nby RTTNews Staff Writer", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gary coh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T08:08:07.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c27bd76787f3b47bfc70a9f6ccdf4add05d2aae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWmuapji9ssBXsmSWzHDNSg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=219.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Philippines", "title": "LoadCentral.ph - buy eload and epin using Bitcoin", "title_full": "LoadCentral.ph - buy eload and epin using Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-09T12:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c27bd76787f3b47bfc70a9f6ccdf4add05d2aae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWmuapji9ssBXsmSWzHDNSg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LoadCentralPH", "published": "2018-05-09T12:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "LoadCentral.ph - buy eload and epin using Bitcoin", "text": "Hello everyone,\nI'd like to invite you to try our loading service at https://loadcentral.ph/ .

A client of the bank was denied an incoming transfer of $195 000 from a European bitcoin trading venue into his joint account.\nThe bank claimed that there was a reasonable basis for concern that the sale of bitcoin was linked to money laundering and financing of terror, this despite the existence of documents indicating the exact source of the funds used for the purchase in this case and enabling ability to track the money from beginning to end. In addition, the transaction was duly reported by the client to the Israel Tax Authority. None of this was sufficient to convince the bank, which insisted on its refusal.\nOn May 6 the two sides faced each other in court and the bank folded. During a hearing before judge Limor Bibi regarding a request for temporary injunction, it became clear that there is no real suspicion of violations of AML laws or of taxation offenses, and the bank agreed that the funds would be deposited in the client’s account immediately. For his part, the trader agreed to sign an IRS W8 form proclaiming he has no linkage to the USA.\nDoron, Tikotzky, Kantor, Gutman & Amit Gross, the law firm which represented the plaintiffs, said about the outcome of the case:\n«This is an important precedent that obliges the banking system as a whole to reconsider its policy regarding funds originating in virtual currency transactions, while conducting a real and relevant examination of each ad hoc transaction, rather than automatically denying each transaction without examining it on its merits».

Canaan has not publicly disclosed its plans for the IPO, which reportedly seeks to raise a billion dollars.\nThe listing would be the second attempt at the Hong Kong market for Canaan, which tried in 2016 to list an IPO on China’s yuan-denominated A-share market. That deal was scuttled by regulators, who scoffed at the company’s planned valuation. Canaan also tried to a listing on China’s “New Third Board” market in 2017, but again had it stopped by regulators. Canaan Creative is based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.

The weakness was relatively short-lived however and the price was immediately brought back above $9000, but the move will not have done much for a jittery contingent of bulls who are desperate to call the end of the bear trend that has halved the value of Bitcoin from its highs near $20,000. Technical analysis suggests tough times ahead for Bitcoin\nThe value of Bitcoin can often be hard to figure out fundamentally. For this reason, technical analysis is the most prevalent way of trading crypto markets. Omkar Godbole, a prominent technical analyst at Coindesk released his view on Bitcoin on Tuesday, outlining his belief the price is set to move further into $8000,\n“Bitcoin dropped to four-day lows below $9,200 on Monday and now looks set to explore levels below the $9,000 mark, the technical charts indicate.”\nThe recent weakness has formed a key reversal indicator, and Mr. Godbole believes that the failure of the price action to render this formation redundant continues to point to a move lower,\n“Yesterday's downwards move meant the cryptocurrency closed below the 10-day moving average (MA) - signaling short-term bullish invalidation - having failed to beat the key inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance over the weekend.”\nThe losses are quite significant from the recent highs, and Mr.Godbole believes that the next day of trading could be quite bumpy for bulls who are now closer to breaching support than they are overhead resistance,\n“As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,357… down 6.3 percent from the recent high of $9,990. Worryingly for the bulls, the price chart analysis indicates the losses could be extended further over the next 24 hours.”\nThere are some important developments being made in the 2nd largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, with a new method of governance being trialed. Until the correlation with Bitcoin movements stops, however, ETH will probably continue to trade like a more risk-sensitive BTC alternative.\nA stronger Dollar has had an odd relationship with Bitcoin, and it would appear that the rise in the USD Index has also helped lift BTC, but it is an imperfect correlation and one that bears watching closely in the coming weeks.

This move will indicate that there is the second giant on Wall Street in the last week, which is interested in opening the platform for trading cryptocurrencies.\nThis news appeared a few days after the publication quoted by Goldman Sachs, which seemed to confirm that the bank will debut on the futures market on Bitcoin in a few weeks. ICE talked to other financial institutions about the start of a new operation through which banks will be able to buy contracts. If the move continues, ICE and Goldman will join an ever-larger piece of traditional financing involving cryptocurrencies. Another new player is now NASDAQ, which announced that it will be open to setting up a trading platform for cryptocurrencies in the future.\nThis news further contrasts with the conflicting prospects of major investors that are currently on the front page of newspapers - for example, Berkshire Hathaway's CEO -Warren Buffett - who compared Bitcoin to rat poison this week. The increasing interest of the US exchanges in traidng Bitcoin is very good news for all cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders as it will likely increase the market capitalisation and general market liquidity. Moreover, it means the financial elites are much more aware of the fact, that the cryptocurrency market is now too large to be ignored.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market is still developing the corrective decline to the downside and currently is testing the short-term trendline support around the level of $8,989. The slide down might be just the first part of the corrective cycle (wave (a)), so there are at least three waves needed to complete the cycle. In a case of a further downside extension, the next technical support is seen at the level of $8,777 and $8,608.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york nyse exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T02:00:30.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a7d7a9d602d8fd72fd7af10d6d41684a88b39c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Rec8ynsrZtlRbEi_CySh3LN7gySpicR_yKgUberTjXWeqOH7oAD6jez7_3FXQ3M3cCJ_PIu1F4Sw_9mWVnE.YyChRkqTX4S7Kly59H503ZQ1qC3pmRNY0DDYn7JdLRaeVYLuB__Twu2MZyjaINA17CLOWob659W77yuGC8v8PdkSzK8YqFv7lB", "site_full": "alzibluk.com", "site": "alzibluk.com", "site_section": "http://alzibluk.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Al Zibluk:  Just Keeping It Real", "title": "Bitcoin price analysis -BTC/USD gets badly beaten, poking at $9,000 – Gary Cohn believes in crypto, but not in Bitcoin", "title_full": "Bitcoin price analysis -BTC/USD gets badly beaten, poking at $9,000 – Gary Cohn believes in crypto, but not in Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-09T08:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a7d7a9d602d8fd72fd7af10d6d41684a88b39c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Rec8ynsrZtlRbEi_CySh3LN7gySpicR_yKgUberTjXWeqOH7oAD6jez7_3FXQ3M3cCJ_PIu1F4Sw_9mWVnE.YyChRkqTX4S7Kly59H503ZQ1qC3pmRNY0DDYn7JdLRaeVYLuB__Twu2MZyjaINA17CLOWob659W77yuGC8v8PdkSzK8YqFv7lB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Zibluk", "published": "2018-05-09T08:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price analysis -BTC/USD gets badly beaten, poking at $9,000 – Gary Cohn believes in crypto, but not in Bitcoin", "text": "Bitcoin price analysis -BTC/USD gets badly beaten, poking at $9,000 – Gary Cohn believes in crypto, but not in Bitcoin\nBTC/USD broke below local support levels with no obvious triggers.\nformer president of Goldman Sachs Gary Cohn supports the idea of global cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin lost over 8% in just three days, crashing from $10,000 to below $9,000. BTC/USD is trading at $9,017, after a short dip to $8,960. The coin is 3% lower than 24 hours before. BTC has moved into a dangerous support zone as a sustainable movement below $9,000 threshold will trigger selling orders and push the coin deeper into the bearish territory. The downside may be partially explained by US Dollar growth on international markets.\nMeanwhile, former president of Goldman Sachs Gary Cohn said that the world will have a cryptocurrency after all, but it won't be Bitcoin. He believes that we will end up with something easier and more user-friendly.\n\"I'm not a big believer in bitcoin. I am a believer in blockchain technology,\" Cohn explained in the interview with CNBC. \"I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it's not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that,\" he added.\nBitcoin technical picture\nThe hourly chart shows that BTC/USD is trading below both 200 and 50-SMAs that are located at $9,276 and $9,383 respectively. They are likely to limit the upside on approach to $9,400. Once it is broken, the upside may be extended towards $9,584 (100-SMA). On the downside the vital support comes at $9,000. This psychological level coincides with 50% Fibo retracement of the downside movement from $1,1567 to $6,483.

If you don’t understand it, you get much more excited,” Buffett said on CNBC television. “People like to speculate, they like to gamble.” Charlie Munger, Buffett’s longtime business partner and a Berkshire vice chairman, described bitcoin as “worthless artificial gold.” He likened it to Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting, calling it “the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.” Buffett said investors would instead be much better off investing in US stocks, which in turn are also a far better investment than 10- or 30-year US government bonds.Buffett said stock prices are elevated but not in a bubble.He said he would much rather have Berkshire’s pile of cash and equivalents be $30 billion, rather than the $108.6 billion it was at the end of March, but good deals have not emerged.Buffett revealed last week having bought about 75 million additional Apple Inc shares in the first quarter, despite already owning about 165.3 million.Agencies", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar wilde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T05:19:03.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd7a6fc896fdbc3cc3bc8468e258d7fe220e3219", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTlPbnd1vp4t31s.xwy3FYM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Is bitcoin worth investing?", "title_full": "Is bitcoin worth investing?", "published": "2018-05-09T03:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd7a6fc896fdbc3cc3bc8468e258d7fe220e3219", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTlPbnd1vp4t31s.xwy3FYM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GameMarket", "published": "2018-05-09T03:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is bitcoin worth investing?", "text": "Bitcoin has it's own values compared to other fiat currency.

I have been following this project since phase 1 and have bought enough tokens to keep my interest. lol I believe crypto is the future of fiat currency. But governments will not let that happen, until there is a solution that lets them regulate it. If we know anything about governments is that they like to run our lives, and are full of buerocrates. That being said. I believe, if this coin works with governments it has unlimited potential, and the potential to uniting the word under one currency.\nIf it does go to $.50 I am with Victor, and will buy my fill and those coins will not see the light of day until ABTC replaces most of crypto currency.\nI am also overwhelmed with all these good news. I hope that aml and governments can get along as I also believe in the unlimited potential they can reach.\nTotally agree Peter, things are getting pumped in here.

You either believe in crypto now while you’re still trying to figure it out, or you don’t – and will have to wait and see if this all succeeds – at which point you will have to believe in it.\nWhy am I pro-crypto? Because I understand it. If you don’t understand it, then it behoves you to go and read up about this remarkable technology, before slamming it with a preconceived opinion – because (besides countless other reasons) one day, pretty much everything you do will be based on blockchain technology. A good start is the work by Andreas Antonopoulos, like this video here . What is Bitcoin really worth?\nBut for today, I want to take a look at the value of Bitcoin. How much is it really worth? Is it really worth the crazy $9300 it currently costs to get your hands on one? And if it is so valuable, why?\nLet’s try and get a brief overview of its value in this article, and perhaps build on it in future pieces. In this particular article, we shall use only one of its strengths that give Bitcoin its inherent value: scarcity .\nThere are a number of other strengths, like its open source platform, its support of over 10,000 computer nodes distributed around the world to give it powerful decentralization, its thousands of devoted computer programmers working on its code not answering to a single authority – only the community. The list of strengths could go on. For today though, we’ll use the crash of December 2017 to looks at its scarcity, and why that alone gives Bitcoin significant value. What happened in December 2017?\nIt was an amazing month for Bitcoin. Records were broken every single day. Starting on the 24th of November, until the 9th of December, Bitcoin’s price reached a new all-time high on a daily basis. With two ever-so-slight pullbacks and much to the amazement of even the longest Bitcoin hodler* , the price charged onwards to its all-time high of $19,850** on the 17th of December.\nBitcoin’s price climbed $14,089 in the space of 24 days, marking a 244% profit for lucky investors. And let’s be honest, “luck” is the right word – because it didn’t matter how much you believed in the fundamentals of Bitcoin, no-one could have predicted a parabolic increase of 244% in only 24 days.\nAnd then… POP!\nJust like that the party was over. After briefly hitting its all-time high of $19,850 on 17 December, the profit-takers took their chance, sparking a worldwide sell-off. In 6 days the price capitulated to $11,065 on the 22nd of December – losing $8,785, or 44%, of its value. Not the Christmas present uncle John was hoping for after investing in Bitcoin for the first time the week before.\nMany analysts thought the carnage was over. Surely it couldn’t retrace all the way back down, could it? It could.\nFor the next 46 days, ending on the 6th of February 2018, Bitcoin continued to plummet back to its mid-November price of $5,970. A full retraction and the bubble had certainly popped. And what a bubble it was! A full quarter (three months) of 244% gains, and 70% losses. Euphoria to despair in less than a single trimester of pregnancy. What went wrong?\nIt was never sustainable.\nIt doesn’t matter what you think about digital assets and their incredibly bright future, a commodity with that much volume cannot sustain a 24-day 244% parabolic increase.\nBut as the dust has settled since the great 2018 capitulation and the get-rich-quickers have long fled the scene with their tails between their legs, what do we have left? What remains among the ashes of despair and people’s dashed dreams? We have exactly what we started with: The first-ever global economy belonging entirely to the people.\nSure, most of us love to see the value of our Blockfolio *** hit those all-time highs and 100% gains. But that is a distraction from what we are really seeing: The world’s economy beginning to unravel at the hands of the people. We are still in the very early stages, and there are decades of development to come, but one day banks will be as foreign as gramophones and card merchants as obsolete as snail-mail.\nBut let me not get distracted into the philosophy behind Bitcoin and what it could do to society. This article was meant to be a fundamental exploration of what Bitcoin’s value could be. What Bitcoin’s value can be\nWith our memories refreshed of the great 2018 sell-off and our portfolios desecrated, what is the potential of our rekt **** portfolios? Using a bit of theoretic analysis to explore the potential of Bitcoin, we will simply consider some numbers in a few basic steps. There are currently 3.2 billion people on Earth with internet access, out of 7.6 billion. That leaves still 4.4 billion yet to come online in coming years (even if these were all children, which they’re not, they would still have to grow up and come online). There over 160 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, contributing to a global daily volume of approximately $30 billion! Bitcoin ($BTC) is the primary currency pairing on 90% of these exchanges (a select few like Etherdelta use Ether ($ETH) – but most people use their $BTC to convert to $ETH before using exchanges like Etherdelta). With Bitcoin being the primary means through which people get into the cryptoassets markets on almost 160 exchanges, and then looking at how many people are online (and yet to come online) it is not a stretch to estimate that 1 billion people will want Bitcoin in the next 5 years. Now if you divide 1 billion people by the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin (still 14 years away from being fully mined, anyway!), that leaves 47 people per $BTC. (This isn’t even taking into account the large wallets who have hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin – thus making that supply even lower). Now imagine 47 people standing around an ounce of Gold, bidding to own it. Can you imagine what that ounce of Gold would sell for? What we have here in our calculation is 47 people essentially bidding for one Bitcoin (assuming all 21 million were actually available)! If we divide this the other way, it works out to 0.02BTC per person. How much do you think a Bitcoin would be worth if there was only 0.02BTC available per user? And so?\nThe point of the exercise is not a mathematical one to come to a specific price conclusion, but rather to indicate the value of a Bitcoin in an economy of very high demand and limited supply. And based on these (in many ways conservative) estimates, it’s not hard to see that Bitcoin has a very, very bright future indeed. When you consider that this exercise is only based upon consumer use, and doesn’t even take into consideration the billions of dollars already streaming into cryptoassets by the behemoth financial institutions, it becomes even clearer just how bright that future actually is.\nWhat’s the bottom line? Get your 0.02BTC before the masses get here.\nGlossary of terms\n*hodler – Purposefully misspelt slang for “hold” in the Bitcoin community.\n** The all-time high of Bitcoin at time of writing was approximately $19,850 – depending on which exchange one uses for data analysis. This article was comprised using data from Bittrex.\n***Blockfolio is an app that allows you to track the latest prices of your cryptocurrency portfolio.\n****rekt – more Bitcoin community slang for a wrecked portfolio – all the prices of the assets you own falling dramatically to lose immense amounts of value.\nImportant: SA Crypto is not a registered financial advisory, and the information provided in this article is for entertainment purposes only.

However, he doesn’t seem to believe that the latter will be bitcoin.’ ‘Not a big believer in bitcoin’\nIn an interview for CNBC on Tuesday, Gary Cohn said that he believes there will be a global cryptocurrency. He also shared that he’s not a Bitcoin believer but he does favor its underlying technology.\nHe said:\nI’m not a big believer in bitcoin. I am a believer in blockchain technology. […] I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it’s not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that. ‘It Will Probably Have Some Blockchain Technology’\nExplaining his vision for the future global cryptocurrency, Cohn adds profound arguments of the kind:\nIt will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency […] It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it’s created, how it moves and how people can use it.\nIs Bitcoin that complex, though? Bitcoin successfully eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries–like Goldman Sachs–and makes long-distance transfers cheaper and more secure.\nOf course, it has run into a lot of issues along the way. Bitcoin mining truly is very energy-intensive, it has problems with handling high volumes of transactions and it has become slower as such. It’s also true that there are currently existing alternatives which perform better in certain aspects.\nHowever, ignoring the facts that Bitcoin is the first of its kind and that it has been field tested for almost a decade, proving its usability and performance capabilities in the process, is just inappropriate. What is more, Cohn’s old firm seems to have quite a lot of faith in Bitcoin itself. Goldman Sachs Recognizing Bitcoin’s Impact\nEarlier this month, Rana Yared, an executive at Cohn’s ex-firm, said that Bitcoin “is not a fraud”. What is more, she also seems to have revealed the bank’s intentions to offer Bitcoin trading. In a definitive statement, she noted:\nIt resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value.\nFurthermore, responding to significant client interest, the bank has already hired crypto trader who will help the company expand into the markets for digital assets. The news came as no surprise, though, as the minimum trading sizes for Bitcoin , as well as other cryptocurrencies, had doubled up.\nIt’s obvious that Cohn’s ex-employer is deviating from the position of the former president, to which he responded briefly:\nThey should do what they think’s in the best interests of their shareholders.\nDo you think Bitcoin has what it takes to become a global cryptocurrency?

This week’s major bearish trend line with resistance at $1,580 was broken on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair also moved above the $1,600 resistance level, which is a positive sign in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is back in a positive zone above $1,600 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD must settle above $1,675 and the 100 hourly simple moving average to gain momentum. Bitcoin Cash Price Support After further declines , bitcoin cash price was able to find support near the $1,460 level against the US Dollar. The price traded as low as $1,463 and later started an upside move. It traded higher and broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,702 high to $1,463 low. It opened the doors for more gains and the price traded above a few important hurdles such as $1,550 and $1,600. More importantly, this week’s major bearish trend line with resistance at $1,580 was broken on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair also moved above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,702 high to $1,463 low. These all are positive signs since the price is now well above the $1,600 level. At the moment, buyers are struggling to place the price above $1,650 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Moreover, the $1,675 level is also a crucial resistance. Looking at the chart , it seems like a proper close above the $1,650 and $1,675 resistance levels may push the price further higher. On the downside, the broken resistances at $1,600 and $1,565 may now act as supports. Looking at the technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is currently flat in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is now well above the 50 level.

The company, Forex EA & Bitcoin Investment LLC, was also accused of failing to disclose the identity of the principals behind it as well as concealing some pertinent facts regarding the buying and selling of digital currencies. Unregistered Sale Of Securities\nThe company, along with its representatives, James Butcher and Richard Dunn, were accused of claiming that an investment in their company’s Bitcoin Trading Program involved no risks and that the returns were 100% assured with no possible way they could lose money. The company also allegedly told investors that there was an account with a balance of $500,000, and that any money lost would be refunded from that account, further strengthening the case for ‘risk-free’. All this was promised to only take 21 days, with the promise that invested funds would be refunded if no profit was realized within that period.\nThe order further alleges that the respondents were offering securities for sale at a time when the securities were not registered with the Securities Commissioner, a violation of Section 7 of the Securities Act. In addition, they were violating Section 12 by offering securities without being registered.\nRespondent Forex EA & Bitcoin is violating Section 12 of the Securities Act by offering securities for sale in Texas without being registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 12 of the Securities Act. Respondent Butcher and Respondent Dunn are violating Section 12 of the Securities Act by offering securities for sale in Texas as agents of Respondent Forex EA and Bitcoin without being registered as agents of Respondent Forex EA and Bitcoin pursuant to the provisions of section 12 of the Securities Act. Lack Of Transparency\nThe board also alleged that the team had effectively denied their investors a deeper look into their financial state. No information had been forthcoming about the account that was to guarantee the investment and cushion against losses. Its financial position, including the state of the assets and their liquidity, had also been kept from the investors.

Crypto enthusiasts see Goldman Sachs' plan to trade bitcoin futures on behalf of clients as a big-time institutional endorsement likely to lend more credibility to the bitcoin market. The price of BTC even hit a monthly high, flirting with $10,000, just days after the news broke confirming the entry of one of Wall Street’s most storied and scrutinized investment banks. Goldmans will also create its own more flexible version of a future, a non-deliverable forward. Mainly used in forex and commodities, an NDF is a dollar cash-settled contract for a security that is never intended to be delivered and primarily used for speculating on its price.\nGoldman Sachs is renowned for its engineering of complex financial products for its clients to make exotic trades and for proprietary trading. It was one of the few who predicted the subprime mortgage crisis (2007-2008) and took bearish positions on the housing market before it imploded. It created and sold real estate-related collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and in 2010 the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Goldman with fraud in the structuring and marketing of synthetic CDOs tied to subprime mortgages. Futures, forwards and financial wizardry\nCurrently, there are two different contracts offered in the bitcoin futures market, the first to launch was the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) futures contract (XBT) on December 10. There was very light trading volume in the market until the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) entered a week later with its own BTC futures. The average daily trading volume the month after CME joined was six times larger than when only the CBOE offered the derivatives. There are subtle differences between futures and forwards. Forward contracts are settled on one date at the end of the contract and not before or after that date. Futures are marked to market daily and so prices fluctuate but they can be settled on any date and rarely ever held out to delivery of the underlying.\nThe CBOE cites bitcoin futures offering more investor protections: the dangers of counterparty risk are mitigated through use of a clearinghouse - as opposed to a crypto exchange that is susceptible to hacks. Although a clearinghouse doesn’t guarantee customer deposits it does act as guarantor between clearing parties, so if a trader who sold short was unable to repay the borrowed amount of securities to the party on the other side of the trade then the trader who bought and went long is fully compensated for their position. How futures affected the BTC price Although much speculation and explanation has been offered on the bitcoin price crash, not much thought has been given to the launch of its futures market.\nOn December 17, the day that bitcoin hit its zenith at $19,511, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched its bitcoin futures trading. The Federal Reserve of San Francisco in its report published on Tuesday - How Futures Trading Changed Bitcoin Prices - argues that this is no coincidence and the price action parallels that of the rise and collapse of the home financing market in the 2000s. That has been attributed to the financial innovations in securitization and groupings of bonds that attracted investors when property prices were booming, but when instruments like synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) allowed pessimistic investors to make a bearish bet against the market the price of mortgage-backed securities and property prices imploded.\nThe Fed said: \"Before December 2017, there was no market for bitcoin derivatives. This meant that it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline in bitcoin price… Betting on the increase in bitcoin price was easy—one just had to buy it. Speculative demand for bitcoin came only from optimists, investors who were willing to bet money that the price was going to go up.”\nSimilarly, in the housing euphoria of the 2000s there was no way of shorting the market so the trend was all one way - bullish - until CDOs and credit default swaps (CDS) were created to bet against it.\n“The peak bitcoin price coincided with with the day bitcoin futures started trading on the CME… we argue these price dynamics are consistent with the rise and collapse of the home financing market in the 2000s”, the Fed report said.\nThe Fed believes bearish positions on the future price of bitcoin affected its spot price as investors who were in the spot market for transactional or speculative reasons and could wait a month would have been able to buy the spot at a much lower price. So demand fell in the spot market which fueled further short selling and downward pressure. Conclusion\nFrom the Fed's hypothesis one could argue that we've already had the \"subprime crash\" and are over the worst of the bearish bets. Goldman's entry is evidence of the growing interest of sophisticated investors in crypto but it would be foolish to think that their clients and traders are all bullish on its future price.\nAs Rana Yared, one of the Goldman executives overseeing the creation of the trading operation, said: “I would not describe myself as a true believer who wakes up thinking Bitcoin will take over the world. For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table.” Information and Widgets ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew gillick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brave new coin fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve the federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T08:34:02.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e30fcd7fffa58ebca0638522c222ac766d1aeeba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WGhxZ6tp53DdT0RPL3U4qVjedyZy7sxkKHaZFI8x5JZRYuiq.LIPuWyf4BB9E8Nlgf4Ryi1dbRTiJBOwbZpAPQlvJOzqYuBELvcZmn6GwEX9qNY76ohQhVA--", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ricky Williams invests in bitcoin due to astrology", "title_full": "Ricky Williams invests in bitcoin due to astrology", "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.972, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_S0VJHuDL1VlsqgFism3cA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODMuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Qs8iRd0ecdKEVGy4t07R0A--~B/aD0yODE3O3c9NDA4MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/1d292f2b221b1d71340a03a2ee6a5725", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 256, "comments": 0, "shares": 256}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e30fcd7fffa58ebca0638522c222ac766d1aeeba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL_G07GdDBhCKt.LTHgw8WGhxZ6tp53DdT0RPL3U4qVjedyZy7sxkKHaZFI8x5JZRYuiq.LIPuWyf4BB9E8Nlgf4Ryi1dbRTiJBOwbZpAPQlvJOzqYuBELvcZmn6GwEX9qNY76ohQhVA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Frank Schwabshutdown Cornermay", "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ricky Williams invests in bitcoin due to astrology", "text": "Shutdown Corner May 9, 2018 Former NFL football player Ricky Williams told CNBC he used astrology to determine he should invest in bitcoin. (AP)\nRicky Williams, former NFL running back and famed marijuana connoisseur, shared his most recent investment strategy with CNBC . It’s out there. Literally.\nWilliams told CNBC that he has invested $50,000 in bitcoin. That’s perhaps a reasonable investment, considering bitcoin was incredibly popular just a few months ago before cooling off. But here’s Williams’ unusual reason for getting into the bitcoin game now:\n“When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight,” Williams told CNBC’s “Make It.” “The insight that got me interested in bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.”\nO -kay.\n“[Uranus] is about revolution; it’s about a change in the way we do things; it’s about innovation,” Williams said.\nThe astrological sign Taurus “is about resources and finances,” the former Heisman Trophy winner added.\nPluto was also involved in that $50,000 bet on bitcoin. Williams told CNBC that Pluto is passing through the astrological sign Capricorn, and Capricorn “is about our structures, like banks for instance.”\nWilliams is really into astrology; CNBC noted that he has a personal website in which he offers 90-minute natal chart readings for $300. Those can be done via phone, Skype or FaceTime, in case you want to talk astrology with the former New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins legend. And he’s in on cryptocurrency, despite others in the investment industry warning against it .\n“Especially with the planet Uranus and change, [it’s] always going to be volatile in the beginning,” Williams told CNBC. “But, still, it’s more of a conscious choice to contribute to the change. If I do well, then great. If not, I’ll still feel like I did my part to contribute to things moving forward.”\nWilliams is one of the most unique players to come through the NFL. He was open about his marijuana use long before that became more widely acceptable, and was always considered a free thinker. He also ended up with a pretty good 11-year career, with 10,009 total yards, despite missing one season due to a sudden retirement and another due to an NFL suspension for multiple violations of the NFL’s substance abuse policy. Story Continues\nWho knows, maybe Williams is ahead of the curve on his investing advice too. Maybe for that $300 over 90 minutes, he’ll tell you even more investment advice based on the stars and planets.\n– – – – – – –\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

The NYT report cites emails and documents it has seen, as well as conversations with four people briefed on the matter. It also reports that Intercontinental Exchange is exploring the possibility of introducing swaps linked to Bitcoin.\nThe news should not come as a shock, analysts said. In 2015 the NYSE was a minority investor – along with Spanish bank BBVA and the former chief executives of Citigroup and Reuters – who pumped $75 million into crypto wallet Coinbase. Since then, Coinbase has sought another $100 million in funding, giving it a valuation of $1 billion . All this with little to no regulation from the US Treasury nor the major financial centres across the globe.\nThe NYSE’s parent company, Intercontinental Exchange, did not reply to a request for comment for this article.\nValue & Volatility\nAs of Monday 7 May, the total value of Bitcoin and competing cryptocurrencies stood at more than $438 billion, despite volatility which sees these prices rise and fall wildly . It is inevitable that mainstream financial platforms will want a slice of this massive market.\nBut the NYSE would be the first major mainstream exchange to allow investors to trade cryptocurrency. Until now cryptocurrency investors have been forced to use alternative crypto-specific exchanges to buy and sell digital currencies. The best-known of these include Binance, Bitfinex and OKEx, each of which has 24-hour trading volumes for Bitcoin of more than $200 million . There are very few barriers to entry into these cryptoexchanges.\nCompare this to the likes of the London Stock Exchange where only a very small minority of brokers have access. And banks themselves have been spooked by the massive value rise of tokens since 2016.\nAs the New York Times writes: “While Bitcoin was originally intended to be used by consumers for all sorts of transactions — without any financial institutions getting involved — it has mostly become a virtual investment, stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world. People buy Bitcoin in the hope that its value will go up, similar to the way they purchase gold or silver.”\nThe move by the NYSE could force the hand of the likes of the Nikkei and London Stock Exchange to push forward plans of their own to debut Bitcoin trading options.\nDaniel Wolfe is the CEO of Tradingene.io, an algorithmic trading marketplace focused on retail investors. He also spent four years as the COO of Troika Dialog (now known as Sberbank CIB), one of Russia’s largest investment banks.\nHe told CryptoNewsReview that “I expect the capitalisation of cryptocurrencies to increase meaningfully once institutional investors begin investing and trading. [This news] moves us closer, both by indicating the interest amongst blue chip investors and by bringing us closer to having institutional counterparties for the most conservative investors”\n“Banks, too, will face increased demand from their clients who will expect them to provide access, whether through the NYSE or other channels.”\nDenial\nThose ‘conservative investors’ – who do not want to risk large sums of money or assets trading on highly volatile cryptocurrencies – could be the source of the largest proportion of new liquidity to crypto markets. Certainly, opening up the gates to cryptocurrencies will allow vastly more investors access to these traditionally closed marketplaces. But the repercussions will go far beyond the simple matter of access, says Matej Tomazin, the Slovenia-born COO of digital asset management platform ICONOMI.\n“The first reaction of traditional markets was denial. They called them Ponzi schemes or pyramid schemes and were big non-believers in crypto.”, he said.\nICONOMI also has its own token, ICN, which is trading at $1.49 as of Tuesday 8 May, with just under 100 million tokens available, giving it a market cap of $147,661,593.\nTomazin said: “ICOs are mainly related to startups and are just one very small piece of the blockchain puzzle, so they will see a boost from this news but we do expect to see some regulation so that ICOs will become much the same as IPOs.”\nJP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was among the first major representatives of the traditional financial world to demonise cryptocurrencies. In September 2017 he blasted Bitcoin as “a fraud” and, as CNBC reported , he told the Institute of International Finance in October 2017: “If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day.”\nJust months later he walked back those comments. “I think the sentiment is slowly shifting to understand the [technology and] trends behind crypto,” said Tomazin, “so it’s more about the blockchain and the possibilities that the blockchain is opening.”\n“So what we will likely see is these institutions opening a door to crypto, regulation will follow, and we will see much bigger adoption from the traditional financial world.”\nThe news that the NYSE is planning to trade Bitcoin “is a logical evolution” says Tomazin, given that the large majority of new customers or clients are trading crypto tokens and not shares. Companies are watching this very closely.\n“We know the space is becoming more attractive for traditional financial institutions,” he said, “but they are still waiting to get some regulation in place.”\nRegulation Matters\nThis regulation has not come fast enough for investors waiting to pump money into fast-moving crypto markets.\nOver here, the UK Parliament’s Treasury Select Committee is looking into digital currencies, but the inquiry is still in its investigatory phase . And while the country’s Financial Conduct Authority has announced its intention to regulate , we are still some way off an official announcement.\n“All financial advisors will tell you that you should diversify your portfolio,” said Tomazin. “With news stories of Bitcoin and Ethereum growing so much in 2016 and 2017, [investors think] why shouldn’t I put half a percent or one percent of my portfolio into crypto? The only question that is now open, of course, is what will come sooner? Will cryptoexchanges have licences sooner than the already-licenced regular exchanges to cover the crypto world?”\nThe way that cryptoexchanges operate could also alter traditional marketplaces, Tomazin reasoned. For example, cryptoexchanges don’t have traditional opening and closing times like the London Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange.\n“The logic is a little different, how everything is done. There is no custody in terms of ordinary settlements of a few days, everything is 24/7, and you can withdraw your digital assets to your own wallet. These are new concepts that are not familiar to investors on traditional equity exchanges.”\nIt is just a matter of time before the Nikkei or the London Stock Exchange join the crypto trading space, adds Tomazin.\n“Companies whose shares are already traded on these exchanges are now watching how tokens are so easily traded, 24/7, on different exchanges. Obviously there is demand for asset-backed tokens – so that it’s shares that are tokenised. And we will see global names that may tokenise their shares so they could be traded anywhere in the world. The liquidity will be much bigger. Only a few brokers can access the London Stock Exchange – how many regular investors can not reach it? This is the question”.\n“I believe that if London Stock Exchange opens the gate to tokens, other companies will say, ‘Why shouldn’t we have shares that have the same kind of characteristics as crypto tokens? We could get settlement instantly, they could be traded anywhere in the world. In the UK you have fiat payments where you can, in a matter of hours, see that money in your account. This is the trend. So why wait a few days to get the money from selling shares?”\nAnd so, while cryptoexchanges may not replace financial institutions, it’s clear that the floodgates are starting to open, and the trading world will have to change – whether it wants to or not.

If successful, the company would reportedly be the first ever blockchain-related company to be listed on the city’s markets, SCMP states further. Sources familiar with the matter, who asked to remain unidentified because Canaan’s listings plans have not yet been made public, told SCMP that the company is seeking to raise $1 bln for its IPO, and that it had previously been considering both Hong Kong and US markets. According to SCMP, in 2016, Canaan had sought to list an IPO on China’s yuan-denominated A-share market, but the attempt fell through after regulators contested the deal’s proposed valuation. In 2017, the company again attempted a listing on China’s “New Third Board” market, which again fell through, even though the market targets startups and is relatively less stringently regulated. Canaan Creative is based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, and the company released unaudited results in January that showed a 600-fold increase in its annual net income of 410 mln yuan ($64 mln) in 2017. SCMP states that the majority of Canaan’s clients come from China, a country that has long been a crypto mining superpower due to its cheap electricity supply. In 2017, China was reported to have filed the most patent filings for blockchain technology of any country in the world, and the country is alleged to have accounted for 50 to 70 percent of BTC mining worldwide that same year.\nHowever, toughened regulatory crackdown on the crypto space by Chinese authorities, including plans to potentially restrict the power use of BTC miners in future, could significantly impact the landscape in which Canaan and its rival, BTC mining manufacturing giant Bitmain, are currently operating. The latter has already attempted to circumvent Chinese restrictions by extending its operations to Canada, Switzerland and Singapore, as well as, although unconfirmed, potentially the US.

Such an app can be transformative because it could serve as the gateway to the world’s banking system for hundreds of millions of people.\nApps are the perfect delivery system for modern financial services because they can reach vast numbers of people who are presently beyond the reach of banks. A textbook example of this situation exists in the Philippines where more than 70% of the population owns a smartphone, but lack bank accounts, the Noah Project estimates.\nThe lack of banking services limits access to cash and makes it impossible for most Filipinos to safely save money. Without banks, credit and capital are almost impossible for most citizens to get. Just 3% of Filipinos own credit cards, according to a Noah estimate.\nThe shortage of banks is a severe problem in the Philippines; up to 10% of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) of $304.9 billion, or $30.49 billion, comes from overseas remittances. Remittances are funds that Filipinos working in places like Japan send to family back home.\nThe lack of banks forces those workers and their loved ones to rely on the money-transfer system, which is both costly and wasteful. Wire services charge between 6% and 10% to send funds to the Philippines.\nThat reduces the Philippines’ GDP by between $1.8 billion to $9.284 billion a year. Money that should be going to hardworking Filipino families can disappear simply because there are so many transaction fees.\nThe Noah Foundation plans to help Filipinos keep more of their remittance money with Noah Coin, a cryptocurrency that will be distributed as part of the Noah Project . Overseas workers and their families will receive access via mobile apps that can be used at any place that carries a wireless signal.\nSince 70% of Filipinos own a smartphone, at least 70% of the nation’s population should be able to receive funds through Noah Project ecosystem. That has the potential to transform communities in the Philippines, because overseas workers would be able to disperse vast amounts of cash to friends and families back home.\nMore importantly, Filipinos that use the app will be able to access a wide variety of banking and financial services through their phones. Once they get used to receiving remittances on the phone, Filipinos can start saving money, borrowing money, sending money, and transacting business through it.\nCryptocurrency is being used because it can greatly lower transaction costs while providing a higher level of security. One way cryptocurrency lowers costs is by eliminating need for direct conversion of Japanese Yen into Philippine Peso.\nThe Noah Project will be testing the use of cryptocurrency remittances with its first app – the Noah Wallet. Philippines residents could use the app to send and receive Noah Coin remittances, which can be converted into currency for local spending.\nThe Japan-Philippines remittance market is the perfect testing ground for cryptocurrency remittances; because there around 128,000 Filipinos working in Japan, Inquirer.net estimated . Those workers send three-trillion yen (around $27 billion) in remittances home each year, per the Noah Foundation.\nIf it works, Noah Coin could save Filipino workers in Japan $1.62 billion to $2.7 billion a year by eliminating the 6% to 10% transfer fees on remittances. That would increase the income of many Filipino families and communities. It would also provide a growing revenue stream for many households and communities, because the number of Filipinos working in Japan increased by 19.7% between 2017 and 2018.\nThe Noah Foundation’s ambitions extend far beyond remittances. It hopes to use remittances as the basis of a new financial technology services infrastructure for the Philippines, a nation of 104 million people. The Foundation is branching out into physical infrastructure with plans for Noah City with a hotel, retail and amusement development in the Horizon Manilla Project. Noah Coin will be used as a digital token to receive special discounts in any part of the Noah City.\nThe Noah Coin token is available through the Livecoin, Mercatox, BTC-Alpha, Changelly and HitBTC cryptocurrency exchanges.\nFor more information about the Noah Foundation, Noah Project and Noah Coin, please visit:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "noah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "noah project", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T05:04:23.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e67c93dde1e36525fd12655a01b4a48454b69d71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54FNDH4x5j7t_ZIHB8q275K_._JY9ktDtj5UU742AgnbvBibFIP.vWq3D4nsD2IxuSka9Dvg_bRwCSL9k__nm608-", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ex-Goldman Chief Says We'll Have a Global Cryptocurrency, But Not Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "Ex-Goldman Chief Says We'll Have a Global Cryptocurrency, But Not Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ap-goldmansachs.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e67c93dde1e36525fd12655a01b4a48454b69d71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54FNDH4x5j7t_ZIHB8q275K_._JY9ktDtj5UU742AgnbvBibFIP.vWq3D4nsD2IxuSka9Dvg_bRwCSL9k__nm608-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Georgi Georgiev", "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ex-Goldman Chief Says We'll Have a Global Cryptocurrency, But Not Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "\nFormer president of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, said on Tuesday that he believes the world will have a global currency. However, he doesn’t seem to believe that the latter will be bitcoin.’ ‘Not a big believer in bitcoin’\nIn an interview for CNBC on Tuesday, Gary Cohn said that he believes there will be a global cryptocurrency. He also shared that he’s not a Bitcoin believer but he does favor its underlying technology.\nHe said:\nI’m not a big believer in bitcoin. I am a believer in blockchain technology. […] I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it’s not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that. ‘It Will Probably Have Some Blockchain Technology’\nExplaining his vision for the future global cryptocurrency, Cohn adds profound arguments of the kind:\nIt will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency […] It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it’s created, how it moves and how people can use it.\nIs Bitcoin that complex, though? Bitcoin successfully eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries–like Goldman Sachs–and makes long-distance transfers cheaper and more secure.\nOf course, it has run into a lot of issues along the way. Bitcoin mining truly is very energy-intensive, it has problems with handling high volumes of transactions and it has become slower as such. It’s also true that there are currently existing alternatives which perform better in certain aspects.\nHowever, ignoring the facts that Bitcoin is the first of its kind and that it has been field tested for almost a decade, proving its usability and performance capabilities in the process, is just inappropriate. What is more, Cohn’s old firm seems to have quite a lot of faith in Bitcoin itself. Goldman Sachs Recognizing Bitcoin’s Impact\nEarlier this month, Rana Yared, an executive at Cohn’s ex-firm, said that Bitcoin “is not a fraud”. What is more, she also seems to have revealed the bank’s intentions to offer Bitcoin trading. In a definitive statement, she noted:\nIt resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value.\nFurthermore, responding to significant client interest, the bank has already hired crypto trader who will help the company expand into the markets for digital assets. The news came as no surprise, though, as the minimum trading sizes for Bitcoin , as well as other cryptocurrencies, had doubled up.\nIt’s obvious that Cohn’s ex-employer is deviating from the position of the former president, to which he responded briefly:\nThey should do what they think’s in the best interests of their shareholders.\nDo you think Bitcoin has what it takes to become a global cryptocurrency?

They’ll message you, out of the blue, asking if you know any private sellers, and will offer to set up a deal for your mutual benefit. The majority of these men (for they are always men) are genuine in their intentions. This does not disguise the fact, though, that BTC brokers are little more than sharks circling the same prey.\nAlso read: Research Paper Finds Transaction Patterns Can Degrade Zcash Privacy Brokers Outnumber Buyers and Sellers 100:1\nAnyone can become a bitcoin broker: change your Linkedin title to “OTC Bitcoin Broker” and you’ve done it. Brokerage is a job that, like most cryptocurrency roles, outside of development, requires no formal qualifications. Just as anyone can call themselves an ICO advisor, anyone can assume the mantle of bitcoin broker, consigning them to start spamming Linkedin users for buyers and highly coveted sellers.\nTo understand the viral spread of brokers, it’s necessary to understand the conditions that led to large OTC sellers coming about. Back in the day, it was possible to acquire a lot of bitcoin for very little money. A lot of people mined it; some made it from trading shitcoins; and a few simply bought a bunch of BTC and then had the presence of mind to hodl, through thick and thin, for years.\nMost brokers will take on anything from 500 BTC upwards as an OTC deal, often operating on behalf of family funds seeking to acquire bitcoin in bulk. But what brokers are really chasing is the big one – deals of 10,000 BTC or more, in which a brokerage commission of 3% is worth millions of dollars. The number of bitcoin addresses containing between 10k and 100k BTC sits at little more than 100, however, and while some sellers have their coins distributed across multiple wallets, bona fide whales looking to sell are rare. Because the rewards for finding one are so great, a swarm of brokers, each chasing “the big one”, has proliferated.

The $10k area remains a key resistance for the Bitcoin as it is a very strong psychological level. As price failed to break above a correction down followed and currently Bitcoin is trading at the 23.6% Fibonacci support, that is $9225.\nThere was no clear break below that support, not to mention that price rejected the lower trendline of the ascending channel. At the moment Bitcoin is still bullish and after some consolidation the uptrend is likely to continue. If BTC/USD manages to break above the $10k with confidence, the next target is seen between $18-19k ( as per previous idea ).\nNevertheless, the downside risk remains and Bitcoin could go more down, but only if there will be a daily close below $8980. In that case next support is seen at $7850, which is 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. SHARE Please enter your name here You have entered an incorrect email address!

This week’s major bearish trend line with resistance at $1,580 was broken on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair also moved above the $1,600 resistance level, which is a positive sign in the near term.\nBitcoin cash price is back in a positive zone above $1,600 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD must settle above $1,675 and the 100 hourly simple moving average to gain momentum. Bitcoin Cash Price Support\nAfter further declines , bitcoin cash price was able to find support near the $1,460 level against the US Dollar. The price traded as low as $1,463 and later started an upside move. It traded higher and broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,702 high to $1,463 low. It opened the doors for more gains and the price traded above a few important hurdles such as $1,550 and $1,600.\nMore importantly, this week’s major bearish trend line with resistance at $1,580 was broken on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair also moved above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,702 high to $1,463 low. These all are positive signs since the price is now well above the $1,600 level. At the moment, buyers are struggling to place the price above $1,650 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Moreover, the $1,675 level is also a crucial resistance.\nLooking at the chart , it seems like a proper close above the $1,650 and $1,675 resistance levels may push the price further higher.

With Jamie Dimon on record for months calling bitcoin a fraud (though he regretted it as recently as January 2018), and Warren Buffett calling it “rat poison squared” as recently as Monday. Now, there’s one more high-profile figure bemoaning bitcoin, and that’s none other than Bill Gates of Microsoft fame, who considers cryptocurrency little more than a “greater fool theory” investment.\nGates leveled his scathing criticisms against bitcoin on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” noting that it was an asset class that wasn’t producing anything, and noted that he would “…short it if there was an easy way to do it.” It’s worth noting that Gates was a bitcoin owner for a while; someone once gave him some for his birthday, he noted, but he sold it a few years later.\nInterestingly, Gates seems to just have a problem with cryptocurrency. The blockchain system upon which much of it is built, meanwhile, has plenty of value as far as Gates is concerned. That’s a point commonly shared by many critics of cryptocurrency.\nGiven that Gates is on the board of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s own company, some here might suggest that Gates is toeing the company line. There’s nothing to confirm that’s the case, but when Buffett comes out against it with both barrels, it would be easy enough to say that the board probably isn’t going to say “Shut up, you fossil; cryptocurrency is the future.”\nStill though, with all the major names arrayed against cryptocurrency—why are they suddenly so concerned about the average joe’s financial well-being—it would be easy to think that cryptocurrency is either a giant scam with no future or the contrarian’s dream come true. With the sheer amount of regulatory firepower being brought to bear on cryptocurrency, though, considering it just a “greater fool” investment seems short-sighted. We’re already seeing cryptocurrency used in a variety of places, from the fully legal like Overstock.com to the largely illegal like Silk Road. With investment firms getting involved, legitimacy doesn’t seem far behind.\nOnly time will tell in the end just who ends up on the right side of history, and who becomes the next target of industry derision.

Bitcoin Cash believers say that there was an organised attempt to create a negative sentiment towards Bitcoin Cash and label it a scam.\nUser regecide2025 describes his experience discussing Bitcoin online as “annoying”.\nHe said: “I don’t have a problem with Bitcoin Cash. I have a problem with the community since they decided attacking people and if you try to have any conversation with them it turns into ‘you’re a paid core shill’ or ‘you’re just afraid of BCH’.”\nUser Uncle-Badtouch agrees, lamenting the “cult-like behaviour” of bitcoin believers, and comparing online discussion over the two coins to, “being attacked by scientologists”.\nThomas Bertani, Director of Eidoo told Express.co.uk that the Bitcoin community as a whole does not appreciate Ethereum as it is built on different assumptions.\nHe said: “People say Bitcoin is simple while Ethereum is easy – there is a substantial difference there. On one side you have the simplicity of the building blocks of Bitcoin, which make it easy to analyse and to make strong, on the other side you have a more complex environment – the Ethereum one – which looks simple to developers and which makes it very easy to build other things on the top.\nHowever, the debate rages on. Hitting back against criticism of Ethereum’s protocol online, Reddit user Mowglio described Bitcoin Cash as “literally the cheap Chinese knock-off of Bitcoin”.\nOn the controversial Bitcoin (BTC) to Bitcoin Cash BCH ‘fork’, he said: “It would be like if I copied a computer games code and then spent huge amount of money on marketing saying that my version was the real game.\n“All I did was change a couple of things and the name and boom.”\nMr Mowglio adds, “In the real world this would be illegal, but in crypto world it makes you filthy rich.”\nThis idea of ‘forked’ coins is, according to Jacob Papageorgiou, Head of Education at London Block Exchange (LBX), likeable to how popular films are ‘rebooted’.\nLike the recent Ghostbusters reboot, he said: “The new film aims to retain enough of the original while using the best available technology to improve it. However, just like movie reboots, they can anger purists who feel the original shouldn’t be meddled with.”\nBut why the anger? Isn’t there another, more centralised enemy?\nMr Papageorgiou adds “we’re talking about people who will have spent years working together on developing software, and so when a disagreement causes such a schism, it divides the community in an extreme manner.”\nHe said: “Debate can become heated and supporters of new and old protocol alike can be extremely passionate about their cause’s side.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "war | city & business | finance - bitcoin newswire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maxwell arnold", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T11:03:25.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b879b079d0288a63e9080b520188f51307047153", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqsT_sslLhldzveH1zO9XrKdISgNhaGnDlsRnU1NXCz7glWh0II6CIARfL52J8JTfVeTyuWTJC9zKuEudoqMzCgJehdFkSC5pw9F5YHyMnQWA--", "site_full": "topcryptofeed.com", "site": "topcryptofeed.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Crypto Youtuber Launching Bitcoin Funded TV Series on CBS - Top Crypto Feed", "title_full": "Crypto Youtuber Launching Bitcoin Funded TV Series on CBS - Top Crypto Feed", "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://topcryptofeed.com/wp-content/uploads/8325/crypto-youtuber-launching-bitcoin-funded-tv-series-on-cbs-1024x1024.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b879b079d0288a63e9080b520188f51307047153", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqsT_sslLhldzveH1zO9XrKdISgNhaGnDlsRnU1NXCz7glWh0II6CIARfL52J8JTfVeTyuWTJC9zKuEudoqMzCgJehdFkSC5pw9F5YHyMnQWA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto Youtuber Launching Bitcoin Funded TV Series on CBS - Top Crypto Feed", "text": "Crypto Youtuber Launching Bitcoin Funded TV Series on CBS May 9, 2018 3\nNews\nA crypto Youtuber is launching his own television series that is fully paid for by bitcoin.

The CW is operated by the CW Network, a joint venture between CBS Corporation, the former owners of United Paramount Network (UPN), and Warner Bros. Roku provides streaming content to set-top devices and apps.\nAccording to the announcement:\nThis will be the first time a cryptocurrency Youtuber has launched their own television series fully paid for by bitcoin. All promotional sponsors, features and the like are paid by bitcoin.\nAppleton is known on Youtube as Crypto Crow. At the time of this writing, he has 73,005 followers on Youtube. He began publishing videos on the site in November last year. While emphasizing that he is not a licensed financial advisor, his videos include Initial Coin Offering (ICO) reviews and investment tips. 13 Episodes on CBS\nAppleton has signed an agreement with CBS Television Networks “to air 13 episodes of the Crypto Crow Show in select markets as a test market in hopes of spreading nationally.” The first season is scheduled to begin in the week of June 25 on the CBS New York WLNY network, serving approximately 7.3 million homes, the announcement details, adding:\nEach episode will feature educational information focused on helping newcomers to the crypto space such as researching, investing and how to stay secure in their efforts while featuring ICO and cryptocurrency companies and how they affect the industry.\nThe 13 episodes planned are on topics such as what are cryptocurrencies, crypto security, exchange trading, ICOs, bot trading for profits, swing trading, crypto cycles and crashes, crypto mining vs investing, crypto predictions and the future of cryptocurrency. Crypto Shows Gaining Popularity\nThe number of television shows featuring cryptocurrencies is growing. Last month, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the cable network Cheddar launching a 30-minute show about cryptocurrencies called Crypto Craze. In February, Krypton Capital announced the launch of Crypto TV which focuses on breaking crypto news, panel discussions and live interviews. Eight pilot episodes of this show are being produced.\nRegular TV shows have also featured cryptocurrencies in selected episodes. Award-winning CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory, for example, aired an episode in November called “The Bitcoin Entanglement.” USA Network’s Mr. Robot has also made many references to bitcoin.\nThis week, HBO’s Silicon Valley featured an ICO while Showtime’s Billions featured a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet.\nWhat do you think of this crypto TV series?

While sparse in exact details, the report reveals that the exchange, which would be built for “large investors” in mind, would permit direct bitcoin trading, not futures contracts as we’ve seen with the CBOE and CME.\nAccording to the NYT ’s sources, ICE has been in talks with legacy banks and financial institutions to facilitate swap contracts for potential bitcoin trading. These contracts would essentially allow banks to buy contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange user buys one of these contracts, cash changes hands and the corresponding bitcoin would appear in his/her wallet the next day. In practice, a swap contract is more complex than this, but the important thing to note is that it would give the exchange the regulatory backing of existing laws and make it fully compliant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a status even today’s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges have yet to secure.\nWhile the report makes it clear that ICE is at least in the process of formulating a bitcoin trading strategy, it did not indicate whether the exchange is mulling over listing additional popular cryptocurrencies such as ether or litecoin. Further, it warns that all developments are not final and that plans for the exchange could dissolve given crypto’s unregulated, unfettered landscape.\nStill, if ICE does go through with its plans, it would become the first traditional financial market to trade bitcoin directly. This would put it in the company of Goldman Sachs, who announced earlier this week its plans to trade bitcoin futures contracts on behalf of its clients. Goldman Sachs indicated that while it is not comfortable with trading bitcoin directly straight out of the gate, the bank has plans on standby if clearer regulations surface. The institution shares this sentiment with Nasdaq, whose CEO, Adena Friedman, told CNBC that the exchange would open up bitcoin trading when “people are ready for a more regulated market.”\nRight now, the only traditional financial exchanges that offer bitcoin options of any kind are the Chicago-based CME and CBOE, both of which began offering futures contracts in December of last year.\nA representative for the New York Stock Exchange declined to comment on the developments.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nwasn’t that cool?

Bitcoin Bulls Need to Defend $9K admin\nHaving hit seven-day lows below $9,000 this morning, bitcoin (BTC) is looking decidedly weak.\nThe cryptocurrency fell to $8,980 on Bitfinex a few hours ago and was last seen changing hands at $9,080 – down 1.13 percent from the previous day’s close (as per UTC) of $9,184.\nThe downwards move does not come as a surprise, however, with the bear flag breakdown witnessed yesterday opening the doors for a fall to $8,865.\nNow, unless the bulls can make a defense of support at $9,055 (seen in chart below), the cryptocurrency risks once more falling below $8,000. 4-hour chart\nBitcoin risks a deeper sell-off to $8,652 (April 26 low) if the failure to beat inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle (as seen over the weekend) is followed by a 4-hour close below the trendline support, currently seen at $9,055.\nThe 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MAs) have shed bullish bias (topped out) and BTC is trading well below other key moving averages. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is holding well below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), also signaling scope for further losses.\nAdditionally, the action in the hourly chart below also suggests that BTC is risking a move downwards. Hourly chart\nAs of writing, BTC is trading on a weaker footing as indicated by the series of lower highs and lower lows, represented by the falling channel (bearish pattern).\nThe 50-hour, 100-hour and 200-hour MAs are all biased to the bears (trending south). The bear flag breakdown, seen yesterday, also favors a drop below $9,055.\nThe only factor that might stall the decline is the bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence. Note that the RSI has not formed lower lows in response to lower lows in prices. View BTC will likely find acceptance below $9,055 (trendline support in the 4-hour chart) and drop towards $8,652 (April 26 low). A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,652 would mean the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 has ended and the bears have regained control. In this case, BTC could extend the decline to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,990). However, an upside break of the falling channel seen in the hourly chart could yield a rally to $9,300. Meanwhile, a close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, seen today at $9,413 would indicate the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 has ended.\nFunfair ride image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

To make things worse, Electrum Pro comes above the legitimate Electrum on Google search because of Google Ads, a fact that will clearly trip up many users.\nThe team behind Electrum has given a detailed explanation on Github which anyone can follow to find the rogue lines of code on Electrum Pro which steals recovery seeds and sends them to the attackers.\nAecovery seed is a feature in most modern wallets where random words are generated that can be used to recover a wallet if the keys are lost. Once these keys are transmitted, the scammers can use it to retrieve user wallets along with all their funds.\nThis is not the first time a fraudulent Electrum wallet has appeared. Scammers have registered similar domains, hosting an infected version of the software for users to download. However, this is the first time scammers have been able to use the electrum.com domain.\nThe website looks reasonably professional, and it is hard to identify it as a fraud unless you have been to the original site before. They have a slightly different logo and claim to be a fork of the legitimate Electrum wallet.\nElectrum claims the malware is only available in the Windows and OS X versions of ElectrumPro. The Linux version remains unaffected, probably because the scammers did not want to have it in plain sight.\nTo combat these problems, Electrum recommends users check the GPG signatures before they start using the wallet. In addition to GPG signatures, Electrum is working towards verifying the wallet using Windows native scheme. Also, some point, they intend to have the official app on Mac App Store to avoid similar scams.\nIf you have recently installed Electrum, make sure you installed the official version from electrum.org and not from any other source. If you mistakenly used the malicious wallet, move your bitcoins immediately and remove the application from your computer.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electrum pro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electrum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:43:10.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d9d66aaae1201750d95fd121c5bf3b5e45401a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFOUCiasWcHc4JC_UdYQ5Lb3M6vebCIE.alMNcQa5eu5i1LLRu.f6w41exWPkPbs74rYAEVGSdWWytvB_JBZlB97HOGN_pUcs8R9HDdUE8d7duaorNKRpB.qA--", "site_full": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Crypto Trader Cryptocurrency Coin Bitcoin Logo BTC Short-Sleeve Unisex T-Shirt Gift", "title_full": "Crypto Trader Cryptocurrency Coin Bitcoin Logo BTC Short-Sleeve Unisex T-Shirt Gift", "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.106, "main_image": "https://ohiobitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bWDQ2s.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d9d66aaae1201750d95fd121c5bf3b5e45401a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFOUCiasWcHc4JC_UdYQ5Lb3M6vebCIE.alMNcQa5eu5i1LLRu.f6w41exWPkPbs74rYAEVGSdWWytvB_JBZlB97HOGN_pUcs8R9HDdUE8d7duaorNKRpB.qA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Specials", "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto Trader Cryptocurrency Coin Bitcoin Logo BTC Short-Sleeve Unisex T-Shirt Gift", "text": "\nCrypto Trader Cryptocurrency Coin Bitcoin Logo BTC Short-Sleeve Unisex T-Shirt Gift Crypto Trader Cryptocurrency Coin Bitcoin Logo BTC Short-Sleeve Unisex T-Shirt Gift\nThis t-shirt is everything you've dreamed of and more.

His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\n...\nXapo's billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who's in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\n...\nXapo's solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.... At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client's identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations.

And people see their lives savings disappear. There’s a real value of having a currency that - as volatile as bitcoin is - are still potentially less volatile than some of the states that see hyper inflation,” Ohanian said, adding:\n\"For so many people in the world to have that security of knowing what’s yours is yours - because it [cryptocurrency] is now digital, it can be transferred with you wherever you are going - is actually pretty empowering.\nLater in the show, Ohanian noted that he ceased managing the day-to-day operation of Reddit in January this year and has initiated a venture capital fund together with former Y Combinator partner Garry Tan,\nAs part of that effort, Ohanian and Tan have also recently participated in a funding round for the sharing economy blockchain startup Origin through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale as previously reported by CoinDesk.\nThe company itself is also looking into cryptocurrencies - just last week, Reddit’s technology head indicated that platform is planning to reintroduce cryptocurrency as a payment method for Reddit Gold members, and may feature ethereum and litecoin in addition to bitcoin.

The firm has said that expects year-over-year gross revenue to jump by more than 700 percent to 10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion) in 2018.\nMost of that remaining market share belongs to Bitmain, who also produces mining rigs for a variety of other mining algorithms, including those used by ethereum, litecoin, and most other major Proof-of-Work (PoW) altcoins.\nAs CCN reported , Bitmain is said to have raked in as much as $4 billion in operating profit last year, ranking it favorably with chipmaking giant Nvidia — a firm that is currently valued at $153 billion.\nDespite these astronomical profits, the secretive firm often manages to fly under the radar, and founder Jihan Wu was not even named in the inaugural Forbes Crypto Rich List .\nIn March, reports emerged that Bitmain was starting a US mining operation through Washington-based subsidiary Ant Creek, and the firm has also revealed plans to expand into other regions including Canada and Switzerland.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.

( MSFT ) co-founder Bill Gates described bitcoin as one of the “crazier, speculative things” and told CNBC’s Squawk Box that he would short bitcoin if “there was some easy way to do it”. Today the Winklevoss twins, who were among the world’s first bitcoin billionaires, schooled him on that easy way. In a tweet directed at Gates’s account, Tyler Winklevoss suggested using Cboe’s XBT futures to short the cryptocurrency. (See also: Winklevoss Twins Are Bitcoin’s First Billionaires ).\nTo be sure, Gates is not completely against bitcoin. In a Bloomberg interview at the start of this year, he said bitcoin had the potential to bring down currency transaction costs. “Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don’t have to be physically in the same place and, of course, for large transactions, currency can get pretty inconvenient,” he said, adding that care had to be taken to ensure that the cryptocurrency was not used for money laundering or criminal activities. A string of hacks and its popularity on the Dark Web have earned bitcoin an unsavory reputation in the popular imagination. Winklevoss Twins Set Up Gemini\nWith the entry of regulation and institutional investors, however, that perception is changing. The Winklevoss twins have contributed to that change by setting up Gemini – the first regulated cryptocurrency exchange in North America. They were early bitcoin enthusiasts and amassed a substantial stash in it by 2014. The run-up in bitcoin’s price last year increased the price of their holding. They’ve also been at the forefront of efforts to lobby regulatory authorities to introduce bitcoin ETFs and recently unveiled a self-regulatory code of conduct. READ Bitcoin Is Worthless, Bubble May Pop Soon, Allianz Global Says\nCboe and CME introduced bitcoin futures within weeks of each other in December last year. Trading volumes for futures have been low on both exchange due to the absence of large, institutional investors and high margin requirements from clearing agents. However, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS ) announced recently that it was planning to start bitcoin futures trading. The investment bank has not disclosed the venue of its derivative contracts.

The Chinese Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer had earlier announced plans for an IPO outside of mainland China. If successful, Canaan will become the first blockchain enterprise to be listed on the Hong Kong Bourse. Hong Kong and Not the United States\nReports emerged in April that Canaan Creative was eyeing an IPO. At the time, the available narrative indicated that the IPO would take place outside of China. Based on this, the United States and Hong Kong were the two most likely locations suggested.\nNow, unnamed insider sources say the company has tentatively settled on Hong Kong. The sources, however, say that the decision isn’t yet final. Meanwhile, Canaan has yet to release any details concerning its listing plans.

The firm Bitmain Technologies has once again produced a device that breaks the mold of digital currency networks that claim to be ‘ASIC resistant.’\nAlso read: Researchers Find Bitcoin Network 3X More ‘Evil’ Than the Public Internet The Bitcoin Gold Project Aimed to be a ‘Better Bitcoin’ by Trying to Remain ‘ASIC Resistant,’ but the Idea Failed Miserably With the Launch of the Z9 Mini\nLast year a project called Bitcoin Gold (BTG) forked the Bitcoin Core (BTC) protocol in hopes of creating a more fair and decentralized mining environment that would remain ‘ASIC resistant.’ The BTG project basically cloned the BTC codebase (Segwit included), and changed the consensus algorithm from SHA-256 to the Equihash algorithm, a popular mechanism used by the digital asset zcash and others. This week the Bitcoin Gold development team wrote a blog post that detailed a new Equihash mining rig that’s been released to the public “threatens” their dream of a “one CPU one vote” network. The mining rig manufacturer Bitmain has caused a stir throughout multiple cryptocurrency communities, by launching various miners this year that process algorithms most thought were ‘ASIC resistant.’ The latest Antminer Z9 mini was announced on May 3 and costs $1,999 USD per unit and the machine processes an Equihash hashrate of about 10k Sol/s ± 5%.\n“We are pleased to announce the Antminer Z9 mini, an ASIC miner to mine Equihash-based cryptocurrencies — To prevent hoarding and to let more individuals worldwide get one, we’ve set a limit of one miner per user,” explains Bitmain the day they launched the Z9 mini. The Antminer Z9 mini mines the Equihash algorithm and has caused trouble for the Bitcoin Gold (BTG) team. After Feeling ‘Threatened’ by the Z9 the BTG Development Team Plans to Modify or Change the Current BTG Equihash Algorithm\nThe announcement has shaken development teams who believed their blockchain consensus models would be free from these high-efficiency semiconductors. But now that Bitmain has released the Equihash mining Antminer Z9, the BTG project may attempt to modify or change its consensus algorithm.\n“This week, we learned that the dominant specialty crypto mining hardware maker (Bitmain) has released an “ASIC” miner for Equihash, which means it would be able to mine BTG if we were to allow that to happen,” explains the BTG organization .\nThe Bitcoin Gold dev team is now working to fix this. We’ve been planning to do this for some time – either by modifying how the Equihash algorithm is implemented, or by changing to an entirely different algorithm. Perhaps we’ll do each, over time. Due to the launch of the Antminer Z9 mini the BTG team plans to change or modify its consensus algorithm. Is ‘ASIC Resistance’ a Pipe Dream?\nBitcoin Gold isn’t the only project that attempted to create an ‘ASIC resistant’ cryptocurrency that failed to meet that goal. The Litecoin (LTC) network utilizes a different hashing algorithm called scrypt , and when the project first launched everyone thought it would never see ASIC miners processing the LTC’s blocks. However, the once claimed ‘ASIC resistant’ Litecoin scrypt algorithm turned out to be minable by application-specific semiconductors and at the time when this was discovered in 2013 it was quite controversial .\nLast month Bitmain released its Antminer E3 that processes the Ethhash (an ethereum, ETH) hashing algorithm. The launch of this device sparked a discussion between Ethereum users who wanted to become ASIC resistant quickly. One Ethereum proponent writes “a regularly scheduled PoW change, like Monero” is needed. The Monero (XMR) development team ran into the same situation as a Bitmain produced mining rig was launched before the E3, that mined cryptocurrencies that utilized the cryptonight algorithm.\nAs far as different types of Proof-of-Work algorithms there hasn’t really been a cryptocurrency yet that has maintained full ASIC resistance. Most people believe the goal to produce an ASIC resistant PoW is a mythical pipe dream as there are warehouses full of ASIC machines that mine these digital currencies that once claimed to be immune from ASICs.\nWhat do you think about the goal to create an ASIC resistant PoW cryptocurrency? Is this goal attainable without going full PoS? Let us know what you think about this project in the comments below.\nImages via Pixabay, Shutterstock, Bitcoin Gold blog, and Bitmain Technologies.\nHave you seen our new cryptocurrency market caps page Satoshi Pulse?

The currency had recently been tested at $9,800, and was unable to surpass $10,000 mark over the weekend as so many analysts and users were hoping. It fell to $9,500 the following day, $9,300 after that, and ultimately settled at $9,100 during yesterday’s early morning hours. Overall, the total drop amounted to $700 over the course of three days.\nNow that the currency has moved up, many are wondering if the bulls have once again taken the reins and are pushing bitcoin back up the financial hill. One source verifies that this might be true, and predicts that the coin could move beyond $15,000 by the end of the year. This is largely attributed to the new bitcoin trading desk up by Goldman Sachs. The sentiment remains that other Wall Street entities will follow in Goldman Sachs’ footsteps and try to pave the way for further cryptocurrency trades in the “big leagues.”\nIn fact, this is already starting to occur. Intercontinental Exchange (which owns the New York Stock Exchange ) has been developing plans for a new trading platform that could potentially allow investors to buy and hold multiple forms of crypto . Digital currency trading could suddenly move from “obscure” to the “norm” in the coming months, and hike up both awareness and the present market cap’s value.\nIt is also mentioned that many cryptocurrency exchanges must now register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may seem scary at first, but is likely to bring further legitimacy to the industry in the long run. This legitimacy is certain to up both the price and the value of bitcoin and its many crypto-cousins, pushing the arena into further mainstream territory and carving a path that leads to spikes in trading.\nThe source forecasts changes in both the number of users and transaction volumes for each month over the rest of 2018. By examining the present data, it suggests a much stronger fundamental value for bitcoin, and believes that the price of the coin will grow steadily over the coming months as mainstream financial institutions continue to show acceptance.\nIn addition, many analysts and financial experts are boosting bitcoin’s reputation by promoting its benefits and working against the actions and words of figures like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. One of those people is Mark Wright, a BBC Apprentice winner and bitcoin investor. As a huge advocate for cryptocurrency , Wright completely disagrees with Buffett’s recent claims, commenting:\n“Despite its volatile nature, the cryptocurrency sector has soared in recent years, with experts predicting it will hit a market valuation of $1 trillion by the close of 2018. This figure proves that Buffett is wrong, particularly when one accounts for how the value of bitcoin has developed since 2014 – the time when Buffett first expressed negative opinions on the sector. Despite his years of experience in business, Buffett’s comments show a terrible lack of engagement in technology and innovation.”\nBob Loukas – founder of Bitcoin.Live – agrees with Mark Wright. He mentions that bitcoin is beginning to gain trust in the financial marketplace, and that over time, healthy regulation will set it on the right path and allow for the currency to grow significantly.

The Bitcoin Network: How does it work?\nBitcoin is also a payment system as well as a currency.\nThe transactions are powered on the bitcoin payment network .\nFirst a person sends BTC to another persons, the transaction then gets verified by a series of complex math questions by other users on the network. Finally, the system rewards the users who have helped solve the problems in form of BTC. How are Bitcoins created? The process of creating new Bitcoins is called mining.\nMining is the process of validating transactions on the bitcoin network by answering a series of math problems\nThe users and computers powering the network are know as the miners. Is Bitcoin Mining Profitable for newbies? Here are some facts to consider: Limited Supply : Only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created Scarcity: Every 4 years, the amount of bitcoin which can be mined per year is halved Randomness: The network randomly rewards miners every 10 minutes Efficiency: Bitcoin mining can be done through CPU , GPU or Asics Miner\n.\n” src=”https://greytortoise.com/wp-content/plugins/ckeditor-for-wordpress/plugins/wpgallery/images/spacer.gif?t=F7J8″ title=”gallery ids=”302,301″ type=”rectangular”” /> What is the Value of Bitcoin? BTC Price History\nBitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin in 2009. He also priced the Bitoin mining energy required to created a bitcoin which was around 10cents at that time.\nThe price has gradually increased and reached an all time high of $20,000 in Korea and Japan in 2017 The first Bitcoins were priced at $0.003 USD on a market place called Bitcoinmarket.com Bitcoin History Who created bitcoin ?\nSatoshi Nakamoto , or someone under than pseudonym, started working on the code 2007 and mined the first block in January 2009. He (or they) also founded Bitcointalk forum as well as the Bitcoin.org domain.\nThough, it is still unclear if Satoshi Nakamoto is an actual person, team or pseudonym, Craig Wright claimed that he was the real Bitcoin founder. However, he has never been able to provide concrete proof. Why it’s not important\nThe creator of Bitcoin designed the system in a way that it would work entirely on its own. Demand and supply of bitcoins determine its price The code is open source, so the users can work on the code to improve it.\nAs a result, the Bitcoin Network does not need one person to exist nor grow. Who is Bitcoin For? Who were the first users of Bitcoin? The first Bitcoin users were the computer nerds who had extra computers who liked the idea of using their spare computers to mine these cryptocoins knowing they may or may not make any profit. The next users that followed were the stock traders who saw the money making potential. To the moon! Who are the future users of Bitcoin? Users sending large sums of money and want to save money on transaction fees Peer-to-Peer transactions eliminate the bank and intermediaries which in turn reduce transaction fees consequently hidden fees. Those who like the idea of a limited supply of Bitcoin Many people don’t like the idea of central banks ‘printing money’ whenever they feel like it and consequently worry a lot about hyper inflation.\nPolitical Reasons There are a lot of people who don’t trust fiat currency because of the government making the decisions.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.
