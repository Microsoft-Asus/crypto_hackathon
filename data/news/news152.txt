Typically, firms will release a pre-outlined variety of crypto-tokens (no matter their unit\" of currency could also be), then sell those tokens to an meant viewers.

Howell said she never imagined someone would use it to demand ransom for her lost dog.\n“It told me I needed to send $600 in bitcoin to a bitcoin address. Otherwise, they would sell or kill Happy,” she said.\nThe scammer then told Howell he was texting her from a burner phone, so she couldn’t trace him.\n“It said the police can’t help you,” Howell said of the text message.\nHowell filed a report with the Granville County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff said the scam is being investigated.

The illicit trade tactics that the DOJ is looking into include spoofing and wash trading, and federal prosecutors are working in collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the investigation, this according to \"four people familiar with the matter\" cited by Bloomberg .\nSpoofing refers to creating false buy orders to attract other traders (usually bots) to get in, with the intention of manipulating the market price in order to make a profit by actually selling. The Dodd-Frank Act defines spoofing as \"the illegal practice of bidding or offering with intent to cancel before execution.\" Similarly, wash trading is when someone simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading activity, meant to make it appear as if an asset has more trade volume than it really does.\nWhy Now? US authorities are reportedly concerned that cryptocurrency markets are prone to manipulation for a number of reasons including doubts that all trading venues are on the lookout for fraudsters, massive price swings that make it possible to steer valuations and a lack of strong regulations on crypto exchanges.\nWhile many will surely applaud the DOJ for its diligence in protecting crypto investors, skeptics might wonder if US authorities are not doing this also in an effort to further cool the market down by frightening investors. They are not generally known to be welcoming toward the field, and only recently it was revealed that American regulators also took part in a crackdown on what they call \"fraudulent ICOs and crypto-asset investment products.\"\nAre cryptocurrency prices manipulated and is it the US DOJ's job to investigate these global markets at all?

Despite the uncertainty and lack of regulation in the industry, Main Street banks are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon and raking in huge revenues.\nMain Street Banks Catching the Bitcoin Bug The big banks on Wall Street have largely shunned the cryptocurrency market with only a few making tentative forays into the industry. This has paved the way for smaller banks to take advantage of the void created by the major players to dominate the arena. Banks like Silvergate, Cross River Bank, and Metropolitan Bank are offering their customers premium crypto-focused banking solutions.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , Silvergate's asset base increased from $978 million to more than $1.9 billion. A significant portion of this revenue growth came from the over 250 cryptocurrency firms supported by the bank. Main Street banks are offering crypto startups the ability to enjoy the convenience of banking support.\nGenesis Global Trading is one of Silvergate's crypto customers. Genesis specializes in cryptocurrency trading, and according to CEO Michael Moro, the firm appreciates the services provided by the bank. According to Moro, Silvergate is a big believer in his company's mission, and that helps to foster an excellent working relationship. The Genesis Global CEO also went on to say that crypto companies need banks to remain in business.\nSilvergate isn't the only bank basking in the bountiful Bitcoin revenue. According to CEO Mark DeFazio, Metropolitan Bank has increased its deposits without having to incur the cost of opening new branches. The bank's 2017 revenue more than tripled the earnings of 2016. DeFazio is of the opinion that there is a significant paradigm shift in the payments industry.\nA Calculated Risk Mainstreet Banks aren't ignorant of the potential pitfalls of backing cryptocurrency firms. According to Alan Lane, the CEO of Silvergate:\nBanking in this [cryptocurrency] ecosystem is not for the faint of heart.\nThe crypto regulatory waters remain murky and even the banks that back cryptocurrency firms tend to play it safe. Main Street banks like Silvergate and Metropolitan have to observe a watchful vigilance in their compliance with KYC and AML regulations. As a result, many of these banks reject clients that do not meet up with statutory standards. Even with the hurdles along the way, smaller banks still manage to attract crypto behemoths like Coinbase, Kraken, and BitFlyer.\nThe trend of small banks backing digital currency firms isn't only limited to the United States. Major banks in Europe remain critical of Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. Thus, smaller banks like Falcon and Vontobel in Switzerland as well as Fidor in Germany and Bank Frick in Liechtenstein have embraced the crypto market, offering a catalog of useful products and earning huge revenues.\nCan smaller banks leverage Bitcoin trading to take on the prominent Wall Street giants?

CheapAir, an important company that sells different travel services (including plane tickets), will accept payments in Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Dash (DASH). CheapAir Accepts CryptoPayments\nThe Travel Booking Site CheapAir has decided to accept new virtual currencies as a means of payment. The information has been released on a press release that explains that the customers have been asking since very long time for virtual currency support.\nCheapAir’s CEO, Jeff Klee, said about that:\n“Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much. Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested.”\nThe company has been offering to its clients the possibility to pay using the famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Moreover, the document explains that in the past months, new virtual currencies have been created so as to solve and improve some of Bitcoin’s issues.\nCheapAir has also explained that they need to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies because they need to pay suppliers and employees because they do not accept virtual currencies as a means of payment.\n“We already had the plumbing in place to make digital currency payments work seamlessly for our customer and suppliers,” said Mr. Klee. “That made adding Litecoin, bitcoin Cash, and Dash a relatively minor endeavour for our development team, but a huge benefit for our crypto customers.” Travel Companies Accept Virtual Currencies\nTapJets, a known American company which offers customers the possibility to request jet flights, announced that it is accepting Ripple and Litecoin payments. In order to do so, the company had to drop support for Verge (XVG) after conducting a poll on Twitter.\nThe company said:\n“Some of this activity would depend on how agile development teams of XRP/LTC are to our requests. It is our goal to allow TapJets clients to use these alt-coins on June 1, 2018. We have been in contact with LTC team already and will be reaching out to XRP team on Monday.” Our #cryptocurrency friends asked for their project to be included in our payment methods. Our CEO @EugeneKesselman promised a quick poll from the product team so here it is #XVG vs #XRP vs #LTC what should be our next move #FLYTAPJETS\n— TapJets – Mobile App (@TapJets) May 15, 2018\nCryptocurrencies are receiving an important support from several companies in different industries and sectors. In the future, more businesses will start using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.\nJoin the conversation over at Telegram ( https://t.me/coinstaker )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.coinstaker.com/litepay-fails-litecoin-suffers/", "https://www.coinstaker.com/dash-making-blockchain-sci-fi-show/", "https://www.coinstaker.com/is-bitcoin-cash-outperforming-bitcoin/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/XVG?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.me/coinstaker", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/TapJets/status/996402253195079682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/EugeneKesselman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FLYTAPJETS?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/cryptocurrency?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/LTC?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff klee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cheapair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "travel booking site cheapair", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:29:50.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78cd99304acacaa0b9ba8405c3adf8ca599c5c88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq7QH.jfae5uxnkSLsuYVGq39c_p8_BsTVsky8ii8TDUFtKBigI3lcNztXwYw9MKnZJHyH5YmHMFNixNc5kuHRKEiBJ2tMdGFCxeHo.R1G65y2gSK_bl8yptilhlilD7qmCuI8HrrVYpWKeSVXMic1X4-", "site_full": "www.thestar.com", "site": "thestar.com", "site_section": "https://www.thestar.com/feeds.articlestopstories.rss", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "TORONTO STAR", "title": "U.S. Justice Department opens criminal probe into bitcoin manipulation", "title_full": "U.S. Justice Department opens criminal probe into bitcoin manipulation", "published": "2018-05-24T21:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.thestar.com/Tf3e3fP5qWukcRufF5bN3JokOeM=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(1527188400000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/business/tech_news/2018/05/24/us-justice-department-opens-criminal-probe-into-bitcoin-manipulation/bitcoins.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3654, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78cd99304acacaa0b9ba8405c3adf8ca599c5c88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq7QH.jfae5uxnkSLsuYVGq39c_p8_BsTVsky8ii8TDUFtKBigI3lcNztXwYw9MKnZJHyH5YmHMFNixNc5kuHRKEiBJ2tMdGFCxeHo.R1G65y2gSK_bl8yptilhlilD7qmCuI8HrrVYpWKeSVXMic1X4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Robinson - Bloomberg,Tom Schoenberg", "published": "2018-05-24T21:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Justice Department opens criminal probe into bitcoin manipulation", "text": "The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter.\nThe investigation is focused on illegal practices that can influence prices — such as spoofing or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the review is private. Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to bitcoin, the people said.\nConcerns around bitcoin prompted China to ban cryptocurrency and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, which contributed to this year’s slump in bitcoin. ( Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg News ) Authorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nRead more:\nWall Street considers trading bitcoin on virtual exchange\n Bitcoin miners generate backlash after spiking electricity rates for cities\nWomen claim their stake in blockchain tech\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading — forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with themselves to give a false impression of market demand that lures others to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include bitcoin and ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut bitcoin’s meteoric rise — it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 — has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\n Cryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook, hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self-regulator for the industry.\nSome market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nMajor cryptocurrency proponents seemed unfazed by news of the criminal probe into potential trading manipulation.\nBillionaire investor Mike Novogratz said he’s not surprised by the allegations and welcomes the investigation, a sentiment echoed by Cameron Winklevoss, president of crypto exchange Gemini. Wall Street’s biggest Bitcoin bull praised the move as the start of needed regulatory oversight.\n“Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market,” Novogratz, who is setting up cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital, said in a telephone interview. “Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins,” he said, citing his own experience trying to trade.\n“We welcome any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors,” Winklevoss, president of the Gemini exchange, said in an emailed statement.\n“This is really welcome news ultimately because this means there is adult supervision coming/here,” Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Global Advisors, said in an email.\nThe world’s most valuable digital coin was down less than 1 per cent as of 12 p.m. in New York, well off its lows for the day.\nBitcoin fell as much as 4.3 per cent to $7,267 after the news was published.\nSpencer Bogart of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital said he wouldn’t be surprised if regulators found cases of fraud, given even the most highly scrutinized markets haven’t been immune to it.\n“I don’t have any first-hand evidence of manipulation of Bitcoin prices but given that even the most highly regulated and most liquid markets in the world (e.g. Libor, FX markets, commodities) have consistently proven to be manipulated, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise,” Bogart said in an email.\nSome market participants have already alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Earlier this year trader Sylvain Ribes wrote a post on Medium where he said he believes more than $3 billion of all cryptoassets’ volume is fabricated, after analyzing exchanges’ order books. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders who have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nTrading volume for the total cryptocurrency market was at around $20 billion Thursday, with bitcoin accounting for about 30 per cent of that, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThemis Trading partner and co-head of equity trading Joseph Saluzzi said there should be cross-market surveillance in crypto markets to stop these practices.\n“The issue is that there is no one regulator monitoring the underlying exchanges and therefore there is no way to know if manipulation like spoofing is going on,” Saluzzi said in an email. “Some exchanges will say that they have information sharing agreements with each other, but again this is not enough to ensure that manipulation is not occurring. As we have seen in the equity market, exchanges are for-profit and can not be trusted to police themselves.”\nWith files from Camila Russo", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T22:14:27.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6bab4bc6929ab8b6834127dfc2971e417f957adb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRQ4L3Ojlheci8rMKDpVqzA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "today is Thursday 24 may, bitcoin price back down, what happened", "title_full": "today is Thursday 24 may, bitcoin price back down, what happened", "published": "2018-05-24T21:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.089, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6bab4bc6929ab8b6834127dfc2971e417f957adb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRQ4L3Ojlheci8rMKDpVqzA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Caladonian", "published": "2018-05-24T21:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "today is Thursday 24 may, bitcoin price back down, what happened", "text": "Quote: from: ChubarV on Today at 01:24:46 PM For people who are in this market for less than 6 months, most likely now is scary.

IJ works to slow the growth of government in the US in all its forms: economic freedom, education, private property, freedom of speech, not to mention amicus briefs to the Supreme Court. Now bitcoiners can help support IJ’s valuable work, a real world use case, through Bitpay and bitcoin cash (BCH).\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash Freedom, a Use Case for Bitcoin Cash\nThis year started very well for The Institute for Justice, a national law firm taking the terribly unsexy cases where government encroachment upon average folk goes largely unnoticed. The venerable Pineapple Fund donated to “only 58 charities so far selected to receive a grant,” including the IJ. In response to the January notice of receiving a grant, the Institute noted it would use the money to “help us defend and secure the rights of hundreds of thousands of people like those you will read about in this issue of Liberty & Law, protecting them from government abuse and enabling them to live as free and responsible individuals.”\nThe Pineapple Fund was a foundation of sorts lasting less than half a year. Started by a bitcoin core (BTC) whale, it garnered widespread praise in the cryptocurrency ecosystem for promoting the idea at least some of the recent years’ gains ought to be set aside for causes working for a brighter future. And it became yet another connection between crypto and the Institute for Justice. A Thirty Year History Meets Money’s Future\nIn fact, the IJ has come to terms with crypto payment provider Bitpay, allowing supporters to donate in bitcoin cash (BCH) as well. The higher fees and lag times of bitcoin core (BTC) made it less hospitable toward microtransactions such as lower-level giving. A hundred bucks worth here, twenty there, were simply eaten alive by transaction costs. A much better match, at the moment, is BCH for those very reasons. And all donations are tax deductible.\nSupporting work of the sort IJ does is something crypto enthusiasts can feel good about. A cursory gloss over the cases during their near 30 year history is proof enough. Eminent domain, whereby governments bully property owners into selling, or worse, under the rubric of the ‘greater good’ are causes rarely heard by other groups. IJ regularly fights them.\nCrypto fans are especially sensitive about the subject of licensing and certification, as they’re often frictions and barriers to entry into the polite, proper economy — something enthusiasts can empathize with. The IJ is a lone advocate in this regard, making sure those who wish to simply offer a nice meal or a haircut are protected from petty bureaucrats. The IJ is also keen on providing support for landmark cases via amicus briefs, as in the case of Carpenter v. United States . The Carpenter case deals with the 4th Amendment violations and may be instrumental towards the pending Ross Ulbricht Supreme Court petition as well.\nFor the BCH Gang, giving to important causes is yet another perk of decentralized cash. Groups such as EatBCH are “collecting bitcoin cash donations for the past few months and have been using the funds to purchase food and feed Venezuelans who are in need of assistance. Nearly every single day for over three months the group’s Twitter handle shows pictures of children and adults getting all kinds of food — and it’s all paid for with bitcoin cash,” these pages reported.

Well, US authorities have apparently heard your whining because they are now reportedly suspicious manipulation is indeed occurring.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street Spoofing and Wash Trading\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly launched a criminal investigation to determine if big money traders are manipulating the prices of Bitcoin, Ether and possibly other cryptocurrencies. The illicit trade tactics that the DOJ is looking into include spoofing and wash trading, and federal prosecutors are working in collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the investigation, this according to “four people familiar with the matter” cited by Bloomberg .\nSpoofing refers to creating false buy orders to attract other traders (usually bots) to get in, with the intention of manipulating the market price in order to make a profit by actually selling. The Dodd-Frank Act defines spoofing as “the illegal practice of bidding or offering with intent to cancel before execution.” Similarly, wash trading is when someone simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading activity, meant to make it appear as if an asset has more trade volume than it really does. Why Now?\nUS authorities are reportedly concerned that cryptocurrency markets are prone to manipulation for a number of reasons including doubts that all trading venues are on the lookout for fraudsters, massive price swings that make it possible to steer valuations and a lack of strong regulations on crypto exchanges.\nWhile many will surely applaud the DOJ for its diligence in protecting crypto investors, skeptics might wonder if US authorities are not doing this also in an effort to further cool the market down by frightening investors. They are not generally known to be welcoming toward the field, and only recently it was revealed that American regulators also took part in a crackdown on what they call “fraudulent ICOs and crypto-asset investment products.”\nAre cryptocurrency prices manipulated and is it the US DOJ’s job to investigate these global markets at all?

They will be working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a federal regulatory agency that oversees cryptocurrency derivatives, during this investigation.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor, to Bloomberg . “It would be easy to spoof this market.” Spoofing is when a crypto trader submits a large quantity of orders on a particular coin only to cancel them after prices have moved in a particular direction desirable for the trader. This is one of the ways the crypto market is being exploited due to lack of regulation, but some crypto proponents believe that government regulation will cause more problems than it solves.\n“This technological innovation must be allowed to develop, be rolled out and tested in real environments without material interference or overburdening regulations, especially at the initial stages of its adoption,” Llew Claasen, who is executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, wrote in a letter addressed to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017.\nThe DOJ and the CTFC are not the only federal entities working to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission is devising a way to better regulate Bitcoin initial coin offerings and even created a fake ICO themselves to draw attention to this problem. As cryptocurrencies continue to take off despite constant fluctuations in price, expect federal regulators to devise new schemes in an attempt to control the market in the future.

There's a lot of information from one of the co-owners of the company that makes them.\nIn short, there is only one physical wallet so how could you physically give it to 3 people?\nThe hardware wallet is contained in an NFC chip on the card that is encrypted. The balance can be verified using an NFC enabled smartphone. That's why you don't need trust, you can verify the card you have been given is funded.\nI'm not saying that the system and technology used is inherently flawed, and I understand the use of the NFC chips, however, taking into account human nature, wouldn't the hardware wallet open up potential avenues for fraud where the fraudulent 'card' or hardware wallet looks legitimate at face-value, and people only realize that they've been defrauded when they go and try to initialize the wallet and it does not work?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T11:04:09.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89a3b4fe362afe46675628ff50a9a2954f590154", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTGvG1TPryZoRkMlzo6I5hfd9UDj0TgUSUW1rTt6ORXPw--", "site_full": "www.pr.com", "site": "pr.com", "site_section": "http://www.pr.com/rss/press-releases.xml", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "PR.com Press Releases", "title": "CrowdReviews Partnered with FutureTech Expo to Announce: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II", "title_full": "CrowdReviews Partnered with FutureTech Expo to Announce: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II", "published": "2018-05-24T21:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29360, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89a3b4fe362afe46675628ff50a9a2954f590154", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTGvG1TPryZoRkMlzo6I5hfd9UDj0TgUSUW1rTt6ORXPw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CrowdReviews.com", "published": "2018-05-24T21:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "CrowdReviews Partnered with FutureTech Expo to Announce: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II", "text": "Receive press releases from CrowdReviews.com: By Email RSS Feeds: CrowdReviews Partnered with FutureTech Expo to Announce: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II CrowdReviews Partnered with FutureTech Expo Announce: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II Promises to Reveal New Profit Opportunities from the Next Bitcoin Bull Run Naples, FL, In February, the Bitcoin Ethereum and Blockchain Super Conference brought together hundreds of cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts, investors, and leaders. Now, the organizer and host, Richard Jacobs, is hosting a second conference at Dallas this September.Mr. Jacobs says the Bitcoin, Ethereum & Blockchain Super Conference II will disclose new information – revealed by select industry leaders – that elevates cryptocurrency and blockchain investment opportunities to the next level.Tickets for the conference are available now.“Before I even made it home from the first conference, my inbox was overflowing with emails asking when we were having a second conference, and how they could secure a ticket early,” said Mr. Jacobs.“Right then, I knew we had a responsibility to take everything to the next level.”Mr. Jacobs took the overwhelming response seriously. The new conference, coming to Dallas this September, is appropriately dubbed the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference II.Richard Jacobs, the organizer of the Bitcoin, Ethereum & Blockchain Super Conference II, is also the publisher of Future Tech Podcast, Crypto News Insider, and the author of the book Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain: Surprising Insights from 200+ Podcast Interviews of Industry Insiders.The main focus of this second conference will be on the next bull run of Bitcoin, which, just like with the 2017 bull run, could happen at any moment.

Despite the uncertainty and lack of regulation in the industry, Main Street banks are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon and raking in huge revenues. Main Street Banks Catching the Bitcoin Bug\nThe big banks on Wall Street have largely shunned the cryptocurrency market with only a few making tentative forays into the industry. This has paved the way for smaller banks to take advantage of the void created by the major players to dominate the arena. Banks like Silvergate, Cross River Bank, and Metropolitan Bank are offering their customers premium crypto-focused banking solutions.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , Silvergate’s asset base increased from $978 million to more than $1.9 billion. A significant portion of this revenue growth came from the over 250 cryptocurrency firms supported by the bank. Main Street banks are offering crypto startups the ability to enjoy the convenience of banking support.\nGenesis Global Trading is one of Silvergate’s crypto customers. Genesis specializes in cryptocurrency trading, and according to CEO Michael Moro, the firm appreciates the services provided by the bank. According to Moro, Silvergate is a big believer in his company’s mission, and that helps to foster an excellent working relationship. The Genesis Global CEO also went on to say that crypto companies need banks to remain in business.\nSilvergate isn’t the only bank basking in the bountiful Bitcoin revenue. According to CEO Mark DeFazio, Metropolitan Bank has increased its deposits without having to incur the cost of opening new branches. The bank’s 2017 revenue more than tripled the earnings of 2016. DeFazio is of the opinion that there is a significant paradigm shift in the payments industry. A Calculated Risk\nMainstreet Banks aren’t ignorant of the potential pitfalls of backing cryptocurrency firms. According to Alan Lane, the CEO of Silvergate:\nBanking in this [cryptocurrency] ecosystem is not for the faint of heart.\nThe crypto regulatory waters remain murky and even the banks that back cryptocurrency firms tend to play it safe. Main Street banks like Silvergate and Metropolitan have to observe a watchful vigilance in their compliance with KYC and AML regulations. As a result, many of these banks reject clients that do not meet up with statutory standards. Even with the hurdles along the way, smaller banks still manage to attract crypto behemoths like Coinbase, Kraken, and BitFlyer.\nThe trend of small banks backing digital currency firms isn’t only limited to the United States. Major banks in Europe remain critical of Bitcoin and the crypto market in general.

Even in its early phases, the criminal investigation will bring in other agencies, like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, The regulatory body that oversees the bitcoin derivatives, the sources said. On spot markets, such as GDAX, Poloniex and Bitfinex, where cryptocurrencies change hands instantly, the price of bitcoin can vacillate wildly in a matter of hours. Starting in early 2017, the price of bitcoin ballooned from $1, 000 to a record of around $20, 000 in mid December.\nCurrently, the price now sits in around $7, 500. Unlike Japan, where virtual currency exchanges are subject to the same rules and supervision as any other financial institution and are required to register with the government in U.S. Along with other nations, cryptocurrency exchanges are still largely unregulated, opening the doors to fraud and manipulation. As for the U.S. Justice Department, its probe will concentrate on practices such as spoofing, where a trader puts in a big sell or buy order only to withdraw the order once the price begins to go down or up, and wash trading, where an investor simultaneously buys and sells assets to increase the volume of trading.\nPainting the tape, where traders trade among themselves to make it look like there’s the squall of activity going on, is another approach of market manipulation. Every one of those illegal trading practices are especially effective in manipulating asset prices on relatively small markets. Cryptocurrency spot markets are said to handle just a small fraction of overall bitcoin trading, while larger transactions take place in over the counter markets, like Gemini Global Trading, Circle and Cumberland Mining, where large investors, miners and hedge funds move hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies daily. Earlier this year, Jordan Belfort, the original Wolf of Wall Street, who served jail time in connection with stock market manipulation, warned bitcoin traders of corruption, and improper trading practices, in the markets and looming government crackdowns. If you think that the governments of the world do not have the capability to shut this down, you’re very wrong. They do, Belfort said in a video.\nSources:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "justi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. justice department probes price manipulation on bitcoin markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poloniex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:23:50.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "990ac74b55b269906905aa795843bad4bc41e503", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZlvfoO8mgu9wDP8ULo1As0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=56.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Gambling", "title": "[Overview of all bitcoin casinos] Latest update: 24-05-18 WEBSITE LAUNCHED", "title_full": "[Overview of all bitcoin casinos] Latest update: 24-05-18 WEBSITE LAUNCHED", "published": "2018-05-24T20:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "990ac74b55b269906905aa795843bad4bc41e503", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZlvfoO8mgu9wDP8ULo1As0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Josepht", "published": "2018-05-24T20:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "[Overview of all bitcoin casinos] Latest update: 24-05-18 WEBSITE LAUNCHED", "text": "Quote: from: Paractor on May 19, 2018, 05:40:43 PM Hi\nLooks like you haven't updated the list since a while.

PUBLISHED: 18:50, Thu, May 24, 2018 | UPDATED: 18:58, Thu, May 24, 2018 0 Bitcoin price drop news: Why is bitcoin going down? BTC falling today\nBitcoin prices are dropping today amid a price manipulation scandal.\nThe cryptocurrency fell more than 1 percent today to trade at $7,539, as of 6.30pm BST.\nBTC took a hit with news the US Justice Department would be launching a criminal investigation probe into price manipulation.\nThe cryptocurrency market has lived under the shadow of regulation since its inception, but the latest development could force the market closer to regulation.\nThe rest of the market seems to be fairing well against BTC, with Ethereum trading at $588. Ripple rose 4.79 percent to trade at $0.625, while Litecoin rose to trade at $122. Related articles Crypto investor explains why he STILL thinks bitcoin will hit $25,000 Why is bitcoin going down?\nDespite its positive results in the previous few weeks, bitcoin is taking a hit amid a price manipulation scandal.\nThe US Justice Department suspects traders are now manipulating BTC prices, an illegal practice in regular markets.\nThe cryptocurrency world is regularly suspected of facilitating nefarious deeds, beginning its journey to popularity as an anonymous currency to trade for drugs and paraphernalia on the Deep Web.\nHowever, the cryptocurrency market may now be moving to more ‘white-collar crimes’ as a criminal investigation is launched. CoinMarketCap Bitcoin prices have fallen by $8,000 in the last year\nThe Justice Department is focussing on certain tricks that can influence prices of digital currencies, including spoofing which sees traders flood the market with fake orders before swiftly cancelling them, duping other traders into buying or selling.\nThe practice has afflicted various other stock markets, but this is the first investigation into cryptocurrency and how the market is run.\nJohn Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation said: “There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nBecause of the inherently anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, authorities worry bitcoin could be facilitating fraud and price manipulation, especially considering the wild price fluctuations and volatility that are known to hit the cryptocurrency market.\nThe bitcoin price has taken a 20 percent hit form its May 4 peak, as regulation speculation circles the market. CoinMarketCap The Justice Deparment fear the market could facilitate fraud\nConcern over the ability to manipulate traders in the cryptocurrency market has forced other countries, like China and Japan to either ban or fully regulate cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe increased scrutiny has seen bitcoin prices drop more than $8,000 from 2017’s high.\nSome market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nA Justice Department spokesman and CFTC officials are yet to respond or comment.

According to Bloomberg , four unnamed sources revealed that federal prosecutors are worried that the market is overrun with misconduct. Fears of Rampant Spoofing and Wash Trading in Bitcoin\nThe two major points of inquiry for the probe are spoofing and wash trading. Spoofing refers to flooding the market with fake orders, tricking other traders in the process while wash trading involves creating false volumes that overvalue the market. Both of these malpractices drive up the prices in the direction desired by the manipulators.\nFor many years, financial regulators have worked hard to eliminate these illicit trading practices from the mainstream markets. However, in the predominantly Wild West crypto scene, it appears spoofing and wash trading is (allegedly) having the run of the mill.\nThus, the DOJ is partnering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to investigate the matter. The CFTC only has oversight powers on crypto derivatives. However, the Commission has the authority to act if it spots fraud in the actual markets where digital coins are traded. Examining the Evidence for Crypto Price Manipulation\nIn 2017, a crypto blogger known as Bitfinex’ed presented evidence that a trader or group of traders known as “spoofy” was manipulating the price of Bitcoin. According to the blogger, Bitfinex was the platform of choice for the price manipulators.\nThe crypto market is mostly unregulated, making price manipulation a possibility. Commenting on the lack of regulation in the market, John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas, said :\nThere’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this [the cryptocurrency] market. Stemming the Tide of Bitcoin Trading Malpractices\nSince the crypto boom of 2017, the SEC has stepped up efforts to sanitize the industry, investigating dozens of ICO campaigns. The Commission recently created a fake ICO project to demonstrate how easy it is to defraud investors in the crypto space.\nCrypto exchange platforms are even warming up to the reality of curtailing the activities of price manipulators. In April, Gemini announced a partnership with Nasdaq to fight cryptocurrency trading fraud on its platform.\nNeither the DOJ nor the CFTC provided any confirmation of the investigation as at the time of writing this article\nDo you agree that there is rampant spoofing and wash trading in the cryptocurrency market?

Well, US authorities have apparently heard your whining because they are now reportedly suspicious manipulation is indeed occurring.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street Spoofing and Wash Trading\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly launched a criminal investigation to determine if big money traders are manipulating the prices of Bitcoin, Ether and possibly other cryptocurrencies. The illicit trade tactics that the DOJ is looking into include spoofing and wash trading, and federal prosecutors are working in collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the investigation, this according to “four people familiar with the matter” cited by Bloomberg .\nSpoofing refers to creating false buy orders to attract other traders (usually bots) to get in, with the intention of manipulating the market price in order to make a profit by actually selling. The Dodd-Frank Act defines spoofing as “the illegal practice of bidding or offering with intent to cancel before execution.” Similarly, wash trading is when someone simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading activity, meant to make it appear as if an asset has more trade volume than it really does. Why Now?\nUS authorities are reportedly concerned that cryptocurrency markets are prone to manipulation for a number of reasons including doubts that all trading venues are on the lookout for fraudsters, massive price swings that make it possible to steer valuations and a lack of strong regulations on crypto exchanges.\nWhile many will surely applaud the DOJ for its diligence in protecting crypto investors, skeptics might wonder if US authorities are not doing this also in an effort to further cool the market down by frightening investors. They are not generally known to be welcoming toward the field, and only recently it was revealed that American regulators also took part in a crackdown on what they call “fraudulent ICOs and crypto-asset investment products.”\nAre cryptocurrency prices manipulated and is it the US DOJ’s job to investigate these global markets at all?

It’s working with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to bring bad actors to justice.\nBitcoin—in keeping with its reputation for being volatile and unpredictable—promptly rose 3%.\nWhat exactly is going on? Not even bitcoin’s most dedicated traders seem to know.\nOn the WhaleClub Telegram chat group , where more than 34,000 traders discuss bitcoin price moves all day, opinion was split over whether to buy now or wait for a collapse. A user named WOMBATMAN was convinced this was the time to go all in, reporting to the group: “I just aold [sic] my kidney just for this moment :)” Meanwhile, a user named JM opined: “Gonna crash so hard soon.”\nAmid the stream of esoteric attempts to interpret price and other charts in the name of technical analysis were memes to keep traders’ spirits high. An administrator of WhaleClub who goes by Rogier thought the rally was a bear trap—a rally that looked like it might collapse but in reality would keep going on—thus exposing bearish traders who went short. He illustrated the point: A WhaleClub user discusses a bear trap. (Joon Ian Wong/Quartz)\nSome of the theories bandied about by WhaleClubbers: Sellers were rushing in to trade bitcoin after hearing about the price manipulation; crypto whales were trying to catch short-sellers out; or market manipulators were indeed manipulating the market.\nPerhaps a user who goes by Wolex had the most pertinent observation. As prices kept rising, he asked: “What the heck is going on”\nRead next: Is bitcoin being manipulated by traders?

Starting in early 2017, the price of bitcoin ballooned from $1,000 to a record high of around $20,000 in mid-December. Currently, the price now sits in around $7,500.\nUnlike in Japan , where virtual currency exchanges are subject the same rules and oversight as any other financial institutions and are required to register with the government, in the U.S. and other countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are still largely unregulated, opening up the doors to fraud and manipulation.\nAs for the U.S. Justice Department, its probe will focus on practices like spoofing, where a trader puts in a large buy or sell order only to withdraw the order as soon as the price starts to go up or down; and wash trading, where an investor simultaneously buys and sells assets to increase the volume of trading. Painting the tape, where traders trade amongst themselves to make it look like there is a flurry of activity going on, is yet another method of market manipulation.\nAll of these illegal trading practices are particularly effective in manipulating asset prices in relatively small markets. Cryptocurrency spot markets are said to handle only a small fraction of overall bitcoin trading, while bigger deals take place in over-the-counter (OTC) markets , like Gemini Global Trading, Circle and Cumberland Mining, where big investors, miners and hedge funds move hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies daily.\nEarlier this year, Jordan Belfort, the original “Wolf of Wall Street,” who served jail time in connection with stock-market manipulation, warned bitcoin traders of “corruption” and “improper trading practices” in the markets and looming government crackdowns. “If you think the governments of the world don’t have the power to shut this down, you are very wrong. They do,” Belfort said in a video .\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : bitcoinmagazine.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-otc/otc-crypto-market-flourishes-powered-by-skype-idUSKCN1H91P4", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe", "https://www.facebook.com/jordanbelfort/videos/10156550326118465/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-japan-creating-template-cryptocurrency-regulation/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. justice department probes price manipulation on bitcoin markets home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. justice department probes price manipulation on bitcoin markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poloniex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:29:52.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04890f705c3992cff8d866652fc7b55fae62d38c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtEW2K_X653Mr9lXLvHhPZCTdxbYJSTqqzwh76MWnnPEE4w6GlHRSgpyK8SdzxZMDJ5uoSLGmoBCvz71yZkNzLZCPRY5LQJmLxYRkNH1aiWwhg--", "site_full": "www.startup365.fr", "site": "startup365.fr", "site_section": "http://www.startup365.fr/feed", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Startup 365", "title": "#Blockchain US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market", "title_full": "#Blockchain US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market", "published": "2018-05-24T20:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/US-DOJ-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "04890f705c3992cff8d866652fc7b55fae62d38c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtEW2K_X653Mr9lXLvHhPZCTdxbYJSTqqzwh76MWnnPEE4w6GlHRSgpyK8SdzxZMDJ5uoSLGmoBCvz71yZkNzLZCPRY5LQJmLxYRkNH1aiWwhg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Startup365", "published": "2018-05-24T20:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "#Blockchain US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market", "text": "#Blockchain US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market Posted on by Startup365\nHave you ever felt that someone is controlling the crypto markets, increasing prices to lure you in and crash it all as soon as you buy?

Well, US authorities have apparently heard your whining because they are now reportedly suspicious manipulation is indeed occurring.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street\nSpoofing and Wash Trading The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly launched a criminal investigation to determine if big money traders are manipulating the prices of Bitcoin, Ether and possibly other cryptocurrencies. The illicit trade tactics that the DOJ is looking into include spoofing and wash trading, and federal prosecutors are working in collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the investigation, this according to “four people familiar with the matter” cited by Bloomberg .\nSpoofing refers to creating false buy orders to attract other traders (usually bots) to get in, with the intention of manipulating the market price in order to make a profit by actually selling. The Dodd-Frank Act defines spoofing as “the illegal practice of bidding or offering with intent to cancel before execution.” Similarly, wash trading is when someone simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading activity, meant to make it appear as if an asset has more trade volume than it really does.\nWhy Now? US authorities are reportedly concerned that cryptocurrency markets are prone to manipulation for a number of reasons including doubts that all trading venues are on the lookout for fraudsters, massive price swings that make it possible to steer valuations and a lack of strong regulations on crypto exchanges.\nWhile many will surely applaud the DOJ for its diligence in protecting crypto investors, skeptics might wonder if US authorities are not doing this also in an effort to further cool the market down by frightening investors. They are not generally known to be welcoming toward the field, and only recently it was revealed that American regulators also took part in a crackdown on what they call “fraudulent ICOs and crypto-asset investment products.”\nAre cryptocurrency prices manipulated and is it the US DOJ’s job to investigate these global markets at all?

Throughout the episode, the character Gilfoyle — a gruff, deadpan systems architect — keeps unnerving his coworkers with a jarring blast of the two-second song “You Suffer” by British extreme metal band Napalm Death.\n“It’s an alert,” Gilfoyle explains. “Whenever the price of bitcoin dips below a certain value, it is no longer efficient to mine. When it comes back up, it is. I need to know when it breaks that threshold so I can remotely toggle my rig at home … bitcoin is very volatile.”\nClearly, mining bitcoin is now decidedly mainstream, and not just for comedy gold. For many organizations, bitcoin mining gets less amusing as it increasingly forms the motivation for malware and cyberattacks.\nWhen episode writer Carrie Kemper uses the word “volatile,” though, it is an understatement. In April 2015, the value of bitcoin hovered around $230. Last December, it hit a high of nearly $20,000. The following February, it was down to $7,000.\nWhen its value was a couple hundred dollars, bitcoin “mining” wasn’t cost-efficient. It requires a fast internet connection, creates electricity costs through power consumption and cooling, depletes storage space and takes time. When the value of a single bitcoin began to skyrocket, so did the profitability of bitcoin mining — and investment in it.\nCouple that rising value with increased competition and a depleting supply of bitcoins and the result is an increasingly serious cybersecurity problem.\nAbout 17 million of 21 million bitcoins have already been mined. As more bitcoins are mined, the system increases the difficulty of the cryptographic hashes that must be solved. Bitcoin also cuts the number of coins awarded to a miner in half every 2.1 million blocks. In July 2016, the reward was halved from 25 coins to 12.5. In May 2020, it will drop to 6.25 coins. With fewer bitcoins left and fewer coins awarded for mining, the primary way to boost profits is to lower operating costs. Namely, the power consumption of running and cooling massive banks of servers. Even with a potential payoff of $100,000 per block added, those costs are not insignificant. In the U.S., depending on electricity rates, the cost to mine a single bitcoin ranges from $3,200 in Louisiana to nearly $10,000 in Hawaii .\nBitcoin miners offset these costs with malware. The malicious scripts are installed on computers — spanning the personal to the enterprise levels — that run bitcoin mining software disguised as legitimate programs. In 2017, the Pirate Bay was caught generating revenue by secretly using the central processing unit (CPU) power of millions of visitors to mine cryptocurrency monero. It was their alternative to the ad overlays that reduced the user experience of accessing pirated content.\nThis is not just a problem for those who visit torrent sites. Recently, hackers targeted more than 400,000 computers — in Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and elsewhere — to install bitcoin mining malware. Facebook, YouTube and Messenger have all experienced attempts to infect users’ PCs and even smartphones to mine different cryptocurrencies. The explosive proliferation of mining malware has led some to call it an epidemic, and “the new ransomware,\" but it comes without all the messy, labor-intensive trouble of demanding ransoms.\nIt’s not just bitcoin, either. To compete with bitcoin, the cryptocurrency monero ( currently valued at about $300 ) — like litecoin and others — utilizes an algorithm that works on PCs with normal CPU power. As mining malware becomes a more common alternative to advertising, there are growing services dedicated to providing simple plugins for WordPress and other content management systems — which may drive an increase in popularity for bitcoin cryptocurrency alternatives like monero and ethereum. Given the greater anonymity of many alternative cryptocurrencies, and the ease of mining compared to bitcoin, it is not hard to imagine a growing pandemic of botnets and malware.\nCryptocurrency mining is not just about a slow running PC, though. Some mining malware is so aggressive that it can literally melt a smartphone . At the enterprise level, the increased CPU loads from mining malware can lead to hardware failure, huge drains on energy consumption, entire systems unable to do mission-critical tasks and literally thousands of infections on a single network. It also provides a frontline and laboratory for malware and cyber threats that are increasingly widespread, difficult to detect and technically complex to remove manually.\nBecause much cryptocurrency mining malware is fileless, it is exceedingly hard to spot. Chief security officers (CSOs) should not depend on traditional virus protection but should instead instruct their organizations to vigilantly watch out for signs of infection. These include strange spikes in CPU and graphics processing unit (GPU) use, dramatic slowdowns of their systems and even overheating.\nThis is more of a stopgap than a solution. More sophisticated attacks (registration required) now monitor CPU usage and limit the processing power stolen to less than 50% to avoid detection. While an educated user base is always a critical component of cybersecurity, a strategic plan for preventing these attacks will serve an organization better than one that spots them after they have hit. That plan should be implemented sooner rather than later.\nImagine the continued growth of mining malware targeting bitcoin alone — and then consider that there are more than 1500 different cryptocurrencies, with more emerging each day. Each could provide the foundation for different types of malware. Add to that a growing awareness of the financial potential — or merely the perception of financial potential — of mining with malware, and it is easy to see how topics that play for laughs today could quickly become the catalyst for much more sophisticated attacks with much greater levels of malicious intent.\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Starting in early 2017, the price of bitcoin ballooned from $1,000 to a record high of around $20,000 in mid-December. Currently, the price now sits in around $7,500.\nUnlike in Japan , where virtual currency exchanges are subject the same rules and oversight as any other financial institutions and are required to register with the government, in the U.S. and other countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are still largely unregulated, opening up the doors to fraud and manipulation.\nAs for the U.S. Justice Department, its probe will focus on practices like spoofing, where a trader puts in a large buy or sell order only to withdraw the order as soon as the price starts to go up or down; and wash trading, where an investor simultaneously buys and sells assets to increase the volume of trading. Painting the tape, where traders trade amongst themselves to make it look like there is a flurry of activity going on, is yet another method of market manipulation.\nAll of these illegal trading practices are particularly effective in manipulating asset prices in relatively small markets. Cryptocurrency spot markets are said to handle only a small fraction of overall bitcoin trading, while bigger deals take place in over-the-counter (OTC) markets , like Gemini Global Trading, Circle and Cumberland Mining, where big investors, miners and hedge funds move hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies daily.\nEarlier this year, Jordan Belfort, the original “Wolf of Wall Street,” who served jail time in connection with stock-market manipulation, warned bitcoin traders of “corruption” and “improper trading practices” in the markets and looming government crackdowns. “If you think the governments of the world don’t have the power to shut this down, you are very wrong. They do,” Belfort said in a video .\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nRead Article Full U.S. Justice Department Probes Price Manipulation on Bitcoin Markets : https://ift.tt/2GOHeF8", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. justice department probes price manipulation on bitcoin markets  the u.s. justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poloniex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T06:57:09.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "993fa9bda9b9384fea893207f1e9d24cd737ad80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVtPlBWiFyDuDev8ARJMLMuv3KYmAEivN_rBH7lmbFlcQJkscN6IYf_hlbEd43ebruMdSlXZHTd_NyBm3b0LcTek-", "site_full": "www.dailyfx.com", "site": "dailyfx.com", "site_section": "https://rss.dailyfx.com/feeds/all", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "games"], "section_title": "DailyFX - Feeds all", "title": "Bitcoin Teeters at 7500 with Bearish Signal", "title_full": "Bitcoin Teeters at 7500 with Bearish Signal", "published": "2018-05-24T20:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9, "comments": 0, "shares": 9}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "993fa9bda9b9384fea893207f1e9d24cd737ad80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVtPlBWiFyDuDev8ARJMLMuv3KYmAEivN_rBH7lmbFlcQJkscN6IYf_hlbEd43ebruMdSlXZHTd_NyBm3b0LcTek-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Abdullah AlAmoudi,", "published": "2018-05-24T20:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Teeters at 7500 with Bearish Signal", "text": "Bitcoin Teeters at 7500 with Bearish Signal by Abdullah AlAmoudi 76% of Traders Are Long on Bitcoin\nBitcoin: Retail trader data shows 76.0% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 3.17 to 1.

We are still in the early days, you can compare it to the internet in 1995, before Google, Facebook, and other big players. The Blockchain can be used to run all sorts of tasks on the web and create different services and operations. Thanks to the platforms like Ethereum , new dapps (decentralized apps) are being created every month now. One of the main aspects of this technology is decentralization which can eliminate the middleman. At the moment, Western Union is charging for international transfers and banks charge a lot for sending money to different places around the globe. Cryptocurrency can eliminate that, fees can be super low and transfer of money instant. But blockchain is so much more, Bitcoin is just the beginning, the implications of this technology are enormous, check out some of my thoughts on this subject:\nFollow me on Instagram Written by: Mike Sygula Mike Sygula is a blogger, entrepreneur and activist promoting alternative ideas to raise public consciousness of the important issues facing humankind.

Another type of manipulation investigators are looking for is called “wash trades,” where a trader exchanges with themselves to produce the illusion of market demand.\nThis investigation is in addition to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s probe into what initial coin offerings, the practice of selling cryptographic tokens by blockchain-related startups as a sort of crowdfunded investment.\nWhen it comes to criminal activity and potential market manipulation, bitcoin has a problematic and risky history. Early bitcoin trading was fraught with a certain amount of danger, with few cryptocurrency exchanges available, and saw the extremely popular Mt. Gox go under in 2014 after the massive theft of an estimated $500 million in bitcoin at the time.\nSince then, bitcoin users have lost numerous coins through the hacks of other exchanges, phishing scams and shady startups. Bitstamp Ltd., bitcoin exchange, lost $5 million in a hack . Bitfinex Inc., another exchange, lost $65.5 million worth of bitcoin. NiceHash, a bitcoin mining marketplace, lost $68 million . And those are just a few of the examples.\nThe theft at Mt. Gox also led to a dramatic plunge in bitcoin market value, from almost $1,000 to below $500 per coin. The exchange represented almost 70 percent of all bitcoin trades at the time. Mark Karpeles, then chief executive of Mt. Gox, was arrested by Japanese authorities out of suspicion that he had embezzled funds and manipulated data, potentially as part of the theft. The case is still in court today .\nWhat’s more, a recent report released by the Anti-Phishing Working Group estimated that criminals have stolen about $1.2 billion in various cryptocurrency tokens since the beginning of 2017.\nAside from the marketplaces becoming victims of hacks, bitcoin exchanges themselves oftentimes come under skepticism about the behavior of traders. This is of concern to the DOJ as part of this probe. Investigators believe that exchanges may not do enough to stop potential market manipulation.\nIn past years, exchanges with low or no fees would show giant volumes of trade. However, much of that would prove to be potentially fake. As a result, some price aggregators would refuse to list particular exchanges for these questionable practices. Trader and investor Sylvain Ribes called this “fake volume” in an essay he wrote on Medium after doing research on the liquidity of cryptocurrency assets.\n“When I set out to datamine for this piece, I had no idea I would end up talking about fake volume,” Ribes wrote.\nWhat he found was that one particular exchange, OKEx, founded in 2014 by OKCoin Chief Executive Officer Star Xu and based out of Hong Kong, represented the top exchange by volume of trades in May. However, Ribes found that over 93 percent of all trades to be nonexistent. At the end of his research, Ribes concluded that more than $3 billion of daily volume in trades of cryptocurrency could be fictional, possibly more.\n“Yet somehow, the practice is, if not encouraged, at least thoroughly ignored by popular data aggregators and most of their users,” Ribes said about his discovery, “when all anybody really has to do is have a look to figure out that something is amiss.”\nAlthough bitcoin trading has been a niche market for many years, the sudden skyrocketing of its market value in recent years has brought it more mainstream attention. The currency started at near $1,000 in 2017 and then the price jumped significantly to near $20,000 by the end of the year. It has since crashed back down to below $8,000 today.\nBloomberg reported that DOJ investigators believe these fluctuations alone make the market a risky venture for anyone attempting to invest in the currency and, because of bitcoin’s rise in popularity, many people may be getting in without fully understanding the risks.\nSo far, the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges within the U.S. has been somewhat minimal, the biggest exception being New York’s “BitLicense” regulation enacted by the New York Department of Financial Services in 2015. Since then, a few U.S.-based exchanges have signed up to be licensed in New York, including payments company Circle Internet Financial Limited, cryptocurrency developer Ripple Labs and bitcoin wallet and exchange Coinbase Inc.\nThe investigation by the USDOJ is said to still be in its early stages but may represent the next wave of potential regulation of bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S.\nSince ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe", "https://medium.com/@sylvainartplayribes/chasing-fake-volume-a-crypto-plague-ea1a3c1e0b5e", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU", "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/head-failed-japan-based-bitcoin-exchange-mt-gox-arrested-n402391", "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/11/gox-bitcoin-exchange-mark-karpeles-on-trial-japan-embezzlement-loss-of-millions"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kyt dotson", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united states department of justice", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T22:25:23.091+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dcd7a6bac65d568d11b3ef43f580a1eac9ce0e44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBK02le2nSuAlGaXDCdM5wWnYzTnVV.OueCVcfJvRkwbKzzDd3WtN6O9nEY4JFtdruT", "site_full": "anynote.co", "site": "anynote.co", "site_section": "https://anynote.co/rss/?id=1", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Latest Blogs", "title": "A Chinese Bitcoin Tycoon And His Report", "title_full": "A Chinese Bitcoin Tycoon And His Report", "published": "2018-05-24T20:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dcd7a6bac65d568d11b3ef43f580a1eac9ce0e44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBK02le2nSuAlGaXDCdM5wWnYzTnVV.OueCVcfJvRkwbKzzDd3WtN6O9nEY4JFtdruT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bryon McCollom", "published": "2018-05-24T20:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Chinese Bitcoin Tycoon And His Report", "text": "by Bryon McCollom on 22 minutes ago 2 views Beneath is the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) data for e-Chat (ECHT).

This video comes from the folks at Botnik Studios. They’re a team of creatives and/or engineers making artificial intelligence a tool for some of the strangest stuff I’ve ever seen before. They’re using AI like a paintbrush, and the canvas is your mind.\nIn the video below, you’re going to get blasted with information. This information was amalgamated using dozens of “Bitcoin explainers”– people who’ve tried to explain Bitcoin before, be it in blogs, on the radio, TV, or in streaming video. Data was input into predictive keyboards, which turned around and made a masterpiece.\nIt’s kind of like the idea Mr Burns had back in ’93 in an episode of The Simpsons by the name of “Last Exit to Springfield.” Have a peek at how 1,000 monkeys working at 1,000 typewriters made their own version of what’s above. It’s… it’s a LITTLE different.\nIf you’d really like to know what Bitcoin is all about, there’s a really, really good talk up now courtesy of TED at Beacon Street. This is an independently organized TED event – but the information isn’t any less well presented. The speaker is Jeremy Rubin, Technical Director of the MIT Bitcoin Project.\nIf you’d like further explanation for why Bitcoin and the Blockchain are important, look no further. Below is a TED Talk from TED at White City – that’s an independently organized TED event as well. This teaching session comes from Galia Benartzi, co-founder, Business Development for Bancor. She knows her stuff, of that you can be sure.\nStay tuned – Blockchain and Bitcoin aren’t going away any time soon.

PUBLISHED: 07:00, Fri, May 25, 2018 | UPDATED: 07:04, Fri, May 25, 2018 0\nFundstrat's Tom Lee flatly refused to reassess his bold prediction that bitcoin would hit $25,000. Bitcoin had dropped to $7,362 at 10 am GMT on Thursday having nearly hit $20,000 in December 2017.\nCNBC ’s Jackie DeAngelis asked Mr Lee: “Make the case to me. From an investor out there, why do I want to buy Bitcoin now, because it seems like a scary trade? “\nHe replied: “I think the chart is pretty scary for folks because bitcoin was $20,000 in December and it is less than half of that now. But the reason investors should care about this is, number one, I think that the notion of blockchain as the way to solve trust in a digital world has gained a lot of traction especial out of consensus (conference).” CNBC•Getty Bitcoin has slumped but Tom Lee thinks the price will rise significantly. bitcoin is trading at cost Tom Lee\n“What investors aren’t connecting is that you can’t necessarily just say that ‘I believe in the blockchain.’ Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are essential to how blockchains act in the securities.”\nMr Lee said that the cryptocurrency has hit the level it costs to produce, comparing it to gold which is trading at nearly double the price it costs to extract from the earth.\nHe said: “The case I’d make for Bitcoin is, one, the cost of producing and replicating a bitcoin today as a store of value is around $8,000 fully loaded.”\n“So bitcoin is trading at cost. Gold as another store of value is trading at more than twice it’s extraction cost.”\nBitcoin is frequently compared to gold as it is frequently treated as a speculative or store-of-value asset. The investor said that increased interest from financial institutions could also provoke an upturn in the cryptocurrency’s value.\nHe said: “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest and they haven’t really come into crypto yet as there is still some regulatory uncertainty.”\n“But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.”\n“I think it's a great story, it's a great technology and I think it is underappreciated and that’s why we like it at $8,000.” Everything you need to know about bitcoin Mon, October 30, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/world/?region=world"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jackie deangelis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cit", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:53:30.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c81f9e8a335f78fe75a362df71249824994999e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2eRCTFln.i_ZKYUln37JOIYwDV_Vxfsd4hAi_5M4LaK466YXpvcIvx7V6nfNBT6PzAaZ.ObIxA--", "site_full": "www.godlikeproductions.com", "site": "godlikeproductions.com", "site_section": "http://www.godlikeproductions.com/feeds/forums/1", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Godlike Productions - General Discussion", "title": "DOJ Launches Bitcoin Price Manipulation Probe", "title_full": "DOJ Launches Bitcoin Price Manipulation Probe", "published": "2018-05-24T20:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 12387, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c81f9e8a335f78fe75a362df71249824994999e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2eRCTFln.i_ZKYUln37JOIYwDV_Vxfsd4hAi_5M4LaK466YXpvcIvx7V6nfNBT6PzAaZ.ObIxA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "VigilantTexan", "published": "2018-05-24T20:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "DOJ Launches Bitcoin Price Manipulation Probe", "text": "Report Copyright Violation DOJ Launches Bitcoin Price Manipulation Probe The Bloomberg reports the DOJ is working with Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (FTC), which oversees cryptocurrency derivatives, to investigate potential Bitcoin price manipulation.Investigators will focus on illegal moves, such as: 1. “spoofing” where false orders are placed on exchanges and then withdrawn with the aim to manipulate prices in an attempt to lure naïve consumers into buying or selling, and 2. “wash trading” where market participants trade with themselves to create the illusion of bustling market activity.Such activities may have provided bad actors the opportunity to manipulate Bitcoin price.

Revolut is also allowing users to use the cryptocurrencies to top up their debit cards with crypto, saying, we’ll just deduce the fiat value from your cryptocurrency utilizing the real exchange rate the moment you pay with your Revolut card. According to another blog post, for cryptocurrency purchases, Revolut charges 1.5 percent markup on average exchange price, which is obtained using live prices from its partner exchanges.
