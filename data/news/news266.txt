Nouri declined to disclose how much the crypto exchange had paid, but said a rental like that typically goes for around $1,000.\nThe flashy cars that symbolize conspicuous consumption among Bitcoin true-believers had caused a stir earlier as they roared through the streets near the hotel. Another stunt came from an upstart mining company called Genesis Mining. The firm hired actors to portray aggrieved bankers who will lose their financial services jobs when blockchain takes over the industry.\nThe gimmicks show that the hype that surrounded Bitcoin as it burst on the mainstream last year remains alive and well even after the biggest digital coin fell more than 50 percent from its December peak of almost $20,000.\nGenesis said the protest was a “fun way” to show how crypto can upend banking “if they fail to adapt to the new world we live in,” according to a blog post on its website.\nA hundred feet away, MK Li stood in front of the revolving hotel doors with a sign that read “Help a fellow VC to pay for this expensive conference!” Sporting a pink button-down shirt with a purple bowtie, the conference goer was accepting donations in digital tokens — a way to protest the hefty price he’d paid for a conference about a technology that was meant to eliminate the need for expensive middlemen.\nTicket prices ranged from from $1,499 to $2,999, suggesting that organizer CoinDesk Inc. raked in at least $12.8 million in revenue from admissions alone. There are also more than 100 sponsors such as IBM, SAP and Microsoft Corp.\nInside the hotel, several floors up, one peeved attendee said to another, “How is this not a fire-code violation?’’ The two stood in the doorway of a packed ballroom, straining their necks to get a glimpse of a presentation about Cryptogaphic Innovations.\nThe hype is real at Consensus, the biggest of about two dozen events that make up “Blockchain Week.’’ So far, the conference — which is expected to bring in more than 8,000 people this year — has featured flannels, business suits, cowboy hats and dreadlocks amid a standing-room only sea of crypto and blockchain enthusiasts.\nSima Baktas, who works for a blockchain startup in Istanbul, sported a T-shirt that said “Satoshi is Female,’’ — a reference to the mysterious and still-unknown author of the original Bitcoin whitepaper. Nearby, a man wore a red sweater covered in pictures of dollar bills.\nNow read: What Vinny Lingham looks for in a crypto investment bitcoin conference cryptocurrency Lamborghini", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john nouri", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "hilton midtown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broadway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T08:58:50.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "32be6e47acca06d223d11cfd53faf67b333efd27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqKU6uQXz.KX21CmPqq92K46Bnv8k96byFT8yjCYAwJ7OVwzFIQ7V0rLb47aUjChwUfSwxpz9scwekOneBjxoNLqjqcOtXijVvrOh7hOp8Fcn0jnFdrGR0meQit6svxcaccBxByuv.MyuxcLJ7dSw14oOrIz0M0x1wU-", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com - Top Stories", "title": "Coinbase aims to become one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome high-speed trading", "title_full": "Coinbase aims to become one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome high-speed trading - MarketWatch", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GI861_bitcoi_ZG_20180509125937.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32be6e47acca06d223d11cfd53faf67b333efd27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqKU6uQXz.KX21CmPqq92K46Bnv8k96byFT8yjCYAwJ7OVwzFIQ7V0rLb47aUjChwUfSwxpz9scwekOneBjxoNLqjqcOtXijVvrOh7hOp8Fcn0jnFdrGR0meQit6svxcaccBxByuv.MyuxcLJ7dSw14oOrIz0M0x1wU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexander Osipovich", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coinbase aims to become one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome high-speed trading", "text": "The bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.27% market is about to get a lot faster. Coinbase Inc., which operates the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade its systems with services that cater to ultrafast traders. The upgrade, planned for later this year, will make Coinbase one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome the controversial business of high-speed trading.\nHigh-frequency trading, or HFT firms, use computers to buy and sell stocks, futures and other assets in the blink of eye. They accounted for 55% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market last year, according to research firm Tabb Group LLC, but they have only recently begun to dabble in cryptocurrencies.\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase plans to introduce “low-latency performance,” the company said in a blog post, using a term in the exchange industry that means extremely fast processing times. Coinbase also said it would allow trading firms to place their servers directly in its data center, a practice called co-location. HFT firms often put their servers next to the computers that power exchanges like Nasdaq Inc. or the New York Stock Exchange, to minimize the split-second delays associated with transmitting data back and forth between the trading firm and the exchange.\nAccording to Coinbase, the plan will benefit customers by reducing bid-ask spreads—the difference between the buying and selling price of an asset. Advocates of HFT say the growth of high-speed trading in the stock market over the past two decades helped drive bid-ask spreads down to just one penny in many big stocks. But Coinbase’s move is likely to raise eyebrows, since many investors view high-speed traders with suspicion. Critics like Michael Lewis, author of the 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys,” have alleged that HFT firms take advantage of slower-moving players.\nRead an extended version of this article at WSJ.com.\nPopular on WSJ.com Tesla CEO Musk Says Company Is ‘Flattening Management Structure’ in Reorganization At Mueller Probe’s First Trial, Expect More Blunt Lectures From the Bench", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-mueller-probes-first-trial-expect-more-blunt-lectures-from-the-bench-1526385601?mod=trending_now_4", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-ceo-musk-says-company-is-flattening-management-structure-inreorganization-1526308678?mod=trending_now_1", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-bitcoin-exchange-welcomes-high-speed-traders-1526385600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "tabb group llc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:05:08.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ffef9abbd21e1ad8e22e44d9655b726992a68bf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7ONEF9cAKQzW7E.auJLsZA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ffef9abbd21e1ad8e22e44d9655b726992a68bf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7ONEF9cAKQzW7E.auJLsZA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nStart earning today, keep your income in your BTC wallet and it will be getting worth more in USD because Bitcoin exchange rate is constantly rising.

Alan Sugar: ‘They Are Scum’\nKnown for his less than subtle remarks and one-liners in the BBC TV series The Apprentice, 71-year-old Sugar has now spoken out against scams relating to cryptocurrencies. Taking to social media, he warned his followers about an advert from Bitcointrader claiming that he was endorsing their advertisement. WARNING: Please ignore an advert from Bitcointrader suggesting I endorse their offerings. They are SCUM it is a total scam. Please pass this on to all your friends particularly the elderly who are falling for this terrible scam #BITCOINTRADERSCAM\n— Lord Sugar (@Lord_Sugar) May 15, 2018\nUnfortunately, with rising interest being seen within the cryptocurrency market, scammers are seeing the potential they present and are turning to them to make a profit from unsuspecting victims. As a result, they are using the faces of well-known individuals to further their cause and make their adverts seem legit.\nAccording to Action Fraud, the U.K.’s national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre, in March consumers were tricked into transferring a total of £34,000 by fraudsters in 21 separate cryptocurrency cases, reported the Independent . The report quoted Pauline Smith, director of Action Fraud, as stating that fraudsters were opportunistic and were ‘doing everything they can’ to defraud unsuspecting victims.\nOther celebrities that have had their images used to promote cryptocurrency scams include Deborah Meaden, known for her role in the TV series Dragons’ Den . MoneySavingExpert Martin Lewis is another individual who has had his image and reputation used for crypto scams. As a presenter on ITV’s The Martin Lewis Money Show, he took matters to another level last month after he announced that he had issued high court proceedings against social media platform Facebook as a result.\nAt the time, Lewis reported that there had been more than 50 fake adverts with his name posted on the platform that had likely been ‘seen by millions of people in the U.K.’ A few of the get-rich-quick schemes that he mentioned included ‘Bitcoin Code’ and ‘Cloud Trader.’\n“Enough is enough,” he said. “I’ve been fighting for over a year to stop Facebook letting scammers use my name and face to rip off vulnerable people – yet it continues.”\nThe U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also expressed concern about the risks that cryptocurrency scams present to young people. At the beginning of the year, the authority released a warning ‘urging the public to be vigilant to the threat of online investment fraud.’ These included binary options, contracts for difference (CFDs), forex, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin it noted.

RSK to Add Smart Contract Functionality to Bitcoin\nThe RSK project — which aims to build Turing-complete smart-contract capabilities for the Bitcoin blockchain — is partnering with iExec in an effort to provide off-chain computing to Bitcoin applications and afford decentralized applications the ability to access on-demand and scalable cloud computing resources.\nAccording to a Medium post from iExec editor Wassim Bendella, “the developers under RSK aim at adding value and functionality to [Bitcoin’s] ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, near instant payments and higher scalability.”\nThis seemingly makes RSK the first general purpose smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin network, as it uses BTC as its native currency via a 2-Way Peg system. Said system guarantees a fixed conversion between SBTC and BTC at a ratio of one-to-one.\nAt the same time, iExec is busy developing the self-proclaimed “first blockchain-based decentralized cloud computing network,” which “allows participants who need computing power to meet those who own computing power, thus supporting the most compute-intensive blockchain applications.”\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is not only the originator but the most battle-tested on the planet. By joining forces, the two companies are pushing the tried-and-true Bitcoin blockchain even further into the future.\n— RSK (@RSKsmart) May 15, 2018\nThe next update from iExec will be coming this month. On Max 29, iExec is slated to release its V2, which is comprised of a decentralized marketplace for the trading of cloud resources. Explains Bendella:\nOnce V2 is made compatible with RSK as a next milestone, RSK applications and their smart contracts will be able to access the same decentralized cloud that Ethereum dapps make use of. Compute-intensive applications in the fields of fintech, artificial intelligence, scientific research or gaming will be able to leverage these resources, making RSK and iExec the backbone of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nWhat do you think about smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain?

Experts are unsure", "text": "How much energy does Bitcoin mining require? Experts are unsure By - May 21, 2018\nHow much energy does crypto mining really use? One recently released study conducted by Alex de Vries says that Bitcoin mining consumes 24 THw of energy or as much as Ireland. To make matters worse, the study estimates that Bitcoin’s energy use is doubling every six months. By the end of 2018, Bitcoin could use as much as 67 THw or the annual energy consumption of the Czech Republic.\nWhile those numbers might seem high, things may not be as bad as they sound. For starters, one of the main issues with Bitcoin mining is that it was originally powered in large part by coal plants in China. In recent years, however, China has worked to rein in its pollution problem, and many Bitcoin mining operations have moved to countries which make use of cleaner energy.\nAnother issue is the matter of distribution. Comparing Bitcoin’s energy usage to countries such as Ireland or the Czech Republic is useful to help visualize the scope of their operations, but that doesn’t tell the full story. Bitcoin mining can happen from anywhere in the world so no one country’s infrastructure is bearing the brunt of the cost.\nBeyond that, there are numerous experts who dispute this study’s findings. Jonathan Koomey, a professor at Stanford who, in the 1990s, disproved similar fears about the internet, says there simply isn’t enough data available to draw conclusions.\n“For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing,” Koomey told NBC News. “My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.”\nOne of the issues Koomey points out is that it is difficult to determine how the value of the energy used in Bitcoin mining and the price paid for that energy. He is unsure of where de Vries is getting the two numbers he uses for those values.\n“The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,” said Koomey. “There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.”\nThe other issue is the accessibility of Bitcoin data. Many Bitcoin miners are concerned about their privacy which can make it difficult to accurately determine how much energy is used.\nThe mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies does consume a fair amount of energy, but it’s unclear as to exactly how much.

JPMorgan’s Lack Of ‘Substance’\n“What I said wasn’t anything special,” he subsequently summarized on Twitter.\nI verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn’t get anything of substance from the presentation.\nThe mood appeared friendly, Song also thanking for Baldet and Lubin for being “good sports” but nonetheless underscoring the frustration shared by many technical experts in the cryptocurrency industry about blockchain – that commercial parties can present the technology and rely on a lack of understanding to give their solutions free passage.\n“Giving voice to something that you know is true often results in shock and laughter. That’s what I saw,” Song continued.\nThe entire crowd had been eating non-stop stories about how everything was going to change for the better because of the new tech, usually sponsored by a panelist. 5/ What I said wasn't anything special.

The correction down followed and EOS/BTC went down to btc 0.0015 where it has rejected the support confirmed by two Fibonacci retracement levels.\nLooks like EOS should continue the uptrend from the current price, and could reach btc 0.0031 in the coming weeks. The btc 0.0031 resistance is confirmed by two Fibonacci retracement levels, 327.2% and 1227.2%.\nOn a downside, EOS still is expected to consolidate for some time and could reach 200 Moving Average or an uptrend trendline, which should also be considered as a potential support.\nThanks for reading!

In a widely shared blog post, Siacoin’s lead developer David Vorick lifted the lid on the cutthroat ASIC mining business. In a response, Bitmain praised Vorick’s input to the industry – but took exception to one particular section of his writeup.\nAlso read: Siacoin Developer: ASICS Are “Money Printing Machines” for Manufacturers Bitmain Breaks Its Silence\nBitmain is a company of few words, preferring to let its ruthlessly efficient ASIC miners do the talking. It was stirred into breaking its silence, however, after an explosive blog post by David Vorick was published three days ago. The lengthy article contained a number of revelations and allegations about the cryptocurrency mining business, and Bitmain’s role in particular.\nAs we reported : “Siacoin’s lead developer repeats claims he has heard that “Bitmain plays dirty”. Vorick was allegedly told that Bitmain would use its power to stop other ASIC companies from manufacturing in China. Despite going to great pains to conceal Obelisk’s involvement in such a deal, the Chinese manufacturer backed out suddenly in a move that reportedly cost Obelisk $2 million. There is no proof that the manufacturer was leaned on by Bitmain, but David Vorick leaves no doubt as to where his suspicions lie.”\nNot content to take this accusation lying down, Bitmain has hit back, retorting : “Considering the truly vast number and diversity of suppliers in China, it’s difficult to consider that Bitmain could possibly exert such powerful control over a competitor’s supply chain to the degree the article suggests.” Interestingly, Bitmain doesn’t outright deny the allegation, focusing instead on the fact that “six percent of [Vorick’s] total article” is taken up with exploring these supposed dirty tricks. A Few Words From One of the Industry’s Most Furtive Organizations The new Obelisk ASIC miner\nDavid Vorick’s blog post was a 5,300-word tour de force. Bitmain’s riposte, in comparison, runs to just 380 words, which provide just enough space in which to refute allegations of “dirty tricks” and the notion that “Bitmain floods the market with its mining rigs”. It’s curious that the mining company should choose to address this latter point, because nowhere in Vorick’s article does he accuse the company of flooding the market with rigs per se. He does though accuse the company of various other underhand tactics, such as mining with its own units and then shipping them once they’re no longer profitable, but Bitmain makes no mention of this.\nAs David Vorick acknowledged in his blog, it is extremely difficult to prove his audacious claims. If a large ASIC manufacturer was to conspire with a domestic supplier to thwart a rival, there would be no paper trail to go on.

He has told that the cryptocurrency, most popular in the world, is “the best option for investment of capital”. Dreyper more than once said about the love to cryptocurrencies publicly – even for the last half a year he spoke about their advantages more than once. Recently he has told that by 2022 the bitcoin will cost 250 000 dollars, and in February of this year has foretold that “cryptocurrencies will conquer the world”. Last fall he has made even more bold statement, having told that in five years of cryptocurrency will take the place of fiatny money. Last week he has also not missed an opportunity again to sing of bitcoin. He has told:\n“There is revolution which allows to receive the best currency now – safer, decentralized, more effective and useful. It influences for the whole world. It is available to all. She allows people to send money to the families on Philippines or to Mexico without problems. It is much the best currency, than traditional money”.\nGreat number of sceptics still prefer the state currencies and traditional bank infrastructure. Dreyper, however, considers similar preferences unreasonable:\n“Banks constantly are attacked. Hackers find gaps in your banks and follow your money, and bankers beat off, trying to prevent breakings, but unsuccessfully. Nobody managed to crack the Bitcoin blockchain. This safest place for placement of your money. As the way of saving the capital is an excellent option”.\nThough it can seem silly for the profane person or skeptically adjusted investor, Dreyper has urged to think of a condition of fiatny currencies in the countries with the falling economies. He has told:\n“If you are in Argentina, Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that the state currency will lose in price of 30% every year, the economy of these countries can fail at any time. And people lose the state. But if the part of your fortune is placed in bitcoin, you will be able to keep it”.\nAt last, Dreyper has told journalists of CNBC that the bitcoin is not just a whim. More likely, it “future of the world”. He has explained:\n“For this purpose there are a lot of reasons, as well as opportunities of his use. The bitcoin will seriously affect the future of the whole world. It is large break, and I can’t wait when we are all we will use the single currency independent of desire of politicians. It is an excellent opportunity for people to operate the companies, not to depend on political whims”.

And while digital currency is still not widely used or understood by many average consumers, Chicago's two main exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, became the first traditional exchanges to trade the financial products late last year, lending credibility to bitcoin and its lesser-known digital brethren.\nCoinbase is already one of the largest digital currency exchanges around the world. Coinbase's Chicago office will serve as a central hub for some back-office technology behind the company's products, said Paul Bauerschmidt, a former CME executive, who is leading the Chicago office.\n\"It's similar to an exchange that you'd see with ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) or CME or CBOE,\" he said.\nRecruiting people who are able to build and maintain these complicated systems, especially with financial experience, is difficult in other cities, Bauerschmidt said.\n\"The talent that's here in Chicago, you can't find anywhere else,\" he said. \"And especially getting as many of the key staff as we need. It's really exciting to be able to build it here.\"\nThe Chicago office also will focus on courting institutional investors, which manage assets on others' behalf, like banks, hedge funds, mutual funds or pension funds, Bauerschmidt said.\nIn concert with the Chicago launch, Coinbase is unveiling Coinbase Prime, a collection of tools and services specifically for those institutional investors. The products make it easier for these large investors to start trading and manage sophisticated trading systems, Bauerschmidt said.\nThe Chicago office currently has just six employees, but it plans to get that number up to 30 this year and reach 100 within three years.\nBitcoin's initial trading value was just pennies in 2010, surging to more than $17,000 at one point in late 2017. It's now trading at just under $9,000. At this point last year, a single bitcoin was worth about $1,800; two years ago it was $445.\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as an alternative to government-issued currency. A number of big companies accept it, from travel website Expedia.com to Subway sandwich shops and even online dating site OkCupid. But because it isn't regulated by a country or other single entity like traditional currency, the price can be volatile.

Alan Sugar: ‘They Are Scum’\nKnown for his less than subtle remarks and one-liners in the BBC TV series The Apprentice, 71-year-old Sugar has now spoken out against scams relating to cryptocurrencies. Taking to social media, he warned his followers about an advert from Bitcointrader claiming that he was endorsing their advertisement. WARNING: Please ignore an advert from Bitcointrader suggesting I endorse their offerings. They are SCUM it is a total scam. Please pass this on to all your friends particularly the elderly who are falling for this terrible scam #BITCOINTRADERSCAM\n— Lord Sugar (@Lord_Sugar) May 15, 2018\nUnfortunately, with rising interest being seen within the cryptocurrency market, scammers are seeing the potential they present and are turning to them to make a profit from unsuspecting victims. As a result, they are using the faces of well-known individuals to further their cause and make their adverts seem legit.\nAccording to Action Fraud, the U.K.’s national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre, in March consumers were tricked into transferring a total of £34,000 by fraudsters in 21 separate cryptocurrency cases, reported the Independent . The report quoted Pauline Smith, director of Action Fraud, as stating that fraudsters were opportunistic and were ‘doing everything they can’ to defraud unsuspecting victims.\nOther celebrities that have had their images used to promote cryptocurrency scams include Deborah Meaden, known for her role in the TV series Dragons’ Den . MoneySavingExpert Martin Lewis is another individual who has had his image and reputation used for crypto scams. As a presenter on ITV’s The Martin Lewis Money Show, he took matters to another level last month after he announced that he had issued high court proceedings against social media platform Facebook as a result.\nAt the time, Lewis reported that there had been more than 50 fake adverts with his name posted on the platform that had likely been ‘seen by millions of people in the U.K.’ A few of the get-rich-quick schemes that he mentioned included ‘Bitcoin Code’ and ‘Cloud Trader.’\n“Enough is enough,” he said. “I’ve been fighting for over a year to stop Facebook letting scammers use my name and face to rip off vulnerable people – yet it continues.”\nThe U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also expressed concern about the risks that cryptocurrency scams present to young people. At the beginning of the year, the authority released a warning ‘urging the public to be vigilant to the threat of online investment fraud.’ These included binary options, contracts for difference (CFDs), forex, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin it noted.

This number continues to grow today. 10 new projects are launched every day, and this is only according to official listings.\nThe problem here is that it can be difficult to ascertain their quality. Frankly, two-thirds are clear scams or are simply using hype to collect money, and only one part is actually a profitable investment. It’s only 42% of 877 ICO projects that have reached completion and financial success according to analysis conducted by the magazine “Bitcoin Market”. So why continue with the creation of new projects? Obviously, it brings a lot of benefits, but not everyone understands that an ICO is a new method of crowdfunding for any business.\nGenerally, ICOs which are conducted by large companies have their own staff and complex models for the sale and release of their tokens, which can be quite difficult to unify. Small projects suffer from this most. With all the saturation, they are easily overlooked. Often, business representatives are either afraid of a new field in which they do not have expertise or they make a number of mistakes in the process.\nSmall businesses need to generate interest in the ICO sphere. And they need to do it in such a way that even the technologically uninformed can begin to use an alternative means of investment. In general, a Token is a new currency that can serve businesses, charities, or even personal PR. Created tokens provide every possible option for the use of currencies and methods of payment between people without touching hard currency.\nAny company can launch its own ICO project. For any ICO, it’s necessary to approach the process step by step. The first stage is the formation of an idea and investigation as to its likelihood of acceptance by the intended audience. There have been cases in which communities were formed based only on an idea, and in these communities business partners were found and ICOs were launched.\nFurthermore, the basic step of creation of a smart contract code is its test launch and refinement – the main step without which the project will not take place. For this, you need not just professional programmers but also an experienced professional in the sphere of blockchain. The process of creating a smart contract is complicated, the slightest error in the code can lead to multi-million dollar losses. Not so long ago, the promising startup BeeCoin was hacked. Hackers were able to access the database and inboxes of users which allowed them to collect more than $ 1 million.\nAfter the creation of a smart contract and the team, you can begin with the stage of initial investments, the so-called pre-sale. Tokens are sold at a certain discount to attract investors. Investors are very important in the early stages of an ICO because they usually help the project with future promotion: they help to attract new members of the team, advisors, recommendations to friends, adjusting or correcting the idea, and can help with writing Whitepaper and so on. Marketing and PR promotion also remain. The easiest way to take care of this is to hire a specialized agency and trust the professionals.\nFor people without technical knowledge and distant from blockchain as a whole, several all-encompassing methods can be used. Let’s take a look at the main ones.\nThe first one is the most obvious – hire programmers. But it takes a long time to configure the entire infrastructure and start work. Additionally, only writing a smart contract, which takes about three weeks, costs about $8,500. As mentioned above, errors in the code are grave. It is vital to understand how the code created by the hired team is possible only during the process of creation. Moreover, the code could be hacked and all investments withdrawn. This is a highly risky method.\nThe second is to order a full project creation from an ICO agency. They sell a pack of services which usually includes writing code, marketing, PR-promotion, etc., all together for about $250,000. It’s always easy just to pay and wait for the result, but again there is no guarantee that programmers will create a secure code.\nThe third way is to create the project yourself via existing online architects. Users only need to fill in the information into the ready to use template and receive the code. Users can start collecting first investments right after the code is posted on the ICO project site. Such offers already exist on the market but not all of them are fully formed: Token Wizard. Here, an unprepared user will find it difficult to create a contract. additional software and lots of special knowledge are required. Etherparty and BlockCAT are the most famous projects in the world of smart contracts that allow creation of a token and a Сrowdsale contract. At the moment, projects have no complete solution for Ethereum (both platforms are in the Beta version). MyWish is a fully functioning open-source platform for creating all kinds of contracts. It has a simple interface and does not require installation of additional software.\nYou need to choose the one where the creation of a smart contract is fully available and where there is no need for additional software installation many projects are engaged professionally in creating SC through their own platforms. They already have the basis of a proven code that does not need to be rewritten again and again, which guarantees reliability and lowers the cost of creation. For example, the MyWish contract is created in such a way that management possibilities are open solely to the creator. This is a great advantage that doesn’t allow hackers to access the code data. Therefore, you can avoid the additional vulnerability audit traditionally done by companies that have launched their ICOs.\n315 Crowdsale contracts have been created on this platform, 25 of which are active. In addition to a Crowdsale contract on MyWish, you can create a Token contract, so there is an opportunity to create not a whole project but just a coin.\nThere are examples of companies where tokens are issued to motivate their employees. For example, a certain amount of tokens is transferred to employees monthly, along with the salary, and at the end of the year part of the company’s revenue is transferred to this token. In other words, it becomes real money at the end of the year. This is a convenient mechanism of domestic currency for anything: employee motivation, loyalty program, etc.\nThe crypto sphere as a whole is still developing and its benefits can be used for the development of its own business. Despite some difficulties and errors, the technology of blockchain is promising, so don’t be afraid to create an ICO or Token. Entrepreneurs and companies that are not even involved in the IT sphere can simply and quickly create their own smart contract by choosing the path of implementation that is suitable for their needs and goals.\nImages courtesy of MyWish ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:06:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c43538b21a84f35d3e2653ce8c5cdde826ce1e6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/QRQg5Edh7qCtiQoXf4MGfO8iukZqZHeVdqjZYIje9rMhv.ADO462QxRIA6Hqvmw1Npi2gxN1R9T0OtL5NzoPhleR0ZnQmvYlGpCO7LGkXMwwpi4BFdD7irFkXPJiRB8X", "site_full": "35.202.202.190", "site": "35.202.202.190", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Winklevoss Twins' Gemini Exchange Unexpectedly Adds ZCash | nCrypto!

Bitcoin, Ethereum, ICO, Blockchain & Cryptocurrency News", "text": "Winklevoss Twins’ Gemini Exchange Unexpectedly Adds ZCash\nNick Chong · May 15, 2018 · 4:00 am\nThe New-York based Gemini cryptocurrency exchange just announced the addition of 3 new cryptocurrencies to their trading lineup. The most surprising addition being ZCash, which was not expected by anybody in the community. ZCash: Privacy Focused, But On a Regulated Exchange\nThe week of the Consensus conference has always been a week of news, innovation, and announcements from major players in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. It seems that this year’s Consensus is no different with the Gemini exchange announcing that they will be adding ZCash with plans to add Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash in the near future.\nThe most surprising of these currencies is ZCash, however, as the additions of Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash were expected by the community for a considerable amount of time.\nWhen news broke out about the announcement of the addition of ZCash, the price of the privacy coin went from $250 to $350 within an hour, in expectation of increased volume, market reach, and publicity. Winklevoss brothers are adding privacy-focused Zcash to their Gemini cryptocurrency exchange https://t.co/D9JoIUXa8R pic.twitter.com/PPDr7wYRDK\n— Forbes (@Forbes) May 14, 2018\nOn May 14th, Gemini received official approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to open Gemini for ZCash deposits on May 19th and ZCash trading 3 days later. Gemini will offer the ZEC/USD, ZEC/BTC, and the ZEC/ETH trading pairs upon launch.\nGemini will also continue to offer block trading, which they announced earlier last month, along with their daily auction of cryptocurrencies and will adapt these things with the arrival of the new cryptocurrency on the platform.\nSurprisingly, the exchange also seemed to be hopeful about the privacy features of ZCash when its blog mentioned:\nThe Zcash protocol’s cutting edge use of zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (“zk-SNARKS” or “zero-knowledge proofs”) makes it a truly innovative privacy coin that offers confidentiality for peer-to-peer transactions\nZCash provides 2 different types of addresses on the platform, shielded and unshielded addresses. The latter showing the balance of the wallet and transaction balances going in and out. However, shielded addresses provide a high level of privacy for users, as their balance and transaction balances are made private on the blockchain.\nContrary to popular belief, ZCash does not offer full anonymity as their protocol does not obfuscate user’s IP addresses. Although some may perceive this as a downside, this was never ZCash’s goal, and never will be.\nDespite this, withdrawing ZCash to shielded addresses will not be allowed for ZCash traders on Gemini at this time, though this seems to undermine the entire point of using a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\nThis issue of this loss of privacy has probably something to do with the regulatory laws and oversight, which try to stop money laundering methods. However, the blog did mention that they may accept withdrawals to shielded addresses at a later date.\nIn the same announcement, the NYDFS also announced that they had also fully approved the addition of Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, the 6th and 4th largest cryptos by market cap, respectively. However, the full integrations of these other cryptocurrencies onto the exchange have not been announced as of yet.\nGemini has long been a ‘good boy’ in terms of receiving the proper licensing and permission from regulatory bodies to operate their services as they are one of the few businesses to be granted the infamous New York BitLicense.\nFrom the start, Gemini’s founders, the Winklevoss twins , sought to be a regulated and licensed exchange which would be different from other exchanges which were present in the market.\nGemini founder believe that being regulated “fosters innovation and protects consumers.” Although this may be true, this could be its downfall as users may seek exchanges operating without governments looking over their shoulders.\nDo you think that the addition of these coins will be a successful venture for the Gemini Exchange?

This week’s ascending channel with current support at $8,480 is intact on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now trading nicely above the $8,500 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Bitcoin price is following a bullish path above $8,600 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD has to move above $9,000 to accelerate gains in the near term. Bitcoin Price Analysis There was a slow and steady rise in bitcoin price above the $8,500 resistance against the US Dollar. The price traded higher and even broke the $8,600 resistance level to settle above the 100 hourly simple moving average. The upside move was positive, as the price traded close to the $8,900 resistance level. A high was formed at $8,899 before the price started a downside correction. It moved down and traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,305 low to $8,899 high. However, the price remains well supported on the downside above the $8,500 level. An immediate key support is at $8,600, which is the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,305 low to $8,899 high. Furthermore, the 100 hourly SMA is positioned near $8,550 to prevent declines in the near term. Additionally, this week’s ascending channel with current support at $8,480 is intact on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Looking at the chart , the price is placed nicely above $8,500 and the 100 hourly SMA. Therefore, as long as the price is above $8,500, it could continue to move higher towards $9,000. A break above $9,000 will most likely confirm a solid bullish bias towards $10,000. Looking at the technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently moving lower towards the 50 level.

Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company's co-chairman Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China’s push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. All the banks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCanaan’s IPO valuation has yet to be set as there is no listed comparable and the prices of cryptocurrencies have\nfluctuated a lot, reported IFR. It was valued at $500 million in mid-2017, IFR said, attributing it to one of the people.\n(Reporting by Fiona Lau at IFR; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang; Writing by Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ebang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiona lau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ifr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national equities exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T09:27:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e47d104cf3bbd159de710844db3123efc2864224", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVWGqe7TEz73Bh1PEZNPM6IfdmbBPn4QWMKMEmm6iSbed8DrnYJ4KtYGhNS_wtZuvLEZHynVGmsVg32Rre5.UKYaZMqrGBkRMe", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Samourai Wallet Creates App for Transactions Over Mesh Networks - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Samourai Wallet Creates App for Transactions Over Mesh Networks - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tenna.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e47d104cf3bbd159de710844db3123efc2864224", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVWGqe7TEz73Bh1PEZNPM6IfdmbBPn4QWMKMEmm6iSbed8DrnYJ4KtYGhNS_wtZuvLEZHynVGmsVg32Rre5.UKYaZMqrGBkRMe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Avi Mizrahi", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Samourai Wallet Creates App for Transactions Over Mesh Networks - Bitcoin News", "text": "Samourai Wallet Creates App for Transactions Over Mesh Networks – Bitcoin News\nTechnology\nEver worried about how will you be able to transact if your ISP (internet service provider) will try to prevent you from sending a transaction or will just not be able to due to a disaster bringing down the needed infrastructure? Setting up mesh networks, which can self-organize without a centralized control hub, is one much talked about possible solution.\nAlso Read: NY Regulator Approves Bitcoin Cash, Zcash and Litecoin Trading Bitcoin Mesh Network\nThe developers of the privacy-centric wallet, Samourai , have teamed up with Gotenna, a Brooklyn-based startup that designs technologies for off-grid and decentralized communications. Together the two teams have created a solution for making transactions over mesh networks. The Txtenna app is meant to enable a more resilient, censorship-resistant and decentralized network for when the internet is inaccessible.\nA transaction using the app will begin with the user creating a standard offline transaction and signing it using the Samourai Wallet. The wallet then passes the transaction to Txtenna which broadcasts it to nearby mesh nodes via a Gotenna mesh device. Similar devices in the area relay the transaction until an internet connected node receives it and forwards it to the network. Its developers say that the Gotenna mesh is a simple, affordable, secure, and resilient solution, but you will obviously need to have access to one of their physical devices beforehand for this to work. Off the Grid\n“Currently the bitcoin peer-to-peer network relies heavily on ISPs for internet connectivity. A few large corporations run these services, many of which are regional or national monopolies. These companies have a track record of putting commercial interests above net neutrality, as they did in 2007/2008 for example, when Comcast secretly throttled Bittorrent traffic. These systems are centralized, making them fragile during natural and man-made disasters,” explained Richard Myers a decentralized applications engineer at Gotenna.\nMesh networking isn’t the only option the Samourai team is working on to make sure users can transact when the internet is down. Back in January they have revealed a new proprietary app called Pony Direct , a transaction payment method (or to act as a relay) to send bitcoin via short message service (SMS) texts.\nWhat other applications do you see for this technology?

Here, I define you polarity of bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrency. Digital Bitcoin Money Uncensored Everyone is aware of this bitcoin technology that is best and superior digital cryptocurrency in the world and rising rapidly in the digital cryptocurrency world. That is truly decentralized open-source cryptocurrency. That is invented peer to peer digital cash system in 2008 to provide the conventional digital banking system. The inventor of Bitcoin wanted to build bitcoin blockchain and protocols to make easier services like handle bitcoin and storing all transaction records on the bitcoin network. Alternatively, the bitcoin blockchain service transfers the bitcoin value which is digital money. The Bitcoin development process is based on cryptocurrency mining that is carried on bitcoin blockchain development. Also, you can send the bitcoin without an attempt from central bank or governance. The services of bitcoin are not depended on any third party authentication like banks, third-party API etc because the blockchain access process is based on SHA-256 algorithm and proof of work development. Ethereum: More Than Real Money At present time the ICO token is based on Ethereum so we can say that the Ethereum is not a purely digital currency but you need to understand Ethereum currency transaction that is based on blockchain service. It’s similar to bitcoin blockchain that handles digital currency account and transaction records with development programming code execution. These type of programming code is stored every transaction record for future reference. Also Read: A Step-by-Step Guide to Bitcoin Cash Mining Alternatively, in this digital currency, you can execute or make a smart contract which is done by the Ethereum virtual machine with help of Ethereum development native programming language that’s why it’s known as a programmable money in the digital cryptocurrency market. It is fully blockchain based decentralized programmable software platform that is mention as an ETH in cryptocurrency language and access on the Ethereum blockchain network. The release method of this currency is based on Pre-Sale. Major Difference in Bitcoin and Ethereum The Bitcoin develop 12.5 fresh bitcoin in every 10 minutes but the Ethereum develop 3 new ETHER in every 15 seconds. The Bitcoin builds a new block in every 10 minutes and Ethereum builds a new block in 15 seconds. The Bitcoin is based on scripting programming language development but the Ethereum is based on general purpose integrated programming language. On the Bitcoin can be done 4 transactions per second but the Ethereum can be done 15 roughly. The Bitcoin is based on SHA-256 hashing algorithm and Ethereum is based on KECCAK-256. The Bitcoin is based on single account type but the Ethereum based on two account type: user fund and computer code.

Poulos forecasts that cryptocurrencies are here to stay saying, “We ain’t seen nothing yet. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. As time goes on, I believe that we’re going to see cryptocurrencies become more and more legitimized, playing a greater and greater role in the economies of the world.” This projection comes as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launches Ethereum indexes, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange considers allowing investors to buy and hold bitcoin, and Warren Buffet equates bitcoin to “rat poison”. Monday, May 14, 2018, CNBC reported that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched two indexes for Ethereum. CME explained that they have no current plans for launching Ethereum futures however, CME did launch bitcoin futures in December 2017. This came a little over a year after they launched bitcoin indexes.\nCointelegraph recently reported (May 8, 2018) that Intercontinental Exchange, the owners of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), were contemplating allowing investors to buy and hold bitcoin.\nPoulos went on to say, “There are several noted publications that are trying to profit off of scare tactics around cryptocurrency’s impending doom, saying that bitcoin is going to zero in the near term. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. A few months ago, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched futures contracts for bitcoin. This would not be happening unless the financial powers to be believed in the future of cryptocurrencies and believed that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. The CME then followed up on that action, launching yet another cryptocurrency futures contract, this time for Ethereum. Now you have two of the major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, both being traded through a regulated exchange. Not any exchange, a government-regulated exchange is trading both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. That is legitimizing cryptocurrencies.”\nPoulos continued, “Now you hear that The New York Stock Exchange, according to The New York Times, is considering letting customers buy and hold Bitcoin. They would do so through some sort of a swap investment vehicle that would settle in a couple of days, in Bitcoin. I won’t go into all those details because up till now it's just hearsay—but stay tuned.”\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is a U.S. based financial and commodity derivative exchange. It is located in Chicago, Illinois and was founded in 1898. The exchange is also popularly referred to as “The Merc” or “The Chicago Merc”. It is owned by the CME Group.\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a United States stock exchange located in New York, New York. It was founded on May 17, 1792 and is owned by Intercontinental Exchange. Going by market capitalization, the NYSE is the largest stock exchange in the world.\nPoulos concluded, “All of this going on day-by-day, week-by-week further legitimizes cryptocurrencies and yet, you’ll still hear from the likes of Warren Buffett, equating Bitcoin to rat poison. When Warren Buffett makes those statements, he's doing it as a way to contrast his entire investing career (around value-based investing) against a digital currency that has no inherent value in and of itself. You have to understand the context within which he's commenting. If I were a betting person, I would take Warren Buffett's comment with a grain of salt.”\nWarren Buffet recently said that bitcoin “is probably rat poison squared.” Buffet is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a billionaire investor. He became involved with Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and helped grow it into the company it is today. As of February 2018, Buffet had a net worth of almost $83 billion.\nBill Poulos is cofounder and president of Profits Run Inc.

The document updates the anti-money laundering legislation of the European Union to address, among other issues, “the risks linked to virtual currencies.” The new rules aim to reduce anonymity for both users and transactions with requirements for know-your-customer procedures that crypto platforms will have to implement. Meanwhile, a high-ranking ECB official has called for segregating the crypto business from traditional finances.\nAlso read: Europe Introduces Customer Verification on Cryptocurrency Exchanges\nAuthorities to Monitor the Use of Cryptocurrencies\n“Strengthening EU rules to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing” has been declared as the main purpose for the changes adopted as part of an “action plan” launched after the terrorist attacks in Europe in 2016. The new directive sets out to “close down criminal finance without hindering the normal functioning of the payment systems,” according to the Council’s press service. The amendments to EU Directive 2015/849 of the European Parliament and the Council of May 20, 2015, were adopted at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, without discussion. The move follows an agreement with the European Parliament form December 2017. In April this year, MEPs voted to support the deal to “bring cryptocurrencies under closer regulation.”\nThe main changes involve addressing the “risks linked to virtual currencies” by taking steps to reduce anonymity for both crypto traders and crypto-related transactions. According to the texts, providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies, as well as custodian wallet providers, will be obliged to identify suspicious activities. The directive states that authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies through these platforms, and the national financial intelligence units should have access to information allowing them to associate crypto addresses with the identities of their owners.\nThe authors acknowledge that the measures in the document do not entirely address the issue of anonymity. These measures should be detailed by member-states which will have 18 months to transpose the provisions of the directive into their national regulatory frameworks. Once that happens, crypto exchanges across the Union will be obliged to comply with stricter anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) guidelines, including by introducing full customer verification on their platforms.\nSome companies have already taken steps in that direction. Localbitcoins , the popular Helsinki-based peer-to-peer exchange, has recently updated its Terms of Service . It admitted that the changes had been introduced mainly due to EU regulations .

The new terms will be enforced as early as this month.\nVirtual Currencies Defined\nThe EU Council states that “virtual currencies should not to be confused with electronic money.” Its directive points out that although cryptos can be used as a means of payment, they could also serve other purposes and find broader applications such as means of exchange, investment, and store-of-value.\nA definition of “virtual currencies” has been provided, in which they have been referred to as “digital representation of value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority.” The directive also notes that cryptocurrencies are not attached to a legally established currency and do not have the legal status of fiat money, but are accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange. Cryptocurrencies can be transferred, stored and traded electronically, the text reads.\nThe European institution has identified custodian wallet providers as “entities safeguarding private Facebook Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "europe introduces customer verification", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T06:23:20.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d85d02daf9ac6d4379ec8708b26e5192a08c6123", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4F4lZuD4woz5aiF8OkembYgZRpYGzW7AXelz8iChRGEEHafNgQEqE9wP8Cr5YP3V2EHE3F8LYM5D3EdvNEenspw--", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why 'Bitcoin Jesus' is so bullish about Bitcoin cash", "title_full": "Why 'Bitcoin Jesus' is so bullish about Bitcoin cash", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/12/02/101237533-10264_Roger-Ver-2.1910x1000.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 254, "comments": 0, "shares": 254}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d85d02daf9ac6d4379ec8708b26e5192a08c6123", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4F4lZuD4woz5aiF8OkembYgZRpYGzW7AXelz8iChRGEEHafNgQEqE9wP8Cr5YP3V2EHE3F8LYM5D3EdvNEenspw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kellie Ell", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why 'Bitcoin Jesus' is so bullish about Bitcoin cash", "text": "Cryptocurrency users and developers around the world are adopting bitcoin cash at faster rates than bitcoin core, Roger Ver, one of the first investors of bitcoin, told CNBC.\nBitcoin cash, a bitcoin offshoot, split off from bitcoin last year after a small group of developers decided to add upgrades that would improve transaction efficiency. The original Bitcoin is being referred to as Bitcoin core to differentiate it from the other version.\nBut Ver, who is sometimes called \" Bitcoin Jesus \" because he was one of the first investors of bitcoin , said the Bitcoin core software is \"slow, expensive and unreliable.\"\nInstead, he recommended bitcoin cash, which he said, is built specifically for transactions.\nVer said new innovation and infrastructures are being built on top of bitcoin cash, \"because it actually works.\"\n\"All of these existing businesses are building their new products on top of bitcoin cash, just like myself as the CEO of bitcoin.com,\" Ver said on \" Fast Money \" Tuesday. His website helps investors buy and store bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\"The economic path that bitcoin cash is on is the one that led to bitcoin's original success,\" Ver said. \"I'm incredibly bullish on bitcoin cash for the exact same reasons I was bullish on bitcoin back in 2011.\"\nOn Tuesday, bitcoin cash created a new blockchain with 32 MB block size limits. The software update immediately caused bitcoin cash's value to fall by about 5 percent.\nStill, at just above $1,300 Tuesday evening 6 p.m. ET, bitcoin cash is almost double its April 17 level of $763, when BKCM investment firm founder and CEO Brian Kelly predicted the coin would make a comeback later in the year.\nBitcoin cash was also the best performing large-cap cryptocurrency in the last month, beating out other large-cap digital coins like ethereum, ripple and traditional bitcoin.\nVer wasn't worried about Tuesday's sudden decline and even predicted bitcoin cash would double by the end of the year.\n\"That's what actually gives [bitcoin cash] its underlying value, that you can use it in commerce to pay for things. Whereas, a lot of these other tokens out there just kind of turn into speculative assets that don't actually have any utility.\"\n\"It's happening fast and furious around the world,\" he said. \"Bitcoin cash works as money; bitcoin core, sadly, no longer does.\"\nWATCH: Should you invest in a cryptocurrency? show chapters Should you invest in a cryptocurrency? 9:27 AM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 | 05:22 Disclaimer", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T06:48:22.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dc036571a4173bf3c02f01b197cf7cb270682bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3zyrILmzxRT2yE_nLhpe9I-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0dc036571a4173bf3c02f01b197cf7cb270682bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3zyrILmzxRT2yE_nLhpe9I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nCryptoTab work is based on a smart system, which dynamically switches mining between several cryptocurrencies for increasing profit up to 4x relative to continued mining of the only one cryptocurrency. Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates.

Albrecht says that Bitbond’s use of cryptocurrency will allow it to transfer money quicker and at a lower cost than standard banks.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” he told Reuters. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients who use Bitbond only hold onto the cryptocurrencies for a few minutes before they are exchanged for local currency. This ensures that clients won’t have to deal with the rather volatile cryptocurrency market.\nBitbond was founded in 2013 and has grown into an officially licensed bank with a large number of investors. Currently, Bitbond’s Berlin office employs 24 people from a dozen countries managing loans for about 100 clients. In total, the loans amount to about $1 million each month.\nAlbrecht says that the majority of his customers are small business owners or freelance workers who need a quick and affordable way to handle international loans. The loans are fairly small by the standards of most banks, and tend to be around $50,000 at the higher end of the scale.\nWhile Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans in the past, this is the first time that it has been used to facilitate international loans. It makes sense that Germany would be one of the first countries to attempt it, however. Adoption of Bitcoin has proceeded at a rapid rate within Germany. In terms of Bitcoin usage, it is second only to the United States.\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just now beginning to hit the mainstream, they still pose many risks not found in traditonal currencies. The largest is the simple fact that the various currencies tend to sharply fluctuate in value. This can make it risky as a long-term investment, but since Bitbond clients only hold the cryptocurrencies for a short amount of time, that risk is mitigated to some extent.\nFor more information about Bitcoin and the technology that makes it possible, check out our blockchain primer.

Greenberg announced May 14 that the county will begin accepting cryptocurrency for payment for various services this summer in order to eliminate heavy fees and improve payment accuracy and efficiency..\nThe office decided to accept the cryptocurrencies in an effort to streamline fee collection, reduce the potential for fraud and identity theft and increase the transparency and accuracy of payments. Greenberg’s office added that it does not perceive any “price volatility or risk to the County” in accepting the cryptocurrencies.\nGreenberg said in the statement:\n“The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.”\nThe collaboration with the Seminole County Tax Collector marks BitPay’s first government partnership. Head of compliance Jeremie Beaudry said the company was launched because “we recognized the potential for blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure and less expensive on a global scale.\n“With the Seminole County Tax Collector’s office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them,” he added. Earlier this month in the state of Arizona, a bill that would have allowed state residents to pay taxes using crypto was amended, removing the provisions which obligated the state to accept crypto. Instead, the bill merely obliges the Department of Revenue to “study” whether a taxpayer may “pay the taxpayer’s income tax liability by using a payment gateway, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin\nAlso this month, the city of Berkeley, California moved forward with an initiative to apply blockchain technology to public financing for community projects. The pilot project also aims to decrease the minimum price of a municipal bond from $5,000 to $10-25, which would allow more people to invest in municipal projects they support. Vice Mayor Ben Barlett added that, should the political process allow it, the city could consider issuing a type of token which would function much like a municipal bond in providing city funding.

The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app.\nCompliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities.\nEarlier this year , for instance, Jay Clayton, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said that, in his view, ICOs are “like a stock offering.” And, last month, at an MIT Tech Review event, Gary Gensler, former chairman of the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission, went so far as to advise virtual currency projects that “if you do an issuance now, in April of 2018, do it under the U.S. securities laws.”\nAs an alternative to doing an initial private offering (IPO), which requires projects to register with the SEC, many virtual currency projects are opting to structure their ICOs under exemptions, like regulation D and others, that limit token sales to accredited investors who can bear the risk of buying an unregulated security. These investors have to meet certain financial and economic requirements as spelled out by the SEC.\nNetki’s existing structure allows an investor who wants to participate in a token sale to use their phone or computer to take a “selfie” along with photos of their driver’s license or passport to show they are who they say they are. Netki now goes a step further by also making it easy for an investor to upload documents that prove his or her income and asset holdings to show they are accredited.\nWithout an automated solution like Netki’s, virtual currency projects would otherwise have to onboard customers manually or outsource the work to lawyers.\n“Doing it with their lawyers would be super expensive; doing it in-house would be slightly expensive and quite tedious and also prone to error,” Netki CEO and co-founder Justin Newton told Bitcoin Magazine .\nHe explained that Netki also uses algorithms to make sure the IDs are authentic. “We have a computer vision machine learning system that looks at every pixel of the ID for evidence of tampering,” he said.\nOnce the financial data is collected, Netki has a network of third-party lawyers and professionals who can validate the documents and provide letters of attestation.\nNetki says it never sees investors’ income data. “We just know that they met the standard and the only person that saw that was the professional who was doing that validation via confidentiality,” Newton said.\nOnce the customer onboarding is completed, Netki wipes the ID and income data from its system. “We don’t want to become a central PII [personal identity information] repository,” Newton said.\nNetki was founded by Justin Newton and wife Dawn Newton in July 2014. The following year, the duo launched a product called Wallet Name Service, which allows people to send bitcoin to human readable addresses. That product is still alive and kicking, says Newton. Over the last few years, however, Netki’s development efforts have focused on identity solutions. A year ago, it launched its digital ID service for KYC and AML.\n“We saw identity, and specifically identity as it relates to risk and compliance, as one of the key enabling technologies for blockchain,” Newton said. In moving toward that goal, Netki raised $3.6 million in seed funding in July 2016.\nNetki is not alone in focusing on identity solutions. Identity Mind and Onfido offer similar services, but neither of those companies offer investor validation tools thus far.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nSource: Bitcoin Magazine ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gary gensler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay clayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aml", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity and futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T15:30:36.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "baa5f017a3320aa6f1da4cb24a685a8d68f5bdb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqICQyOGciTrVygK_th0niQbCjeUiTqfnlql_gQQytKXgkVCJPvq9ZhifcGQSTOjY7_OVQlAStEhiIDHyslb9exC1IHbDyrngDI-", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Cryptos face muted trade as Bitcoin Cash set for key split - MarketWatch", "title_full": "Cryptos face muted trade as Bitcoin Cash set for key split - MarketWatch", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ951_bitcoi_ZG_20171211134033.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 23, "comments": 0, "shares": 23}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "baa5f017a3320aa6f1da4cb24a685a8d68f5bdb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqICQyOGciTrVygK_th0niQbCjeUiTqfnlql_gQQytKXgkVCJPvq9ZhifcGQSTOjY7_OVQlAStEhiIDHyslb9exC1IHbDyrngDI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Hankin", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptos face muted trade as Bitcoin Cash set for key split - MarketWatch", "text": "After a torrid few trading sessions, cryptocurrencies have taken a breather, with most major coins opening Tuesday at or around yesterday’s levels.\nThe No. 1 digital currency, bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.82% bounced off the support ahead of $8,000 and last traded at $8,784.77, down 0.8% since Monday’s levels at 5 p.m. Eastern time on the Kraken exchange.\nThe growth of the cryptocurrency market got a boost Monday when U.S. exchange Coinbase announced a raft of new products to satisfy its growing institutional demand.\n“There is clear demand from institutional clients and financial services professionals for more specific solutions with regard to cryptocurrencies that address their sophisticated needs,” said Adam White, vice president and general manager of Coinbase Institutional in a press release.\n“Through new products like Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Custody, we’re building the necessary capability for institutions that allows cryptocurrencies to be traded and stored in a compliant, trusted and efficient manner.”\nBitcoin Cash to hard fork today Expected Tuesday is a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash to the new Bitcoin ABC software. A hard fork is usually a fundamental change of the blockchain, or distributed-ledger technology, underpinning a coin. Typically, a hard fork results in two separate coins created, like when Bitcoin Cash forked from core bitcoin in a contentious split over scalability in August , resulting in core and cash versions of the virtual currency. The cash version represented an upgrade to processing power to 8-megabyte units, rather than the one-megabyte block core bitcoin.\nThis hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, however, differs from a conventional hark fork in that no new coins will be created and the older version of BCH will carry no economic value and become obsolete—if all goes well. The upgraded BCH will mean blocksizes will be increased to 32MB, resulting in even faster transactions and lower network fees, according to market participants.\nWhat are altcoins and futures doing? Other alternative coins to bitcoin, or alt coins, are showing small losses to begin Tuesday. Ether ETHUSD, -3.71% is down 0.8% at $731.73, Bitcoin Cash BCHUSD, -6.06% is off 1.5% at $1,429.30, Litecoin LTCUSD, -7.46% is off 3% at $146.63 and Ripple’s XRP XRPUSD, -5.90% last traded at 74 cents, down 0.4%.\nFutures have had a quiet start to the trading day. The Cboe May contract XBTK8, -2.88% is unchanged at $8,755 while the CME May contract BTCK8, -2.86% is up 0.1% at $8,765.\nCryptoWatch: Check bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices, performance and market capitalization—all on one dashboard", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adam white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron hankin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinbase institutional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinbase custody", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:35:05.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b2254b3738e46025f410b424d7fc8b13928669c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoYasFL09R_zpEEHyJnE.D8w8Ek8JMf1gitGABhLCKCiXeY8oh4MTjQCWbKPwgtxWkRALt8sZOMgF_QLSPfFTPOMXVT3IwEiK8xvpuom2gJHi4irdN07cA7", "site_full": "bitcoinblog.tk", "site": "bitcoinblog.tk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Ripple Launches 'Xpring' Initiative to Invest in XRP-Focused Startups – The Bitcoin Blog", "title_full": "Ripple Launches 'Xpring' Initiative to Invest in XRP-Focused Startups – The Bitcoin Blog", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "TK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/bitcoinblog.tk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_633990632.jpg?fit=1000%2C667", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b2254b3738e46025f410b424d7fc8b13928669c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoYasFL09R_zpEEHyJnE.D8w8Ek8JMf1gitGABhLCKCiXeY8oh4MTjQCWbKPwgtxWkRALt8sZOMgF_QLSPfFTPOMXVT3IwEiK8xvpuom2gJHi4irdN07cA7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ripple Launches 'Xpring' Initiative to Invest in XRP-Focused Startups – The Bitcoin Blog", "text": "Subscribe to our mailing list: Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Netherlands BL3P exchange drops BCH, gives the hard fork as the why. Bitcoin Cash Immediate support is at $1,400, it will also be supported at $1,350 and $1,300.\nBitcoin Cash price is exchanging hands above $1,400 but the intraday cap is below $1,450. Moreover, it is up 2.98% on the day while it is facing immediate resistance from the 50 SMA on the 1-hour timeframe chart. The price spiked last month on the news that Bitcoin Cash will finally be hard forked to bring several software upgrades to the network.\nThe hard fork execution is scheduled to take place at $16:00:00 UTC and if everything goes according to plan, the functionality of the network should get a boost. Well, this hard fork is different from other common hard forks where holders of a coin keep the old coins plus get the same amount of coins in form of a new token. Bitcoin Cash hard fork will not bring forth a new cryptocurrency, the coins will not be used on a new BCH blockchain without any hitches. However, the users operating Bitcoin Cash network nodes are required to upgrade to the latest software, ABC 0.17.1. The network will increase the maximum block size from 8 MB to 32 MB among other upgrades.\nBitcoin price is not surging in price at the moment, an activity common when a crypto is hard forked. Instead, BCH/USD has been trimming gains and has been hit hard by the decision of the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the Netherlands, BL3P to drop the coin from its platform. The exchange wrote:\n“Since there already was a planning for the removal of Bitcash the hard fork has become a reason and strict deadline for the removal of Bitcash from BL3P,”\nBitcoin Cash price analysis\nBitcoin Cash is trading within a forming falling wedge pattern as observed on the chart. The price is testing the support at $1,400, besides there is a growing bearish momentum around this level which could break into the $1,300 range in the near-term. Significantly, the MACD is slightly in the negative region while the RSI in pointing south below the 50 mark. A short-term support has been formed at $1,400, but net next support areas are at $1,350 and $1,300 respectively.\nBCH/USD 1-hour chart\nBEST BROKERS TO TRADE CRYPTO\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Underscoring the growing acceptance of digital currencies in the financial world, Chinese bitcoin mining technology company Canaan Creative has filed for a colossal initial public offering (IPO).\nCanaan, the second biggest manufacturer of bitcoin mining hardware, pursues to raise $1 billion through the IPO, according to the application filed by the company in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Picture Courtesy: Marco Verch\nIt is Canaan’s second outing in the equity market, the first being in 2017 when it put forward the listing application in the National Equities Exchange and Quotations, a secondary market in China. Being home to the top three manufacturers of digital currency mining hardware – Bitmain, Canaan, and Zhejiang Ebang – China is set to top the list of countries with most IPOs involving crypto technology firms.\nThe Beijing-headquartered Canaan apparently bets on the phenomenal increase in the price of bitcoin, though prices crumbled this year, which is currently trending at multi-week highs and once again moving closer to the $10,000-mark.\nIf everything goes as planned, Canaan will start trading in July and become the first company related to the blockchain and crypto industry to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company’s fast-paced growth and the consistent upturn in quarterly earnings justify its decision to go public.\nCanaan’s market share is expanding rapidly, powered entirely by its high-speed crypto mining chip, sold under the brand name Avalon , which consumes less electricity. Currently, the leading players in the sector are struggling to cater to the growing demand for mining machines. Canaan, the second biggest manufacturer of bitcoin mining hardware, pursues to raise $1 billion through the IPO\nMeanwhile, China-based Zhejiang Ebang Communication, the third largest provider of bitcoin mining gear and a direct competitor to Canaan, is also planning to file for IPO in Hong Kong, according to sources. Before starting the procedures for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, lured by the easier listing norms there, the company delisted from the Chinese secondary market New Third Board earlier this year.\nThough there is an increasing appetite among blockchain and crypto technology companies to go public, the cautious stance adopted by major stock exchanges continues to be a deterrent for them. While lack of transparency and regulatory constraints restrict digital currencies from entering mainstream financial markets, smaller stock exchanges have started opening their doors to them.

While the asset almost recovered to above $9,000, sudden weakness saw it slide below $8,000 in the latest mid-week market shakedown. BTC lost around 4.5% in the past day, to hover around $7,964.32, on thinning volumes of $5 billion, just a quarter of the trading levels at peak prices.\nSince the landslide at the beginning of the year, Bitcoin has been seeking direction, and it turned out to be a slow downward drift. BTC still commands high market prices, but the slide to lower levels may remain, as it has happened in past years.\nhttps://twitter.com/sthenc/status/998599507796377600\nNot even the support of the Japanese Yen has managed to lift the fortunes of BTC. Right now, more than 55% of all BTC trades are against the Yen, and less than 20% against the US dollar. Tethers are propping trading up, but making up around 15% of BTC volumes.\nAt the same time, altcoins are sold off for BTC, lifting the dominance of BTC in terms of market capitalization to 38.3%.\nWhat is even more curious – the entire crypto market has stagnated again, following a series of bad news. The entire crypto market trading, habitually above $20 billion in 24 hours, has now slid to $16 billion, lower than Bitcoin trading on a good day.\nhttps://twitter.com/BitcoinDood/status/999143391794524160\nRight now, the predictions see BTC sliding even lower, and seeing some accumulation before another significant jump. Some believe the leading crypto coin could reach as low as $7,200. At the same time, several coins are attempting to chart their own path, especially those that have a higher share of fiat trading, or Tether (USDT) trading. Yet as BTC slides, more altcoins may be sold to acquire BTC positions.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is also tracking down from recent peaks, possibly sliding below $1,000 if the downward trend continues. BCH trades around $1,098.78.

Dubai-based exchange BitOasis has suspended UAE Dirham/BTC trading, citing issues with the bank servicing the exchange itself. A communication was sent to BitOasis users yesterday that starting Tuesday, no more dirham can be withdrawn from the exchange, leaving users with today only to move their balance elsewhere or top it up with more dirham if desired. Users wishing to make credit card deposits can do so at the discounted fee of four percent until June 16. According to BitOasis, the issuing bank of the exchange is the only problem, and the normal trading of cryptocurrencies such as BTC, BCH, ETH, XRP, LTC, XMR, and ZEC will continue as usual, as will cryptocurrency withdrawals from the exchange into private wallets.\nArabian Business quotes the statement as informing BitOasis users the following:\n“If you decide to leave your fiat balances the only way for you to withdraw your funds at any time after May 15th would be to convert it to cryptocurrency and send it to an external wallet”\n“If you choose to keep your AED fiat balances after May 15th, currently we do not have any date on when we will be reactivating AED fiat withdrawals, but we are hard at work to provide our customers with this service.”\nThere is no date as of yet for the reactivation of dirham withdrawals and deposits by wire transfer, although BitOasis have said it should be soon. AED wire withdrawals will be enabled again soon. Please feel free to store your funds until it's enabled.\n— BitOasis (@bitoasis) May 14, 2018\nThe exchange, which operates in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, has suspended withdrawals in the past as well, halting transfers to and from Emirates NBD, Noor Bank and Mashreq bank accounts in 2017 for a short time Gulf News reported that customers experienced delayed withdrawals while new verifications were also suspended and that the issue was due to regulatory pressure from within the UAE at the time.\nEntrepreneur Ola Dudin of Jordan founded BitOasis in 2014 as a hybrid wallet/exchange, and the exchange has been active since then, listing Zcash as recently as April 23, 2018. According to the website , BitOasis plans to be the first digital assets company in MENA to be registered in a major technology center in the region.\nThe company has not yet updated the blog regarding the new constraints on the use of the dirham currency on the exchange. Many BitOasis users are concerned with the recent developments, and have taken to Twitter to voice complaints and seek answers to their questions on the timeline of the restrictions and whether they still have time to withdraw their money. @bitoasis with the last minute email about wire withdrawal closures, I can’t connect to your website.

Though as Fundstrat market strategists have pointed out, much of the gains in the bitcoin price tend to unfold over just a handful of days each year.\nEven at the start of the new year, when the bitcoin price was trading in the doldrums, Hayes wasn’t phased, though he pointed out “it’s [his] job to make predictions” whether or not they come true.\nHayes, a Citigroup alum, explained that he is a volatility trader, and he makes his money on the volatility in the bitcoin price, which there has been no shortage of year-to-date. “If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud … Short it, I don’t care. If you think it’s going to be $1 million in a few months, great, buy it. I still don’t care. We just match trades,” Hayes said.\nAsia-focused BitMEX is geared toward retail investors but instead of spot trading, it has some of the advanced features that you might expect to see on an institutional trading platform, including derivatives, margin trading and up to 100x leverage (which is more of a “headline number” and not something most traders take advantage of). The exchange supports short trading in perpetual contracts . Market Dynamics\nHayes also addressed the cultural differences that affect cryptocurrency market dynamics in the Western world and Asia, the latter of which is where some suggest two-thirds of the market originates from.\n“I think Asia dominates crypto because they’re very used to trading digital assets,” said Hayes, pointing to South Korea, where locals are accustomed to trading virtual goods in video games and where the culture is easily transferred to cryptocurrency trading.\nAnd it’s individuals, not institutions, that are driving most of the volume.\n“There’s really not too much institutional presence right now in crypto. It is a retail phenomenon,” Hayes told CNBC.\nBut many are expecting that institutional investors that have been sidelined are on the brink of a shift where they too will enter the space, especially with traditional Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs launching a trading desk and the NYSE also jumping in. When that happens, Hayes said BitMEX is prepared to support them, pointing to the exchange’s API.\nHayes got the Twitter-sphere talking when he claimed in a tweet to show up at Consensus 2018, which is unfolding in midtown Manhattan this week, in one of those famous crypto Lamborghinis – Did you see my ride today at #Consensus2018 ? pic.twitter.com/qGznsNMgWo\n— Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) May 14, 2018\nIf Hayes is correct and the bitcoin price attains $50,000 as he predicts, there could be a lot more Lambos on the road in the not-too-distant future.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

The app will allow users to pair their phones with goTenna’s portable antennas in order to broadcast transactions.\ngoTenna produces consumer-grade hardware to facilitate mesh networking — a concept that echoes much of the decentralization ethos that we see across the cryptocurrency domain — which operates by allowing peers to connect directly to one another for the purpose of routing packets, sidestepping the need to rely on an ISP or cell tower.\n“What will happen when these massive centralized networks fail due to natural disasters, as they did after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, or due to some kind of outside cybersecurity attack? What will happen when providers decide to crank up prices just because they can?” said Rich Myers, goTenna’s Decentralized Applications Engineer.\n“Mesh networks are the only legitimate alternative to these traditional centralized communication networks. They are completely decentralized and democratized, leaving the power of communication in the hands of the people. Beyond that, they are much more resilient to unforeseen disasters — the only thing these networks need to function is a mesh networking device paired with a smartphone.”\nFor its part, Samourai Wallet has been focusing on censorship resistance and privacy-oriented tools since it began in 2015. With features such as direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets, it has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions.\nSamourai has been curating Mule.tools , an R&D initiative to further reinforce the censorship-resistant properties of the Bitcoin blockchain and also published the code for Pony Direct , a proof-of-concept app for broadcasting transactions over SMS in January.\n“We believe one of the most fundamental value propositions that bitcoin provides is censorship resistance,” SW, the CEO of Samourai, told Bitcoin Magazine . “The freedom to transact freely and without permission is not a freedom to take lightly, or give up without a fight. We saw the open internet transform into a walled garden, captured by regulatory and corporate interest working together — and largely aided by red-herrings like ‘net-neutrality.’\n“The tools we are building arm the little guy — the individual — with the tools they need to level the playing field against the inevitable overstepping of bounds by hostile actors, oppressive regimes and overzealous governments,” said SW. “We’re making some material changes to Samourai Wallet to allow for a greater high latency and offline experience. In conjunction with the release of txTenna, Samourai Wallet users will be able to theoretically keep their phone offline at all times and still be able to send and receive payments with minimal hassle.”\nThe concept explored by txTenna follows in the path of alternate methods to access the blockchain, previously seen with both the Blockstream Satellite and in the works of Nick Szabo and Elaine Ou. Not only does it provide more versatility to those wishing to avoid using censored systems, but it opens up a slew of use cases for Bitcoin in regions with less-developed infrastructures and those affected by natural disasters.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Therefore, the RBI cannot unilaterally decide for the government on the legality of bitcoins\nIn its response, the RBI also confirmed that the committee is due to submit a report on cryptocurrencies come June 30 and insisted that the working group will study the regulatory approach taken by other countries before proposing a regulatory framework in India.\nMeanwhile, despite mainstream reports to the contrary this year, bitcoin isn’t banned in India despite recent curbs led by the central bank which effectively barred Indian citizens from purchasing cryptocurrency through their bank accounts.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rbi tells supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central bank tells supreme court advertisement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "securities and exchange board of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "information technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:38:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50ec5534040bfe7f9110db8be7b7cac5b0d8e4c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVCXPg8gzn7KGhoeTqzmA_ep6JTno8Ri41uYUg4I_oNMkFO8mQdOquTlXas4YsWkPAQ1Hj80IW4Byc68yFKE_f6W0LwcnO_DI1", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Thomson Reuters Launches Real Time Rates for Six Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Thomson Reuters Launches Real Time Rates for Six Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_761233717_1600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50ec5534040bfe7f9110db8be7b7cac5b0d8e4c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVCXPg8gzn7KGhoeTqzmA_ep6JTno8Ri41uYUg4I_oNMkFO8mQdOquTlXas4YsWkPAQ1Hj80IW4Byc68yFKE_f6W0LwcnO_DI1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lubomir Tassev", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Thomson Reuters Launches Real Time Rates for Six Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin News", "text": "4945 Thomson Reuters Launches Real Time Rates for Six Cryptocurrencies\nThomson Reuters is launching a cryptocurrency real-time rates data feed. The new service is expected to provide “reliable, real-time information” for six digital coins across major crypto exchanges. The stated goal is to encourage efficiency and transparency for cryptocurrency investors within the global market place.\nAlso read: Thomson Reuters and Marketpsych Launch Bitcoin Sentiment Index Six Cryptocurrencies Will Be Tracked\nThe new Cryptocurrency Real Time Rates are already accessible through a customized API interface on Thomson Reuters Eikon platform. The application is providing trading data from various crypto exchanges including Bitflyer and Bitpoint . More trading platforms will be added in the future, according to a Reuters report.\nThe announcement comes after a recent Thomson Reuters survey found that cryptocurrency trading by financial firms is likely increase this year. About 20% of 400 finance companies participating in the study are considering entering trading crypto assets within 12 months. That means that one in every five of the undisclosed businesses plans to establish direct contact with cryptocurrencies in 2018.\nPricing data for the real-time rates will cover six cryptocurrencies, not mentioned in the report. The launch of the service could be interpreted as an indication that Reuters is considering embracing the digital asset class on ‎its own trading platforms. In December, the mass media and information giant added bitcoin cash (BCH) to Eikon. BCH became only the third cryptocurrency to list on the platform after bitcoin core (BTC) and ethereum. ‎\nThe latest release comes after an announcement from CME Group which is launching a daily price benchmark for ‎Ethereum, as reported by Finance Magnates . The service will be provided in partnership with the cryptocurrency trading platform Crypto Facilities.‎\nEarlier this year, Thomson Reuters Corp. announced the launch of a new version of the Marketpsych Indices sentiment data feed, which includes analysis of bitcoin market sentiment. The service is provided in cooperation with Marketpsych Data LLC, as news.Bitcoin.com reported in March. 400 news and social media sites, including many specific to cryptocurrencies, have been added to the feed. Each one of them is scanned and scored in real time to ascertain market-moving sentiments and themes. Immense Growth Highlights Strong Momentum\nAccording to Michael Go, head of FX Market Development for Asia Pacific at Thomson Reuters, the immense growth in the cryptocurrency market in the last decade highlights the strong momentum around the new technology and the tradable asset class. “Thomson Reuters Cryptocurrency Real Time Rates enhances our rate offering and helps create a transparent and efficient global marketplace, vital to the future stability of cryptocurrency trading to support the investor,” he commented.\n“As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Bitflyer has made efforts to facilitate the development of cryptocurrency markets,” said Yuzo Kano, CEO and co-founder of the trading platform. He noted that Bitflyer is the first company to obtain license to trade cryptocurrencies in Japan, the US and Europe. “We are delighted to be able to provide valuable data to customers worldwide through Thomson Reuters,” Kano added.\nPresident and representative director of Bitpoint, Genki Oda, also expressed satisfaction with the partnership on the real-time rates. “We are pleased to cooperate with Thomson Reuters in the further enhancement of its services and hope that our data will become a benchmark for the cryptocurrency industry as a global cryptocurrency trading exchange,” Oda said.\nDo you think the introduction of services like the real-time crypto rates helps the adoption of cryptocurrencies?

Tabb identified a few key reasons why established money managers and the planet’s largest financial powerhouses might now be getting ready to make their move into the space. Tabb: There Are Three Reasons Why Institutional Investors Remain Cautious of Crypto\nAccording to report on CNBC’s website, the market researchers have published a document by one of their senior analysts along with other contributors. Monica Summerville and colleagues write:\n“If 2017 was the year cryptocurrencies went mainstream, then 2018 is certainly shaping up to be the year they go institutional.”\nMany cryptocurrency investors believe that an influx of money from traditional centres of finance is inevitable. Some believed that the launch of Bitcoin futures by the CME Group and Cboe late last year would be the catalyst for this. However, it hasn’t quite panned out that way. It wasn’t long after the launch of these products that the price of Bitcoin began its sharp decline from a high of nearly $20,000 right down to just above $6,000 in early February.\nAccording to Tabb, there are three main obstacles stopping institutional investors taking up positions in cryptocurrency. These are current uncertainty about regulations, lack of market infrastructure, and lack of institutional-grade sources of market information. These three factors combined have forced what little institutional interest there has been in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to make over-the-counter (OTC) trades. The authors of the Tabb report estimate that these account for between $30 billion and $150 billion in daily trading volume. The document goes on to state that:\n“The word on the street is that significant additional institutional money is being amassed and is waiting for the right conditions to enter the market — and expected to start doing so this year.”\nWith more regulatory bodies starting to consider cryptocurrency across the globe and trading desks expected to be launched by Goldman Sachs along with other established Wall Street banks later this year, it seems that at least two of Tabb’s obstacles to institutional cash will be removed in the coming months. This could well see the kind of influx of money needed to prove some of the most bullish price calls right.\nPredictions such as that of Tom Lee’s $25,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2018 or even Alexis Ohanian’s $15,000 Ether token in the same period of time seem little but a pipe dream without serious financial institutions having easy access to exposure in cryptocurrency. Time will tell if Tabb’s thinking is right on the subject of institutional cash entering crypto. Featured image from Shutterstock.

How can one deny access to an essential service when I am not doing anything illegal? You have not declared Virtual Currencies illegal in the country.”\nIn April this year, the Indian central bank said finance institutions under its regulation and oversight were no longer allowed to deal in or provide services to traders or investors dealing in virtual currencies. The latest court challenge will be back in court on May 17.\nThe 11 representatives of various virtual currency-aligned businesses challenging the RBI in the latest writ are disputing the constitutional validity of the decision by the Indian financial services sector regulator to prevent banks from offering services to companies that facilitate cryptocurrency trading. Source: Shutterstock\nBanks in India have until July 5 to be compliant with the central bank’s directive, hence the rush by cryptocurrency exchanges and traders to challenge the bank’s decision. On May 24, the Delhi High Court will further hear from two exchanges, Kali Digital Eco-systems and MoneyTrade Coin, which are both challenging the central bank’s move.\nBitcoin traders and other cryptocurrency exchange companies have in the past few months dragged the Indian Apex Bank to court for its decision. Earlier this month, Flintstone Technologies Private Limited which operates the MoneyTrade Coin exchange challenged India’s bitcoin banking ban , following up on the first challenge by digital asset trading platform CoinRecoil in the High Court of Delhi.\nCCN reported last week that four other Indian cryptocurrency exchanges had jointly filed a Writ Petition (Civil) no. 373 of 2018 under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the constitutional validity of the Central Bank’s Circular. These include Coindelta Exchange, Koinex Exchange, Throughbit Exchange and CoinDCX.\nAlthough the ban on Indian banks has had wide effects on cryptocurrency trading in India, virtual currency exchanges and traders in the country have pivoted to crypto-to-crypto trading as they scramble for ways out of glitches occasioned by the RBI directive.\n“Even if there was no RBI circular, the crypto to crypto product would have happened. However, because of the circular and the fact that fiats may no longer be in the picture, it definitely did hurry up and encourage the solution sooner,” said Ajeet Khurana, the CEO of Zebpay.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "economic times in india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:05:54.118+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a826785498dec6831682b9f4a2fc7189cfff46ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSwWdHMT04Z.6e6zJsC1ck.wtMM_OPZDQpR.JH5JeBLYaLgl01rRoT1AKscWrQS3JJeUcRi3eAUj9ft7oHfIMIFiV8iOCfIW7E4mVS3f1ZqYesIkgYAvzfyzeFo4Ifqac8VJV0Dbdtd0Xl2yOhb6NyF", "site_full": "theicojournal.com", "site": "theicojournal.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "", "title": "COINBASE GOES BIG: Announces Institutional Custody, Liquidity, And Prime Services - The ICO Journal - Cryptocurrency News, Bitcoin, Coin News", "title_full": "COINBASE GOES BIG: Announces Institutional Custody, Liquidity, And Prime Services - The ICO Journal - Cryptocurrency News, Bitcoin, Coin News", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.143, "main_image": "https://theicojournal.com/wp-content/uploads/image001.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a826785498dec6831682b9f4a2fc7189cfff46ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSwWdHMT04Z.6e6zJsC1ck.wtMM_OPZDQpR.JH5JeBLYaLgl01rRoT1AKscWrQS3JJeUcRi3eAUj9ft7oHfIMIFiV8iOCfIW7E4mVS3f1ZqYesIkgYAvzfyzeFo4Ifqac8VJV0Dbdtd0Xl2yOhb6NyF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rogue Trader", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "COINBASE GOES BIG: Announces Institutional Custody, Liquidity, And Prime Services - The ICO Journal - Cryptocurrency News, Bitcoin, Coin News", "text": "/ in Article: News / by Rogue Trader\nFollowing up on the back of our earlier report connecting Coinbase/GDAX to Morgan Stanley and institutional services – the crypto firm has decided to go all in and align itself with Wall Street. This alignment makes sense in that Coinbase is fit to compete directly with Gemini and do so on a global scale.\nSeveral announcements were made connected to custody, margin, lending, liquidity, and algorithmic trading. Heavy stuff that allows Coinbase to link directly to clients of scale that they have heretofore been unavailable to and for.\nCoinbase Custody – partners Coinbase with an SEC-regulated broker-dealer for third-party auditing and financial reporting validation. The custodial product offering maintains a high standard of reporting validation that institutional firms require in broker-dealer relationships.\nCoinbase Markets – an electronic marketplace based out of Coinbase’s engineering office in Chicago. ‘Coinbase Markets provides a centralized pool of liquidity for all Coinbase products,’ White added. ‘Over the course of the year, Coinbase Markets will introduce new features like low latency performance, on-premise data center colocation services, institutional connectivity and access, and settlement and clearing services. These additions will allow for a more efficient price discovery process to occur, creating tighter markets, deeper liquidity, and increased certainty of execution.’\nPresumably, this is because the engineers around the area are already experienced in traditional exchange-centred products as Chicago is a hub for finance. The tight blockchain talent pool has led exchanges to lure engineers away from banking firms.\nCoinbase Prime – a software service that equips institutions with tools for trading cryptocurrency. This product will fill a missing piece of critical infrastructure needed for institutions. Over the course of the year, they intend to offer lending and margin financing products to qualified clients, high touch and low touch execution services like over-the-counter (OTC) trading and algorithmic orders, and new market data and research products. This product launch builds on Coinbase’s previous efforts for building traditional investment types like margin trading into cryptocurrency.\nCoverage Group – this initiative focuses exclusively on supporting institutional clients (as opposed to retail clients). The support includes “sales, sales trading, research, market operations, and client services support,” White writes. The group will be based out of Coinbase’s New York office and touts an employee pool with impressive experience in the New York Stock Exchange, Morgan Stanley, plus regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC.\nEach of these initiatives is serious and grown up. If you look closely enough, what Coinbase is trying to do is offer a ‘plug and play’ institutional crypto solution to global investment banks before they create their own.

Appearing on CNBC’s Fast Money, the former Citigroup and Deutsche Bank executive also spoke on volatility and the dominance of Asian retail traders in the crypto market. Bitcoin at $50,000\nWhen asked to give a bitcoin price prediction, Hayes said it could reach $50,000 before the end of 2018. Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market has endured a difficult start to 2018 with bitcoin, in particular, dropping to below $6,000 in February after having almost broken the $20,000 ceiling in mid-December 2017. Commenting on the seriousness of his prediction, Hayes said:\nIt’s my job to make predictions. Whether they’re right or wrong, it doesn’t matter to me.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat has on many occasions this year predicted that bitcoin will be $20,000 by the middle of the year and will round up 2018 trading at $25,000. BitMEX: Highest Bitcoin Trading by Volume\nBitMEX is based in Hong Kong and has a large trading base in North Asia. The platform also holds the record for the most number of bitcoins traded in a 24-hour trading period at 140 BTC. BitMEX offers bitcoin futures and swaps as well as altcoin futures for Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. One of the headline features of the platform is that it offers 100x leveraged trading, which according to Hayes is hardly ever used by traders. It’s a headline number. Most traders do not use a 100x leverage. Some traders use it as a testing ground or a free option. It is a limited liability from the perspective of the trader. On BitMEX, traders can only lose what they put in. Asian Crypto Trading Dominance\nHayes also spoke about the dominance of Asian retail traders in the crypto market. This is because there is an established digital asset trading tradition in the region.\nAsia dominates cryptos because they’re very used to digital trading assets. South Korea has been trading digital goods related to gaming for two decades. When you move to a purely money based digital currency, they understand that culturally, so they get on board quickly.

He took to Twitter on Monday to share a photo of the rented orange Lamborghini Huracan he purportedly arrived in at the summit.\nWill bitcoin hit the $50,000 milestone in 2018?

ZCash benefited from the news that they would be listed on Gemini; an exclusive club in its own right. The ‘pump’ for ZCash produced a 45% spike in its price and rejoicing throughout the ZCash ecosystem.\nIn the same way, Ethereum saw a nice bump higher as we reported the news that the CME would begin producing Ethereum futures and trade them ‘imminently’. The crypto community was abuzz and the price of $ETH moved right along with the news.\nPer ZCash: On May 14, privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash experienced a 55 percent increase in price after being listed on Gemini, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the US led by the Winklevoss twins. Subsequent to the official announcement of Gemini, the price of Zcash increased from 0.0293 to 0.0456 BTC, by nearly two-fold.\nGemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss told Bloomberg in an interview said that privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Zcash have struggled to gain large market valuations in the past due to concerns from investors towards potential crackdown by authorities, as seen in the Japanese cryptocurrency market as of recent.\n“Part of the reason a coin like Zcash has a smaller market cap is that people are not sure if regulators will ever get comfortable with this type of technology. Today demonstrates that through education and collaboration and with the right controls in place, regulators can get comfortable with privacy technology,” said Winklevoss.\nPer Ethereum: The news that the CME would begin crafting and managing ETH futures was a boost to the overall market cap of cryptocurrencies and pushed the collective number above $400B.\nThe overall reaction to the news was mixed, though, as some connected the inclusion of ETH futures to the downdraft in price and volatility connected to BTC at the outset of 2018. Comparing the ability of fiat banks to now short the cryptocurrency in the same way that many believe BTC futures have constrained its performance.\nStill, the price action proved to move the overall market higher. The crypto community remains engaged in ‘Blockchain Week’ at Consensus 2018. More stories to come as developments are announced.

Bankers Against Bitcoin Protest Staged Outside Consensus 2018 Posted by Cryptobble on May 15, 2018 7:38 pmCategories: News Top Stories\nBankers were out in full force protesting against bitcoin outside of Consensus 2018 in New York City this Monday.\nIn a number of placards, bankers show displeasure at constant criticisms of the world’s biggest bank by market capitalization:\nSome $25 billion of taxpayers’ money was used in 2008 to bail out Wells Fargo, but the bank has now reached the stage where “the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank barred Wells Fargo from growing its asset base any further, based upon years of misconduct.”\nOne such misconduct includes “the creation of over 2 million fake bank accounts by Wells Fargo employees.” Protesting bankers say that was by accident.\nRevealing the satire or the staged nature of this protest, one pretend banker says 19% fees to send some money to Mexico is fair. Another one asks for the remittance industry to be given back to banks.\nSome bankers ask why this bubble hasn’t popped, while another one says cutting trees, sending them to mills, printing them into checks, transporting them to banks, and so on, takes less electricity than bitcoin.\nThe most hard-hitting complaint is by a banker who says he wants the $15 billion overdraft industry back. That’s in US alone. UK probably has some $6 billion in such fees on top, as well as, we’d think, other European countries.\nGenesis Mining, which stages the above protest, says: “The consumer abuse that’s been possible due to a lack of competition is over… Industries like the lucrative $15 billion overdraft industry that enrich banks will soon disappear.”\nSoon here is probably meant in jest too. Nearly a decade since bitcoin’s invention, we can’t say it has found much use as a banks’ replacement.\nThat’s primarily because the currency remains very volatile to the point where $15 billion in overdraft fees might seem like a good deal when compared to all your income going down 70% in three month as it would have done only two months ago had bitcoin been used as a bank replacement.\nMuch of that volatility is probably due to entities like Genesis Mining which tend to sell newly produced coins, sometimes arguably in a careless manner.\nUsability would be another consideration if bitcoin was to really be considered as an alternative to banks. That usability includes lack of capacity, and a lack of real plans to address it for general use rather than just niche cases.\nWhich may be why the once competitors are now friends, albeit not in rhetoric. Goldman Sachs only recently opened a trading desk, others will probably follow as the bankers’ competitor becomes just another asset to hodl for diversification.\nSecond generation bitcoins may gradually and incrementally challenge banks’ monopoly on the payment system by taking a different approach or by re-continuing the approach bitcoin once took.\nThat is, making the crypto as a unit of account in somewhat unique dapps that are attractive to end users. The theory suggests that through significant use, and thus utility, a base value would be formed, tampering volatility.\nYet the task is quite significant, and complacence isn’t really in time, for empty words and rhetoric doesn’t deliver results. Building does, and that building spirit continues to lack in bitcoin, yet they do, we must say, make somewhat up for it by keeping up the crypto spirit.\nCopyrights Trustnodes.com\nThanks for reading!

New York-based startup, goTenna Inc. is partnering with Samourai Wallet to launch an android application which allows users to send Bitcoin payments with an active internet connection. goTenna is a startup that designs and develops technology for decentralized communications. The devices from goTenna can be paired with smartphones, which enables the users to share information on a peer-to-peer basis even without any centralized communications infrastructure. On 14 th May, at the Consensus 2018 goTenna had announced a new application called the ‘txTenna’, which would allow users to connect their smartphones with a goTenna device and use a cryptocurrency trading wallet to send payments. The developers of the application have said that as long a phone is charged, the user can communicate. The application has done wonders during the Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, by helping people reconnect. The concept is decades-old which enables people to use the internet without a Wifi network or an active LAN network. But the other goTenna device has to be within a mile of this device for sending the message across the mesh network. The cryptocurrency user should be within a mile of another active device, transactions bounce across the mesh until it reaches a user with an active internet connection. Samourai wallet had reached out to goTenna with the idea of its open source communication code. txTenna works as the same principle as the iOS wallet. txTenna is going to be an alternative which would be censorship-resistant and will be an open source project. The application could work with any software wallet, txTenna can send transactions without the use of the internet in almost any wallet provider. Peter James has tweeted that:\n“Sending Bitcoin without going through a mining rig?” Fulmo a lightning network startup has tweeted that:\n“Can @goTenna help decentralize #Bitcoin transactions? Yes, they can! Working together with @samouraiWallet, Bitcoin transaction can be broadcast through a mesh network without direct access to the Internet.

Though as Fundstrat market strategists have pointed out, much of the gains in the bitcoin price tend to unfold over just a handful of days each year.\nEven at the start of the new year, when the bitcoin price was trading in the doldrums, Hayes wasn’t phased, though he pointed out “it’s [his] job to make predictions” whether or not they come true.\nHayes, a Citigroup alum, explained that he is a volatility trader, and he makes his money on the volatility in the bitcoin price, which there has been no shortage of year-to-date. “If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud … Short it, I don’t care. If you think it’s going to be $1 million in a few months, great, buy it. I still don’t care. We just match trades,” Hayes said.\nAsia-focused BitMEX is geared toward retail investors but instead of spot trading, it has some of the advanced features that you might expect to see on an institutional trading platform, including derivatives, margin trading and up to 100x leverage (which is more of a “headline number” and not something most traders take advantage of). The exchange supports short trading in perpetual contracts . Market Dynamics\nHayes also addressed the cultural differences that affect cryptocurrency market dynamics in the Western world and Asia, the latter of which is where some suggest two-thirds of the market originates from.\n“I think Asia dominates crypto because they’re very used to trading digital assets,” said Hayes, pointing to South Korea, where locals are accustomed to trading virtual goods in video games and where the culture is easily transferred to cryptocurrency trading.\nAnd it’s individuals, not institutions, that are driving most of the volume.\n“There’s really not too much institutional presence right now in crypto. It is a retail phenomenon,” Hayes told CNBC.\nBut many are expecting that institutional investors that have been sidelined are on the brink of a shift where they too will enter the space, especially with traditional Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs launching a trading desk and the NYSE also jumping in. When that happens, Hayes said BitMEX is prepared to support them, pointing to the exchange’s API.\nHayes got the Twitter-sphere talking when he claimed in a tweet to show up at Consensus 2018, which is unfolding in midtown Manhattan this week, in one of those famous crypto Lamborghinis – Did you see my ride today at #Consensus2018 ? pic.twitter.com/qGznsNMgWo\n— Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) May 14, 2018\nIf Hayes is correct and the bitcoin price attains $50,000 as he predicts, there could be a lot more Lambos on the road in the not-too-distant future.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "citigroup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:01:42.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e4f3fa962b0cb220111c1e8375926d303ef6866", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNA.gF3kq7FmVkxZjJXkfraP6FTPZDPo_Ybffs6PuVo_6TS.qpAQS.VjVPWabuYH7NoTWuhBcWmgEMaqedFHD.SNnSlfsEW0T5GOBbFv2I2R3", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to use Electrum to create your Brainwallet for Bitcoin | TechRadar", "title_full": "How to use Electrum to create your Brainwallet for Bitcoin | TechRadar", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ickAZi4h4bHat8QfFBzDnN-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e4f3fa962b0cb220111c1e8375926d303ef6866", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNA.gF3kq7FmVkxZjJXkfraP6FTPZDPo_Ybffs6PuVo_6TS.qpAQS.VjVPWabuYH7NoTWuhBcWmgEMaqedFHD.SNnSlfsEW0T5GOBbFv2I2R3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lexie M", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to use Electrum to create your Brainwallet for Bitcoin | TechRadar", "text": " pro IT insights for business\nNews Reviews Insights TechRadar Next Up VPN Mobile Industry Linux Networks Data Centre Laptops/PCs Printers Software Security How To How to use Electrum to create your Brainwallet for Bitcoin How to use Electrum to create your Brainwallet for Bitcoin By Lexie M How To\nSometimes storing your seed words in your head can be the safest way to secure your Bitcoin. Shares In Bitcoin , there exists a way to literally put your money in your brain. It is the equivalent of digitally burying your savings in the woods, only to come back years later to retrieve it. While we don’t necessarily advise you to do this, it can be a powerful demonstration for what is possible in Bitcoin, as well as a practical guide on how to securely create a Bitcoin seed.\nYou can download Electrum from their official website . There are versions for Windows, Mac, Android, and Linux. You can also find Electrum pre-installed in the operating system Tails, which we recommend, and have used in our example.\nA Live-USB (an operating system run from a USB stick) is recommended when setting up your brainwallet, as your computer could already be infected with malware without your knowledge. Even if you consider this risk to be relatively small, a Live-USB eliminates it almost entirely.\nAlso take a look at the best cryptocurrency wallets Create a new Bitcoin wallet\nCreate a wallet by clicking on File > New/Restore. Confirm the file name wallet_1. Select Create New Wallet then Standard Wallet.\nThirteen English words will appear in the next window. Write these words down on a piece of paper, then click Next.\nYou will be asked to enter the previously generated words in the next window. This will confirm that you have written down the correct words, in the correct order, and without typos.\nNext, you will be asked to set a password. If you are relying solely on your paper backup, this password is not important. If you intend to use this wallet regularly, generate a password with your password manager .\nHit Confirm, and your addresses will be generated by Electrum – You can see them all under Addresses.\nNext we will export our Master Public Keys for our watch-only wallet. You can view this key under Wallet > Master Public Keys.\nSave this key in a text file called xpub.txt on your USB stick or hard drive.\nThe public key beginning with xpub is not security relevant, so you do not need to worry about it being stolen. Anybody who has this key will be able to find which Bitcoin addresses belong to you, but they will not be able to steal your bitcoins.\nRemember your seed words then delete your wallet If you remember your seed words (or have them written down on a piece of paper) and your public key is saved in xpub.txt, you can delete your wallet.\nYou can find the file wallet_1 as listed below. Make sure to also delete it from your Trash Bin:\nOn Windows:\nShow hidden files Go to Users/YourUserName/AppDataRoaming/Local/Electrum/wallets On Mac:\nOpen Finder Go to folder (shift+cmd+G) and type ~/.electrum/wallets On Linux:\nHome Folder Go -> Location and type ~/.electrum/wallets Congratulations! Your Bitcoin wallet now exists solely in your head.\nKeep your seed words safe You must remember your seed words! If you chose to back them up on a piece of paper, you must keep it safe. If you lose this paper and forget your seed words, you will lose all your Bitcoins. Anyone who knows your seed words can steal your Bitcoins.\nDo not put any paper copy of your seed words into a scanner or photocopier and keep it out of the reach of cameras or spying eyes. A safe, or somewhere you are comfortable keeping large amounts of cash or other valuable documents, would be a great place to store a paper backup.\nCreate a watch-only wallet to see your Bitcoins A watch-only wallet will only allow you to monitor your balance and receive money. As a result, you do not have to worry about keeping this wallet secure–you only need to worry about remembering your seed words.\nOpen Electrum and click on File > New/Restore again. Enter a wallet name and select Restore a Wallet or Import Keys, then Standard Wallet.\nPaste your xpub key into the field in the next window, or click on the folder icon and select the xpub.txt that you saved.\nA notification will inform you that this is a watch-only wallet.\nYou can see your addresses under Addresses. You can also see the balance of these addresses, or send money to them.\nRestore your wallet to spend your money\nIf you want to spend the Bitcoins you have gathered in your mind, you’ll first need to restore the wallet you deleted.\nOpen Electrum and select File > New/Restore.\nEnter a wallet name and select Restore a Wallet or Import Keys, then Standard Wallet.\nEnter a password–we recommend you generate one with your password manager.\nConfirm this step by clicking OK.\nElectrum will generate your addresses and you will be able to see your balance and make payments. For each payment, you will need to enter your password.\nA threesome with triple protection You can use Diceware to generate strong, memorable passwords for your computer and password manager. Then use your password manager to generate and store all your other account passwords. Add extra security to your most private accounts with two-factor authentication.\nNo password strategy is more secure than this.\nLexie M writes about information security, bitcoin, and privacy.

BBC Lord Sugar urged his followers not to fall for adverts using his picture to sell dodgy cryptocurrency investments\nThe Apprentice host, 71 , took to Twitter to warn his followers about a fake Bitcointrader advert pretending he is endorsing an investment.\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"WARNING: Please ignore an advert from Bitcointrader suggesting I endorse their offerings.\n\"They are SCUM it is a total scam. Please pass this on to all your friends particularly the elderly who are falling for this terrible scam.\"\nClicking on the advert usually takes you to the fraudster's website where the pictures are used again - along with fake quotes recommending that you invest in the scheme. Twitter The Apprentice host took to Twitter to warn his followers about a fake Bitcointrader advert pretending he is endorsing the investment\nYou might also be asked to input your contact details, which scammers will then use to try and persuade you to invest.\nThe scam ads are placed on social media networks like Facebook and other websites and use the celebs' images to promote the fraudulent investments.\nAction fraud figures released exclusively to The Sun Online show 1,639 scams were reported in 2017 , with the majority of those related to online shopping.\nThese are only official figures, so it's likely there could be countless more victims who have been duped. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM ONLINE SCAMS ONLINE scams are a danger to both your personal details and your cash. Here are some tips you need to be aware of, according to Action Fraud. Protect yourself - Always be suspicious. Don't assume anyone who has sent you an email or text message or has left a voice is who they say they are. If the message asks you to make a payment, log-in to an online account or offers you a deal, be extremely cautious. Banks will never email you for passwords or any other sensitive information by asking you to click on a link or visit a website. Spot the signs - Always check spellings and grammar of an email or website. If it's poorly designed and contains lots of errors, the website probably isn't legit. Genuine businesses won't use web-based email addresses such as Gmail or Yahoo. Make sure the sites are verified - Facebook, Twitter and other social media can also be used to direct you to a spoof website. Official accounts are \"verified\" and come with checkmark icon next to their name - so make sure you check.\nVictims on average lost £342 but in 24 cases Brits reported being scammed out of more than £10,000.
