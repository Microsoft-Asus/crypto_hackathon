For many of the top cryptocurrency exchanges at the time it effectively was; several have fallen by the wayside and eight out of the top ten platforms by trading volume have lost their spot. It’s not just vintage altcoins that time has been unkind to: the same holds true for many of the exchanges that once listed them.\nAlso read: Faast Platform Connects With Popular Wallets Offering Cross-Chain Swaps 8/10 of the Top Cryptocurrency Exchanges Have Lost Their Place\nOver the past two years, the makeup of the top cryptocurrency exchanges has changed dramatically – and so has the volumes traded. In August 2016, Coinmarketcap records the top exchange as being Okcoin.cn, with a 24-hour volume of $440 million. Today, it’s ranked 188th, with a trading volume of just $17,000. Then, as now, BTC and LTC were the top traded pairs.\nSecond on the list for trade volume in 2016 was Btctrade, with 24-hour volume of $218 million. Today, it sits in 54th place with volume of just $23 million. BTC and Ybcoin were its top traded pairs back then, the latter a Chinese coin which died in 2017. Today, Btctrade’s top pairs are BCH and ETH. Of the entire top 10 from 2016, just two exchanges remain there – Huobi and Kraken. Huobi occupied third place then and it lies in fourth spot today, despite its 24-hour volume having grown from $165 million to $1.3 billion. This is naturally a reflection of the increase in value that digital assets such as bitcoin have enjoyed in this period. The top three exchanges in August 2016 A Lot Can Happen in Two Years\nHere’s how the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges looked two years ago and today:\n1. Okcoin.cn (188th now). Today: Bitmex\n2. Btctrade (54th now). Today: Okex\n3. Huobi (4th now). Today: Binance\n4. CHBTC (dead now). Today: Huobi\n5. BTCC (38th now). Today: Bitfinex\n6. Poloniex (29th now). Today: Upbit\n7. BTC100 (dead now). Today: Bithumb\n8. Btcbox (25th now). Today: Hitbtc\n9. Itbit (39th now). Today: GDAX\n10. Kraken. Today: Kraken\nMany people write altcoins off as having no permanency and predict that the majority of cryptos will die a slow death. They may well be right, but as a look at the dominant cryptocurrency exchanges from 2016 shows, few enterprises live long. The churn rate for exchanges exceeds even that of the coins themselves. Coinmarketcap listed 105 exchanges in 2016, versus 213 today, though only 60% of the listed exchanges back then had any sort of meaningful volume of over $10,000 a day. Even accounting for inflation, 90% of today’s exchanges have some semblance of a respectable volume.\nAmong the coins that accounted for the top trading volume in 2016 you’ll find Maidsafe, Nxt, Dogecoin, and even The DAO. Today, most people would agree that the top 10 exchanges have gotten better. Whether the top 10 cryptocurrencies, outside of bitcoin, have improved in quality is another matter. A final indicator of how much the landscape has changed in two years comes from the total trading volume. In August 2016, the top 10 exchanges saw just over $1 billion in cryptocurrencies traded in a day. Today, that figure stands at $10.6 billion. It will be interesting to see, two years from now, how many of 2018’s top exchanges are still standing.\nHow many of 2016’s top 10 exchanges do you recall?

However, this tendency may also underly the seeming contradiction that large corporations, which typically exert centralized control over a product or service, are embracing new decentralized technologies such as blockchain and the token economy.\nKakao is a corporate giant that dominates the Korean mobile market. Its mobile messaging app Kakaotalk accounts for 94 percent of the domestic market. Based on this overwhelming market share, Kakao has successfully expanded its operations into markets such as advertising, gaming, mobile banking, taxi services and music.\nAs a result, Kakao employed 2,600 staff as of 2017 and recorded annual sales of 1.9723 trillion Korean won ($1.8 billion) with an operating profit of 165.3 billion KRW ($154 million).\nThe company recently announced a new blockchain business.\nAs one of the leading “middlemen” that has taken control of the mobile platform market in Korea, if Kakao chooses to embrace blockchain – which eliminates the middleman and allows users to directly exchange value – what would happen to the massive profits the company currently earns in its intermediary role? The ‘middleman’ exists for a reason\nSeeking the answer to that question and more, CoinDesk spoke to Jason Han, the CEO of Ground X – a Kakao subsidiary that has been charged with taking forward the firm’s blockchain strategy.\n“Will the middleman really disappear? Are the middlemen all bad? I don’t think people are thinking seriously about these questions,” he said.\nHan is also skeptical about whether the numerous ICO projects currently underway will be able to produce services on the same level as companies like Kakao or Amazon.\n“ICOs have an odd structure. You’ve already made all of your money by the time you start. Let’s say you can’t dispose of the money for two years. Two years go by very quickly. You spend those two years working on development to get your smart contracts working, then release your service. Maybe 1,000 users sign up. But you need something more to attract more users beyond that. You have to spend a lot on marketing and go through all kinds of trouble to get your name out there. But why bother doing all that? You’ve already made all your money,” he said.\nBefore joining Kakao in March, Han worked as the CTO of an investment company called FuturePlay, where he was responsible for evaluating the technology of companies that were potential investment targets.\n“From my investment experience, there is a huge gap between what startups promise in their white papers and what they actually deliver,” he said.\nThat gap cannot be bridged simply by developing good smart contracts or designing a good token economy, argued Han.\n“Those who have real experience in business will know. When you finish development, it’s not the end of the project – it’s the beginning. Figuring out how to close that gap is a business problem,” he continued, adding:\n“Until last year, nobody talked about business when they were making dapps (decentralized applications), but I think things will be different this year. Decentralization can’t be the core of a service, it’s just a method of providing the service. Tokens can’t be the only kind of value that you offer to users. Tokens are only part of the value. What’s important is the essence of the business itself.” Pinpointing the benefits\nKakao’s proposed blockchain platform, Han said, could be summed up as “partial or gradual decentralization.”\n“Everyone is using blockchain these days because it’s popular,” he said. “I wish people would stop trying to put everything on blockchain.”\nSome of Kakao’s services could be decentralized, while others cannot, Han explained. Rather than uploading a whole service to blockchain, certain functions of the components that make up the service could be separated out for decentralization and tokenization.\n“For example, let’s say that we convert the mileage points system into tokens. From the company’s perspective, it’s just changing the money into a token format. If we did that, it would be more about making mileage more useful rather than sharing our profits with users. When you tokenize non-core aspects of the service, it allows the company to retain its profitability model while also expanding user inflow. With a forward-looking approach, tokens could also be used to provide incentives to users, but in that case there need to be benefits for Kakao as well,” Han said.\nSo, what are the benefits Kakao is seeking through blockchain?\n“The token economy is a business model that no one could have imagined before,” he said. “Until now, Kakao has only operated in Korea, but through blockchain we could expand into the global market. That means taking a portion of the profits we earn as an intermediary and using it to expand our market by sharing it with users.”\nFor example, he said, if Kakao were currently earning 100 units in profits, then growing the market to 1,000 units would eventually allow the firm to give 300 back to users and keep 700 for itself.\n“What kind of strategy could Kakao adopt if it wanted to export its successful service to the Asian market? Each country already has one or two established services. The only solution I can think of is offering incentives through blockchain. With blockchain, you can shake up the existing order.” Competitors on both sides\nKakao’s longstanding rival Naver is also jumping into the blockchain industry with its subsidiary, LINE Plus.\nNorth America-based messenger service Kik is also working on a blockchain business called KIN, while Telegram has raised $1.7 billion through an ICO, the largest amount ever recorded in a token sale.\n“The biggest concern for dapps on ethereum or EOS is how to attract users,” Han said. “Messenger services like Telegram have an advantage since they already have a platform with an established user base. This is why we need to pay attention to what these companies are doing. On the other hand, those messaging services have lots of users but no other services, while Kakao already provides a wide range of services.”\nAlthough Han was skeptical of ICO projects, he does not believe that all of these startups are destined to fail.\n“Twenty years ago, nobody could have imagined a company like Google or Amazon,” he said. “There are so many teams working hard on their own projects, and some of them will be able to create new types of commerce that are completely different from anything we currently know. Some of them may be able to create innovative business models by focusing on decentralization. With blockchain, I think this will only take five or 10 years, not 20.”\nHan provided the advertising market as an example to explain the competition he expects to see in the token economy of the future. In that industry, there are already many blockchain projects seeking to connect advertisers and consumers, thereby generating economic benefits for consumers.\nAt first, it will be difficult to completely remove the middleman and make the service 100 percent decentralized. Since it takes money and effort to attract advertisers and consumers, at first the middleman might take 70 percent of advertising revenue, while consumers would receive the remaining 30 percent. This model would already be competitive against current advertising agencies, where the middleman doesn’t pay a cent to consumers.\nCompetition may lead some companies to offer 50 percent to consumers, then 70 percent, then 100 percent, eventually creating a completely decentralized system.\n“Right now, nobody knows what kinds of services might come out of the blockchain world,” Han says. “We haven’t seen them yet. Steemit has shown us some of the potential, but nobody knows how far it will grow. But if you sit on your hands for a while and then something new comes out, it will already be too late. In this situation, having a go is the right thing to do.” Technical issues and ICOs\nLINE Plus recently announced that it plans to create a blockchain platform using the ICON network. Kakao also plans to use an existing blockchain platform. Since most platforms released so far are open source, Kakao will use the source code of a suitable existing platform and add its own unique functions on top.\nHan explained that Kakao was considering many existing platforms including ethereum, tendermint, cosmos, quorum, EOS and Hyperledger.\n“Ethereum has the highest level of completion,” he said. “But if we want to get started quickly then quorum is also a good option. EOS has not yet released its main network, so it is difficult to conduct a deep analysis of the platform.”\nHe added that most existing projects have problems with performance or processing speed, and there are a host of issues outside of that which also need be resolved. The most important factor is providing a user experience that meets the expectations of the average users.\n“If a platform has a very well-refined philosophy, will users be willing to pay for that value? You need to be issued a private key and install a wallet, but if you lose your private key, you lose all your money. Even the person who created the platform can’t recover the money for you. It’s ridiculous to the average users. Performance and speed are the basics, but even once you’ve got that sorted, it’s just the beginning. The first step for us is figuring out what we need to do to make Kakao’s services work and how to support millions of users accessing a service at the same time.”\nKakao plans to launch its main network alongside meaningful services (dapps) by the end of the year. It appears that the first of those will be mainly created by Kakao itself, as well as external companies that already provide it with services.\n“There are outside companies that are seeking a platform for a reverse ICO, and we are willing to give them a ride on our platform if they are a good fit,” Han said. “We believe that the service should come first, and the platform later. A platform is useless by itself. You need to have a target service and then find a platform that will allow you to perform that service. We are not completely ruling out startups without existing services, but our main focus is on providing services that are already established.\nWith the Korean government effectively banning ICOs last year, issuing tokens is also a sensitive issue. When Kakao announced the establishment of its blockchain subsidiary in March, Financial Services Commission chairman Choi JongKu reaffirmed his negative view on token sales. Kakao has already made it clear that it has no plans to engage in an ICO to raise funds.\nHan concluded:\n“Issuing tokens and listing on an exchange are two separate issues. There are several creative ways to issue tokens, including through an ICO, an airdrop or offering tokens as rewards for active participation on the platform like Steemit does.”\nKakao image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

It has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction.\nDr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were “a subtype of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction”.\nCastle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity.\n“It is a form of gambling [and] people gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it’s mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.”\nAnd that’s where the havoc begins.\n“People dive in because they don’t want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is [cryptocurrency] trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm.”\nIn that regard, it wasn’t surprising people were taken in by the bitcoin craze.\n“I think it’s an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and [sit there] and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That’s what a compulsive gambler wants.” media_camera A UK hospital has begun offering treatment specifically\nThere were parallels with pokie machines, and Mr Burn predicted there would be a rise in the number of bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead.\n“It provides excitement and an escape from reality...It’s a classic bubble situation and the way we see that developing, it could well [get worse] quite soon.”\nIt was relatively easy to start bitcoin trading which was dangerous for young people in particular.\n“It’s relatively easy...you go through the motions...you don’t know who you are dealing with but anyone can get on and it’s relatively easy.”\nBitcoin was particularly dangerous because people were being seduced by the idea of making it rich quick online, where they believed there was a fortune to be made.\nThere are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system.\n“A lot of people hear about something like this [and] they go for a gamble because they don’t want to miss out on the next good thing - a lot of addictive behaviour comes from computers and the internet. This is another specific example that is really, really dangerous.”\nThe situation “just goes bad” from there.\nThe patients he had worked with had been desperate and on the verge of suicide.\n“They are in desperate need of help and are isolated. People don’t realise if you spend 14 hours or so a day on a computer doing this sort of thing it has really negative consequences on other aspects of your life.”\nBitcoin trading therefore was a very modern take on an old problem. That means often people had no idea they were at risk until it was too late.\n“Anybody who is involved with cryptocurrency trading who thinks they could have a problem, chances are they probably do.”\nThe moment of realisation was depressingly familiar.\n“It’s usually when they run out of money and realise there is no way forward. Until then, people convince themselves the next bet would make it okay. We would all do that with any sort of addictive behaviour if there were no consequences.”\nCastle Craig has treated over 10,000 patients for various addictions since it opened in 1988, and claims the majority have gone on to achieve long-term abstinent recovery.

What the macro and fixed income expert isn’t sure of is whether such price manipulations are against the law. The DOJ recently began investigating suspected trading malpractices in the cryptocurrency market. Whales and Miners Influence Bitcoin Prices\nWriting in an op-ed for Forbes , macroeconomist Pter Tchir states that he’d be surprised if there weren’t any shenanigans going on with the way Bitcoin prices move, saying: Whether the activities meet the legal definition of manipulation or can lead to a criminal indictment remains to be seen, but I’d be shocked if there wasn’t manipulation of prices occurring. Never forget Rule number two of the Three Rules of Bitcoin – ‘There are no rules!’\nAccording to Tchir, whales and miners have vested interests in higher Bitcoin prices. For miners, it makes sense for them to want to push prices higher from an economic perspective. Otherwise, mining no longer becomes a profitable enterprise .\nTchir drew comparisons with the mainstream market arguing that wealth concentration gives whales “the incentive to push prices higher.”\nThere is, however, a significant aspect missing from Tchir’s analysis as it ignores the incentives for price declines. Whales can take advantage of these selloffs by shorting bitcoin and strengthen their monopoly of the market. They can acquire more bitcoins at lower prices before driving prices higher again.\nOn May 24, reports emerged that the DOJ and the CFTC were looking to probe suspected bitcoin price manipulation . According to inside sources, spoofing and wash trading are the focus of the investigation. The DOJ believes traders are engaging in illicit trading activities to move crypto prices in their desired direction. Continuous Crypto Price Decline\nTchir is correct in pointing out that the lack of regulations in the market make it possible for such alleged manipulations to occur. Bitcoin is currently experiencing a week-long decline that seen the number one crypto bouncing of support at $7,000 USD.\nAccording to Tchir, the crypto market is losing steam due to an amalgam of problems that have slowed down adoption rate. He also pointed out that the failure of the market to rally after Consensus has taken some of the bullish hype away from the industry.\nThus, as investigations probe suspected price manipulation, Tchir believes that crypto investor confidence is at an all-time low.\nDo you think that there is a manipulation of bitcoin prices?

Dominance of Big Banks in UK Means London Might Miss the Boat on Bitcoin | Buzzeology By\nDominance of Big Banks in UK Means London Might Miss the Boat on Bitcoin .\nFinance\nLondon has loved a standing of an international monetary hub for hundreds of years and served as a pioneer for brand spanking new buying and selling choices for many years. However, some worry it’s now in threat of getting left in the back of via the freshest rising asset elegance – cryptocurrency. One of the major causes for this seems to be the dominance of the large banks over the UK economic system. Also Read: Niall Ferguson Tells Bank of England Bitcoin Is Financial System of the Future Banks Hindering Progress Despite having a thriving fintech startups scene, a longtime buying and selling ecosystem and a number one position in the conventional fiat currencies marketplace, London seems to be lacking the boat on the subject of the rush of institutional cash flowing into crypto finance. Locations corresponding to Tokyo, Chicago, New York or even San Francisco are taking the lead on the subject of regulated platforms, OTC and hedge finances, in addition to exchange-traded derivatives corresponding to futures. And many of us in the trade imagine that is basically because of the outsize affect that the banks have in the City. “Banks have been unusually strict in dealings with crypto,” Max Boonen, a former Goldman Sachs dealer and present CEO of B2C2, a London cryptocurrency marketplace maker, advised FT. “It’s nearly impossible to open an account for crypto in the UK. The problem is that in the UK there is a perception that banks have issues with anti-money laundering and decided to be a lot more conservative.” And David Mercer, CEO of LMAX, an FCA regulated FX buying and selling venue which not too long ago introduced a bodily cryptocurrency replace devoted to serving simply institutional shoppers, expects UK banks would handiest sign up for the marketplace subsequent yr. “London is very bank-driven and we see it as being a late adopter,” he defined. Not Too Late? There also are components that make stronger London’s place in the crypto marketplace, corresponding to CFD agents like IG Group and Plus500 attaining luck with retail investors in addition to Barclays agreeing to open an account for Coinbase. Additionally, there are those who suppose that the subject is overstated. “The City of London, taken as a whole, has the collective experience to make considered and forward-thinking decisions. This experience manifests itself in many ways, from the efficiency of trade execution to KYC & AML regulations and from the strength of our legal system to our culture of effective corporate governance. These reasons are why London dominates the international foreign exchange markets, and it is unthinkable that the City will not continue to be a dominant player in crypto markets,” commented to information.Bitcoin.com Nauman Anees, Co-founder of Think Coin, a multi-asset monetary & cryptocurrency buying and selling replace. Anees added: “London is the dominant player in global financial markets thanks to the strength of its regulatory infrastructure and position as a gateway & conduit between every key global market – and while the crypto markets are novel in many ways, these key contextual advantages still apply. Moreover, events in recent years show the crypto space is one where ‘first mover advantage’ does not apply. Repeated hacks of key exchanges along with the slow pace of international regulation has meant that many ‘early adopters’ have not been positioned to fully develop and grow with the market, meaning that a more cautious approach will likely prove to pay the biggest dividends later. That said, the idea that there is a corporate resistance to crypto adoption in London is misguided. Most of the major investment banks have opened crypto desks, and the ones which haven’t already announced are undoubtedly experimenting behind the scenes.” How will have to London make certain that the crypto revolution does now not go it via?

Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Lowering Withdrawal Limit\nBithumb reportedly said on Monday that it has “decided to gradually reduce the withdrawal limit for customer accounts that have not converted to real-name confirmation accounts,” starting on June 4, according to MTN. This announcement closely follows the exchange confirming that it will block trading in 11 countries including North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, as well as strengthening the account verification process for foreign users.\nThe South Korean regulators established the real-name system for crypto accounts at the end of January in order to end the anonymous trading of cryptocurrencies. However, the conversion rate has been low. In early May, only about 30% had switched to real-name accounts. Today it is still possible to transact cryptocurrencies in Korea using unregistered accounts.\n“According to Bithumb, about 60% of customers do not switch to a real-name verification accounts,” the news outlet detailed, adding that the exchange currently has a daily withdrawal limit of 50 million won (~US$46,465) and a monthly limit of 300 million won (~$278,753).\nInitially, “If the account is not confirmed by this measure [real-name], the daily withdrawal limit will be reduced to 45 million won [~$41,795] from next month,” the publication elaborated. While the exchange has not revealed how low the withdrawal limit will eventually be, a Bithumb official was quoted explaining:\nWe have decided to gradually reduce the withdrawal amounts in the Korean won because it is raising concerns that bank accounts for non-convertible withdrawals may become a target of various financial crimes. Complying With 5-5-7 Regulation\nIn addition, Bithumb also announced on Monday that it has “built a first-class financial information security personnel and budget system.” The exchange says it is the first cryptocurrency exchange to have “followed all [of the] 5-5-7 [Regulation’s] provisions within the electronic banking supervisory regulations,” chapter 32, section 8, paragraph 2.\nThe 5-5-7 Regulation recommends that 5% of a financial organization’s total workforce be IT specialists, 5% of which be dedicated to information security, and 7% of the company’s overall budget be used for privacy. Bithumb elaborated:\nIn May 2018, the current Bithumb’s total employees compared to IT staff ratio is about 21%, and the proportion of IT staff who are responsible for information security is 10%.

If it keeps holding as a floor, price could head back to the resistance around $9,000. Oscillators are suggesting that a return in bullish momentum is in order.\nBitcoin price is finding support at the bottom of its symmetrical triangle while oscillators indicate oversold conditions.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside, which suggests that a break below support is still possible.\nPrice is also trading below the 100 SMA so this moving average could hold as near-term resistance in a bigger bounce. The gap between the moving averages is sufficiently wide so there is no imminent threat of a bullish crossover.\nHowever, RSI is pulling up from oversold levels to signal that buyers are getting back on their feet. Similarly stochastic is moving out of the oversold region to signal a return in buying pressure. A bullish divergence can also be observed for this oscillator as stochastic made lower lows since April while bitcoin price made higher lows. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nEven though cryptocurrencies have been hit by risk-off flows recently, it looks like fears of rising anti-EU sentiment are driving up demand for bitcoin again. This has been particularly evident during previous referendums wherein euro zone nations threatened to leave the bloc.\nItaly is said to be headed for another round of polls as the coalition government leaders are unable to draw enough support. Some say that the elections could be a proxy for a referendum vote, possibly even spurring anti-EU sentiment in other countries like Spain and Portugal.\nThe polls aren’t likely to happen until late July or even September, which means continued political uncertainty in the region and a chance for anti-EU parties to gain more traction.

News , Chelan County , crypto , cryptocurrency , Electricity , News\nThe electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining operations has always been a thorn in the side of many people. Various studies on this topic have been published over the years. In Chelan County, Washington, a major development is taking place. Rural electric utilities are taking an aggressive stance against various Bitcoin mining firms over their “disruption” of the local power grid. Chelan County Turns on Bitcoin Mining\nOver the past two to three years, various Bitcoin mining firms have set up shop in Washington’s Chelan County . This part of the state has an abundance of renewable energy, and its power grid seems more than capable of supporting large energy draws. While this situation has worked out quite well for several years, local residents are getting fed up with these Bitcoin miners, by the look of things.\nIn fact, a crusade of sorts has been taking place in Chelan County. Rural electric utilities have conducted a hearing regarding the future of these local Bitcoin mining firms. This event took place two weeks ago but only made media headlines over the weekend. There was so much public interest in the hearing that a second room had to be opened so everyone could attend it live.\nChelan County has become increasingly appealing to Bitcoin mining firms due to its access to hydropower. This form of renewable energy allows mining firms to benefit from cheaper power in rather large quantities. As such, multiple companies have set up shop in the county, although a few problems have arisen.\nOne of the primary issues is that there are a lot of farms and other areas previously used for other purposes which have been transformed into Bitcoin mining operations. While this is a positive trend for the cryptocurrency industry , no success goes by unpunished. All three public utilities in Chelan County are determining how best to deal with all of these mining firms. One possible outcome is that they could choose not to increase their energy offerings to these companies, which would hinder the companies’ growth plans.\nWhile the demand for electric power in Chelan County tends to grow each year, the latest increase has been well beyond expectations. Since January of 2017, there has been a demand for 210 megawatts just to power Bitcoin mining operations. This is virtually the same amount as the entire county and its 73,000 residents are using right now. Doubling the electric power output of the region is no easy feat, and it seems the utility providers are looking for ways to avoid having to do so.\nMoreover, there is the problem of how large energy purchases work exactly. Some miners think they can simply talk to an official in order to purchase electricity for their Bitcoin mining operation. That is not how things work in the real world. Furthermore, there are the unusual spikes in power usage which utility crews have to deal with. Bitcoin mining is a booming business in Washington, but it is also causing a lot of problems for the companies delivering the required electricity to miners.

In fact, just two out of the top 50 cryptocurrencies were in positive territory.\nOver the last 24 hours the Litecoin (LTC) price is down 3.7%, the Stellar (XLM) price has fallen 6.5%, the Cardano (ADA) price has dropped 7.2%, the TRON (TRX) price has shed 10% of its value, and the IOTA (MIOTA) price is 4.5% lower.\nUnfortunately, with sentiment still very negative, it looks as though the crypto market could continue its decline on Tuesday.\nBecause of the negative sentiment, I would suggest investors look at this major tech investment opportunity instead of cryptos.\nOne of the world's richest people is sounding the alarm on what could be a trillion-dollar technology.\nAnd when a tech billionaire - several times over - speaks, it pays to listen.\nThis could be your chance to get in on the ground floor!\nClick here to discover a $19.9 trillion dollar idea -- hidden in plain sight!\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Euro Faces Repeat Politics\nData uploaded to social media by eToro analyst Mati Greenspan shows that despite its downturn in May, Bitcoin is still 7% higher than it was April 1, while the euro has dropped 6%.\n“Draw your own conclusions,” Greenspan commented. Just for the fun of it. Here's a graph comparing Bitcoin to the Euro since the beginning of April.\nGreen is BTC = +7%\n— Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 28, 2018\nWhile acknowledging the comparison was “just for fun,” the EUR/BTC comparison makes for surprising reading, while the underlying motivation for the euro’s abrupt descent points to far more serious future implications.\nItaly will head towards fresh elections in 2018, but the results will be anything but an improvement, former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis warned May 28.\nThe refusal of president Sergio Mattarella to appoint eurosceptic Paolo Savona as finance minister will give strength to some of the more virulent populist voices in Italian politics, Varoufakis warned, notably Northern League leader Matteo Salvini:\nIn short, (Mattarella) fell right into Mr Salvini’s trap. The formation of another ‘technical’ government, under a former IMF apparatchik, is a fantastic gift to Mr Salvini. Crypto Commentators Smell Blood\nThe uncertainty has so far given a boost to Bitcoin price today as news our of Italy is beginning to resemble previous events such as the Cypriot bank bailout and Greek debt crisis .\nThe susceptibility of euro for cryptocurrency commentators nonetheless remains a preoccupation.\n“For a fiat currency, this is a huge dump,” WhalePanda claimed in a Twitter debate on the currency’s crash. Damn this coin has taking a beating the last couple of days… Oh wait that's the $EURUSD chart. #FiatRekt Good thing I'm hedged in #Bitcoin 🙃 pic.twitter.com/7WDKj35e48\n— WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) May 29, 2018\nItaly’s stocks meanwhile continue to bear the brunt of financial panic, with two-year yields seeing their biggest one-day move in history, ZeroHedge reports , describing the event as a “full-blown liquidation avalanche.”\nThe knock-on effects reached Germany, where Deutsche Bank’s stock dipped below €10 for the first time since the bank faced a crisis of its own in 2016.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin’s performance versus the euro?

However, this is only half true.\nWhat many people fail to remember is that the brain isn’t actually a single entity. It is made up of many different parts, and each of these parts is responsible for a different task. It is the collaboration between all of these different parts that truly makes our brain so amazing and that ultimately allows our body to function.\nSimilarly, a single organization is made up of a number of different entities. In order for the organization to run smoothly, each one of these entities must fulfill its specific role. Desirable results will only be produced if the crowd is coordinated properly. Why is It So Difficult to Coordinate Organizations?\nCoordinating the entities within an organization or corporation sounds simple in theory, but is much more difficult in practice – especially in cases where the organization is particularly large.\nThe first significant obstacle that stands in the way of effective coordination is the fact that it is exceedingly difficult to maintain agility with respect to rapidly changing conditions. The second main obstacle is that it can be difficult to preserve the alignment of interest, engagement, and trust among members.\nIf an organization is particularly large, it will often have a lot of internal friction to deal with. On the other hand, if an organization is small, it will have lots of external competition that it must overcome.\nIn both cases, it can be extremely difficult to overcome these problems, and many organizations fail as a result. How Can We Solve This Problem?\nBlockchain hype is at an all-time high, and its increasing popularity is enabling us to come up with solutions to problems we previously found virtually impossible to solve.\nTo fully understand the applications of the blockchain, it is important to understand that the blockchain itself is a very specific decentralized governance system.\nIn particular, it has introduced a new possible form of web organization, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This is an organization where decisions are made electronically, either by written computer code or through a vote cast by its members.\nThe DAO has been around for a substantial amount of time now, and is no longer an esoteric concept. Essentially, DAOs are open, self-organized collectives. They are coordinated by economic incentives and self-executing code that cooperates around shared goals, and provide a revenue model and therefore an incentive for the production of open, shareable resources.\nDAOs are expected to radically change the way we organize things – from startups to major corporations to nonprofits, and even nation-states. They have even been called the ‘companies of the future’.\nHowever, up until now, DAOs have lacked many of the critical elements required to be successfully deployed. Making DAOs Mainstream\nDAOstack is essentially an operating system for DAOs. It promotes the concept of collective intelligence and acts as a toolkit for decentralized collaboration at scale.\nThe purpose of the application is to act as a catalyst to foster a new way of creative thinking to solve complex problems.\nBy using the DAOstack platform, open-source creators from all over the world will be able to collaborate to create their own decentralized applications. They will be granted the ability to distribute ‘individual ownership’ within the product to those who have contributed value.\nSome of the potential uses of DAOstack include: Organization – making it easier and simpler to form startups, companies, and nonprofits. Scalability – the technology can be used to accommodate future innovations, regardless of their size or demands. Governance – through use of its token-based ecosystem, the application will have the ability to govern financial systems.\nThe Blockchain Industry is About to Be Shaken Up\n“Bitcoin governance” has become a huge topic of discussion over the past few months. Vitalik Buterin himself has written extensively on the topic. However, a result of these changes, it’s becoming increasingly likely that we’re going to have to reframe our understanding of what the term really means.\nInstead of being limited to the rules that have been specifically implemented to regulate a particular blockchain-based application, we will have to take note of the rules contributing to the regulation of a system’s underlying architecture.\nThere’s no doubt that this is a big deal, and that we’re about to witness some relatively extensive changes to the blockchain industry over the next few months as a result.\n–\nFor more information on DAOstack please visit their website: https://daostack.io/\n* The views expressed in this article belong to the author.

The company claims that this attack could possibly “decimate” that the whole cryptocurrency network.\nQihoo 360 went on to describe that poor actors would have the ability to attack the system by building and releasing smart contracts containing malicious code on the EOS mainnet and also have EOS supernodes package them to new blocks.\nSubsequently that the code could influence all nodes on the community, such as those of cryptocurrency pockets and trades, allowing the attackers gain control of personal keys to cryptocurrency trades.\nWhile EOS hasn’t yet made any public comment on the problem, Qihoo 360 said in a different site update the project’s lead programmer, Daniel Larimer, has been informed of the issues he has since said the vulnerabilities — identified as issue amount 3498 on Github — have already been mended.\n“If any of these asserts trigger in release it shouldn’t pass, but should throw. Allowing the code to continue running in release is a potential security vulnerability and will likely result in crashes elsewhere,” Larimer composed on the Github page.\nMeanwhile, Larimer has now appealed for more outside Aid in identifying critical bugs from the machine together with the job’s mainnet launch only days off, begging:-LRB- ) Help us locate critical bugs #EOSIO prior to our 1.0 release. $10K to each and every exceptional bug which can result in a crash, privilege escalation, or non-deterministic behaviour in contracts that are smart.

Bitcoin ATM Count Breaks 3,000 Despite the lackluster price action of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in recent months, the Bitcoin ATM industry appears as healthy as ever. The latest data from CoinATMradar shows that the number of Bitcoin vending machines has passed the 3,000 milestone in mid-May and is currently at 3,125 machines worldwide. This milestone comes just 15 months after surpassing the 1,000 mark back at the beginning of 2017, indicating an accelerating pace , which now stands at 6.15 installations daily. Back in April, Bitcoinist reported on a UK-based ATM startup, BCB ATM, whose rapid expansion is just one example of a rapidly growing market. In just eleven months through 2017, BCB ATM’s machine count grew from 7 to 32 or by 528.07 percent. Bitcoin ATM Operators Unfazed by Price Slump\nWhat’s more, it appears that the Q1 2018 Bitcoin price slump has not had much of an effect on the installation rate. In fact, the last time there was a drop-off was in late-2015, when the price of Bitcoin was as low as $200 USD.\nHowever, the market has grown at an accelerating pace in the past 3 years with rising prices. From the latest data, we can assume two things with certainty: 1) the demand for buying (and selling) Bitcoin through automatic vending machines is increasing, and 2) the business model is largely profitable for the operators despite the price volatility.\nMoreover, the share of two-way machines, allowing both buying and selling, has also increased to over 35 percent with improved hardware, whose operators scoop up the fees on both sides of the trade at 8.77 percent on average per transaction.\nAt the same time, Bitcoin remains king despite an increasing number of altcoin vending options. In fact, 99.99 percent of all machines support Bitcoin, while only 50 percent of all machines support some type of altcoin(s). Litecoin is the most popular altcoin, supported by 47.8 percent of the ATMs, with Ether coming second at 28.1 percent.\nOut of the 31 total hardware manufacturers, the top three include Genesis Coin (34.37%), General Bytes (27.49%), and Lamassu (11.23%) who comprise over 70 percent of the entire market.\nAt the same time, the United States remains the clear leader of installations with over 1,800 machines, dwarfing second-place Canada, whose count stands at 477 and then Austria in third place with just 174. Bitcoin ATMs Don’t Paint the Whole Picture\nOf course, Bitcoin ATMs is just one facet of a much bigger industry that provides cryptocurrency buying and selling services. Indeed, the amount of physical locations where one can purchase Bitcoin , whether it’s through vouchers, gift cards, web-money kiosks, etc., is much larger, numbering in the tens of thousands across the globe.\nFor example, anyone can buy Bitcoin at the 1,357 Swiss Railway ticket kiosks in Switzerland. Ukraine boasts almost 7,000 web-money kiosks that let you also buy bitcoins. While Canada’s sprawling network of Flexepin cashier machines can be found at over 5,500 locations .\nAll of these services provide useful options for those who prefer not to deal with online exchanges and are looking to quickly buy or sell Bitcoin for some local cash. At the same time, the increasing pace of expansion points to a healthy industry that has adapted to the volatile market conditions and has found its niche.\nHow important is the Bitcoin ATM industry to Bitcoin’s overall adoption?

Call our experts for a consultation today.\nWhat are bitcoins?\nThe bitcoin is regarded as a cryptocurrency belonging to a virtual banking system established on the internet. Though it has been around for several years, awareness among the people developed only recently. As decentralized digital money, bitcoins are computer currency that is in the lines of a computer code and influence monetary value. Mathematical computations are used to create this public digital money, which is monitored by miners.\nTransactions are usually carried out between users directly with no intermediaries involved. Cryptography is used to create network nodes that verify the validity of the transactions, which are then recorded into a public distribution ledger called a blockchain. Governments generally do not have any control over cryptocurrencies and the creation of new coins depend upon the market cap. Ideally, their production decreases over a period of time, making them valuable in the future.\nCryptocurrencies come with high anonymity rates and one of the biggest advantages of bitcoin is, they can be stored on your individual hard drive.\nHow do they work?\nOnce a person owns bitcoins it is like owning gold coins. Since they come with a self-contained value, banks are not required to move and store the money. You can also purchase goods and services online with bitcoins.

Jim's unique and exclusive daily technical report is an absolute must for any trader/investor/market watcher who closely follows Bitcoin.\n(Kitco News) - Bitcoin-U.S. dollar prices are higher in early U.S. trading Tuesday, on a corrective bounce from recent selling pressure.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

It is an unfortunate development, but one that is entirely to be expected in any industry gaining mainstream traction. In the case of Bitcoin, a completely new scam is making the rounds. As part of this effort, users may receive an email claiming that they have to fork over Bitcoin if they “value their life and family”. Bitcoin Scams Evolve Somewhat\nIt is always important to put things into their proper perspective when a Bitcoin scam arises. The latest venture is not new by any means, as it has been making the rounds for at least ten years. However, the scam never previously asked for a Bitcoin payment, which puts a somewhat new twist on this existing scam. It’s not necessarily the best base for a money grab, but it may still work out for some scammers.\nThe scam in question comes in the form of an email which was seemingly sent out in a completely random manner. In the message, scammers tell users that they have been instructed to kill the recipient of this email by a “close friend”. A lot of people will laugh off such a message, but given the way our society works these days, no threat should be taken lightly, as unrealistic as it might seem at first.\nThe sender also claims that the victim has been under surveillance for some time now and decided to put their reputation at stake by not killing their assigned target. Instead, they are asking for a payment of 0.5 Bitcoin – though the amount is subject to change – to avoid having to kill their target. The email includes a Bitcoin address to which the payment can be sent.\nWhile this is clearly a fake threat, it is likely that some people will fall for it. Sending half a Bitcoin to strangers on the internet is always asking for problems. Additionally, Bitcoin is not an anonymous currency, and thus it makes no real sense for professional scammers to use this particular payment method. Even so, smaller scammers continue to think Bitcoin is the go-to tool to mask their online activity, but they will be sorely disappointed at the end of the day.\nAnyone in the world knows that assassins can be hired to kill people of interest. Some of this activity will undoubtedly occur on the dark web, which has become the go-to place for criminals, scammers, and people with anything but honest intentions to do their business. Even so, it is highly unlikely that anyone would hire an assassin to kill the recipient specifically, especially if he or she is not a public figure or anyone of major importance to the rest of the world.\nThe fact that this ‘comply or die’ scam is now asking for a Bitcoin payment does raise some interesting questions. While the popularity of cryptocurrency has not waned much – especially not among criminals – it only makes the message appear even less legitimate.

May 29 08:16 2018 One of the technological world’s biggest mystery to this day, is the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the computer programmer (or programmers) who created and developed the digital currency known as Bitcoin. There is much speculation as to whether Satoshi is an actual person, or a collection of individuals using a pseudonym for a consortium of cypherpunk developers that designed wrote and tested the Bitcoin experiment. The background of Bitcoin Created in 2009, Bitcoin is a digital currency introduced as open source software by MIT student, Satoshi Nakamoto. On November 2008, a whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” authored by Satoshi was posted to a cryptography mailing list, sparking the first ever mention of Bitcoin. In January 2009, the bitcoin network was established after Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block, the first ever block on the chain. Since the inception of bitcoin, the currency has peaked at $19,140.70 USD. What was the vision of Bitcoin – Decentralized financial system nondependent on banks and corporations Bitcoin is built on the notion that money is any object or record, that is accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic grouping. To control the creation and transfer of money, Bitcoin uses cryptography, or mathematical equations rather than relying on governments or central banking authorities. Transfers for loans, sales, purchases or any other methods of payment can be processed by anybody, using a desktop, smart phone, tablet, or laptop. This is all possible without the need for a financial institution to act as an intermediary or recording agent. Bitcoin is not just money for the internet; it is a programming language that allows for the decentralization of any information system. In order to understand this let’s use the analogy of the internet; which allows any individual admission to a global communication and information network instantaneously. In this same way, Bitcoin is allowing individuals’ instant access to a free global financial network. The implication of a decentralized financial network free from the corruption of third party moderators is overwhelming. Ponder for a moment introducing 7 billion potential consumers to the global marketplace. The possibilities for economic growth and innovation are exponential. This exists because Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, chose to create open source software that gave all users equal say. The power of the Bitcoin network is its users, which currently exceeds the combined computing power of the top 600 super computers on Earth. This equates to a network, which is for all intents of purposes, impenetrable. Essentially, each individual computer acts as a voting node. The validity of the current Bitcoin equation, otherwise known as the block chain, is then determined by the nodes. In order for the block chain to be verified, a majority of the voting nodes must corroborate if the equation is done correctly. This process happens in nanoseconds, meaning not all voting nodes will participate in every given block chain verification. The Bitcoin protocol not only has the power to shape and influence the future of our global financial network, but also of our voting, our phones, and our cable television. The Bitcoin software can be implemented into any system that is based on an unbiased third-party mediator. As the software is policed by all participating members, the possibility of corruption, or hacking the system is minuscule. Regardless of whether or not the Bitcoin currency ever turns into a legitimate mainstream form of monetary transaction remains to be seen, however the revolution in software that Nakamoto has unleashed has only just begun. What is a God Protocol – Nick Szabo idea Imagine a financial system controlled by AI, barred from government or corporation interventions. This would represent everyone in an ideal system in which there is no third-party manipulation. In 1998, Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called “Bit Gold”. Bit Gold was never implemented but has been called a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture. Based on the words of Nick Szabo, third trusted parties are security holes. When a protocol relies on third trusted parties, it has to patch the security holes that the mere centralization creates and that can be fairly costly. What is Faythe, the first god protocol Introducing Faythe, the first god protocol – an anonymous decentralized movement with human trusted third parties where those parties provide insight or knowledge that cannot be provided by a computer. Faythe aims to fight cryptocurrency censorship, public manipulation and corporations forcing governments to protect them against decentralization. Faythe is currently in pre-ico stage and is open to contributions. Anyone can contribute or join the project, and early contributors will receive FAYTHE tokens as a bonus which can be exchanged for FAYTHE coins after the Faythe public release. Faythe in the vision of SN for the future Satoshi envisioned a payment system that was faster, cheaper and irreversible. No financial institution needed. Nor did it need a 3rd party to mediate conflicts either. “ A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution .’’– Satoshi Nakamoto. Decentralization makes sense; the idea of sending payments without going through a financial institution is what Satoshi envisioned. Now that Bitcoin has been in existence for more than nine years, its strengths have been revealed. For a project that was initially ignored and then mocked by the financial world, Bitcoin is amazingly resilient. Bitcoin has demonstrated to the world that blockchain technology works, and, for certain use cases, works amazingly well. It has solved the problem of exchanging money between strangers without resorting to a third party. Blockchain transactions are faster and cheaper than traditional models due to it’s irreversible nature, making it safer and more convenient for online payments. Those of us who have been involved in Bitcoin for years should step back every once in a while, and marvel at its capabilities. It is truly a technological and economic miracle. However Faythe is about to solve one of the biggest problems that the original blockchain didn’t. Faythe will control the ins and outs and will be able to bridge blockchains in a way that will make everything be able to operate as a complete financial system. The Faythe Alpha Net is already being tested and multiple participants will join before the end of the year.\nMedia Contact", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T12:47:07.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28ce46f4bcdb97ab781aa9731e533775ccf3d8dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeEp0fUkrsH9FNxKFdb8sendHq_sfjr76KQ.a.FOjwOX.YZlGq4uA1G66uPTCl7l49Ox7JmEjhxi1HrIB4NFBYRKnsCucHNvs-", "site_full": "trenz.today", "site": "trenz.today", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "BITCOIN MILLIONAIRE EXPLAINS CRASH MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY – Trenz.Today", "title_full": "BITCOIN MILLIONAIRE EXPLAINS CRASH MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY – Trenz.Today", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://trenz.today/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cropped-small-logo-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "28ce46f4bcdb97ab781aa9731e533775ccf3d8dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeEp0fUkrsH9FNxKFdb8sendHq_sfjr76KQ.a.FOjwOX.YZlGq4uA1G66uPTCl7l49Ox7JmEjhxi1HrIB4NFBYRKnsCucHNvs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN MILLIONAIRE EXPLAINS CRASH MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY – Trenz.Today", "text": "Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

People coming from all over the world speaking languages of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day.\nOn the 6th floor of the hotelhere held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time.\nDozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him.\nRight side is Liao Wang\nLiao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space. He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi (a blockchain company) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization.\nSelected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech:\n“China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now.\n“Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.”\n“The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that.\n“Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now.\n“Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good:\nDubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.”\nDubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office.\nDr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.”\n“Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper.

Moreover, while volatility is great for traders, it impedes mainstream adoption.\nCboe data show that despite last week’s pop in volatility, the trend is heading south. Cboe XBT futures weekly lead volatility\n“From a volatility standpoint, the overall trend is certainly lower, but, in contradiction to that trend, last week was the most volatile for lead-month futures since the middle of April,” wrote Peter Lusk, senior instructor for the Options Institute at the Cboe.\n“Since the start of trading of the futures at Cboe in December, the average weekly XBT volatility has been 21.7% (through May 18). However, since the middle of March, volatility has run below that average, showing a downward trend.”\nA lead month is the earliest settlement expiration from the current trading day. Altcoins on the move\nCryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, colloquially known as altcoins, are on track to record solid gains Tuesday.\nEther ETHUSD, -1.11% has surged 8.7% to $568.80, Bitcoin Cash BCHUSD, +0.92% has climbed 8.6% to $994, Litecoin LTCUSD, +0.02% is up 7.5% at $121.87 and Ripple’s XRP coin XRPUSD, +0.31% is at 60 cents, up 5.9% on the day.\nAfter Monday’s holiday in the U.S., bitcoin futures closed higher Tuesday. The Cboe June contract XBTM8, -0.03% finished up 1% at $7,497.50, while the CME June contract BTCM8, +0.27% closed up 0.7% at $7,495.

Markets are tumbling precipitously towards $300 billion, their lowest point since mid-April and a key support level. Failure to hold this could send all cryptos down towards their end of March yearly lows. Bitcoin has floundered again losing 3% on the day and falling to $7,150. Ethereum has also been battered and all altcoins are currently bleeding. There are no cryptocurrencies showing gains in the top 50 during the morning’s Asian trading session.\nWe have to go back to the end of March to the last time every single crypto currency was bleeding. Technical analysts are warning of a bearish breakout as Bitcoin closes below a long term consolidation pattern. Ethereum has fared worse losing 6% on the day and falling to $530. There is a high probability of it falling further, below $500 which is currently a major support level.\nIn the top 25 the altcoins suffering the greatest losses at the time of writing are Bitcoin Cash down 9.5%, Tron crashing 13.5%, Nem losing 10.3%, VeChain down 10%, Bytecoin dropping 13.4%, Zcash down 12%, Icon losing 10.5% and Zilliqa shedding 12.5%. Looking at Coinmarketcap’s gainers and losers for the day shows a few obscure altcoins making positive moves signaling pump and dump action.\nTotal trade volume has increased a little over the past day from $13 to $17 billion but market capitalization has fallen 6.7% as $22 billion left the crypto space in 24 hours. Bears are currently smashing the markets which look like they could be heading back to the $270 billion level the same time two months ago. Since the monthly high of $470 billion on May 6, crypto markets had hemorrhaged 35%. Bitcoin market dominance is up to around 40% as Ethereum and all altcoins take a heavy beating for the third time in 2018.

It successfully mined 13 Bitcoins reportedly worth around $100,000 and apparently threw away the keys in its quest to remain ethical in its reporting on cryptocurrency. Years later, Louise Matsakis, staff writer at WIRED, said the magazine could have locked the coins down to be used at a future date.\nButterfly Labs had shared a 5-gigahash-per-second Bitcoin miner with WIRED so that it could review the miner. Paying customers would have had to invest $274 for the system that WIRED received. At the time, miners didn't need the powerful, specialized hardware required to mine crytocurrencies that is required today.\nBy essentially winning the Bitcoin lottery a couple times, WIRED earned itself over 13 coins, which left it confronting a moral dilemma. When former senior writer for WIRED Robert McMillian reported on the earnings, he set forth the poignant question of what they should do with the proceeds. After a lengthy conversation, staff members couldn't agree on what to do with the earnings, but, Matsakis said, \"what was agreed upon was that the money shouldn't just sit there, because it could influence how the magazine reported on cryptocurrencies.\"\nTo settle the matter, WIRED decided to destroy the private keys that unlock the Bitcoin wallet so that the funds could never be spent. \"Originally I was going to say that the closest metaphor I have is that we dropped a car key somewhere in the Atlantic, but I think it's closer for me to say we dropped the key somewhere between here and the Alpha Centauri,\" said Stefan Antonowicz, the then-head of engineering at WIRED who set up the miner.\nRecovering lost or stolen Bitcoin is impossible, according to Cryptalker . That's bad news for anyone at WIRED who hoped to maybe someday recover the keys. Shredding the private keys to its 13 Bitcoin is a loss, but one that pales in comparison to the estimated 2.78 and 3.79 million lost coins in the worldwide abyss. Why Not Watch?

In an October interview, he warned investors of the risks around the popular, unregulated crowdfunding tools that raise money for cryptocurrencies.\n“There are a lot of these initial coin offerings, which are in my opinion absolute scams and people should be very wary of things that are going on in that area,” Wales said in an October 4 interview with CNBC .\nRead: The SEC created a fake ICO website to show just how easy it is to scam investors\nThe internet entrepreneur’s comments come as the No. 1 digital currency is in the midst of a dire stretch, coming off three consecutive weekly losses for the first time since September 2017, pushing bitcoin BTCUSD, +2.87% to a six-week low.\nDespite his negative outlook for the industry, there is a reason Wales may hope he is wrong — in 2014, Wikipedia announced it had started accepting bitcoin as a form of donation, which it still does today .\nAaron Hankin Aaron Hankin is a MarketWatch reporter in New York who covers cryptocurrency and financial markets.\nWe Want to Hear from You Join the conversation\nComment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give", "https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/07/30/wikimedia-foundation-now-accepts-bitcoin/", "http://twitter.com/@ahhankin", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/05/ico-or-initial-coin-offerings-are-an-absolute-scam-wikipedias-jimmy-wales.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "—jimmy wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy wales", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wikipedia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockshow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:21:52.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9329853f1614dcb0827663b5b8ef5e6402245be7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcHeNG8XIoU.ySUi2k41fFrBXeQSbQSbI_1FGOYLONLvFfecJ_rX6x62y4ndRl.LiPgvN5GrENHAK5fqdnt2fCD_g6Qzl_JeMTUr7IBlSyHlKAayh71VDrWA--", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - eToro Signs on French Tennis Professional Gael Monfils as Global Ambassador - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - eToro Signs on French Tennis Professional Gael Monfils as Global Ambassador - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.976, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Etoro-Gael-Monfils.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9329853f1614dcb0827663b5b8ef5e6402245be7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcHeNG8XIoU.ySUi2k41fFrBXeQSbQSbI_1FGOYLONLvFfecJ_rX6x62y4ndRl.LiPgvN5GrENHAK5fqdnt2fCD_g6Qzl_JeMTUr7IBlSyHlKAayh71VDrWA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - eToro Signs on French Tennis Professional Gael Monfils as Global Ambassador - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New – eToro Signs on French Tennis Professional Gael Monfils as Global Ambassador Best New – eToro Signs on French Tennis Professional Gael Monfils as Global Ambassador Best New Cryptocurrency By root / May 29, 2018\neToro, the social trading network, has signed French professional tennis player Gael Monfils on as its global ambassador.\nMonfils is no stranger to success. At the age of 31, he has already won seven Associated of Tennis Professionals (ATP) singles titles, competed in several Grand Slam tournaments, and is due to play two more later this year.\nIn a 42-second video titled ‘ Get Serious About Investing ,’ a ‘professional narrator’ uses the words ‘dedication’ and ‘success’ to make a connection between playing tennis and investing in the financial markets. The aim of the video is to grab the viewer’s attention before telling them to get serious about investing on eToro.\nBut what do tennis and trading have in common that makes this pairing work?\neToro offers a multi-asset, web-based investment platform that allows users to easily buy, hold, and sell assets, including ETFs, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. It currently provides trading on 10 digital currencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BCH , XRP, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Stellar, NEO , and EOS . With over nine million registered users in 140 countries, eToro has managed to make trading approachable to a range of clients.\nOne of which is Monfils. Known for his colourful personality, and despite his hectic training schedule, the tennis professional still manages to trade online and does so via eToro.\nTrading on the platform since October 2017, Monfils first heard about the trading network from his brother-in-law. When he joined he was drawn to eToro’s wide selection of digital currencies and its innovative CopyFund investment strategies, which are ready-made, fully allocated, managed investment portfolios. Another feature that Monfils enjoys is the CopyTrader, which enables traders to allocate funds to copy other traders’ portfolios in real time.\nYet, just as tennis takes dedication, hard work, raw talent, and the ability to handle adverse circumstances, so too does being an online trader. For eToro taking on Monfils as its global ambassador seemed to go hand-in-hand. Some of eToro’s main values include leadership, innovation, and fun. Monfils embodies many of these values, which is why the collaboration between the two is quite natural – just like an ace served up in tennis to win the game.

Chinese mining conglomerate Bitmain had recently announced the release of an ASIC designed for mining the similar, privacy-based cryptocurrency Zcash, which ultimately led to some concerns in the cryptocurrency space, and Zcoin is looking to offer reassurance.\nFounded in September of 2016, Zcoin was constructed to tackle decentralization and privacy issues on the blockchain. It was also the first currency to implement the Zerocoin protocol and provide financial privacy by using zero-knowledge proofs.\nCreated by Alex Biryukov and Dmitry Khovratovich in June 2016, MTP is designed to target miner centralization caused by ASICs and permit entry to the mining space for CPUs and GPUs. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine , Zcoin’s Chief Operating Officer Reuben Yap explained how MTP works to demonopolize the cryptocurrency mining space.\n“When you have specialized machines, X dollars will get you a hash rate 1000 times stronger than if I spend X dollars on a CPU or GPU, so if I spend $2,000 on a bitcoin ASIC miner, I’ll get a higher performance than if I spent $2,000 on a GPU rig,” he said.\n“MTP’s aim is to make the price and performance as close to each other regardless of whether you use an ASIC, GPU or CPU, so no one can gain an unfair advantage through the use of specialized hardware. It is back to the idea of egalitarian mining where Satoshi was expressing one CPU per vote.”\nYap pointed out that ASIC manufacturers like Bitmain are not incentivized to sell miners at more affordable prices. But, by allowing people to use their existing hardware, without requiring something specialized to remain competitive, everyone can be kept “on fair footing as opposed to only the miner manufacturers having control.”\nThe system was first published in January 2018 and was used to strengthen algorithms against attacks found in both academic peer reviews and Zcoin-funded MTP bounty programs. MTP can handle large memory sizes from two to eight GBs, which pits it favorably against other leading PoW systems like Scrypt, Equihash and Cryptonight.\nMTP also discourages the use of botnets — infected computers that are controlled to mine cryptocurrencies — as its high memory usage would likely alert users of infected systems due to heavy impacts on a system’s performance. Botnets have often taken advantage of ASIC-resistant algorithms in the past, though MTP requires considerably more memory for proof computation like mining than it does for proof verification.\nZcoin is now refining its MTP code to prepare the application for extended testing. It will also be launching bounties for open-sourced miners and pool software prior to its release on the main net.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . 2018-05-29 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry khovratovich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuben yap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex biryukov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoins ahoy price chart zcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mtp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T01:35:44.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1aa636342da3584d838c00d98ba628377f2c6a08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JiI33rCgHUNQ35ltdGg.lWV.78lqQdN7L1WV706M9YZgSPUjTrqabxRCRW_HsppxJtj0JnHe.zxaEtyG7zQnxxa.HzV4AlxCo-", "site_full": "ezquickstore.com", "site": "ezquickstore.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Oldest Bitcoin Exchange to Launch New Platform In June - Crypto News & Info", "title_full": "Oldest Bitcoin Exchange to Launch New Platform In June - Crypto News & Info", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.099, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1aa636342da3584d838c00d98ba628377f2c6a08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JiI33rCgHUNQ35ltdGg.lWV.78lqQdN7L1WV706M9YZgSPUjTrqabxRCRW_HsppxJtj0JnHe.zxaEtyG7zQnxxa.HzV4AlxCo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Oldest Bitcoin Exchange to Launch New Platform In June - Crypto News & Info", "text": "Oldest Bitcoin Exchange to Launch New Platform In June Oldest Bitcoin Exchange to Launch New Platform In June coiner Crypto Analysis Spread the love\nBTCC Exchange, the world’s oldest Bitcoin exchange has announced an upgraded platform next June. At launch, the operator will support trading of a limited number of cryptocurrency pairs and offer zero trading fees for the first three months. BTCC Exchange to Launch New And Enhanced Platform In June\nThe oldest Bitcoin exchange in the world is reforming its modus operandi by enlarging its cryptocurrency trading offering as well as by optimizing to include offline cold storage and SSL encrypted traffic to protect its customer’s digital assets.\nBTCC Exchange has more than seven years of experience in bringing together buyers and sellers of Bitcoin (BTC). It is new enlarging the scope of its offering to Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and their respective trading pairs. For the first three months starting in June, users will face no trading fees.\nThe launch of the new BTCC Exchange platform will introduce its users to enhanced liquidity, faster deposits and withdrawals, and small bid-offer spreads, according to the company. Technically, the exchange says it has invested in a cutting-edge system proper for trading at the highest standards. The operator is now using a multi-tier, multi-clustered system with an optimized, high-speed memory trading engine.\nAs cryptocurrency exchange hacks present one of the most difficult challenges for both sides, operators and customers, the oldest Bitcoin platform in the world reminded users that it has never been hacked in more than seven years online, but it is still optimizing security through cold storage and encryption systems.\n“BTCC’s exchange is backed by seven years of operational experience and has been optimized to include offline cold storage and SSL encrypted traffic to protect your digital assets. We take security very seriously and are proud of the fact that we have never been compromised.”\nRecent virtual currency exchange thefts include the CoinSecure hack in April 2018. Worth 438 Bitcoin (approximately $3.3 million), the company accused one employee for the inside jobs. In February, the BitGrail hack amounted to $195 million worth of NANO. The exchange failed to secure its coin storage. The most valuable hack in 2018 so far was on Coincheck exchange , who seems to have neglected security measures on NEM. The hack was worth over $500 million.\nThe operator is also promoting user referrals, verifications, and deposits, with its reward point system that provides benefits across the BTCC ecosystem, including both BTCC Pool and Mobi wallet.\nBTCC Exchange offers Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange services, a digital currency wallet, physical bitcoins, and mining pools.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oldest bitcoin exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto news & info oldest bitcoin exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btcc exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:20:45.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85ce706255b0dadaa231a4c9670baf9ddefb0bd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyorZ37oECRV8EsJqXy7oYA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85ce706255b0dadaa231a4c9670baf9ddefb0bd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyorZ37oECRV8EsJqXy7oYA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nThe number of referral network levels will be reduced for all newly registered users shortly!

Let’s take a look at some of the latest developments.\nIn March of this year, we reported on a massive Ponzi scheme in South Africa which affected nearly 28,000 crypto investors.\nThe company at the center of it all, BTC Global, promised investors ridiculously high returns on their investments and through these promises, managed to scam victims out of more than $50 million as of March. According to Fin24 , this amount has since increased to over $80 million. The Hawks are on the Case\nSouth Africa’s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, known as the Hawks, have taken over the investigation. A statement by the organization, which investigates issues such as organized- and economic crimes, said:\nThe serious economic offenses unit has been tasked to investigate the massive alleged fraud. Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest, with promises of 2% interest per day, 14% per week and ultimately 50% per month. Will the Real Steven Twain Please Stand Up?\nThere still seems to be some debate as to whether the alleged mastermind of the scheme, Steven Twain, even exists. However, if Cheri Ward is to be believed, he definitely does. Ward was part of a team that helped build a website for Steven and his team to handle customer queries.\nEven though Ward had not physically met with Twain, she had had regular contact with him through email and text. When asked for a photo he replied that he was “super shy” and also refused to do a Skype video call. A Possible Accomplice in the Scam?\nOn the 25th of May, the Hawks also implicated BitCaw Trading Company as being complicit in the scam, an accusation the latter vehemently denies. A representative for the company said:\n“BitCaw Trading was not involved in the BTC Global scam and we are shocked to see our name connected with it. BitCaw Trading assists people with buying and selling Bitcoin as well as other Bitcoin-related services. We do not manage third-party money or offer any kind of investment.”\nBitCaw has subsequently threatened to sue the Hawks for their comments unless a retraction is issued. On Monday, the company’s legal team had said that BitCaw is in no way related to BTC Global.\nA letter issued by BitCaw’s lawyers state:\n“BitCaw Trading does not manage or trade with third-party money or offer any kind of investment returns. BTC Global, on the other hand, was/is a Bitcoin investment company and has nothing to do with our client.”\nAccording to the letter, if a retraction is not made by Tuesday, the legal team’s “instructions are to approach the South Gauteng High Court on an urgent basis in order to enforce our clients’ rights”. Standing Firm\nHowever, the Hawks have stated that they will not be swayed and believe that they have sufficient evidence to make these claims against BitCaw. A spokesperson for the Hawks, Brigadier Hangwani Malaudzi, said:\nWe got the letter. We knew that they would go to the media. We will take it on in line with the due process. We believe that it is good that people want this to be clarified by the courts, and we will handle it there. As far as we are concerned, our statements on the matter still stand unless we are convinced otherwise.\nWith a crypto con artist playing coy and conflicting stories as to who was actually part of the scam, the Hawks definitely seem to have their work cut out for them.\nDo you think that BitCaw Trading is involved? Will Steven Twain ever show himself?

The country’s latest blockchain push would see the Russian banking giant Sberbank and the National Settlement Depository monitor an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on a state-developed blockchain.\nRussia’s Blockchain Push\nAccording to an official report by Sberbank, the two entities would test an ICO issuance on Central Bank of Russia’s (CBR) blockchain platform. Earlier in April 2018, the latter launched its blockchain platform, primarily to run pilots of financial services and bond exchanges using decentralized ledger technology. The CBR maintains that any required legal changes would be made only after several successful tests.\nAs stated, the ICO shall be issued by Moscow-based Level One, a commercial, educational platform with millions of users. Sberbank added that it “will act as the organizer and chief investor in the firm’s ICO.” Moscow shall witness world’s first state-monitored ICO . Source: The National The ICO shall be conducted in early Q3 of 2018, which tentatively places the date around late-June/early July, with the token’s settlements taking place on NSD’s securities exchange infrastructure – the same used for Russia’s stock market.\nAdditionally, the NSD shall act as the ICO’s custodian, safeguarding the issued digital tokens and maintain a database of all settled trades.\nAdvertisement\nadvertisement\nTests Serve to Evaluate Blockchain Technology\nThe ICO testing will enable all involved entities to collate, evaluate, and review the data and results of the token issuance.\nChairman of the NSD, Eddie Astanin, said:\n“Our end goal is to create the fundamental basis for the development of the digital economy in our country, for the emergence of a new type of asset for investors, for ICO ecosystems, and for the circulation of digital assets on the secondary market.”\nIn particular, Sberbank and the NSD will collect feedback from the ICO’s participants, which shall help them mitigate any risks in future ICOs while providing complete transparency to all invested parties. The project shall also serve as a litmus test for digital asset infrastructure and investigating if they can be integrated into existing systems with ease.\nSpeaking on the ICO test, Sberbank’s Senior Vice President, Igor Bulantsev, added:\nSberbank CIB considers the Russian ICO market to be very promising. Many Sberbank clients are interested in this type of investment, and we plan to promote this service proactively once the appropriate legislative framework comes into effect; we will be one of the drivers to institutionalize and popularize this type of transaction. Sberbank Headquarters . Source: Sberbank Earlier in May 2018, BTCManager reported on the successful transaction of $12 billion worth of security bonds on the CBR’s platform. Interestingly, it was the same consortium which conducted that test, which insinuates the Russian government’s concrete interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

Instead, a combination of negative trader sentiment, significant selling pressure, and profit taking appear to be weighing on the alt coin’s performance.\nIn respect to the former, recent reports of price manipulation in cryptocurrency markets has hit trader sentiment at a time when it was already very weak.\nAnd in respect to the latter, the Bitcoin Cash price rallied strongly last month ahead of its Bitcoin ABC upgrade which increased its block size to 32MB. This allowed it to handle significantly more transactions than many of its peers and was supposed to increase its appeal for real world use.\nWhilst this could still be the case one day, traders certainly aren’t sticking around to find out. The Bitcoin Cash price is now close to the levels it was before the Bitcoin ABC bump took place.\nWhat’s next?\nUntil there is a positive catalyst that leads to an improvement in sentiment, I believe that Bitcoin Cash and its crypto peers will unfortunately continue their decline.\nIn light of this, I would suggest that traders resist the temptation to buy the dip and focus on other opportunities instead.\nThis next major investment opportunity , for example. could be a great option right now.\nOne of the world's richest people is sounding the alarm on what could be a trillion-dollar technology.\nEveryone is talking about the artificial intelligence revolution.\nHarvard Business Review calls it, \"the most important general-purpose technology of our era.\"\nOne Google Insider predicts AI, \"will be as transformative as the discovery of electricity.\" And it already is transforming industry after industry.\nAfter all we have been hearing about AI for years...but it never really lived up to the hype...so what's finally unlocked this huge tidal wave of innovation?\nClick here to learn more!\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

From Japan’s real estate and stock market bubble in 1990 to the dot-com bubble and US housing bubble, each one had dire consequences for the economy and detrimentally impacted millions of people.\nWhether Bitcoin is destined for a similar fate remains a rife debate among investors and cryptocurrency experts alike. Why tulips?\nOf all the economic bubbles, none was more infamous than the Dutch Tulip Bubble that gripped Holland in the early 17th century.\nTulips, which were seen as a luxury item and status symbol, first boomed in popularity when a virus infected them, causing the petal colours of the flower to suddenly change into multi-coloured patterns. In 1634, speculators began to enter the market and saw how the new rich and middle class in Holland’s Golden Age were willing to pay extraordinary sums of money for a single bulb, and by 1636, stock exchanges were established to trade in bulbs and their future options.\nEventually though, in 1637, the market for tulips collapsed as people could no longer afford to purchase even the cheapest bulbs. This saw a tremendous drop in value and sparked a financial catastrophe for many. While the flower still remains popular in Holland, the story should serve as a reminder that markets can be extremely irrational at times. Why Bitcoin?\nWhile Bitcoin has increased in acceptance, it still falls well short of mainstream fiat currency and the price movement over the recent past makes it quite unpredictable as a store of value. Perhaps over time it could stabilise and gain mass appeal as a means of exchange. However, for now its volatility makes it more attractive for speculation than for facilitating trade.\nThose investing in Bitcoin as a currency should adopt an opportunistic trading strategy, pay attention to price action, analyse momentum indicators and utilise buy/stop orders regularly over short periods of time. The alternative is to hold Bitcoin for the long term with the faith that its price will stabilise, its acceptance (as a means of trade) becomes more widespread and its purchasing power slowly increases over time. This, unfortunately, is still yet to be exhibited.\nHowever, I believe that purchasing Bitcoin as a collectible because it was the first cryptocurrency, has a slightly better footing and similarities to being used as a store of value, as is the case with gold. Within its code, Bitcoin was designed to reach a maximum number of units, 21 million Bitcoins to be exact. By most calculations, the total number of Bitcoins will reach their zenith in the year 2140.\nThis brings about two consequential implications, firstly, Bitcoin is scarce and, secondly, as a result, increasing demand should realise a higher value. Additionally, owing to the Blockchain existing outside of the financial system, it could serve as a store of value, a digital gold, for those seeking an alternative to the status quo of central banks, financial regulation and industry middle-men.\nHowever, as it stands, the regulatory environment around Bitcoin remains a source of much uncertainty. Critically for purchasers, as with any investment, the price paid will be a defining element of the potential for future returns. So what does the future hold?\nThis is the real ‘million Bitcoin’ question. Blockchain as a technology and platform, we believe, is here to stay. There are numerous advantages that the platform maintains over traditional transaction networks which have seen organisations from central banks to private banks utilising the technology and creating their own closed loop networks for internal transactions.\nThese advantages coupled with the increased adoption of artificial intelligence portend an exciting future where, at the very least, the cost to transact (being measured in both time and money) should decrease.\nThe future for Bitcoin, however, is somewhat more uncertain. As we know, there are many more cryptocurrencies in circulation, most are quite similar in nature while others are quite different, such as Ether. The issue for Bitcoin, specifically, is that it is the first cryptocurrency and has benefitted from this advantage.\nHowever, this leaves it open to disruption from new superior entrants.

Naturally the company is no longer based in restrictive China but Hong Kong where crypto businesses are welcomed and encouraged.\nIn the official announcement it was stated that the company has leveraged more than seven years of continuous operation to bring the most reliable, convenient, and secure digital asset services to millions of users worldwide.\nAt launch the new platform will offer trading pairs such as BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC, and will regularly launch new trading pairs to meet the needs of its users the announcement said. In a further incentive to draw in new customers from the ever crowded crypto exchange scene BTCC has offered zero-fee trading for the first three months; [media=https://twitter.com/YourBTCC/status/1000984147026939904?ref_src=twsrc^tfw]\nThe company is touting a technologically advanced, ‘cutting edge’ trading platform;\n“In terms of technical developments, our exchange will utilize a multi-tier, multi-clustered system with an optimized, high-speed memory trading engine. So, you can make the trades you want on a cutting-edge system.”\nBTCC are also taking security very seriously and are proud of the fact they have never been compromised. Offline cold storage and SSL encrypted traffic will be part of the revamped exchange protect digital assets and client information.\nA number of additional bonuses are on the table including a points and referrals system;\n“Points are also up for grabs for all customers! Referring users, verifying, depositing, and many other activities will all provide opportunities to earn you points. Our new reward point system will give you tangible benefits that you can use across the whole BTCC ecosystem including both BTCC Pool and Mobi wallet!”\nIt is possible that BTCC will mimic the offerings of other major exchanges such as Binance and develop its own in house token for reduced fee trading once the initial offer expires.\nBTCC was founded in China in 2011, and was the world’s oldest Bitcoin exchange until it closed in September 2017 under pressure from the Chinese regulators following a major clampdown in the country. It was considered one of China’s top three exchanges, the other two being Huobi and OKCoin (OKEx), both of which have also moved to friendlier climes namely Hong Kong and Singapore respectively.

Thanks to its already-in-place 51-percent defense, the cryptocurrency neatly sidestepped a massive hash attack that targeted multiple exchanges.\nAccording to initial reports , the May 2018 incident was a classic example of 51-percent abuse. Hackers gained authority over significant amounts of hashing power so that they could override the consensus-based confirmations that power PoW cryptocurrencies. With the majority of the nodes on a network under their control, it was easy to fake consensus, spend coins twice and reverse transactions for their own gain.\nInterestingly, the coins targeted here didn’t seem to know how to respond even after exchanges lost millions. While the exchanges definitely took smart steps by halting deposits, it’s worth pointing out that many of the victimized protocols simply appeared to have been caught with their pants down. Verge, for instance, fell prey to a similar DDoS-based attack just a month earlier.\nWhere does GoldCoin ($GLD) stand amidst such turmoil? This wouldn’t be the first time that the cryptocurrency has faced such trials, but unsurprisingly, the bad actors seem to have passed it over in favor of easier pickings. Since Goldcoin has included a 51%-attack defense since 2013, attackers can’t spread their fraudulent blockchains around the network.\n“The GoldCoin Network has survived countless 51% attacks over its 5-year history and never flinched,” said community member Greg Matthews. “Because we’ve always focused on making Satoshi’s protocol more robust, GoldCoin users have never had to worry about these kinds of problems.”\nIs GoldCoin’s approach better than how other PoW protocols function? While it’s certainly superior to doing nothing, it also beats the standard solution where exchanges merely institute stricter confirmation requirements since it keeps transactions fast and consistent. To learn more about why GoldCoin is better-prepared, visit GoldCoinweb.com. You can also read a detailed whitepaper on how GoldCoin ($GLD) handles 51% attacks .\nGoldCoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that finally delivers on the promises of decentralization. It’s completely built and maintained by a team of dedicated volunteers who firmly believe in promoting economic freedom. Thanks to these principles and a focus on game-changing usability features, like two-minute confirmation speeds and instant 0-Conf transactions, GoldCoin is fundamentally changing how cryptocurrency and economies operate.\nUnlike the securities, stock options, profit sharing and other investment plans of centuries past, this is more than just a new way to invest: It’s a proven system where awards are based on math alone. Thanks to its SegWit-free design, the ledger is truly verifiable and safe. Even better, it’s powered by an innovative 51 percent defense algorithm and devoted community working together to keep anyone from rigging the game.\nWebsite 1: Goldcoinweb.com\nWebsite 2: GoldCoin.org\nContact: Adam Sharek\nPhone: +403-921-7111 (Canada)\nEmail: a.sharek@goldcoin.org", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.goldcoin.org/", "https://goldcoinweb.com/cherry-services/51-defense-system/", "https://blog.coinswitch.co/verge-bitcoin-gold-and-monacoin-hack-all-you-need-to-know-585062c00c35", "https://goldcoinweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GoldCoin-51-Percent-Attack-System.pdf", "https://goldcoinweb.com/2017/12/07/goldcoin-gld-network-best-performance/", "https://goldcoinweb.com/", "https://www.goldcoinweb.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "goldcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dodges", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "calgary", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T11:23:43.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53c1bced1b3edc56c5850fb1257cdb2c861e5488", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUuIVrIb9IQS_mwQ_kESQlECzRQD0eRSuen4ls8Pdk1E697lh_JYG9mYXL20KbxINRhVxr8BvdwjPAvsKJBtZYsLf_oHS09C8wArbLe56qxXy_XjM79ytW6RlHYhZTiWYwy5BlYfoMWvg--", "site_full": "news.morningstar.com", "site": "morningstar.com", "site_section": "http://news.morningstar.com/all/source/market-watch.aspx", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "News Archive: MarketWatch", "title": "Bitcoin holds $7,000; volatility trends lower", "title_full": "Bitcoin holds $7,000; volatility trends lower", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.028, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53c1bced1b3edc56c5850fb1257cdb2c861e5488", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUuIVrIb9IQS_mwQ_kESQlECzRQD0eRSuen4ls8Pdk1E697lh_JYG9mYXL20KbxINRhVxr8BvdwjPAvsKJBtZYsLf_oHS09C8wArbLe56qxXy_XjM79ytW6RlHYhZTiWYwy5BlYfoMWvg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "morningstar.com", "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin holds $7,000; volatility trends lower", "text": "By Aaron Hankin\nAfter a dreadful run, altcoins are recovering some losses Tuesday\nBitcoin and other digital currencies are trading higher Tuesday, looking to recover some of last week's losses that saw the total value of all cryptocurrencies fall by more than $60 billion.\nAfter slipping near the $7,000 support level late Monday, the No. 1 digital currency is higher Tuesday, last trading at $7,409.85, up 3.6% from 5 p.m. Eastern levels on the Kraken exchange on Monday.\nBitcoin traded Monday at a low of $7,081.25, its lowest level since April 11.\nRead:Why a collapse in bitcoin won't kill blockchain\nVolatility on the slide\nAlthough May has been a torrid month for cryptocurrencies, proponents note the overall downward trend in volatility is a bright spot for widespread adoption.\nCharles Hayter, co-founder of CryptoCompare, said the extraordinary price targets for bitcoin set by the likes of John McAfee and Jamie Dimon (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-1-million-cybersecurity-legend-jon-mcafee-ramps-up-his-nsfw-wager-2017-11-29) aren't helping the credibility of the cryptocurrency market.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.
