With the increment of the popularity of Bitcoin, many users started to mine using mining machines. As a result, the mining difficulty of the bitcoin increased. Because of this reason, Engineers thought to design best bitcoin mining hardware which can obtain maximum efficiency and profitability.\nHistory of bitcoin mining hardware\nIn 2009, very first bitcoin miner used multi-core CPUs to make Bitcoin. If a guy had two or three computers connected according to some specifications, you had the ability to earn $5 a day easily.\nIn those days, the mining difficulty was very low, and most of the people started bitcoin mining as a hobby. However, in 2010, bitcoin was not a very valuable thing, and it came under the subject of \"Pizza for bitcoins\" in the Bitcointalk forum.\nIn October 2010, code for bitcoin mining was released. It was designed to work with GPUs. The main reason to use GPU is the increasing of mining difficulty. In this time, mining using one GPU was fair enough with some technical skills. But it changed quickly with the popularity of cryptocurrency. Therefore designers needed better ideas for making mining hardware.\nHistory of bitcoin mining hardware\nIt was difficult to scale the hash rates via GPU as they pushed the consumer limit. But people find new ways to increase the profitability by connecting bitcoin miners together. As a result mining rig came into the subject.\nRevolution of FPGA\nBut the mining difficulty rose again and as a result of this, the power required to generate bitcoin increased. As a solution for this, FPGA ( Field programmable gate arrays) came.\nThe most significant specification on these miners was the FPGAs consumed three times less energy than ordinary GPU miners. They were effective than old mining hardware, and it was the changing point of mining to a new level.\nEnergy efficiency of the FPGA miners allowed to create the first bitcoin farms.\nREAD:\nHow to Earn Money From Blogs, Social Media or Websites Modern Best Bitcoin mining Hardware\nWith the increase of technology, FPGA jumped into ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) systems. With this transformation, bitcoin mining jumped into the industry level. Many companies started bitcoin farms using ASIC miners. They found money using crowdfunding systems and investor referral programs.\nAccording to the Products Explainer , product review website, a miner can be named as another best bitcoin mining hardware at least if it has the ASIC technology.\nThese miners have a hash rate 100 times more than FPGAs. ASIC is the latest stable technology used in the cryptocurrency mining hardware. It is the most profitable, efficient and time-consuming tech that came\nModern Best Bitcoin mining Hardware\nTechnology in Bitcoin Farms\nBitcoin mining farm is a collection of mining rigs which built according to the obtain a larger profit than a mining rig. All modern bitcoin farms use ASIC technology. With the increment of solar energy consuming, most companies try to invest in solar power than using industrial current. But it needs a good capital in the beginning.\nBitcoin miners give away a significant amount of noise and heat. To release that heat and noise companies use their own tricks. Using air conditioners is an excellent choice, but it consumes more electricity and directly affects the profit.\nI saw a new invention of a company for cooling. They built their mining farm inside a giant rock cave of a mountain. Rocks provide a kind of natural cooling system for the environment, and it is a good idea to reduce the heat.\nMost of the farms don't focus on reducing noise as it is far tricky and not a big issue for the profit.\nWatch this video to get a better understanding of how cryptocurrency farms work.\nconclusion\nIn this review, I described the history of bitcoin mining hardware and with the development of the technology how it changed. And also described the bitcoin mining farms. If you have any idea or thought about these things, please comment.

Amid a sea of critics, the market has avoided controversies and perhaps conferred a modicum of legitimacy on cryptocurrencies.\nNow, over the early hump, its fair to say acceptance is growing: Volatility, while still elevated, has moderated somewhat, and the outlook is brighter. And for one of Wall Streets biggest players, the bitcoin futures market may be just the opening act.\nBob Fitzsimmons, managing director and head of Wedbush Futures, spent decades in the trading pits focusing on traditional futures and options products, like fixed-income options. Now as he oversees the bitcoin-futures arm of Wedbush Securities, he has an upbeat outlook perhaps surprisingly so, to some for the digital-currency market.\nClients are asking, when is Litecoin, when is Ripple, Fitzsimmons told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\nIf the former pit traders predictions are accurate, the next step for cryptocurrencies is new coins being rolled out on the CME Group Inc. XBTH8, +1.17% and Cboe Global Markets Inc. BTCH8, +1.22% platforms, and possibly exchanges linked to physical delivery of digital assets, rather than cash-settled trading. Trading on bitcoin futures kicked off on both platforms in December.\nWhat Fitzsimmons describes as success for futures trading on the commodities platforms may not have appeared that way initially to skeptics.\nEarly on it looked as though the naysayers were right. When the Cboe cash-settled bitcoin futures market unfurled, it created a number of anomalies and concerns. Initially, with just the Cboe market operating, there was a hefty premium between spot bitcoin and futures the difference between the futures and cash market which critics of the futures marked labeled as a fundamental concern for trading a futures contract with such a volatile underlying asset.\nThe launch reminds me of the U.S. Treasury market in the 1970s, Fitzsimmons said.\nFitzsimmons, grew up in New York, graduated from Harvard University in 1984 with a degree in economics, and after some persuasion from his friends, he packed his bags for Chicago. The 1980s were a time when financial futures markets were in their ascendancy. Interest rates were falling and the pits were a frenzy, he reminisced.\nBitcoin, which rocketed to a record value around $20,000 a unit in late December, has attracted legions of skeptics, with the entry of a futures market for the digital asset only igniting a flurry of questions about the legitimacy of the nascent asset class.\nRead: Bitcoin futures: Heres what you need to know\nFor instance, how can a futures market track an underlying asset that trades on multiple exchanges? And how can a regulated futures market reflect an unregulated market?\nOf primary importance to bitcoin futures platforms at the start was eliminating or minimizing the arbitrage, or difference between prices of bitcoin on the CME and Cboe and at other virtual-currency exchanges.\nAt one point in early trade, the premium, or spread, between the January contract for the Cboe -listed bitcoin futures reached $1,400 versus the spot market, Fitzsimmons said.\nNow, with contracts on both the CME and Cboe up and running, spreads have tightened, reducing arbitrage and market inefficiencies. Market participants arent limited to those looking to expose holes between the futures and the cash market.\nWhile volumes are minuscule compared with other futures products, Fitzsimmons said trading on the exchanges remains healthy when you compare them with early trading in Cboe Volatility Index VIX, +17.66% futures in the early 1990s. The VIX, otherwise known as Wall Streets fear index uses options on the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.27% to reflect implied volatility in the market and has become one of the exchanges most popular products.\nAs one of the major participants in the bitcoin market, Wedbush Futures says it has no shortage of investors knocking on their door asking about cryptocurrencies.\nTrading in decentralized, permissionless currency (a permissionless currency refers to one that doesnt restrict its access to the publicly distributed ledger that underpins it, while the term decentralized means an intermediary, like a bank or government) created by computer coders and without a government backing may not be how Fitzsimmons thought the futures market would evolve some four decades ago. However, he said there are signs that Wall Streets current dalliance in cryptos futures is more than just fleeting.\nAnecdotally, Fitzsimmons points to the number of tech-savvy Ph.D. graduates from the likes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology lining up to enter the digital-asset industry as evidence of its upbeat prospects.\nBack then [1985] the prototypical floor guy was an Ivy League athlete. Today its a quant guy with his own algorithm that can beat the market, Fitzsimmons said, referring to the old profile of futures traders.\nFitzsimmons didnt disclose how big Wedbushs footprint is in the bitcoin futures market, but he did say they were a chunky part of the market.\nFor reference, on Feb. 27, there were 5,338 open contracts on the March Cboe exchange with total daily volume of 3,010 contracts. Each contract is worth one bitcoin, compared to five on the CME exchange, meaning Feb. 27 daily volume was just over $30 million.\nRelated Topics U.S. Stocks Markets Investing\nQuote References XBTH8 +125.00 +1.17% ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fitzsimmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob fitzsimmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wedbush futures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wedbush securities", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T04:52:07.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4274c158d10affe193647fb22b56f4a697cff367", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWRU3lGwtBOTUk8jgIPEL50-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin bull run begins now?", "title_full": "Bitcoin bull run begins now?", "published": "2018-06-01T04:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.087, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4274c158d10affe193647fb22b56f4a697cff367", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWRU3lGwtBOTUk8jgIPEL50-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Argoo", "published": "2018-06-01T04:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin bull run begins now?", "text": "In February, the bull run of bitcoin did not happen.

That’s the view of experts at the Scotland-based Castle Craig Hospital, which expanded its rehab services to cover cryptocurrency addiction earlier this month.\nExperts have long compared the thrill of cryptocurrency to day trading, both of which entail high degrees of risk. You’re essentially gambling with your money with crypto and with day trading, and the thrill of massive returns — and the potential addictive effects — create an emotional dependence that is not much different from gambling addiction.\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler,” Castle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn says. “It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains & losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nSimilar to those that might be addicted to casino table games or slots, the addicted trader spends most if not all of their money on cryptocurrency, and will “chase” their losses in attempts to win back lost money. They may borrow excessively or even steal, or experience mood swings and obsessive thoughts and actions, the hospital says.\nCastle Craig plans to treat addicts using the same methods used for excessive gambling. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary tool, and teaches the person how to accept responsibility for their addiction and coping strategies, finding positive activities to replace the need for cryptocurrency trading, and most importantly how to manage their debts and finances appropriately.\nThe help is not cheap: according to WikiTribune, Treatments start at 2,975 British pounds (about $4,000) per week for a multi-occupancy room all the way up to 4,970 pounds (about $6,600) weekly for a private room. Considering most addiction programs are multi-step processes — Castle Craig’s is 12 — treatment could easily run into the tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nWhile most won’t be able to afford the treatment out-of-pocket, the company says it offers payment plans, and in some cases a portion of the cost might be covered under public or private insurance. The company also operates clinics in at least six other European countries, however it’s not immediately clear if the program will be offered at those locations.\nEditors’ Recommendations\nThe tech behind cryptocurrency could save lives by fixing medical records\nBecome a cryptocurrency master with these online Bitcoin courses\nAddicted to your smartphone?

Some people might even roll their eyes. “That won’t last long” , critics say. But what about the fact that a large community of users has rallied around Bitcoin? What about the fact that one Bitcoin is currently valued at over $1,000? Image Source: BenjaminNelan\nThe use of Bitcoin has drastically increased over the years and has become quite successful, especially since it started as a vague idea. However, Bitcoin still retains much of that vagueness, and some people argue that it’s more of a monetary option for scammers and people trying to hide their identity. On the other side of the spectrum, hiding one’s identity might sound great for the average consumer who desires some privacy while shopping online. Regardless of where you stand on Bitcoin, people are starting to use it. That means you might have the desire to accept Bitcoin payments on your WordPress site. Luckily, the WordPress community has responded with some interesting options and solutions for your website. The benefits of using and accepting Bitcoins Image Source: typographyimages\nWhy should you use Bitcoin payments if there are more common payment methods available? In addition to the fact that more and more people are using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for their online transactions, Bitcoin payments have some advantages: Bitcoin is anonymous (which is great for consumers and merchants) Image Source: geralt A Bitcoin payment doesn’t carry any personal information from the buyer. This means that all sales are final. From the customer’s perspective, it’s a plus because they don’t have to give up all of their personal information to a random company. Merchants, on the other hand, benefit from all sales being final. They don’t have to give refunds, and chargebacks are virtually non-existent, which minimizes fraudulent purchases, as these are a common risk when selling online. More freedom for everyone Image Source: insspirito – Pixabay.com / License: Public Domain CC0\nThe anonymous part of Bitcoin certainly creates freedom for the payer, but there’s also the fact that Bitcoin can typically be used across all borders. There’s no central bank that controls where people can make payments, so a merchant could accept a payment from all the way across the world without worrying about the banks. This could open up new markets for your business as well. What’s also interesting is that this opens merchants up to customers in high crime rate countries and regions. That might sound sketchy at first, but the merchant is covered with no risk of refunds. Security and decentralization Image Source: JuralMin No person, organization, or government controls Bitcoin. This not only makes Bitcoin payments more secure, but the transactions are more transparent, seeing as how all purchases are available to the public. The only piece of information shown to the public is the location of the buyer. All personal details are hidden, protecting people from identity theft and even keeping fees lower because the banks don’t have any control over transactions. Using WordPress plugins to accept Bitcoin payments Image Source: typographyimages\nYour best bet for accepting Bitcoin payments on your WordPress website is to go with a WordPress plugin or certain script that accepts Bitcoin payments . These are somewhat similar to payment gateways except they remove the need for a bank (a lot less red tape). Quite a few Bitcoin plugins exist, here are some of the available options to accept Bitcoin payments: Coingate for WooCommerce Image Source: Screenshot – WordPress.org The Coingate for WooCommerce plugin is a solid choice considering its sole purpose is for processing Bitcoin payments. Upon installation and configuration, a Bitcoin option shows up in your WooCommerce store. So, if you already have a PayPal button, this would show up right below or next to it. The coolest part about Coingate is that it combines nicely with more familiar currencies. So, it can convert to and from currencies like the US dollar and the Euro. GoURL WooCommerce Image Source: Screenshot – WordPress.org\nGoURL is one of the more prominent Bitcoin plugin creators, seeing as how you could also opt for the GoURL Bitcoin PayPal Donations plugin or the GoURL Bitcoin Easy Digital Downloads plugin. All of them work the same, but they’re designed to integrate with different online store plugins and payment options. That gives you some flexibility regarding your preferred ecommerce solution. GoURL accepts all sorts of alternative payment methods such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Peercoin. The system is easy to configure, and the WooCommerce option makes for a smooth combination with the popular store plugin. As with most Bitcoin plugins, this one is great for keeping fees low, ensuring all of your transactions are secure and removing the need to think about chargebacks or refunds. Bitcoin Payments for WooCommerce Image Source: Screenshot – WordPress.org Bitcoin Payments for WooCommerce is another solution for WooCommerce that makes for a simple installation process and a quick combination with your Bitcoin wallet (discussed below). Notifications are sent out to you and the buyer when the order has been received, and you can specify your own exchange rate depending on where you intend to get payments from. What are some other Bitcoin WordPress plugins? Image Source: Clker-Free-Vector-Images\nIf you haven’t yet found a suitable WordPress plugin to accept Bitcoin payments on your website, then here are some additional plugins you could look into: Get your Bitcoin wallet to send and accept payments Image Source: MichaelWuensch\nAn additional tool you’ll need to start accepting Bitcoin is a Bitcoin Wallet. These wallets are rather similar to regular bank accounts, so they act as the intermediary between you and the customer. Therefore, when a customer makes a payment on your site with Bitcoin, the currency is then dropped into your Bitcoin Wallet.\nThe big advantage to a Bitcoin wallet is the conversion. Many merchants wonder if they’re stuck with Bitcoins in an account. That’s not the case. The primary wallets convert your Bitcoins into your local currency, giving you regular “real” money if that’s what you’re looking for. After that, the Bitcoin Wallet can be used for your own purposes, to send Bitcoins to other people or to use the coins to purchase items elsewhere online. Some of the most popular Bitcoin Wallets include the following: Coinbase Image Source: Screenshot – Coinbase.com\nCoinbase allows for buying and selling digital currencies (cryptocurrencies), not just Bitcoin. However, it’s one of the most well-known solutions for storing and using your Bitcoins, so it’s not a bad choice when setting up a Coinbase wallet for your WordPress site. Therefore, the account holder can buy and sell their Bitcoins or use it to accept payments from customers. All of your Bitcoins are secure in the account, and converting to your local currency is done with the click of a button. Airbitz Image Source: Screenshot – Airbitz.co Airbitz lets you reap the benefits of Bitcoin security, decentralization, and privacy. Not only that, but it has support for Bluetooth and NFC payments. You can manage your account from the convenience of your own mobile device, and the payments are converted to your own local currency once needed. The Airbitz app for smartphones is designed nicely and provides great user experience. CoPay Image Source: Screenshot – Copay.io If you plan on having multiple accounts, CoPay has a solution for setting up and managing separate Bitcoin wallets. For example, you might want to keep business and personal separate, or there’s a chance you have multiple stores collecting Bitcoin payments. Regardless, it comes with all the other benefits of a solid Bitcoin wallet. Should you start accepting Bitcoin payments on your WordPress site?\nThis is a tough question because of the lack of knowledge that so many people have about Bitcoin. In our opinion, the merchant really can’t lose out when accepting Bitcoin. If someone makes a payment on your site they have no way of getting that money back. It limits the chances of fraud, allows you to expand your selling to less accessible countries and you know it’s secure.\nTherefore, it’s similar to adding a PayPal button, opening up yet another payment option for your customers. Not a bad idea in our opinion! If you have any questions about how to accept Bitcoin payments on your WordPress website, let us know in the comments below.

It’s up two percent and odds are, BCH prices shall continue appreciating in the days to come. Fundamentals are good and despite their full node migration problems after their hard fork, Bitcoin Cash continues to take root. BCH is now available at De Vere and their users can now buy/sell the coins as they wish. All they have to do is download deVere mobile app and they are good to go. From the News\nThe genesis of current Bitcoin Cash squabbles can be routed back to August 2017 and the New York Agreement. Then, it was a couple of months before crypto-mania which saw main coins as Bitcoin and others exploding to their ATHs. During that pump, the network was literally congested and consequently, transaction fees were on the roof. To prevent such happenings, one of the agreements detailed a solution of lowering BTC network transaction fees. Segwit came to pass but Segwit2X collapsed in the last minute. Shortly after Segwit 2X failure, we had Bitcoin Cash.\nAt its core and according to proponents, BCH represents the objectives of Satoshi himself. Two weeks ago, Bitcoin Cash did split again increasing their block size to 32 MB. They said they were preparing for a future in which they are dominant and are a medium of exchange if not a store of value. However, despite their objectives, there is a big problem. Statistics shows that up-to 13 percent of their full nodes didn’t upgrade and are effectively incompatible with the current PoW protocol. Whether this is a minor issue or not, we can truly say Bitcoin Cash is overlooking potentially disastrous situations which can be their major undoing. If they want to run the crypto world, then should have been consensus.\nIn other news, can the recent depreciation of cryptocurrencies valuation be attributed to German officials dumping Bitcoin Cash, ETH and BTC? Solid data do support this argument. While we understand that price declines started in mid-January 2018, releasing of seized coins exacerbates the overall erosion of coin market cap. Reliable sources confirm that German authorities were successful in unloading 1399 Bitcoin Cash coins in 1600 individual transactions in a span of two months.

Hanyecz, who was the first person to use Bitcoin in a real-world commercial transaction described Nakamoto as an “oddball.” The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery till this day. A Bit of an Eccentric Fellow\nAccording to Hanyecz, worked pro bono as a developer during the early days of the Bitcoin project, Nakamoto was an eccentric fellow who regularly gave him “a weird feeling.” Commenting on his experience to Business Insider , Hanyecz said :\nI thought bitcoin was awesome, and I wanted to be involved, but I had a regular developing job. Nakamoto would send me emails like ‘Hey, can you fix this bug?’‘Hey, can you do this?\nHe’d say, ‘Hey, the west side’s down,’ or ‘We have these bugs — we need to fix this.’ I’d be like, we? We’re not a team. I thought that it was approval from him, that maybe he accepted me as a member. But I didn’t want the responsibility. I didn’t really understand all of the forces that were going on at the time.\nHanyecz admits that he found some of Nakamoto’s requests to be annoying and said he’d dismiss them from time to time. Nakamoto’s identity remains a mystery and Hanyecz says the Bitcoin creator was always intent on maintaining privacy and anonymity. According to Hanyecz, this behavior of Nakamoto’s struck him as strange.\nHe or she or whoever it was never told me anything personal. I asked a few questions, but he always dodged them. Those questions never got answered. The Search for Satoshi Nakamoto\nThe identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the biggest mysteries in the entire digital currency industry. Several leading figures in the world of cryptography, programming, and computer science are among possible candidates for the person behind Bitcoin.\nIn 2015 and 2016, an Australian computer scientist and businessman named Dr. Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. In fact, several leading media outlets, including the BBC and The Economist , published articles claiming that Wright had provided proof to back up his claims. In spite of this, however, the general consensus among the crypto community is that Wright’s claims are false and the mystery behind the pseudonymous Nakamoto remains unsolved.\nDo you find Hanyecz’s description of Nakamoto as surprising?

Learning how to securely archive records that hold private keys like a JSON file or exporting, importing, and sweeping can provide people with the basic steps towards really owning bitcoin.\nAlso read: Localbitcoincash.org Revamps Website and Adds New P2P Features Private Key Ownership Provides Financial Sovereignty\nEvery day someone new is learning about the fantastic benefits of bitcoin and cryptocurrency solutions. Many people will have acquired their first digital asset from an exchange like Coinbase or Circle Invest, but have yet to learn how to secure their private keys so they can really own those precious cryptocurrencies. The first and foremost lesson to digital currency ownership is a statement said over and over again by veteran bitcoiners.\nIf you don’t possess your private key, you don’t own bitcoins. Private Keys and the Different Ways to Obtain Them\nA private key is the secret alphanumeric code that is mathematically paired with your public key — the alphanumeric address you use to receive payments. Private keys allow you to spend your cryptocurrencies and ensure you maintain ownership over them as long as the 256-bit alphanumeric code is kept a secret.\nIf you happen to own cryptocurrencies because maybe you purchased some on an exchange, or someone loaded up a wallet for you or gave you a paper wallet, you may want to know how to obtain full ownership of your private keys. The thing about private keys is they can be stored in various ways and it’s good to gain knowledge on the differences between each method.\nMnemonic Phrase\nIf someone gave you a wallet you may have to find out the mnemonic phrase or mnemonic seed associated with the cryptocurrency. For instance, if someone gave you some bitcoin cash (BCH) using a software client like the Bitcoin.com Wallet you could set up your and find your mnemonic recovery phrase easily. An example of a phrase would be twelve random words given to you by the software client in order which you must back up by writing down the phrase in the exact same order. The twelve words (some wallets use 24) can be used to recover your bitcoin cash either using the same Bitcoin.com Wallet or another wallet that supports the mnemonic phrase backup restoration process. These words should be guarded with maximum security and you should never take a screenshot of them or type the words online. If someone else knows the twelve-word mnemonic seed tethered to your coins this means someone can have full access to your cryptocurrency holdings. An example of a private key tied to a twelve-word mnemonic phrase within an Electrum wallet. The QR code to the right is also a private key.\nA Backup Keyfile or JSON File\nThere are other ways you can be given a private key like, for instance, in a keyfile or JSON file. A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is simply a file with a lightweight data format that allows it to be easily read and written by humans or machines. Sometimes browser wallets will give you a backup JSON file that contains your coins’ private keys. These types of files need to be imported into a supporting wallet to gain access to the funds associated with the keys. These files need to be secured in a safe manner and users can hide them and encrypt them in folders so intruders can’t gain access to the file. Just like the mnemonic seed, someone with access to a keyfile or JSON has full access to the funds associated with those keys. The Fundamental Difference Between Importing and Sweeping\nImport\nThere are also two different ways people can obtain their keys — importing and sweeping. These two distinct ways of gaining full ownership of keys are separate actions within the cryptocurrency-import process. Importing a private key means you are simply tethering the funds that belong to the private key to an existing set of keys in your software wallet. This means the coins are still tied to the private key that may be tied to a paper wallet for example. Both wallets now have access to the funds tethered to the private key until they are spent. If you are planning to import keys make sure that both areas of ownership remain 100 percent secure from other individuals, otherwise you may want to sweep the keys.\nSweep\nEssentially sweeping private keys is a form of importing them but when you sweep them they are sent to an entirely different address and the older imported key set is no longer valid. So if you take the Bitcoin.com Wallet and sweep the paper wallet someone gave you, the paper wallet will be emptied. Anytime you sweep a source wallet the funds will be moved to an entirely different location with another public and private key pair. Lots of wallets allow users to sweep a QR code that contains a private key in order to gain access to the funds. Note that if you have a QR code tethered to a private key on a paper wallet or stored somewhere and it is exposed it can be easily swept away if it’s not kept hidden. Bitcoin: Be Your Own Bank\nAs we mentioned above, keys can be kept in QR codes, keyfiles, JSON files, and mnemonic phrases and knowing how to access them for full ownership is a must for every cryptocurrency enthusiast. If you hold your money on an exchange you are allowing a third party to have ownership of your coins and if something happened to that exchange like a hack that resulted in a huge loss you may lose your bitcoins. Gaining access to your cryptocurrency’s keys means you own them and you maintain full ownership. The fundamental benefit of bitcoin means you get to be your own bank .\nAre you sure you own your private keys?

It's up two percent and odds are, BCH prices shall continue appreciating in the days to come. Fundamentals are good and despite their full node migration problems after their hard fork, Bitcoin Cash continues to take root. BCH is now available at De Vere and their users can now buy/sell the coins as they wish. All they have to do is download deVere mobile app and they are good to go.\nFrom the News The genesis of current Bitcoin Cash squabbles can be routed back to August 2017 and the New York Agreement. Then, it was a couple of months before crypto-mania which saw main coins as Bitcoin and others exploding to their ATHs. During that pump, the network was literally congested and consequently, transaction fees were on the roof. To prevent such happenings, one of the agreements detailed a solution of lowering BTC network transaction fees. Segwit came to pass but Segwit2X collapsed in the last minute. Shortly after Segwit 2X failure, we had Bitcoin Cash.\nAt its core and according to proponents, BCH represents the objectives of Satoshi himself. Two weeks ago, Bitcoin Cash did split again increasing their block size to 32 MB. They said they were preparing for a future in which they are dominant and are a medium of exchange if not a store of value. However, despite their objectives, there is a big problem. Statistics shows that up-to 13 percent of their full nodes didn't upgrade and are effectively incompatible with the current PoW protocol. Whether this is a minor issue or not, we can truly say Bitcoin Cash is overlooking potentially disastrous situations which can be their major undoing. If they want to run the crypto world, then should have been consensus.\nIn other news, can the recent depreciation of cryptocurrencies valuation be attributed to German officials dumping Bitcoin Cash, ETH and BTC? Solid data do support this argument. While we understand that price declines started in mid-January 2018, releasing of seized coins exacerbates the overall erosion of coin market cap. Reliable sources confirm that German authorities were successful in unloading 1399 Bitcoin Cash coins in 1600 individual transactions in a span of two months.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nUnderstandably, we can link this slide in market cap and Bitcoin Cash to the poor performance of the crypto market in May. It's not an individual coin performance per say neither can critics satisfactorily point out a technical glitch or loss of user case application. Note this though, Bitcoin Cash bears are up 60 percent from April highs at around $1800.\nThis is encouraging and portrays typical retracements following periods of higher highs we saw in April. In my view and considering the relation between trading ranges, volumes and key inflection points, I can almost conclude May down trend as long coverings. Then again, why not? Look at the way buyers are rejecting lower lows in lower time frames. It's conditional that can only cement my views that last week's sell candlestick was a climax if this week's candlestick ends up bullish.\nDaily Chart Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nIn determining the most probable direction of price action, we can always refer to that double bar bullish reversal pattern on May 28-29. May 29 is important because it was this time that buyers did jump in. Check out those volume surges rejecting lower lows. The next day, prices didn't edge higher and that is okay.\nHowever, after yesterday's bullish candlestick, Bitcoin Cash buyers can look for under-valuations in lower time frame charts and trade with the trends. Ideal buy targets lie at $1,800 with stops at $900.\nThe post The Federal Reserve Places Bitcoin Cash at $1800– That's Where We Fix Our Buy Targets: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis (June 1, 2018) appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch) price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve places bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vere", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T03:46:02.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5a4d3cd327489d62e0fe34d3ea9abfc1e8fdfba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma5Jv_lxR0s6dBulU_JfYbU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Which takes your time , Bitcoins or Altcoins", "title_full": "Which takes your time , Bitcoins or Altcoins", "published": "2018-06-01T03:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5a4d3cd327489d62e0fe34d3ea9abfc1e8fdfba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma5Jv_lxR0s6dBulU_JfYbU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "yslyv", "published": "2018-06-01T03:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Which takes your time , Bitcoins or Altcoins", "text": "well. both of them takes my time. even i dont hold so many bitcoins, all crypto market trend is depended on bitcoin price. if bitcoin goes up, altcoins also go up if bitcoin price crashs all altcoins crash. so both altcoins and bitcoin take my time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T07:20:14.049+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51ea04b447c32b60bcaccf77c5279629c7c58b5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggmtBM8.k9UnKSVCDTmDFGT2w1vSQlMJVeo0ifHO5CS08It9dRwwdkLxZfdyePOsg2j7dtAerg6ILA--", "site_full": "sg.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/provider-sgcnbc", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business finance, stock market, quotes, news", "title": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician", "title_full": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician", "published": "2018-06-01T03:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9LeSsyXSiVEFHy6Cr12NMg--~B/aD00ODc7dz04NDM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/video.cnbcuk.com/f744d9c925bb89cbe9826e1b68b20cd6", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51ea04b447c32b60bcaccf77c5279629c7c58b5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggmtBM8.k9UnKSVCDTmDFGT2w1vSQlMJVeo0ifHO5CS08It9dRwwdkLxZfdyePOsg2j7dtAerg6ILA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CNBC", "published": "2018-06-01T03:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician", "text": "Bitcoin has recouped the week's losses and is in rally mode as trade threats keep equities on the back foot. One market strategist says the major cryptocurrency may have finally found its bottom.\n\"When we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen. We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it's going to start a recovery process here,\" Robert Sluymer, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's \" Futures Now \" on Thursday.\nBitcoin has touched its key support level around $7,000 several times this year and recovered. Most recently, prices moved as low as $7,054 this week before bouncing higher.\n\"That's certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold,\" he said.\nMomentum also looks positive to Sluymer, indicating a decline in Bitcoin may have found a floor.\n\"That RSI indicator in the bottom of the chart is very oversold and starting to bottom so that's really part of that bottoming phase taking hold,\" he said.\nBitcoin's relative strength index, a measure of momentum, is currently trading around 40. A level close to 30 typically indicates oversold conditions.\n\"The next thing that has to happen is to see Bitcoin actually rally through the downtrend and we use the 15-day moving average, it's very simplistic, but it's a pretty good proxy across most markets,\" said Sluymer. Its 15-day moving average of roughly $7,800 \"will be the next hurdle for it to get through.\"\nBitcoin last traded around the $7,800 level a week ago. It has not traded above it since May 23.\n\"We think the setup is very attractive here,\" added Sluymer. \"If you're short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you're looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.\"\nBitcoin is up more than 2 percent on Thursday and last traded at $7,558.\nDisclaimer", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RzugpNmet5C5Iv8T5jQWEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/video.cnbcuk.com/f744d9c925bb89cbe9826e1b68b20cd6", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RzugpNmet5C5Iv8T5jQWEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/video.cnbcuk.com/f744d9c925bb89cbe9826e1b68b20cd6);"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T06:51:28.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8cb1eb8fcfc2d65401725818876b67b4051f660f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFua2AOifmQXniOBO5T4Js7k1dy565Cd.73t65YQI.dKNioFEnNBi6pXks-", "site_full": "www.liveleak.com", "site": "liveleak.com", "site_section": "http://www.liveleak.com/rss?channel_token=82e_1302956677", "site_categories": ["media", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Liveleak.com Rss Feed - Recent threads", "title": "Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Scammer gets exposed and does not answer", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Scammer gets exposed and does not answer", "published": "2018-06-01T03:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.liveleak.com/80281E/ll_a_u/2018/May/31/LiveLeak-dot-com-5b10957e0e635_thumb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1061, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8cb1eb8fcfc2d65401725818876b67b4051f660f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFua2AOifmQXniOBO5T4Js7k1dy565Cd.73t65YQI.dKNioFEnNBi6pXks-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JTMusic", "published": "2018-06-01T03:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Scammer gets exposed and does not answer", "text": "1 Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Scammer gets exposed and does not answer Just another young punk trying to scam people of their hard working money.

Bittrex is working with New York-based Signature Bank, which will hold the dollar-denominated funds, along with other financial firms.\n“It’s been a long path,” Bittrex Chief Executive Officer Bill Shihara said in an interview. “It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.”\nLarger financial institutions, bound to strict government regulations on money laundering and customer verification, have mostly avoided putting their reputations at risk by getting involved with an industry that many still associate with criminal activity. As a result, some virtual-currency marketplaces are “crypto-to-crypto” only, meaning that they allow customers to trade using digital money, not dollars.\nSome banks are coming around. Coinbase, one of the biggest U.S. crypto trading venues, has developed relationships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the U.S., and recently secured a Barclays PLC bank account in the U.K. Noble Bank International, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, took over banking duties for Bitfinex last year after the exchange was dumped by Wells Fargo & Co., three people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.\n“They really do look and pore through the entire business,” Shihara said. “They want to make sure that we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes, that we’ve got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts.”\nBittrex, which has more than 3 million customers globally, is launching fiat trading Thursday for Bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD. The service will initially be available only to corporate customers in Washington, California, New York and Montana for regulatory reasons, but the firm said it plans to expand the offering to retail investors eventually.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bittrex", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "broken represen", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T00:49:18.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d89e84e8b2c5f84dac4dd42cf09f960e95fb4f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZToFMKkWtWMwVxjcC5tletk3Zn6qKgCDgj.MNoSfAXPlC5YFDkQXjNajwrUkrWtw73clND2iDNRaPK4z6iu36vnwMbbl1WwLSM8uDSjuGRNAClcYGQBuRGR8rl5.TDZ47zhUZPGzKi0Lw--", "site_full": "lindamille.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://lindamille.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App – Linda Miller", "title": "Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App", "title_full": "Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App", "published": "2018-06-01T03:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d89e84e8b2c5f84dac4dd42cf09f960e95fb4f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZToFMKkWtWMwVxjcC5tletk3Zn6qKgCDgj.MNoSfAXPlC5YFDkQXjNajwrUkrWtw73clND2iDNRaPK4z6iu36vnwMbbl1WwLSM8uDSjuGRNAClcYGQBuRGR8rl5.TDZ47zhUZPGzKi0Lw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Linda Miller", "published": "2018-06-01T03:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App", "text": "Devere Group, an international financial consultancy boasting well over 80,000 clients in more than 100 countries, has announced that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and EOS have now been added its recently released cryptocurrency exchange app Devere Crypto.

Large banks, including BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and RCI Bank, introduce blockchain transactions, while the Bank of France helps startups based on decentralized technology.\nRecent changes show that the government is interested in the blockchain-based business and cryptocurrency market development. This is why French crypto community welcomes blockchain events with open arms.\nWho Will Present and What Will Be Discussed?\nStefano Tempesta , Regional Director at Microsoft, will deliver a presentation “Blockchain for Enterprise.” He will discuss smart contracts and cybersecurity, and will share real-life cases of blockchain integration into business operations.\nThe Founder and CEO at Chaineum Laurent Leloup will introduce the topic “The new use cases of blockchain for industrials and governments.” The expert will talk about the current trends in blockchain use and its innovative opportunities.\nMarc Durand , a Blockchain leader at IBM Cloud France, will give a presentation “Industrial blockchain projects with Hyperledger Fabric: Feedbacks and Perspectives.”\nDemozone\nApart from the conference, guests of the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France will have a chance to visit demozone where companies working in the blockchain industry will introduce their developments.\nThe event will include the networking time as well: companies will be able to find business partners, get business ties and sign profitable contracts.\nОrganizer\nThe event will be held by the company Smile-Expo , which has organized the Blockchain World Events series in 25 countries.\nVenue\nThe conference will take place in the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile hotel in the heart of Paris next to Arch of Triumph and Champs-Élysées.

Death will only mean one thing for bitcoin, zero value. As long as bitcoin has value, it will still be alive and continue to live. The good thing about being down is that the only is UP. Other doesn't realize it and got too afraid of investing. Decrease in price is not always negative. I am taking it as a blessing and making an opportunity out of it. Think of it as the best time to invest. Death is so final. Just give it a chance, you won't regret it.\nLOL. What do you mean to early to tell? Bitcoin has survived a a lot of issues/problems so I don't know what will causes bitcoin to suddenly die as what others have been portraying for years. And just remember that it is still young, not even a decade to say that its dead already.

It\\u2019s up two percent and odds are, BCH prices shall continue appreciating in the days to come. Fundamentals are good and despite their full node migration problems after their hard fork, Bitcoin Cash continues to take root. BCH is now available at De Vere and their users can now buy\\/sell the coins as they wish. All they have to do is download deVere mobile app and they are good to go. From the News\nThe genesis of current Bitcoin Cash squabbles can be routed back to August 2017 and the New York Agreement. Then, it was a couple of months before crypto-mania which saw main coins as Bitcoin and others exploding to their ATHs. During that pump, the network was literally congested and consequently, transaction fees were on the roof. To prevent such happenings, one of the agreements detailed a solution of lowering BTC network transaction fees. Segwit came to pass but Segwit2X collapsed in the last minute. Shortly after Segwit 2X failure, we had Bitcoin Cash.\nAt its core and according to proponents, BCH represents the objectives of Satoshi himself. Two weeks ago, Bitcoin Cash did split again increasing their block size to 32 MB. They said they were preparing for a future in which they are dominant and are a medium of exchange if not a store of value. However, despite their objectives, there is a big problem. Statistics shows that up-to 13 percent of their full nodes didn\\u2019t upgrade and are effectively incompatible with the current PoW protocol. Whether this is a minor issue or not, we can truly say Bitcoin Cash is overlooking potentially disastrous situations which can be their major undoing. If they want to run the crypto world, then should have been consensus.\nIn other news, can the recent depreciation of cryptocurrencies valuation be attributed to German officials dumping Bitcoin Cash, ETH and BTC? Solid data do support this argument. While we understand that price declines started in mid-January 2018, releasing of seized coins exacerbates the overall erosion of coin market cap. Reliable sources confirm that German authorities were successful in unloading 1399 Bitcoin Cash coins in 1600 individual transactions in a span of two months. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nUnderstandably, we can link this slide in market cap and Bitcoin Cash to the poor performance of the crypto market in May. It\\u2019s not an individual coin performance per say neither can critics satisfactorily point out a technical glitch or loss of user case application. Note this though, Bitcoin Cash bears are up 60 percent from April highs at around $1800.\nThis is encouraging and portrays typical retracements following periods of higher highs we saw in April. In my view and considering the relation between trading ranges, volumes and key inflection points, I can almost conclude May down trend as long coverings. Then again, why not? Look at the way buyers are rejecting lower lows in lower time frames. It\\u2019s conditional that can only cement my views that last week\\u2019s sell candlestick was a climax if this week\\u2019s candlestick ends up bullish. Daily Chart Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nIn determining the most probable direction of price action, we can always refer to that double bar bullish reversal pattern on May 28-29. May 29 is important because it was this time that buyers did jump in. Check out those volume surges rejecting lower lows. The next day, prices didn\\u2019t edge higher and that is okay.\nHowever, after yesterday\\u2019s bullish candlestick, Bitcoin Cash buyers can look for under-valuations in lower time frame charts and trade with the trends. Ideal buy targets lie at $1,800 with stops at $900.\nThe post The Federal Reserve Places Bitcoin Cash at $1800– That\\u2019s Where We Fix Our Buy Targets: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis (June 1, 2018) appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york agreement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vere", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T05:25:22.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c3a89f798687f7e974d7e9165cc5f0ec5b14eda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5p4FJR4tjwOQWunfE1Yxpeu2kRdJq.a75Cx8t.inS.F5ijuJZskhI_EDgdHqVaZ3bdpUrX2MwkyKL3LFiNtaWVTvZC5pW.I_n.w42K1mur.WQ-", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician", "title_full": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician", "published": "2018-06-01T03:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/104911414-GettyImages-890387088-bitcoin.1910x1000-1024x536.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c3a89f798687f7e974d7e9165cc5f0ec5b14eda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5p4FJR4tjwOQWunfE1Yxpeu2kRdJq.a75Cx8t.inS.F5ijuJZskhI_EDgdHqVaZ3bdpUrX2MwkyKL3LFiNtaWVTvZC5pW.I_n.w42K1mur.WQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-06-01T03:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician", "text": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician by 0\nBitcoin has recouped the week’s losses and is in rally mode as trade threats keep equities on the back foot. One market strategist says the major cryptocurrency may have finally found its bottom.\n“When we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen. We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here,” Robert Sluymer, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC’s “Futures Now” on Thursday.\nBitcoin has touched its key support level around $7,000 several times this year and recovered. Most recently, prices moved as low as $7,054 this week before bouncing higher.\n“That’s certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold,” he said. Momentum also looks positive to Sluymer, indicating a decline in Bitcoin may have found a floor.\n“That RSI indicator in the bottom of the chart is very oversold and starting to bottom so that’s really part of that bottoming phase taking hold,” he said. Bitcoin’s relative strength index, a measure of momentum, is currently trading around 40.

Here’s a look at some of the headlines that were moving the cryptocurrency market today — and which currencies were on the move.\nHeadlines Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced the creation of a $1 billion fund to back cryptocurrency and blockchain startup companies. Binance said its first incubation project will be blockchain-based Chinese ride hailing startup Dache Coin. Binance has also invested in MobilCoin, Oasis Labs, Certik and Republic.\nDan Morehead, founder of hedge fund Pantera Capital Management, says investors should be scooping up bitcoin after the price of the cryptocurrency has declined 45 percent year-to-date. Morehead said the majority of cryptocurrencies are cheap at the moment and advised investors to buy cryptos once they break their 230-day moving average and hold for at least one year.\nCryptocurrency trading platform Huobi is launching its own crypto-based ETF . The new ETF will replicate the performance of the recently-launched Huobi 10 index, which tracks a basket of 10 different crypto assets.\nPrice Action The Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC ) traded at $12.14, down 1.1 percent.\nHere’s how several top crypto investments fared Friday. Prices are as of 3:45 p.m. ET and reflect the previous 24 hours.\nBitcoin declined 1.5 percent to $7,453; Ethereum declined 1.6 percent to $571; Ripple declined 1.6 percent to 61 cents; Bitcoin Cash declined 2.0 percent to $983; EOS declined 3.6 percent to $12.08. The three cryptocurrencies with at least $1-million market caps that have made the biggest gains over the past 24 hours are:\nSuperCoin: $1.1-million market cap, 338.7-percent gain. Carboncoin: $2.2-million market cap, 95.2-percent gain. MagicCoin: $2.6-million market cap, 40.9-percent gain.

This has increased the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation to US$129 billion. Once again, the catalyst for this rise appears to have been a flight to safety after heavy declines on European and U.S. share markets.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price has pushed 5.2% higher since this time yesterday to US$580.53 per token, lifting ETH’s market capitalisation to US$57.9 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has lifted 3.8% over the last 24 hours to 61.7 U.S. cents, increasing its market capitalisation to US$24.2 billion. The Ripple price was given a boost yesterday after its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, told attendees at the Recode conference that he thought Bitcoin was the Napster of cryptocurrencies. He stated that Bitcoin “is transformative technology, but Spotify and iTunes and Pandora rule the day because they engaged with regulators to solve a real problem.”\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price is up 3.4% since this time yesterday to US$1,002.26 per token, increasing its market capitalisation to US$17.2 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has been a strong performer and has pushed 4.9% higher over the last 24 hours to US$12.50. This gives EOS an improved market capitalisation of US$11.15 billion.\nOutside the top five the gains were even stronger. While Litecoin (LTC) only managed a 1.9% gain, Cardano (ADA) and Stellar (XLM) both rose 9%, and IOTA (MIOTA) jumped a massive 13.3% over the last 24 hours.\nThe only coin in the top ten to drop lower was TRON (TRX) with a 1% decline to 6.1 U.S. cents.

The firm kicked off its own bitcoin mining operations in December 2017, and has also slated in August as the deadline for the launch of its cloud mining service.\nThe tech giant said in the announcement that the hope is to encourage the public to become familiar with cryptocurrencies via the new app, since users will need to use their own digital wallets to receive and use the bitcoin.\nGMO indicated that, moving forward, it may include support for more cryptocurrencies within the app and also expand its integrations across other mobile games.\nThe new service comes just a week after GMO announced that it is launching the world’s first 7nm bitcoin mining chip, with a target shipment deadline set for the end of October 2018.\nMobile game image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

I recently came across an ad for Bit.ly/Earn1Daily It sounded very intising to me when I learned of a company now giving people this opportunity for free, I didn’t believe it, you don’t even need bank account and you’ll still be able to do this and withdrawal the funds to many popular crypto wallets. I didn’t have to spend any money to try it out so I was completely interested and willing. I mean why not, I’m not loaded, Extra money is always good to me! With this company I’ve discovered possibly the future of investing and you can too! The company has leveraged itself with real estate, investor funds go towards buying properties giving block chain a new meaning. These guys have found a way that allows them to equate 1 square foot of real estate into to $1 of residual payments. The company’s customers can decide for themselves how many square feet they want to purchase. Each property will continue to earn money revenues for life and grow in value over time. So I’ve been using the service for awhile and I’ve decided to invest some of my XRP, for me It’s one of my favorite coins so I try to keep a nice supply in the bag anyway. To me Xrp is more valuable than any fiat but to make a long story short 100 Xrp will generate 1 Xrp daily! Your investment is paid back in 100 days, everything after that is all profit. I think this could could also be a good tool for those who can’t resist temptations and never seem to hold their digital assets longer than a few weeks.

Lightning Payments Meet Android\nThe release, called simply Lightning Wallet , incorporates a fully operational Lightning node, providing for both on-chain Bitcoin and off-chain Lightning Network transactions.\nUsers will be able to take advantage of the increasingly well-populated network, benefits including near-instant sending and receiving of Bitcoin via dedicated channels for fees of less than one satoshi ($0.0000755141) – Bitcoin’s smallest unit. The app has received six positive 5-star user reviews so far.\n“It is crucial to understand that Lightning Wallet is a completely standalone app, it is not a thin client to some centralized service,” the wallet’s description to potential users reads.\nThis most importantly means that your money is stored right on your phone and nowhere else which gives you a ultimate censorship resistance: no one can ‘freeze your account’ or cancel your transactions, but at the same time this makes you the only one responsible for securing your funds. Mitigating Funds Loss Concerns\nAs Bitcoinist has reported throughout 2018 since Lightning’s mainnet release went live, both support and adoption have been brisk, despite the underlying technology remaining in an experimental phase.\nWhile the potential for funds to go missing due to technical inconsistencies remains, Lightning Wallet developers claim they have mitigated such risks using a mnemonic passphrase setup.\n“This is [the] first Lightning wallet on [the] market which offers off-chain data loss protection: in case of emergencies such as phone loss you will only need a mnemonic phrase to recover both on-chain Bitcoin balance and off-chain Lightning balance,” its Google Play description confirms.\nIn April, Lightning passed the symbolic adoption mark of 2000 nodes, with over 6000 channels currently open, handling a total network capacity of over $160,000.\nVarious consumer tools have gone live, while payment processor CoinGate recently announced it had also pivoted to add compatibility for merchants.\n“Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network,” the company wrote in a statement.\nWhat do you think about Lightning Wallet?

The police said that the couple hailed from Uttar Pradesh and invited people to invest in crypto-currency schemes. The police claimed that the dup used to promise investors to double up their money. “They tricked over 6,000 to invent into their scheme and duped them of several crore,” the official said.\nAdding that the couple used to market about their schemes on the website , and offered multilevel marketing schemes , “The couple managed to lure people by offering gifts such as expansive watches, we have investigated the matter at and more names may come to the fore,” said an official.\nThe police added that during the interrogation the couple said that at least 6,000 people invested in their schemes. “We are taking help of the cyber experts to ascertain if indeed they had brought crypto currencies such as bitcoins,” said an official.\nThe Rajasthan police said that there are many companies inviting people to invest in their digital currencies but lack of regulation makes it difficult for cops to check if they are indeed Ponzi firms. “There are rules related to the crypto currency.

Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has repeatedly shared his enthusiasm for digital currencies, saying earlier this month that “the internet deserves a native currency.”\nBut San Francisco-based Square has gained on more than optimism for cryptocurrencies. The shares have rallied 25 percent since the company said in April it was buying website-builder Weebly for $365 million, the firm’s biggest-ever acquisition. The deal is a key step in Square’s strategy to build its online and e-commerce offerings for small and medium-size businesses. It also gives Square another recurring revenue stream and base of new customers.\nThe stock closed Thursday at $58.25, a new record high, shortly before the company raised its annual revenue forecast to reflect the impact of the Weebly transaction.\nDorsey’s crypto fever and appetite for deals have contributed to Square’s surge, but a steady stream of positive earnings surprises has also fueled bullish sentiment. The most recently reported quarter marked the 10th consecutive period that the firm topped analysts’ sales projections.\nSquare’s gross payment volume could reach $409 billion in 2026, or 4.1 percent of total U.S. payment volume, RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin predicted in a May 22 note to clients.\n“Square’s integrated hardware, software and services solutions position the company to benefit from ongoing card acceptance penetration at smaller merchants while gaining share against existing solutions that lag from a technological or efficiency-basis,” wrote Perlin, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.\nNow read: Warren Buffet almost invested $3 billion in Uber Bitcoin trading Square", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "shares of square inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco-based square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T08:20:36.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b03b935edff91d873f8bb07f38b79e995467cc60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy8IJWbUL_rCNW5iMqsCl1Vxhm1Binfpova.vGJUv7bSFDdAvxxvKelYvdxmsJHORXQbZT57E7C1LBG41.mf_FtgNKU9Hn.ZpVVAqN2sAkPZQYY0nEKzwXL7gxk1uGC9SmBOmQgv6v7dQ--", "site_full": "freebitcoin.directory", "site": "freebitcoin.directory", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Cypher Capital Publishes Independent Analysis About Mobile Data Marketplace DENT - Free Bitcoin Directory", "title_full": "Cypher Capital Publishes Independent Analysis About Mobile Data Marketplace DENT - Free Bitcoin Directory", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://freebitcoin.directory/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/freebitcoindirectory_logo-300x293.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b03b935edff91d873f8bb07f38b79e995467cc60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy8IJWbUL_rCNW5iMqsCl1Vxhm1Binfpova.vGJUv7bSFDdAvxxvKelYvdxmsJHORXQbZT57E7C1LBG41.mf_FtgNKU9Hn.ZpVVAqN2sAkPZQYY0nEKzwXL7gxk1uGC9SmBOmQgv6v7dQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cypher Capital Publishes Independent Analysis About Mobile Data Marketplace DENT - Free Bitcoin Directory", "text": "Yiddish Cypher Capital Publishes Independent Analysis About Mobile Data Marketplace DENT\nThis is a sponsored story.

The major crypto exchange is thinking about opening an office in Uganda and we have covered the story in today’s Bitcoin in Brief. Also, online trade with cryptos spikes in Bahrain, while in Georgia, luxury real estate is being sold for bitcoin. All this has been happening in an otherwise bearish May. Binance to Open Office in Uganda\nBinance is considering the possibility of opening a new office in Uganda , company CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference 2018, which took place at the end of May in Kampala, the country’s capital. The move is part of the trading platform’s plans to support the economic transformation of the African nation and increase youth employment through blockchain technology implementation. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has offices in Japan, Hong Kong, Malta , and intends to establish a global compliance center in Bermuda .\nWith the help of companies like Binance, “Uganda will be able to join the 4th Industrial Revolution, subsequently a lot of new jobs will open and the flow of investment into the country will increase,” Zhao said. “Watching this conference I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,” he stated.\nIn April, Binance’ CEO announced a partnership with Crypto Savannah, an African blockchain innovation hub, Msingi, an organization working to build the East African industries of the future, and the “Made in Africa” Initiative. In a post on Twitter, Changpeng Zhao promised “thousands of jobs and bringing investments to Uganda.” “Expect more news on Africa!” he added in the comments.\nIn a statement during the conference in Kampala, Zhao noted that most banks in Europe, the US, and China criticize cryptocurrencies and do everything possible to crush them, and added: “It seems to me that Africa has real chances of becoming one of the leading regions in the implementation of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.” Bearish May Brings Down Trading Volumes\nMore than $606 billion in cryptocurrencies have been traded last month through over 1,600 different cryptocurrencies, according to Coinmarketcap . The total is less than half the $1.4 trillion in more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies traded during the previous monthly period, 24/7 Wall St reports. The data shows a bearish May following a rather bullish April. With a 30-day volume of $184.31 billion, bitcoin (BTC) is the most traded cryptocurrency.\nThe last several months have seen another negative trend – in futures trading. Since March, the contracts have dropped by a third. Nymex bitcoin futures have lost more than 51% since trading began in January. Bitcoin June futures on Cboe traded down about 1.9% at noon on Wednesday. The expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25 also influenced cryptocurrency prices. Crypto Trade Booming in Bahrain\nIn some parts of the world, however, things do not look so bleak. Since the beginning of this year, more jurisdictions have begun to legally recognize cryptocurrencies, one way or another. These include the US, Canada, many members of the European Union, and several African and Asian nations.\nBahrain , a country credited for building the first post-oil economy in the Persian Gulf, has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency, according to local media. In the absence of official regulations, bitcoin transactions have been booming on Bahraini websites and social media. A shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in the Riffa area, Albawaba Business reported.\nThe island nation has also indicated it may soon emerge as a global cryptocurrency exchange hub. In March, the government in Manama set up a “regulatory sandbox” for that purpose. “As long as the business qualifies as fintech, we will welcome it,” said Khalid Saad, CEO of Bahrain Fintech Bay, quoted by Business Line . At least four crypto trading platforms are already registered there.\nThe sector, however, is still awaiting a final decision on the legal tender status of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It is supposed to come from the Central Bank of Bahrain, which is the country’s financial regulator. Real Estate Sold for Bitcoin in Georgia\nA luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins (~$190,000) in Georgia . According to local realtors, the owner has explicitly asked the price to be announced in cryptocurrency, Geomigrant reports. The current legislation does not mention crypto payments. Despite the lack of a regulatory framework, cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity as a means of exchange and trade among Georgians.\nThe Caucasian country is known as a major crypto mining hub in Eurasia thanks to some tax incentives and low electricity rates. According to a recently published study by the World Bank, around 5% of Georgian households participate in cryptocurrency trading and investing. Blockchain technologies have also spread in Georgia.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today’s Bitcoin in Brief?

See this amazing bank note which greatly worths one Bitcoin Godwin Godwin June 7, 2018 Cryptocurrencies Leave a comment\nThis particular banknote Is the most important valued hard currency in the world. Interestingly, it is worth a Bitcoin, as in barely enough to purchase One Bitcoin\nODYNAIJA gathered from report published by Quartz that the banknote in question belongs to Brunei, one of the most centralized countries in the world. Meanwhile, it shouldn’t be to some extent astonishing that Brunei has in her one of the richest men alive printed on it. Brunei’s B$10,000 banknote is worth, at press time, roughly $7,584. Bitcoin, according to ODYNAIJA’S price Index , is trading at about $7,709 after surging from about $7,700 in the last 2-4 hour period. The Bank note has on it the portrait of this richest man’s name – Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, and was issued in 2006. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, one of the last monarchs (absolute) , is notably one of the richest men on Earth, as reports suggest heis worth over $20 billion, thanks to the country’s vast oil and gas fields, which account for nearly all of its economy. Brunei has less than half a million residents, and recently adopted strict Islamic sharia law, which drew criticism from various international rights groups. Back in December, when most cryptocurrencies were at an all-time high, the country’s central bank reportedly cautioned against cryptocurrencies. Phasing out high-denomination notes, the Brunei dollar’s value is legally par with the Singaporean dollar. Singapore itself had its own S$10,000, but reportedly discontinued it. High-denomination bills are being retired throughout the universe, as these reportedly make it easier to conduct illicit activities such as terrorism financing, money laundering, and tax evasion. Recently, Latvia got rid of its 500-lat note, worth about $982, after becoming the eurozone’s 13th member. The euro zone itself is phasing out its €500 bill over similar concerns. Brunei’s high-denomination bill remains as the country is seen as a low threat for money laundering and terrorism financing. Switzerland, which recently called for a study on the potential risks and benefits of issuing a state cryptocurrency dubbed “e-franc, ” has been resisting pressure to stop printing its 1,00-franc note, which currently accounts for more than 40% of its bills in circulation. According to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) article, a briefcase with $100 bills would be 70% full, while a briefcase with Brunei’s largest note would only be 1.5% full. In as much it’s easy to transport makes these bills ideal for criminals, the article suggests. A similar argument, coupling said feature with bitcoin’s semi-anonymous nature, was also used against the cryptocurrency in the past. Featured image from Shutterstock.

At first glance I would think that most countries that need investment to bypass sanctions or to pull away from the oil dollar, would seem very open and warm towards this new form of money, but the opposite has happened, many states like India, Russia, China have taken strong stances against bitcoin, making buying totally illegal or difficult to the point that the only way to buy is to pay extreme premiums, up to 20% or pay in cash. The interesting thing I find here is that the countries with some of the highest corruption levels in terms of the amount of money circulating are the ones that are hard on bitcoin, for example China, Russia, India. According to a rough study done a few years back the corruption economy in Russia reaches a wild $300 billion per year. People shouldn't be fooled by the “contentious”(yellow) level given by bitlegal(down below), from 1st and 2nd hand experience unless your buying $5000 worth of bitcoin, anything more and it might present some difficulty, a lot of the OTC websites like localbitcoins.com are blocked, and they cant accommodate large trades either way simply because the spread becomes ridiculous. Perhaps after reading this people will stop complaining about coinbase, seen as many dont have coinbase. http://map.bitlegal.io/ So why do these countries take such a hard stance on bitcoin? Apart from all the well known reasons, especially in Russia's case, isn't it better to attract investors and innovation in this new exciting space, when you are sanctioned? This is what I thought… and I thought wrong. The holders of all the illegal money are always looking for ways to legalize there funds, and this is where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies come in, dont get me wrong, I am not saying or supporting the accusations of “bankers” that bitcoin is used for money laundering, bitcoin is a valuable revolutionary technology that gives its users enough freedom to do what they please with that value. Freedom that has been taken away. The money leaving these countries is always very big. It’s simple corrupt politicians are always trying to avoid investing there stolen funds in the country they stole them in, just in case “the shit hits the fan” . If you haven't guessed what I am getting at, bitcoin lets them transfer there funds with great ease, it goes like this, for example: buy bitcoin for cash in nation A, send to a verified exchange account in nation B, sell the bitcoin, send the money to your bank account in nation B. Its that easy. At the current level of regulation the relevant financial authority wont ask questions, even if they do, you can always say “I bought in 2012 and forgot about them” , and in my opinion most regulators are not too strict when money is coming into the country, it’s when money wants to leave that they start to get vigilant. For these states, it is a very clear loss, having such a big amount of capital leaving the country which far outweighs the positives of “warm” policy towards bitcoin, hence in my opinion, even when regulation does come it will be very double sided and it wont reach the level of adoption of western nations, in that buying and selling will be strictly monitored. This in turn will only increase the economy of cash based trades, and therefore increase the crime that goes on in association with it. Generally crime is hypothesized to only increase in the cryptocurrency space and this includes everything digital and physical(hacking, phishing, physical robbery etc). The social engineering will only increase until people learn to take responsibility for their own finances. The simple answer to why? is the financial incentive is too big, just imagine for a second the group of people who hacked the Japanese coincheck exchange for over $500 million worth of Nem, even if there were 20 of them that is $25 million per person, that’s enough money to never work a day in your life, with the correct management. The real question is how many readers would not perform such a hack if they were capable of doing it? There was a situation in Moscow, a person was kidnapped and taken to the woods, the criminals proceeded to cut his face and threaten him which eventually led him to send them his 300 bitcoin, again the financial incentive is too big, I am not defending the criminals, I am just looking at things in a realistic way, people get mugged for a mobile phone worth $700, what do you expect to happen if someone knows you have that much money? So what should the random buyer do? If located in a part of the world where the government is hard on bitcoin, and therefore cash trades are very common, along with crime. There are some precautions to take when planning to buy or sell this way, which can help negate the risk of being at the bad end of criminal activity, some of which are mentioned below: •Do not talk about your cryptocurrency wealth, very easy, but time and time again I see people doing it, cryptocurrency made many people very wealthy very quickly, but think about this, there is a reason why Satoshi went underground, because he understood the risks associated with being public if bitcoin took off. •Never go to a trade alone •If the amount in question is large, say over 50 bitcoin meet prior to the trade dont trust internet conversations, see the people you are dealing with. •Is it too good to be true? for example the spread is too good or another factor, stay away. •When counting the cash, always have it counted by a foreign currency exchange you trust, they may charge a small fee, its well worth it. •If your acting as a middleman or broker, always make sure to clarify what your side really wants, so if someone says they want to buy 10 bitcoin, make sure to ask them, because in many cases, buyers have a specific amount of money, so if the price of bitcoin was to increase by 5%(very possible) they will be buying less than 10 bitcoin, this can be aggravating to the party selling. •Do not travel around the city with large amounts of cash, you agree on a specific place and time, if the party then asks you to come to another place, cancel the trade. •Never place your money inside someone else’s safe in there office or anywhere else, before you see the confirmations the money should be on neutral ground. In most jurisdictions if the money is placed inside there safe, it is technically there money, and it may be very hard to prove you put it there. •Always show the most caution, better safe than sorry, seriously it has been mentioned far too often, All the con artists around the world are now focusing in this industry the internet and physical robbers. If something looks suspicious just cancel the trade. •If your the middleman in a large trade, everyone has there own understanding of large trade, but lets say about 300 bitcoin. One way to deter risk is to offer the sides to make the deal happen on separate occasions like 30 bitcoin everyday over the course of 10 days, and if one side does not want to, that’s a red flag. It is very sad to admit, some of the things mentioned above where obvious, but I felt everything had to be mentioned, because common, we still have people falling for twitter ethereum scams, “send us 0.2 ethereum and get 5 back” , I call on everyone to educate themselves and stay aware at all times. Society has become to used to being nurtured financially by institutions which would take care of everything in terms of security, too bad the cost of that service far outweighs the loss, even though custodial services will become more apparent in the crypto space, I still urge everyone to learn to take responsibility of there own finances, coinbase is already being called a bank, because it went against Wikileaks, nothing against Wikileaks here, but coinbase is a business at first, they will always protect there business. To conclude… Cryptocurrency adoption over the coming years will most likely increase, as regulation sets in, it will open the doors for a wider investment audience, because for many people the “no regulation” is the main reason they deter. In no way though will these nations who have problems with corruption ever easily let the trade of bitcoin to go without close monitoring. Crime in the space will continue to grow until people learn to take the necessary precautions, we will continue to hear news stories of exchanges getting hacked, other custodian services being attacked, people being robbed, etc. The only way to prosper is to get educated, stay safe and aware.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: Will John McAfee’s Prediction Hold True? On Jun 1, 2018 Share\nBitcoin price is running but she’s not out of the woods yet. Technical charts show a pack of angry bears right at the heel, but at last, in swoops a hero!\nIs it volume?\nIs it the cavalry composed of fat cat institutional investors and bitcoin beluga whales?\nNope.\nAt the edge of the tree-line, waiting with hands extended…or actually, tapping to the rescue via Twitter is the one and only person who can restore Bitcoin to its rightful place above 10k.\nJohn McAfee? John McAfee\nMcAfee recently reaffirmed his belief that bitcoin will trade above $15,000 by June 12th and voila, BTC price popped right up to $7,600 yesterday. At this point, one cannot draw a direct connection between the words of a notorious coin shill and changes in bitcoin price, but it can’t be disputed that McAfee’s statements had an effect on the prices of multiple cryptocurrencies in the past. Market Overview\nFor the moment, the valor of McAfee’s chivalrous shill appeal appear to have had little impact as Bitcoin’s technical setup remains relatively unchanged. But technical charts are beginning to show a budding attempt of a reversal.\nNews-wise, this week hasn’t provided any market moving events but there were a few intriguing posts from Twitter technical analysts.\nTwitter user FilbFilb , for example, argues that the Money Flow Indicator serves as a reliable oscillator for measuring buying and selling pressure and his or her charts demonstrate how it could be used to forecast BTC movement.\nMeanwhile, Roger Quantrillo posted his mic drop BTC triangle chart which provides plenty of food for thought.\nNow, those are beautiful charts that provoke all sorts of bearish and bullish thoughts but it should be noted that cryptocurrency price movement (especially Bitcoin) does not happen in a vacuum.\nSo, reliance on one oscillator, or any combination of technical analysis tools has yet to be proven as being capable of providing reliable data for BTC price direction and the same observation applies to the charts below. Daily Chart\nAt the time of writing, BTC continues to trade near the bottom leg of the descending channel and a quick glance at the moving averages shows the 20-day MA continuing to plummet well below the 50-day MA.\nSince dropping to $7,043 on May 29th, BTC has been pinned between $7,200 – $7,600 and is slowing working its way towards the next levels of resistance at $7,650 and $7,870 (20-day MA).\nEncouragingly, there appears to be an inverse head and shoulders formation developing, but to confirm this, BTC needs to meet the neckline slightly above $7,600.\nBoth the RSI and Stoch are angled upward and heading into bullish territory as BTC approaches $7,600, which supports the case for BTC extending to $7,850 in the near term. 4HR Chart\nThe 4 hour chart paints a more positive picture with the 5 and 10-day MA crossed, moving upward, and above the 50-MA. The 50,100 and 200-MA continue to slope downward in favor of bears so traders should keep an eye on volume as the pop could be short lived in the event of a gains above $7,850.\nOn May 31st, BTC posted an outside-day candle, which is a bullish indicator as the higher low hints at a price reversal. The possibility of a reversal is further supported by the bullish divergence seen on the RSI oscillator.\nCombined, all of these factors, along with the nearing completion of an inverse head and shoulders formation, make a strong case for the possibility of a bullish reversal. Bitcoin Price: Looking Ahead\nBTC appears to be wrapping up a period of consolidation and gearing up for a breakout.\nIn the short-term, a test of the descending channel trendline near $7,850 is probable and traders should keep an eye on volume in order to gain insight on the strength of the movement. If there is strong buying pressure BTC could run up to $8,520 (50-day MA on the daily chart).\nFailure to break and stay above the $7,650 resistance could see BTC pullback to a soft resistance level at $7,100, followed by a stronger resistance at $6,750. Hence, it is recommended to keep an eye on volume and the position of the Stoch and RSI in the event of a reversal.\n[Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

One market strategist says the major cryptocurrency may have finally found its bottom.\n\"When we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen. We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it's going to start a recovery process here,\" Robert Sluymer, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's \" Futures Now \" on Thursday.\nBitcoin has touched its key support level around $7,000 several times this year and recovered. Most recently, prices moved as low as $7,054 this week before bouncing higher.\n\"That's certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold,\" he said.\nMomentum also looks positive to Sluymer, indicating a decline in Bitcoin may have found a floor.\n\"That RSI indicator in the bottom of the chart is very oversold and starting to bottom so that's really part of that bottoming phase taking hold,\" he said.\nBitcoin's relative strength index, a measure of momentum, is currently trading around 40. A level close to 30 typically indicates oversold conditions.\n\"The next thing that has to happen is to see Bitcoin actually rally through the downtrend and we use the 15-day moving average, it's very simplistic, but it's a pretty good proxy across most markets,\" said Sluymer. Its 15-day moving average of roughly $7,800 \"will be the next hurdle for it to get through.\"\nBitcoin last traded around the $7,800 level a week ago. It has not traded above it since May 23.\n\"We think the setup is very attractive here,\" added Sluymer. \"If you're short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you're looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.\"\nBitcoin is up more than 2 percent on Thursday and last traded at $7,558.\nDisclaimer\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/id/105056576", "https://www.cnbc.com/futures-now/", "https://www.cnbc.com/id/23596635"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T17:05:16.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81f84758d47398431ee409ab88a78cf6aeede7f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1jdQF1a4CEjX4PWy2Z6eCM-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81f84758d47398431ee409ab88a78cf6aeede7f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1jdQF1a4CEjX4PWy2Z6eCM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvest your time and effort inviting new users and you will guarantee a high passive income for yourself for a long time.

Square Sees Stock Prices Soar Thanks to Bitcoin Trading Square added about $8 billion in market value since it rolled out Bitcoin trading in November on its Cash App, used by U.S. customers who want convenient access to cryptocurrencies without the hassle of dealing with centralized exchanges. CEO, and Twitter co-founder, Jack Dorsey has been a staunch supporter of digital currencies , stating earlier this month that ‘the internet deserves a native currency,’ according to Bloomberg . Looking to the future, Square’s gross payment volume could reach $409 billion in 2026, or 4.1% of total U.S. payment volume, RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin predicted in a May 22 note to clients. In fact, the most recently reported quarter marked the 10th consecutive period that the firm topped analysts’ sales projections . “Square’s integrated hardware, software and services solutions position the company to benefit from ongoing card acceptance penetration at smaller merchants while gaining share against existing solutions that lag from a technological or efficiency-basis,” wrote Perlin, who has the equivalent of a ‘buy’ rating on the stock. Fortunately for Square, it’s not just cryptocurrencies that are contributing to soaring stock prices. The San Francisco-based firm’s shares have gained 25% since the company announced in April that it was buying website-creator Weebly for $365 million — the firm’s biggest acquisition ever. The deal is a key part of Square’s plans to bulk-up its online and e-commerce offerings and gives the firm another recurring revenue stream as well as a new base of customers.\nOriginally, Square was started as a payment system to serve small businesses priced out of traditional banking services. The concept was conceived when an artisan glassblower and friend of Dorsey needed a better way to process credit and debit card payments. The company has made massive gains since then, and shows no signs of slowing down. Square: Moving Forward When Square’s cryptocurrency services were unveiled there were still some states where it was prohibited, like Georgia, Hawaii, Wyoming, and New York, due to local laws that regulate the movement of digital funds in attempts to prevent money laundering. This has slowly been changing. In a bid to win over future business opportunities with blockchain-based companies, Wyoming passed legislation earlier this year that exempts some cryptocurrency trading operations from its money transmitter laws. The law, known as HB70, was among five crypto-friendly laws presented to the governor’s desk aimed at permitting cryptocurrency and blockchain companies to do business in the state. Square was quick to take advantage of Wyoming’s change in legislation, soon after making their Bitcoin services available to residents of the state.\nThen there’s New York. New York passed it’s Bitlicense cryptocurrency regulatory framework in 2015 under mounting pressure from banking lobbies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the New York District Attorney’s office. Since then only a handful of the licenses have been granted — and Square is looking to get in on the action next.\nA spokesperson for Square confirmed in March the firm’s bid to obtain a license via a tweet . Square made its announcement as legislators in New York are apparently in the process of making changes to the 2015 legislation which will allow more flexibility for cryptocurrency-based businesses in the state.

That’s gotten a lot of people interested in trading for the first time. If you don’t have experience buying and selling something like securities, trying to trade crypto can feel like learning to swim in the deep end of a pool. That’s why we’ve created this glossary of foundational trading concepts to help you get oriented as you start buying and selling Bitcoin, Ether, and more. Basic Concepts Exchanges An exchange is a marketplace where people are able to buy and sell assets. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for example, is a place where people are able to buy and sell stocks. There are a number of cryptocurrency exchanges set up today and that number is increasing all the time. Some of the major exchanges include: Kraken , headquartered in San Fransisco, CA Gemini , headquartered in New York, NY Bitstamp , headquartered in Luxembourg Bitfinex , headquartered in Hong Kong itBit , headquartered in New York, NY All cryptocurrency exchanges are not created equal. Different exchanges let you buy and sell different cryptocurrencies; different exchanges set different prices for their listed cryptocurrencies; and different exchanges have different volumes of trades happening on them, which changes how easy it is to buy or sell cryptocurrency efficiently. Bid price The bid price for a given asset is the maximum price that someone is willing to pay for that asset. You can think of this as the “demand” side of “supply and demand.” Ask price The ask price for a given asset is the minimum price for which someone is willing to sell that asset. You can think of this as the “demand” side of “supply and demand.” Bid-ask spread The bid-ask spread is the difference between the bid price and ask price for a given asset. This spread is the profit that market makers earn by buying and selling the asset on behalf of investors. As an asset’s liquidity increases, this spread decreases correspondingly. Volatility Volatility is the extent of changes in an asset’s value over time. If an asset’s value frequently fluctuates to a great degree — that is, if it’s highly volatile — then it’s typically thought to be a proportionately high-risk investment. The historically high volatility of Bitcoin is one of the reasons why some have been skeptical of Bitcoin’s capacity to act as a store of value. Volatility is also what gives traders the opportunity to profit through day trading and swing trading (see below). Wallets When it comes to managing your cryptocurrency holdings, it’s important to understand who actually has your holdings. If you have your holdings in a wallet — whether that’s a hardware wallet, a software wallet, or a paper wallet — you control your private key and actually have custody over those holdings. On the other hand, when you buy and hold cryptocurrencies on most exchanges, they store those holdings in wallets of their own. That’s why some people worry about centralized cryptocurrency exchanges: if they’re hacked, their investors’ money could vanish overnight. FOMO Fear of missing out (“FOMO”) is modern slang for a timeless, irrational behavior: worrying that you’re missing out on a great opportunity and therefore jumping into an investment. In the cryptocurrency space, otherwise inexplicable influxes of buyers have been attributed to FOMO. FUD Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (“FUD”) is modern slang for the “opposite” of FOMO: irrationally worrying that a particular investment or sector might collapse. In the cryptocurrency space, otherwise inexplicable sell-offs have been attributed to FUD. Strategies HODL The term “HODL” comes from when Bitcoin forum user GameKyuubi drunkenly misspelled that he was holding Bitcoin in December of 2013, despite its price crashing. HODL has become synonymous with the “trading” philosophy of buying Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) and holding it indefinitely. The rationale behind this philosophy varies. Many who are entering the space with little trading experience believe that they will make more money in the long run by holding than they would by trying to catch the highs and lows of the market. Others — true Bitcoin maximalists, for example — believe that cryptocurrencies will ultimately replace fiat currencies, in which case it would be irrational to sell any cryptocurrency for fiat. Dollar-Cost Averaging Dollar-cost averaging is the strategy of buying a particular dollar amount of an asset on a regular schedule, e.g., X amount every hour or X amount every day. The idea behind this strategy, which plays well with HODLing, is to gradually take on a position in an asset like Bitcoin in a way that resists the short-term swings of the market. Diversification Generally speaking, diversification is a method of managing the overall level of risk in your portfolio by investing in a range of assets that aren’t perfectly correlated with each other, securing better profits (on average), and minimizing the risk of losses. It can be hard to diversify within the crypto sector at this early stage of its existence, but there are a few rules of thumb that are good to follow:\nUse Bitcoin as the foundation of your crypto holdings. As the cryptocurrency with the biggest market cap, Bitcoin is almost like an index fund for the crypto sector: if crypto as a whole succeeds, then Bitcoin will succeed.\nHolding Ether is a good way of betting that blockchain will have applications beyond being a mere store of value, since most other use cases are being built on Ethereum in one way or another.\nHolding Bitcoin Cash is a good way of investing in the use of cryptocurrencies in commerce. Arbitrage Arbitrage is the strategy of profiting by simultaneously buying and selling an asset in order to take advantage of market inefficiencies by the same asset being priced differently in different places. Especially in this early stage of cryptocurrency’s history, where liquidity varies widely from one exchange to the next, there are numerous opportunities to exploit pricing differences between exchanges to profit through arbitrage. Swing trading Swing trading is the strategy of buying an asset at a low price and selling it at a high price at a relatively high frequency — typically once a day or once every few days. The high volatility of many cryptocurrencies has led many traders to focus on this kind of strategy, though that high volatility can also make the strategy costly if you time your trades poorly. Day trading Day trading is like swing trading but with a higher trade frequency. As the name suggests, day traders trade multiple times per day, typically trying to routinely profit from small fluctuations in a market. Margin trading Margin trading is the practice of buying an asset using funds borrowed from a broker. This is a risky method of trading because, if the assets end up decreasing in value, the trader can be left in significant debt — it’s possible to lose more money than one initially invested. Leverage Leverage is the additional buying power created by margin trading, allowing you to effectively pay less than full price for an asset using borrowed funds. Leverage is typically represented as a ratio: for example, if you have $10,000 in a trading account and borrow another $10,000, then you have 2:1 leverage. Types of trades Market order A market order is what happens when you make an agreement with an exchange to buy or sell a certain amount of an asset immediately at the best available price. Depending on the size of your order and the trading volume on the exchange, this can end up giving you an extremely suboptimal price, though it allows you to execute your trade quickly. Limit order A limit order is an agreement that you make with an exchange to execute a trade only at a certain price point or better. If that price point ends up never being reached, your order may never be executed. Limit orders also allow you to set a time limit on the order, after which the trade won’t be executed at all. Stop-loss order A stop-loss order is a trade that you put in place for an exchange to immediately execute if an asset reaches a particular price point. As the name suggests, this kind of order is designed to limit your losses: if you’re invested in Bitcoin and want to make sure you don’t lose too much money in the event of it tanking, you can make a stop-loss order to ensure that your Bitcoin will be sold immediately if the price dips below a certain point. Take-profit order A take-profit order is the “other half” of a stop-loss order: whereas a stop-loss order is put in place to limit one’s losses, a take-profit order is put in place to secure one’s profits. When this kind of limit order is put in place with an exchange, you will automatically sell the asset in question, immediately, if its value reaches a certain price. OTC trades Over-the-counter (‘OTC’) trades are how many high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors make their especially large trades: they use a broker who directly connects them with an entity willing to buy or sell the asset in question at a particular price. This is intended to avoid losing money by executing a trade so large that it moves the market — but the peculiar information asymmetries involved in such a trade make it easy to make a mistake that ends up offsetting the potential advantages of OTC trading. Gorilla trades Gorilla trades are an SFOX trade algorithm designed for executing large trades without inadvertently moving the market. This method of trade finds the best way to execute a large order by only showing smaller pieces of it on the order book, preventing it from getting buried deep in the order book. It’s best used when there are medium levels of activity in the market. Polar bear trades Polar bear trades are an SFOX trade algorithm designed to optimize the price on large orders. It is a hidden order that automatically trades on the top of an order book once a set limit price is reached. It’s best used with thin spreads and small quantities on the top of the order book. Sniper Trades Sniper trades are an SFOX trade algorithm , a hidden order optimized for speed. This algorithm is ideal for getting the best possible price on a large order quickly, as you would want to do when the markets are especially volatile and you’re worried about prices dropping drastically. TWAP Trades Time-weighted average price (‘TWAP’) trades are an SFOX trade algorithms and are like a more sophisticated method of dollar-cost averaging. These trades allow you to specify n, t, and p such that you buy or sell n of a cryptocurrency over t hours for an average price of p. Trade wisely It’s easy to get sucked into the hype of cryptocurrency and dive into trading without a solid understanding of what you’re really doing. That way lies madness: if you’re shooting in the dark, any bulls-eyes you hit will be rare and purely accidental. Take the crypto craze as an opportunity to learn about the concepts and strategies that underpin sound investing. Armed with more knowledge, you’ll be able to take advantage of the opportunities in this new sector without taking on outsized risk.

That monthly loss pushed bitcoin's five-month moving average below its 10-month moving average for the first time since June 2014. As June began, bitcoin was still lower at about $7,400 for most of the day. While that puts bitcoin about 62% lower than its record high set in December 2017, it's worth noting that bitcoin traded for just $2,407 on June 1, 2017. In the last year, prices have climbed more than 200%. IMF Official: Central Banks Need to Compete\nDong He, the deputy director for the International Monetary Fund's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said in an editorial that central banks need to offer \"better\" fiat currencies in order to compete with cryptocurrencies. He noted that central banks should consider adopting some of the technological innovation in play in the crypto space to \"forestall the competitive pressure crypto assets may exert on fiat currencies.\" The deputy director's thesis was based on the notion that, if cryptocurrencies become the de facto currency of choice over fiat currencies, central banks will lose their ability to influence the economy in times of duress. Bitcoin Is Worth as Much as This Banknote\nWhile many bitcoin evangelists have suggested the cryptocurrency will replace all fiat currencies in coming years, the digital assets have yet to do so. But right now, one single bitcoin has about the same market value as the largest banknote in circulation, Quartz pointed out . Brunei's B$10,000 note is worth about $7,480 - nearly in line with bitcoin's price this week. Most people in Brunei don't use the note, instead hoarding it for an emergency or for use in wartime. It also has, since its introduction in 2006, sometimes served as the go-to currency for illicit transactions. Few countries allow for such large banknotes anymore. The eurozone most recently moved to retire its 500-euro bill, often called the \"bin Laden\" following concerns the high-value banknote was being used to fund terrorism. GMO Launches Bitcoin Reward for Gamers\nGMO Internet Group, a Japanese technology firm, has developed a new app for mobile devices that rewards users with bitcoin earned by playing games. The company calls the app CryptoChips, it announced this week . At its launch, CryptoChips will be integrated with the real-time territorial battle game \"Whimsical War,\" also developed by GMO. By playing the game, users can earn bitcoin based on their rankings and on missions achieved in \"Whimsical War.\" The program is scheduled to begin in August, GMO said. Developers said the goal of the bitcoin reward system is to encourage the broader public to become more familiar with cryptocurrencies, as players who want to earn bitcoin will have to open their own digital wallets to receive their crypto rewards.

The current price represents a decline of more than 50% from its December 2017 highs. The cryptocurrency has been trading around this level throughout most of the week, finally settling down after weeks of gradual decline.\nHowever, the market may be due for a reversal. Yesterday, Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital Management, said in an interview with CNBC that “Bitcoin may have reached its bottom this year, so now is a good time to buy,” Morehead continued: “As a whole, cryptocurrencies have declined about 65% from their highs this year. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes”. BTC/USD Testing Resistance\nBitcoin price is currently forming a bullish trend line that’s looking to test a major resistance level at $7,500. A break above that seems likely, given the steady gains experienced over the past few hours. In that case, the next critical level would be $7,800. This is regarded as a key barrier for BTC/USD to return above $8,000.\nOn the other hand, a struggle to break the resistance level could result in a minor downside reaction to test a major support level at $7,350. A break below that price may send BTC/USD down further to a retracement level of $7,200. Source: Tradingview\nIn the chart above, the MACD is showing a neutral signal, while the RSI indicator puts Bitcoin on the oversold side. Hence, an upward run for BTC/USD is a more likely case in the short term.

The pair might correct a few points in the near term before retesting the $0.6250 resistance.\nRipple price is placed nicely in a bullish zone against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD has to move past the $0.6250 barrier for more gains in the near term. Ripple Price Trend\nThere was a decent price action forming above $0.6000 in Ripple price faced against the US Dollar. The price retested the $0.6200-$0.6250 resistance zone yesterday. However, there was no upside break above $0.6250 and the price topped near $0.6201. It corrected lower and traded below the $0.6150 level. It also declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.5815 low to $0.6201 low.\nOn the downside, there are many supports above the $0.6000 level. There is also a short-term connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.6060 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. Below the trend line, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.5815 low to $0.6201 low is positioned near $0.6008 to prevent losses. Further below $0.6000, the next major buy zone is near $0.5850. As long as the price is above the $0.6000 and $0.5850 support levels, it remains in an uptrend.\nLooking at the chart , the price remains well supported above the $0.5850 level. There could a few downside corrections in the near term, but $0.6000 and $0.5850 are likely to hold losses.

Crypto markets have rallied from the monthly low on Tuesday of just over $300 billion but it has been a weak rally. Bitcoin has struggled to gain momentum today and is hovering around $7,570 where it was this time yesterday. Altcoins are a mixed bunch this Friday following trading in Asia, some are flat, some are still falling and one or two are climbing at the moment. The top coin as Asian trading comes to the end of the working week is Iota.\nCoinmarketcap is showing a 10% climb for Iota over the past 24 hours putting it ahead of all other altcoins in the top 25. Currently trading at $1.87 Iota is up from $1.68 this time yesterday, it is the only cryptocurrency in double figures at the moment. On the week Iota has had a reasonable time, increasing over 22% from $1.52 this time last Friday. Iota ends the month pretty much where it started it with a monthly high of $2.66 and a low of $1.35. Against Bitcoin Iota is up 9% to 24600 satoshis from 22200 sats this time yesterday. Over the past seven days this altcoin has made 21% on BTC from 21300 satoshis this time last week.\nThis Internet of Things based altcoin has had a tough year with security breaches and a big fall from its all-time high of $5.70 in January. It has been due some good news and that finally came with the announcement of collaboration with Norway’s largest bank. The IOTA Foundation and Norway's biggest bank DNB teams up to explore the potential of Economy of Things and myData https://t.co/y48a3525KH #IOTA #DNB\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nDNB ASA, Norway’s largest financial services group, has signed a MoU with the Iota Foundation to ‘explore the new digital innovation landscape made possible by the Iota Tangle technology.’ The news lifted momentum for Iota which has been in steady decline for several months.\nTrade has been dominated in USD on Bitfinex today which has 35% of the total volume. Binance takes second place with over just 25% of the Iota trade. Volume has increased from $97 million to $145 million over the past 24 hours and is rising at the moment. Market cap for Iota currently stands at $5.2 billion positioning it at 9 th on the charts, just behind Stellar.\nTotal crypto market capitalization is up just about 1 percent on the day, sitting at around $335 billion. Trade volume has remained steady at around $16 billion and we end this week pretty much at the same level that things were last Friday. Consequently there has been very little movement amongst the rest of the altcoins but the few that have been performing reasonably well include Cardano up 4.5%, Nem up 5.5% and Ontology up 8%.\nMore on Iota can be found here: https://iota.org/\nFOMO Moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the Asian trading session and analyses the best performing one, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.

The users of the app are demanding an ever-wider, diversified crypto portfolio as the crypto sector expands and moves even further into the mainstream.\" After the app released earlier this year, Green explained: \"All the digital coins on Devere Crypto have different characteristics, strengths and values. As such these additions help to achieve portfolio diversification within this specific asset class and their individual traits make them useful in different ways for investors. I believe that there is no longer any doubt that cryptocurrencies in some form are the future of money.\" HNWIs\nShedding some light on why the group has entered the crypto market, it also released the findings of a new poll in which it is revealed that 35% of high net worth individuals are now already invested in or will make investments in cryptocurrencies before the end of 2018. According to Devere, the 600+ respondents of this poll are some of the group's wealthy clients who currently reside in the U.S., the UK, Australia, the UAE, Qatar, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Spain, France, Germany and South Africa.\nCEO Green opined : \"This mainstream expansion is clearly evidenced by the fact that more than a third of wealthy individuals around the world – who are already likely to be successful investors – are telling us that they already have exposure to crypto or that they will have by the end of this year. The survey's findings demonstrate that high net worth individuals are increasingly unable to ignore the huge potential of cryptocurrencies. There's now surging public awareness of the value, need and demand for digital, global currencies in a digitalised, globalised world. I expect that a broader awareness and understanding of the crypto sector will grow exponentially in the next year as the tech that underpins it further improves, as major corporations and financial institutions embrace it, and as regulation is further developed.\"\nWhat do you think about Devere adding BCH and EOS support?
