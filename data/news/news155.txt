Picture taken December 20, 2017. More REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\nThe US Justice Department and the CFTC are investigating spoofing and wash trading in cryptocurrency markets, according to Bloomberg. These are forms of market manipulation designed to influence the price of assets. They are illegal in mainstream financial markets. A BI investigation last year found \"pump and dump\" scams — where groups falsely ramp up the price of assets for profit — are rife in cryptocurrency markets.\nLONDON — The US Justice Department has reportedly opened a criminal probe into potential market manipulation of bitcoin prices, according to a Bloomberg report.\nBloomberg reported that the Justice Department is working with the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees cryptocurrency derivatives, to investigate potential market manipulation.\nThe investigation is said to focus on \"spoofing\" — where false orders are placed on exchanges and then withdrawn to manipulate prices — in an attempt to lure other people into buying or selling and \"wash trading,\" where market participants trade with themselves to create the illusion of market activity.\nThese kinds of activities allow bad actors to manipulate the price of assets in their favour. Spoofing and wash trading are illegal in mainstream regulated markets such as equities and futures.\nThere are around 26 different ways to manipulate a market, according to a study last year .\nA Business Insider investigation last year found so-called \"pump and dump\" scams are rife in cryptocurrency markets. This is where people \"pump\" a price of a certain crypto by bidding up the price before \"dumping\" it on unsuspecting traders who are lured into the market by the pumpers who say the price is only going up.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently cited Business Insider's investigation in a report highlighting concerns about cryptocurrency markets.\nAnonymous Twitter account Bitfinex'ed, which has over 38,000 followers, has also repeatedly drawn attention to alleged instances of wash trading and spoofing, calling for action from regulators.\nBloomberg reports that the US regulators' investigation, which is in its early stages, focuses on bitcoin, ether, and other major cryptocurrencies.\nBusiness Insider interviewed an alleged \"pump and dump\" ringleader last year who claimed to have been involved in bitcoin price manipulation in the past but said the size of the market made it too hard to manipulate today.\n\"We did manipulate these but now it's too hard with big market capitalization,\" the trader, who went by the name Nico, claimed. \"Our biggest power ever has been around $5 million...

It will, however, feature a variant of the Proof of Authority consensus protocol called Proof of Ambassador instead.\nThe Proof of Ambassador protocol will be a combination of two major consensus methods - Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority, and will enable a high transactional throughput of 15,000 transactions per second on the blockchain.\n\"The existing Proof of Work cryptocurrency model is not sustainable, environmentally speaking, with energy consumption rising exponentially. Generating new coins requires dedicated hardware which is expensive and consumes a lot of energy. An eventual switch to another consensus method is inevitable,\" said Greg van der Spuy, CEO of Bitcoin Origin.\n\"What we are doing with Bitcoin Origin is introducing energy-efficient and highly secure variants of popular cryptocurrencies with an exponentially higher transactional throughput than what's in practice right now. As the Proof of Ambassador consensus does away with cryptographic puzzles, our system is also energy-efficient, scalable and sustainable.\"\nBitcoin Origin will also make use of ground-breaking, innovative blockchain protocols like multi-state engines (MSE), cross-chain, multi-layering and namespace sharding to let users of any technical skill implement their own native, serverless blockchains. And in turn solve the problem of economic abstraction. Moreover, the use of an Ethereum Token Bridge will allow for dApp fees to be paid in native tokens.\nThe board of advisors for the project includes Cyber Security Expert and Consultant, Andrew Henwood, renowned Researchers and Developers, Schalk Dormehl and Afri Schoedon and serial entrepreneur, Thomas van der Spuy.\nThe testnet launch for the project is scheduled for Q3 of 2018 with a mainnet launch planned in Q4. So far, the company has provided proofs of concept for both the Proof of Ambassador consensus protocol and its native blockchain implementation framework.\nSign Up to be the Part of Team

It was first traded on January 3rd, 2009. Bitcoin’s total supply is 17,051,987 coins. The official message board for Bitcoin is bitcointalk.org . Bitcoin’s official Twitter account is @bitcoin and its Facebook page is accessible here . The official website for Bitcoin is bitcoin.org . The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoin and the currency’s Github account can be viewed here .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be purchased on the following cryptocurrency exchanges: BitBay, Upbit, CEX.IO, Octaex, Omicrex, Gemini, BTCC, Fatbtc, Kucoin, Binance, Huobi, CoinsBank, Exrates, RightBTC, BitMEX, bitFlyer, Fisco, Coinhub, Lbank, itBit, Coinsuper, Korbit, YoBit, BTCBOX, OKEx, Bibox, Exmo, BCEX, EXX, IDAX, Tidex, GOPAX, OEX, ZB.COM, Coinroom, Bittrex, CoinEx Market, Negocie Coins, Trade By Trade, Bithumb, BtcTrade.im, HitBTC, Gate.io, Luno, B2BX, CoinTiger, Bitstamp, CoinEgg, Sistemkoin, Iquant, xBTCe, Ethfinex, Coinone, Kraken, OTCBTC, Coinrail, C2CX, Hotbit, OOOBTC, Livecoin, LakeBTC, Bitbank, Zaif, Paribu, Bitinka, CoinBene, GDAX, Cobinhood, Poloniex, DragonEX, Bitfinex, Quoine, Simex, Bit-Z, fex, BitForex, Neraex, WEX and TOPBTC.

Starting in early 2017, the price of bitcoin ballooned from $1,000 to a record high of around $20,000 in mid-December. Currently, the price now sits in around $7,500.\nUnlike in Japan , where virtual currency exchanges are subject the same rules and oversight as any other financial institutions and are required to register with the government, in the U.S. and other countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are still largely unregulated, opening up the doors to fraud and manipulation.\nAs for the U.S. Justice Department, its probe will focus on practices like spoofing, where a trader puts in a large buy or sell order only to withdraw the order as soon as the price starts to go up or down; and wash trading, where an investor simultaneously buys and sells assets to increase the volume of trading. Painting the tape, where traders trade amongst themselves to make it look like there is a flurry of activity going on, is yet another method of market manipulation.\nAll of these illegal trading practices are particularly effective in manipulating asset prices in relatively small markets. Cryptocurrency spot markets are said to handle only a small fraction of overall bitcoin trading, while bigger deals take place in over-the-counter (OTC) markets , like Gemini Global Trading, Circle and Cumberland Mining, where big investors, miners and hedge funds move hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies daily.\nEarlier this year, Jordan Belfort, the original “Wolf of Wall Street,” who served jail time in connection with stock-market manipulation, warned bitcoin traders of “corruption” and “improper trading practices” in the markets and looming government crackdowns. “If you think the governments of the world don’t have the power to shut this down, you are very wrong. They do,” Belfort said in a video .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

the World's First Penta-Fork Blockchain\nMALTA, SOUTHERN EUROPE The Bitcoin Origin Foundation is set to merge five major cryptocurrencies into one multichain blockchain via simultaneous hard forks.\nThe new multichain blockchain (known as Bitcoin Origin) will be an advancement in technologies of the five biggest Proof of Work cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash. It will, however, feature a variant of the Proof of Authority consensus protocol called Proof of Ambassador instead.\nThe Proof of Ambassador protocol will be a combination of two major consensus methods - Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority, and will enable a high transactional throughput of 15,000 transactions per second on the blockchain.\n\"The existing Proof of Work cryptocurrency model is not sustainable, environmentally speaking, with energy consumption rising exponentially. Generating new coins requires dedicated hardware which is expensive and consumes a lot of energy. An eventual switch to another consensus method is inevitable,\" said Greg van der Spuy, CEO of Bitcoin Origin.\n\"What we are doing with Bitcoin Origin is introducing energy-efficient and highly secure variants of popular cryptocurrencies with an exponentially higher transactional throughput than what's in practice right now. As the Proof of Ambassador consensus does away with cryptographic puzzles, our system is also energy-efficient, scalable and sustainable.\"\nBitcoin Origin will also make use of ground-breaking, innovative blockchain protocols like multi-state engines (MSE), cross-chain, multi-layering and namespace sharding to let users of any technical skill implement their own native, serverless blockchains. And in turn solve the problem of economic abstraction. Moreover, the use of an Ethereum Token Bridge will allow for dApp fees to be paid in native tokens.\nThe board of advisors for the project includes Cyber Security Expert and Consultant, Andrew Henwood, renowned Researchers and Developers, Schalk Dormehl and Afri Schoedon and serial entrepreneur, Thomas van der Spuy.\nThe testnet launch for the project is scheduled for Q3 of 2018 with a mainnet launch planned in Q4. So far, the company has provided proofs of concept for both the Proof of Ambassador consensus protocol and its native blockchain implementation framework.\nSign Up to be the Part of Team Now!\nBitcoinOrigin ICO Website: https://www.bitcoinorigin.io/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bitcoinorigin.io/", "http://pr.report/9irovSLY"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin origin foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "proof of authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "malta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:11:03.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b14ca7ff2575560bacb20998901d56004ab6bb86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWE4Mt1H34qTlEsxIc4VBDQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin VS.

It takes 2 seconds. It's a little different than credit cards, so there is a learning curve for the servers, but after they figure it out, they sometimes decide to take the digital cash for themselves as a tip! Who can turn down money that grows doubles in value every year? We get an extra 3-4 tables per week who pay with digital cash, and most of them were not regulars until we started taking it.

Bloomberg reports that the United States Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into possible manipulation of market prices on Bitcoin cryptocurrency market.\nIt is reported that the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is working with the Commission on Commodity and Futures Trading (CFTC), the main US market regulator, to focus on investigating illegal trading activities in cryptocurrency markets. In particular, we are talking about the so-called \"spoofing\", a kind of market manipulation, when traders introduce a flood of false orders into the market to deceive other market participants about the majority's intentions, and also attract new traders to the market. While the investigation is at the initial stage there is no more information regarding the issue. The stage of collecting information and studying the cryptocurrency markets will surely take some time.\nIt is interesting that the news about investigations coincided with another decline in prices for Bitcoin. Today, the price of the main digital currency broke through support at $7700 and the market moved down to a new 6-week local minimum around $7236. After that, there was a local pullback and market gained to the $7490 area. The market capitalization continued its decline and today it was around 332 billion dollars.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "states department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:45:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77a6d0491fb2957319a52c3f847945f6f1e3cfe7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa.Qx1Rd8WETeuDrexk9SzDOI_EEVSVW8mgTJwy0r2OS98jRYPb8lzszMT5xwEHLB3O2qYFIrNzpxw--", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the Top Bitcoin Fork Ever, and Here’s Why", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the Top Bitcoin Fork Ever, and Here’s Why", "published": "2018-05-24T16:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Crypto.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77a6d0491fb2957319a52c3f847945f6f1e3cfe7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa.Qx1Rd8WETeuDrexk9SzDOI_EEVSVW8mgTJwy0r2OS98jRYPb8lzszMT5xwEHLB3O2qYFIrNzpxw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Global Coin Report", "published": "2018-05-24T16:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the Top Bitcoin Fork Ever, and Here’s Why", "text": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the Top Bitcoin Fork Ever, and Here’s Why May 24, 2018 140\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is an easily recognizable fork due to a controversy that surrounded its forking process. We all remember August 2017 when Bitcoin Cash was created as a fork of Bitcoin, that way representing the first Bitcoin fork by far. However, forking Bitcoin didn’t stop there. Bitcoin Cash turned out to be a pretty successful fork with being worth around 4,000$ at its best as marked back in December 2017, only a couple of months after Bitcoin Cash appeared in the crypto market scene. Moreover, BCH is a prominent cryptocurrency and the most successful fork that came from Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Cash Makes Protocol Updates to Enhance Block Size\nBitcoin Cash is probably the best known due to the controversy that surrounded its creation. Back in August 2017 when Bitcoin Cash first appeared in the market, BCH was created as a fork that was decided on based on the disagreement on the integration of the SegWit protocol into the system of Bitcoin.\nAs it usually goes with forking, the portion of investors and users that don’t agree with the proposed updates can create a fork that would enable them to keep operating on the old chain.\nThat is precisely how Bitcoin Cash was created, and probably unexpectedly, BCH was here to stay.\nAfter it was forked out from Bitcoin’s own blockchain, Bitcoin Cash has once again made a move towards another update in its system.\nThis time, Bitcoin Cash updates its protocol so it would be able to enhance the block size, enlarging the block size to 32MB.\nWith this change, BCH made a quite astonishing update to its system as Bitcoin Cash will now be able to provide its users with faster transactions and lower transaction fees, which might add to its value in the following months as a consequence.\nBitcoin Cash Partners Up with BitPay\nBitPay has as of the most recent case partnered up with Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core. What brought Bitcoin Cash to this partnership is the fact that BitPay had some plans with BCH and Bitcoin Core that could potentially sky-rocket these cryptos to the moon in the following months.\nBitPay makes up for a crypto payment processor that is based in the United States, and as of the most recent events, BitPay has made an agreement with Seminole County Tax Collector in Florida, named Joel N. Greenberg.\nAs per the agreement made between BitPay and the mentioned tax collector in Florida, the residents of this area will now be able to pay their taxes in crypto, meaning that the residents will be able to pay for their IDs, licenses and other official documents and taxes by using Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core with BitPay as the medium service.\nThis is an amazing progress for BCH as it showcased its ability to be used in official real-life purpose – in this case, paying taxes in Florida.\nHow Bitcoin Cash Beats Other Bitcoin Forks?\nIn accordance with data provided by BitMEX research service, Bitcoin had 44 forks after Bitcoin Cash, which only counts the forks that were registered and promoted.\nAmong those 44+ forks derived from Bitcoin, it can be easily concluded that not even the half survived the market for long, however, Bitcoin Cash alongside with a couple of more examples, makes up for a perfect exception.\nBitcoin Cash seemed like a success almost at the start, and especially in mid-December when this fork managed to reach the price of over 4.000$ per one BCH unit, which was a massive success for this crypto given the fact that it only existed for 3 months at the time.\nNow when we can see BCH trading at the price of 1.181$, which is pretty far from its all-time high value, we can still see it trading above other Bitcoin forks.\nThat is how Bitcoin Cash has even made it to the list of the top popular cryptos, also making the number 4 on the global coin ranking list which also makes it the 4 th best crypto due to its market cap.\nBesides from Bitcoin Cash, we can still hear about forks like Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Private, a lot of the forks derived from Bitcoin has been shut down like Bitcoin Classic for example. While some of them were doomed from the mere start, many decayed due to the inability to find investors willing to support their fork.\nHow is Bitcoin Cash doing at the Current Moment?\nBitcoin Cash seems to be unable to resist the current market trend, so we can see it dropping against the dollar while going down in the red zone.\nFollowing the latest change that took place in the course of the last 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash can now be traded at the price of 1,176$ per one unit as we can see it dropping by -4.31% against the dollar.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

With fiat currency like US Dollars, you can store them at the bank or in your wallet. It’s pretty straightforward. But with digital currencies, there are a few wrinkles that you need to get your head around, but the idea is similar. Let’s take a look at how cryptocurrency storage works. You store your cryptocurrencies on the blockchain in a “wallet.” This is simply an address on the blockchain. It’s like how the website address tradingheroes.com directs you to my website, on the internet. Each wallet has a public address and a private address. The public address is the address that people send funds to. The private address is the “password” that you use to access and send your funds. Never expose your private key until you are ready to spend your funds, otherwise you will probably lose all the money in your wallet. Here’s an example from a Bitcoin paper wallet at https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/. Now that you understand the basics of cryptocurrency wallets, let’s look at the different wallet options out there. Here are the different ways that you can store your loot. Online wallet: This is probably the easiest way to store your money. But it is also the least secure. So it’s not a good long term storage solution, but it is fine for buying things and funding your trading accounts. Exchanges like Coinbase also have their own wallets built in.\nMobile wallet: You can download a mobile app like Mycelium at https://wallet.mycelium.com/index.html to store your spending money. It is more secure than an online wallet, but if your phone ever breaks or it gets hacked, everything in your wallet will be gone. Desktop wallet: Similar to a mobile app but just for desktop computers. Hardware device wallet: These are hardware devices at http://amzn.to/2qwtIP7 that are built especially for storing cryptocurrency keys. They are safer than the options above, but they are still susceptible to the things that can damage all electronic devices. Paper wallet: You can also store your private key on paper, like in the picture above. This is the most hacker proof, but it is also the least convenient. If you are going to go this route, be sure to store them in a safe place (like a safety deposit box) and don’t actually use paper. Use something like this at http://amzn.to/2sfPcAj to make sure that your money isn’t lost to something as simple as a spilled beer. Cryptocurrency Tracking Apps. Before I wrap it up, you will probably need an app to track cryptocurrency prices on your phone. So here are a couple of apps that might work for you. Blockfolio at https://blockfolio.com/. A simple app that allows you to add a watch list and add trades so you can track your portfolio, ala stock trading apps. The most useful thing about this app is that it displays all currencies on your watch list in the currency of your choice. Some apps insist on displaying the value in Bitcoin, which is annoying.\nCoincap at https://coincap.io/. This app allows you to display currencies by market capitalization, volume and other ranking factors. They also have cool charts. Very useful for seeing what is being actively traded. Also displays prices in your currency of choice. These apps are not for storing or trading currency. They are just to check the markets. What Can Affect the Price of a Cryptocurrency? There are many things that can affect the price of a cryptocurrency…sometimes very quickly. Here is what you need to be aware of when you trade cryptocurrencies. Of course, there is no guarantee that these things will move the market. But based on what we have seen so far. Exchange Listing. This is a big one. When Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase added Litecoin to their already limited list of cryptocurrencies that can be bought, they made it easily accessible to the average person. Their interface is the best I’ve seen so far. It makes it so easy for the non-technical person to buy Litecoin. Soon after the Coinbase launch (marked with the arrow, in the chart below), the price of Litecoin started to skyrocket and it has never looked back. Now, you might be thinking that this could simply be a coincidence. …and it could. But it is very, very likely that exposing Litecoin to Coinbase’s user base helped boost the price. So when a large exchange announces that they will start listing a cryptocurrency that you are trading, take notice.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-4/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn\n a Video Press Release to MyPR.\n–", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://wallet.mycelium.com/index.html", "http://amzn.to/2sfPcAj", "http://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-5/", "http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase", "http://amzn.to/2qwtIP7", "https://coincap.io/.", "https://blockfolio.com/.", "https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/.", "https://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-4/", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:11:30.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4379fc85c4d2c46fd2b0ab163d213e82ee0084b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZKQLiwkSSkHS1QXZjnOIbY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Mining , Is it worth it?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Mining , Is it worth it?", "published": "2018-05-24T16:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4379fc85c4d2c46fd2b0ab163d213e82ee0084b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZKQLiwkSSkHS1QXZjnOIbY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "poldanmig", "published": "2018-05-24T16:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Mining , Is it worth it?", "text": "Quote: from: joms123 on February 21, 2018, 12:49:02 PM Hello guys, I have a friend who told me about BITCOIN MINING.\nWhat do you think?

According to Kelly, the altcoin’s worth will skyrocket thanks to the development fund being reportedly set up by bitcoin cash miners . Comparatively Speaking: BTC, BCH, and XRP\nKelly continued , “You’re going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for bitcoin cash. That’s a place I want to buy.”\nEven though BCH is far from the all-time high valuation that it managed to achieve in December 2017, its current price of just over $1,100 is still significantly higher than the levels it was trading at just a month ago. CNBC also highlighted the altcoin’s performance over the past month and pointed out that other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple ( XRP ) had lost value since.\nWhile there is nothing inherently wrong with highlighting a particular digital currency, social media communities were quick to point out that personal profit rather than honest reporting may motivate Kelly’s position on the matter. The accusations against him was largely a by-product of his first personal involvement in the cryptocurrency industry in the form of NautilusCoin. Kelly Knows Controversy\nNautilusCoin was the brainchild of Kelly and aimed to be a “superior version of bitcoin” in 2015. Shortly after its release, a CNBC article highlighting the coin’s adoption by an island in Greece quickly went viral. The digital currency became an overnight success, going from a valuation of nothing to around 12 cents per token, resulting in a market capitalization of over half a million dollar. Ultimately, the public characterized the project to be little more than a “pump and dump,” leaving it with no value whatsoever.\nA blog post describing the scam-like nature of NautilusCoin stated, “Being a spawn of coingen.io means that NautilusCoin brings absolutely nothing new to the table. It’s nothing more than an awful clone that lacks everything that makes Bitcoin great – the huge network, the businesses and infrastructure built around it, and most importantly, the thousands of brilliant individuals that work on the codebase.”\nGiven Kelly’s past credentials then, it is perhaps surprising to note that he has made several appearances and statements on the Fast Money segment. CNBC credits Kelly as the “founder and CEO of BKCM , an investment firm focused on digital currencies,” but does not acknowledge his past endeavors.\nIt is perhaps worth noting that CNBC has had a somewhat notorious love-hate relationship with cryptocurrencies in general over the past few years. A Steemit post published in 2017 became rather popular after it highlighted the network’s negatively skewed bias towards the crypto market, even at a time when the industry was booming. Positive Vibes Unrealized\nIt is undeniable, however, that Kelly’s position at the network has helped paint a somewhat positive picture of crypto before the masses. In an interview held on April 13, 2018, with CNBC’s Trading Block , he said, “I think this technology is going to work, it’s going to be game changing, but it’s very early days, so we can have this massive volatility.”\nKelly’s statement on Bitcoin Cash comes only days after the Consensus 2018 event held at New York failed to stimulate the market. For the past few years, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have picked up significant momentum after the conference, presumably due to increased investor interest. This year, however, the market continued its declining trend in spite of the event.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cnbc.com/id/102815706", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/crypto-investor-brian-kelly-makes-the-case-for-bitcoin-cash.html", "http://cryptolife.net/scam-alert-nautiluscoin/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nautiluscoin/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oh98rDCP0U", "https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@hilarski/cnbc-is-a-bitcoin-fud-factory", "https://bitcoin.org/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/", "https://www.nycedc.com/event/consensus-2018", "http://bkcm.co/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T22:39:04.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5b100115f2d42412d5a35fb740556f4dc6e97f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYzPaAGRWM3zvZYxz1pPlxnlHLdxmNaWH.IclM8SQ49gfkSdqXo0hMQFayVc7FDrz.g--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "U.S. Congress Candidate Discourages Bitcoin FUD and Aims to Educate Public", "title_full": "U.S. Congress Candidate Discourages Bitcoin FUD and Aims to Educate Public", "published": "2018-05-24T16:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5b100115f2d42412d5a35fb740556f4dc6e97f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYzPaAGRWM3zvZYxz1pPlxnlHLdxmNaWH.IclM8SQ49gfkSdqXo0hMQFayVc7FDrz.g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T16:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Congress Candidate Discourages Bitcoin FUD and Aims to Educate Public", "text": "Cryptocurrencies have always been in the gray end of the regulation spectrum when discussed in American politics.

He represents a growing force of technologists who aims to tackle the anti-science sentiment under the Trump administration.\nAttacking the ad film made by Min, Forde said \"While his ad disparages a technology he clearly doesn't understand, the United Nations uses it to address human trafficking.\"\nForde cites the United Nations (UN) led project in Moldova , which uses blockchain based IDs to curb sex trafficking.\nThe post U.S. Congress Candidate Discourages Bitcoin FUD and Aims to Educate Public appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave min", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress candidate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ameri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:30:07.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c9420b0ccae5dcc0de8dbc893717582957a700d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__39oOeoDpaKgjS5a_WCDtcxB51dnoGKRb3LH1NSEYfEb6GEQdl7cl2HqdcbcLQ8pcfg--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Banishing The Bear: New Analysis Pinpoints Return To Bitcoin Bull Market", "title_full": "Banishing The Bear: New Analysis Pinpoints Return To Bitcoin Bull Market", "published": "2018-05-24T16:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c9420b0ccae5dcc0de8dbc893717582957a700d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__39oOeoDpaKgjS5a_WCDtcxB51dnoGKRb3LH1NSEYfEb6GEQdl7cl2HqdcbcLQ8pcfg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T16:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Banishing The Bear: New Analysis Pinpoints Return To Bitcoin Bull Market", "text": "Home » bitcoin » bitcoinist » crypto » news » Banishing The Bear: New Analysis Pinpoints Return To Bitcoin Bull Market Banishing The Bear: New Analysis Pinpoints Return To Bitcoin Bull Market bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nA group of cryptocurrency analysts has identified new market trends, signaling what they believe is the imminent end of the Bitcoin “bear market.” From Selling to Stocking Up\nIn a selection of charts uploaded to social media May 23rd, the group, known on Twitter as “The Crypto Fam,” determined BTC/USD was coming to the end of a three-cycle bearish phase which began in mid-December 2017.\nAccording to the findings, institutional investors were “clearly stocking up” on Bitcoin prior to the all-time highs seen at the time. They then began selling in waves, resulting in three peak-and-trough cycles, each less severe than the last.\nThe Crypto Fam writes:\nThe bear market has consisted of 3 major drives down, represented by black arrows in the chart below. We are currently in the midst of the 3rd drive down, awaiting a bottom. 1/ THE BITCOIN BEAR MARKET: A brief thread pic.twitter.com/1mOoYYIBHU\n— The Crypto Fam (@TheCryptoFam) May 23, 2018 ‘All Signs’ Suggest ‘Imminent End’\nThe comments come at a time when Bitcoin prices are dropping for a fourth time, losing 13% since May 20th to currently circle around $7400 on major exchanges.\nSources have attributed the lackluster performance of the cryptocurrency in 2018 to various factors, including Mt. Gox investor funds sell-offs , regulatory pressure, and even more institutional investors “waiting on the sidelines” for the perfect entry moment.\nFor The Crypto Fam, meanwhile, a definitive end to the trend is already in sight.\nAs each boom-and-bust is less pronounced in volume and volatility than the previous one, Bitcoin markets are moving from bearish to consolidatory, with new drops likely to be either insignificant or signal the start of new a buying phase.\nThe analysis by The Crypto Fam concludes:\nAll of these signs point to an imminent end to the trend. Bounces are not going as high, while bottoms are not as low. The black lines show this convergence. It is almost time for whales to begin accumulating their BTC again, rather than distributing/taking profits. 11/ All of these signs point to an imminent end to the trend.

Wall Street’s biggest Bitcoin bull praised the move as the start of needed regulatory oversight.\n“Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market,” Novogratz, who is setting up cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital LP, said in a telephone interview. “Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins,” he said, citing his own experience trying to trade.\n“We welcome any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors,” Winklevoss, president of the Gemini exchange, said in an emailed statement.\n“This is really welcome news ultimately because this means there is adult supervision coming/here,” Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Global Advisors, said in an email.\nThe world’s most valuable digital coin was down less than 1 percent as of 12 p.m. in New York, well off its lows for the day.\nBloomberg News first reported earlier Thursday that the DOJ opened a criminal probe into potential manipulation of the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, citing four people familiar with the matter. The investigation could shed light on whether reported trading volumes across exchanges are accurate, on whether traders use illegal practices to move prices in their favor and on other market irregularities.\nBitcoin fell as much as 4.3 percent to $7,267 after the news was published. The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure all year as regulators clamped down on the sector, in part because of the concerns raised in the DOJ investigation.\nSpencer Bogart of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital said he wouldn’t be surprised if regulators found cases of fraud, given even the most highly scrutinized markets haven’t been immune to it.\n“I don’t have any first-hand evidence of manipulation of Bitcoin prices but given that even the most highly regulated and most liquid markets in the world (e.g. Libor, FX markets, commodities) have consistently proven to be manipulated, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise,” Bogart said in an email.\nSome market participants have already alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Earlier this year trader Sylvain Ribes wrote a post on Medium where he said he believes more than $3 billion of all cryptoassets’ volume is fabricated, after analyzing exchanges’ order books. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders who have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nTrading volume for the total cryptocurrency market was at around $20 billion today, with Bitcoin accounting for about 30 percent of that, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThemis Trading LLC partner and co-head of equity trading Joseph Saluzzi said there should be cross-market surveillance in crypto markets to stop these practices.\n“The issue is that there is no one regulator monitoring the underlying exchanges and therefore there is no way to know if manipulation like spoofing is going on,” Saluzzi said in an email. “Some exchanges will say that they have information sharing agreements with each other, but again this is not enough to ensure that manipulation is not occurring. As we have seen in the equity market, exchanges are for-profit and can not be trusted to police themselves.” Thinking strategically and leveraging progress to anticipate what’s next Partner Insights", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galaxy digital lp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:22:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e1df8fe20af5262dd6a46b89acafea6fa6cafe5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwaez9tRfpoUmxJvWMzQZJe1GXtkEsabzrUcJNQiJDHMaf.2GS3d5kHwPv2GifkygtDWi0KTZ3oqOAJjio7WV2zUrmRgs8Ca8hNgaQ0lXYL0jCtEKYKQX6OBYq6ZsbPTtTrcqdbVPwzWA--", "site_full": "feedjunkie.com", "site": "feedjunkie.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/feedjunkie", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Feedjunkie.com", "title": "US Department of Justice is investigating Bitcoin price manipulation", "title_full": "US Department of Justice is investigating Bitcoin price manipulation", "published": "2018-05-24T16:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e1df8fe20af5262dd6a46b89acafea6fa6cafe5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwaez9tRfpoUmxJvWMzQZJe1GXtkEsabzrUcJNQiJDHMaf.2GS3d5kHwPv2GifkygtDWi0KTZ3oqOAJjio7WV2zUrmRgs8Ca8hNgaQ0lXYL0jCtEKYKQX6OBYq6ZsbPTtTrcqdbVPwzWA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Verge - All Posts", "published": "2018-05-24T16:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "US Department of Justice is investigating Bitcoin price manipulation", "text": "The Verge - All Posts US Department of Justice is investigating Bitcoin price manipulation Bitcoin has always been contentious, especially as prices of the decentralized currency rise and fall at rapid-fire rates.

Is Hungary ready to embrace Bitcoin and its counterparts?\nAfter last year’s OneCoin fiasco, it’s understandable that many Hungarians are quite wary of anything related to cryptocurrencies. At that time, and central bank warned locals about the dangers of trading within apparent pyramid schemes that issuers such as OneCoin had complete control over. This highly publicized investigation did a lot of good in that it made the public more aware of such schemes, but it also damaged the reputation of legitimate currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, the question is: Is that damage reversible?\nFor experienced traders and those in business, the answer is, of course, yes. Those who work within the financial and cryptocurrency sectors understand the controlled Ponzi schemes associated with trading OneCoin have little to do with real cryptocurrency trading. However, local business owners are a different matter. Those who trade with international customers, need to understand that to keep up with the pack, they must adapt to digital forms of payment. If not now, then soon. Yet they still feel that it’s dangerous and unchartered territory.\nAnd as far as the average person on the street is concerned, it’s even more difficult. In recent times, the only news relating to cryptocurrencies in Hungary was bad news. Warnings of scams and educational, journalistic pieces aimed at protecting the public were par for the course.\nSo, in effect, Bitcoin and the like need to start all over again with the Hungarian market, a market that is understandably wary of digital currencies.\nBut doubters of cryptocurrencies need only look as far as the poker industry to see how the blockchain can offer a more secure customer service that should be the envy of any banking institution. CoinPoker, for example, is a new start-up that has based its online poker platform on the relatively new technology and so far, things are looking up. A successful launch and even the chance to sponsor the Asian Poker Tour shows how much trust is being placed in this start-up. And while that trust is in part due to the reputation of its team and advisers, it’s mostly down to the transparency and security of its service.\nIf we are to convince the public here in Hungary that cryptocurrencies are indeed a secure method to both send and receive funds, then it’s essential that more local businesses adopt a similar strategy to CoinPoker. By adapting and learning to embrace this technology rather than fearing it, companies with a positive brand image in Hungary can instill a sense of trust and confidence in locals. And none could do this more so than the banks. If the nation’s leading financial institutions were to use blockchain-based technology and perhaps offer cryptocurrency services, it wouldn’t be too long before every company, business owner and the average person on the street would open their minds to the positive advantages of digital currencies.\nSo, in answer to our question on whether Hungary is ready to embrace Bitcoin, the answer is a simple not yet.\nWithout a doubt, cryptocurrencies have suffered a great deal in the wake of the OneCoin investigation and that there is much work to be done to restore faith in the industry. However, if Hungary wishes to encourage more foreign investment and overseas trade, they have no choice but to restore that faith.\nPhoto by Eivind Pederson, CC BY TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://pixabay.com/en/bitcoin-currency-cryptocurrency-3333541/", "https://medium.com/@CoinPoker/official-coinpoker-sponsors-asian-poker-tour-2018-e0831099e849", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en", "https://bbj.hu/business/hungarian-central-bank-steps-up-against-onecoin_132646"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "daily news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:07:47.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "663b1c1c6598e386323c83f979cbfdc2577d515d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfY4LrqtSUM5Ba0MZwJRbHDALFIc3AWcCnvey.AqfIRwmQtj5KoxsojOorXMxVTtSZqBpHu3SgYCuuyyeXC6XToc.XkY7KHWaZg--", "site_full": "www.coindesk.com", "site": "coindesk.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/CoinDesk", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "CoinDesk", "title": "German Stock Exchange Wants to Launch Bitcoin Products", "title_full": "German Stock Exchange Wants to Launch Bitcoin Products", "published": "2018-05-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_712614874.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10453, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 168, "comments": 0, "shares": 168}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "663b1c1c6598e386323c83f979cbfdc2577d515d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfY4LrqtSUM5Ba0MZwJRbHDALFIc3AWcCnvey.AqfIRwmQtj5KoxsojOorXMxVTtSZqBpHu3SgYCuuyyeXC6XToc.XkY7KHWaZg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sujha Sundararajan", "published": "2018-05-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "German Stock Exchange Wants to Launch Bitcoin Products", "text": "German Stock Exchange Wants to Launch Bitcoin Products NEWS May 24, 2018 at 13:00 UTC | Updated May 24, 2018 at 13:31 UTC\nDeutsche Boerse, owner of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is considering offering cryptocurrency products, according to a report.\nSpeaking at an industry event in London on Wednesday, Jeffrey Tessler, the firm's head of clients, products and core markets, said, \"We are deep at work with it.\"\nHowever, any move into the crypto space from the stock exchange may not be immediately forthcoming, with Bloomberg quoting Tessler as saying:\n\"Before we move forward with anything like bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn't the easiest thing to do.\"\nWhile CME Group and Cboe Global Markets both launched bitcoin futures trading last December, Tessler further said during the event that Deutsche Boerse is \"not at the same stage.\"\nThe firm, he said, is trying first to understand the volatility of the bitcoin market and making sure clients and regulators are \"in line\" before moving forward with any offerings, he added.\nWhile a move into offering bitcoin products is so far not certain, the exchange has already been active in the blockchain space.\nLast June, Deutsche Boerse revealed details to CoinDesk about its plan to move the majority of its post-trade services to a blockchain.

Americans now have a new reason to consider moving their money away from big banks to cryptocurrencies – the expected decision by banking regulators to water down the Volcker Rule, which restricts the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading with depositor funds. This according to the latest analysis by Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings. They explain that due to the rule changes, banks will now be able to gamble more freely in a scheme that gives them the quick profits but gives depositors the ultimate risks. In contrast, holders of cryptocurrencies are not exposed to those kinds of risks as they can control their money directly with no custody by third parties and no need to trust a central authority.\n\"With this rule change, the authorities will make it easier for megabanks to take big risks with other people's money. But they are making the change precisely when global debt levels imply record risks,\" the authors argue. \"In the future, cryptocurrencies will do such a fundamentally better job as a safe depository of funds it's difficult to envision a world in which this technology does not become a game-changer for money and banking.\"\nWhat do you think about today's news updates?

It was first traded on January 3rd, 2009. Bitcoin’s total supply is 17,051,487 coins. The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoin and the currency’s Github account can be viewed here . Bitcoin’s official message board is bitcointalk.org . Bitcoin’s official website is bitcoin.org . Bitcoin’s official Twitter account is @bitcoin and its Facebook page is accessible here .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be purchased on these cryptocurrency exchanges: DragonEX, Iquant, Bittrex, Livecoin, Huobi, CoinEgg, Exrates, Coinhub, Kraken, B2BX, LakeBTC, Poloniex, Cobinhood, Ethfinex, Bitstamp, Hotbit, Bitfinex, OEX, xBTCe, Luno, Gate.io, Tidex, CoinEx Market, Bibox, OTCBTC, CoinBene, Kucoin, Fisco, Quoine, IDAX, OKEx, BCEX, Bit-Z, TOPBTC, Fatbtc, EXX, BitForex, GDAX, CoinTiger, Exmo, BitMEX, RightBTC, BTCBOX, Lbank, Octaex, Bitbank, Simex, ZB.COM, HitBTC, Gemini, Upbit, Omicrex, bitFlyer, Neraex, Korbit, Sistemkoin, Zaif, fex, GOPAX, itBit, YoBit, Bitinka, OOOBTC, BtcTrade.im, Trade By Trade, Bithumb, Coinone, CoinsBank, CEX.IO, Coinrail, C2CX, Binance, WEX, BitBay, Coinsuper, Paribu, Coinroom, Negocie Coins and BTCC.

bitcoin wave", "text": "WHETHER it’s Donald Trump delivering ad hoc foreign policy in 140 characters or Kanye West sermonising his followers with a stream-of-consciousness rant to promote his new album, Twitter has enjoying a cultural revival in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, a United States judge ruled that it was against the law for President Trump to block people on the platform, the underlying sentiment being that Twitter has become so embedded in our society that it’s against the US Constitution for the President to not let people see his tweets.\nIt’s a rather bizarre state of affairs and the man responsible for overseeing the global online forum is Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey. And it’s certainly no easy task.\n“I think generally people want to engage in conversation that is enabling but we’ve let ourselves get the best of ourselves,” he told news.com.au in Sydney.\nHis company is undertaking a quixotic mission to diagnose the health of conversations taking place among its more than 328 million users to offer a potential remedy for improvement. He wants to build solutions akin to digital penicillin for the disease of disrespectful discourse.\nCAN YOU DETERMINE THE HEALTH OF A CONVERSATION?\nEarlier this year Mr Dorsey penned a Twitter message that he fixed to the top of his page, detailing how the company wanted to mitigate against the scourge of online harassment, bullying, hate speech, narrative manipulation and disinformation campaigns.\n“We didn’t fully predict or understand the real-world negative consequences,” he wrote about building such a public platform.\nTwitter gives anyone the chance to involve themselves in the discussion. You want to tell Elon Musk his latest idea is stupid? Go for it . You want to tell pop star Ariel Grande’s what you think about her latest breakup? Have at it .\nOnline forums like Twitter can bring out the best and worst in people and Mr Dorsey just wants to facilitate the best, all in the name of “holding ourselves accountable to progress,” he wrote.\n“We’re trying to determine what these indicators are of conversation health, so that we understand where we are, so we can understand if we’re making progress or not,” Mr Dorsey told news.com.au.\n“The belief, the principle underlying all that is if we can have respectful conversations, if we can have civil dialogue then society can progress rather than stand still.”\nmedia_camera Jack Dorsey and Twitter are undertaking a bold mission.\nAfter putting out the call to external companies to help in the quest to diagnose the health and productivity of conversations on the service, Twitter received about 230 submissions which it is currently reviewing.\nIt’s early days, but four indicators the company has identified as being important are shared attention, shared reality, variety of opinion, and receptivity.\nMr Dorsey said the one word that encapsulates Twitter is “open”. He doesn’t want to change that by governing dialogue, but believes the company has a responsibility to better understand the quality of it.\n“I think it’s our job to show a path towards health, (whether) people choose it or not.”\nTHE MANIPULATION EFFECT\nSocial media companies like Twitter and Facebook have been criticised for inadvertently devolving into siloed echo chambers which help to ferment partisan ideas and erode shared consensus.\nPart of that has been active attempts to corrupt online debate, or co-opt it for financial gain. The most publicised example has been Russian actors during the US presidential race using both troll farms and online bots to sway online debate.\nA paper released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US found that bots may have increased Trump’s vote in the 2016 election by 3.23 percentage points and the Brexit vote by 1.7 per cent.\n“Bots have a tangible effect on the tweeting activity of humans,” the researchers wrote . “Overall, our results suggest that the aggressive use of Twitter bots, coupled with the fragmentation of social media and the role of sentiment, could contribute to the vote outcomes.”\nBut Mr Dorsey says such research should be taken with a grain of salt.\n“I think some of the biggest challenge in some of that data is they don’t have a full picture, they only have the public information,” he said.\nTwitter challenges 8 million accounts a week if they’re suspected of being a bot and engaging in manipulative behaviour at a high frequency.\n“A lot of what people assume are bots are actually people. It’s easy to assume they’re bots but that’s actually not the case,” Mr Dorsey said. “Anything that we think is a bot and is engaging in behaviour that is manipulative, we challenge.”\nMany of Donald Trump’s followers are said to be bots but of course not all bots are created equal.\n“It’s dangerous to say all bots are bad, because they’re not. There’s a bunch of customer service bots, there’s a bunch of really useful automations on Twitter that people value,” Mr Dorsey said.\nON BLOCKCHAIN AND TAKING ON THE BANKS\nEarlier in his Australian tour this week, Mr Dorsey, 41, who now has a personal wealth of about $5.4 billion, was promoting the other company he started, called Square.\nThe company provides innovative point-of-sale and mobile payments services for small businesses and has recently added a slew of other tools covering invoicing, real-time data and inventory.\nmedia_camera Jack Dorsey company Square is disrupting the financial services with its payment platform.\nSquare was created in the wake of the global financial crisis as a way to give greater access to financial services for consumers and small businesses as it became clear that the financial services industry was ripe for disruption.\n“We started Square nine years ago during the financial crisis in the United States, so yes, we saw that people were not being included, they didn’t have access to the financial system and that was it,” he said.\n“So anything that we can do to provide more access to more people is our goal, independent of what the banks are doing.”\nPart of building a new payment platform - and integrating emerging technologies like popular cryptocurrency bitcoin - was to take advantage of the blockchain revolution that Mr Dorsey sees as an inevitability.\n“That’s the reason we did it, we want to learn as quickly as possible,” he said, referring to the plan to position Square to ride the crest of the cryptocurrency wave.\nHe believes it is inevitable that the internet will one day have its own native currency.\n“Look at what the internet has done in terms of decentralisation and what has been invented because of that. The internet is inherently global, it is inherently decentralised and trading of value is inherent to how we live,” he said.\n“So if a majority of what we do every single day is built upon this network that is global and inherently decentralised but it doesn’t have a value trading system, it will (soon) have a value trading system, and it’s not just information.”\nFor now, he’s tipping it to be bitcoin.\n“I think that native currency will be bitcoin — I don’t know,” he said. “I assume and know that the internet will have its own currency that is native to it.”\nHis admiration for bitcoin is hardly a surprise given that the ethos of decentralisation and egalitarianism that underpin bitcoin are not dissimilar to the ideas that Twitter was founded on.\n“I just love how the thing (bitcoin) was built and the philosophies behind it,” he said.\n Billionaire’s radical internet experiment\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nber.org/papers/w24631", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/13-russians-charged-for-meddling-in-us-election/news-story/664bbdadd22a5448a47527b42b021151", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/you-lost-your-credibility-a-long-time-ago-musks-idea-to-take-on-the-media-with-new-website/news-story/372b705cc0dd03301e97291b63279e00", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Billionaire%E2%80%99s%20radical%20internet%20experiment&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.heraldsun.com.au%2Ftechnology%2Fnews-story%2F6f4070548df71ef4e36d5a664768643b", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/jack-dorsey-on-the-unlikely-plan-to-measure-the-health-of-online-conversations-and-riding-the-crypto-wave/news-story/6f4070548df71ef4e36d5a664768643b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/78a857c3062524766b6aea1219ad1cfe?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/73fbf4a202d78be3efda929a07605bcd?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/toxic-relationship-ariana-grande-spills-details-on-shock-split/news-story/8df44dc2b12cd1a6cc17d177357bab0c", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135469303148773&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.heraldsun.com.au%2Ftechnology%2Fnews-story%2F6f4070548df71ef4e36d5a664768643b&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.heraldsun.com.au%2Ftechnology%2Fnews-story%2F6f4070548df71ef4e36d5a664768643b"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kanye west sermonisi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T02:40:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68a5f2214be2c15013afa6b6a23fecc91043dfd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOie9uMaDW_jvwP1yE9C_ZQCKm0urOSv93Bsgz9UBNGexl_uLQYgxY9z7U.INzxQ2DrBkJoysT7TBuFgaEarCXbriMXiLHD9MJdg--", "site_full": "www.freelancer.ie", "site": "freelancer.ie", "site_section": "https://www.freelancer.ie/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "Blockchain/Bitcoin/Crypto Accountants (Personal & Corporate)", "title_full": "Blockchain/Bitcoin/Crypto Accountants (Personal & Corporate)", "published": "2018-05-24T15:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68a5f2214be2c15013afa6b6a23fecc91043dfd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOie9uMaDW_jvwP1yE9C_ZQCKm0urOSv93Bsgz9UBNGexl_uLQYgxY9z7U.INzxQ2DrBkJoysT7TBuFgaEarCXbriMXiLHD9MJdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T15:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blockchain/Bitcoin/Crypto Accountants (Personal & Corporate)", "text": "Accounting Blockchain/Bitcoin/Crypto Accountants (Personal & Corporate)\nWe are launching a new crypto accounting firm in 2018 and are seeking to build a team of experienced personal and corporate accountants\nKnowledge of the space is preferred and experience is great, however as the space is very new, willingness to learn the space is paramount\nPLEASE DO NOT APPLY IF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE BLOCKCHAIN/CRYPTO SPACE\nSkills looked upon favourably:\n- Accounting knowledge (corporate and/or personal)\n- Project management skills\n- Ability to take charge and lead a project\n- Team management skills Offer to work on this job now!

Market manipulation has been an increasingly popular topic in crypto world – particularly since prices started their historic surge.\nLast summer, the SEC established the legal precedent that all digital tokens should be treated like legitimate securities and required them to be registered with the agency. Meanwhile, the CFTC, which is also working with the DOJ, declared bitcoin a commodity back in 2015, and is responsible for regulating bitcoin futures.\nInvestigators will likely look to bring charges against traders who engaged in spoofing – flooding the market with fake orders to push a price up or down depending on one’s position. Another illicit tactic that the DOJ is looking into is called wash trading, which is also prevalent in equity and futures markets. Wash traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume in an otherwise illiquid market.\nThe probe is reportedly focusing on bitcoin and ether, according to Bloomberg’s sources.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise – it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 – has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nGiven the pressure that the IRS has put on companies like Coinbase to turn over customer information, the DOJ investigation could also ensnare a few exchanges – particularly after the collapse of Mt Gox, the former Tokyo-based exchange has been liquidated after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its customers’ bitcoin.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the limited oversight of the crypto market (the same reason given by the SEC for rejecting a proposed rule change that would’ve cleared the way for an ETF) makes it vulnerable to fraud. And exchanges are increasingly realizing that if manipulation isn’t eliminated, or at least suppressed, that customers could start walking away from what they now believe to be a rigged market… then again, investors have stuck with stocks and bonds through every financial crisis in the history of modern, post-central bank “capitalism.”\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets. “There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThat said, good luck : determining who is manipulating prices and who has inside information would be next to impossible in the anonymous world of bitcoin, which is subject to different regulations in different markets. Japan and the Philippines have already developed their own legal framework for crypto markets.\nStudies have shown that 1,000 people own 40% of the bitcoin market. Given this naturally top-heavy concentration, it could be difficult for prosecutors to prove that there’s anything illegal going on when the largest players step up to trade.\nIronically, most of the recent “manipulation” has been to the detriment of bulls: for example, when the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee who has earned the nickname “the Tokyo Whale” for his ability to crash prices while unloading massive quantities of bitcoin decides to sell tens of thousands of bitcoins in a single block – crashing the price – is he manipulating the market?\nBut that doesn’t mean spoofing isn’t happening. For years, the twitter user @bitfinexed (who has since switched his account to private) has documented the work of “spoofy” ( who was also profiled here ) – a nickname he used for a group of traders who would place, and then cancel, large orders on different exchanges. He has also highlighted other shady behavior, like the Bitfinexed tether token, which is supposed to allow crypto traders to go from cash to coin more quickly. But we imagine – particularly as more institutions become exposed to the bitcoin market – that the Feds will investigate every scrap of potentially nefarious activity in due time.\nMeanwhile, we imagine crypto enthusiasts will be less than delighted at this news, with accusations that the US is turning into China set to emerge as crypto doomsayers claim the US government is finally making its move against bitcoin. 7:48 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-04-29/movement-tokyo-whale-wallet-hints-more-crypto-chaos-ahead", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe", "https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-24/doj-launches-criminal-probe-bitcoin-market-manipulation", "https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-06/mysterious-trader-nearly-unlimited-bankroll-said-be-manipulating-bitcoin-price"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:43:02.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb2c4eff878775ab96f9b3f44b73eda58c3dd69b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDwEeUGv6ok5nDojdw_GgSLVDKCubiLz8xTG0vGx6ejlCLijtHuExjXCKe2LxMDTeqxR8O1sExlWiI.oI79XKudKr2_KGu6vQ3YnSpAmPfrpMNZjyvNlba", "site_full": "www.watchlistnews.com", "site": "watchlistnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.watchlistnews.com//rss/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Watch List News", "title": "First Bitcoin Price Hits $0.0264 on Exchanges (BIT)", "title_full": "First Bitcoin Price Hits $0.0264 on Exchanges (BIT)", "published": "2018-05-24T15:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1323.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb2c4eff878775ab96f9b3f44b73eda58c3dd69b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDwEeUGv6ok5nDojdw_GgSLVDKCubiLz8xTG0vGx6ejlCLijtHuExjXCKe2LxMDTeqxR8O1sExlWiI.oI79XKudKr2_KGu6vQ3YnSpAmPfrpMNZjyvNlba", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nicole Kennedy", "published": "2018-05-24T15:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "First Bitcoin Price Hits $0.0264 on Exchanges (BIT)", "text": "Tweet\nFirst Bitcoin (CURRENCY:BIT) traded 10.3% higher against the U.S. dollar during the one day period ending at 8:00 AM Eastern on May 24th.

IJ works to slow the growth of government in the US in all its forms: economic freedom, education, private property, freedom of speech, not to mention amicus briefs to the Supreme Court. Now bitcoiners can help support IJ’s valuable work, a real world use case, through Bitpay and bitcoin cash (BCH).\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash Freedom, a Use Case for Bitcoin Cash\nThis year started very well for The Institute for Justice, a national law firm taking the terribly unsexy cases where government encroachment upon average folk goes largely unnoticed. The venerable Pineapple Fund donated to “only 58 charities so far selected to receive a grant,” including the IJ. In response to the January notice of receiving a grant, the Institute noted it would use the money to “help us defend and secure the rights of hundreds of thousands of people like those you will read about in this issue of Liberty & Law, protecting them from government abuse and enabling them to live as free and responsible individuals.”\nThe Pineapple Fund was a foundation of sorts lasting less than half a year. Started by a bitcoin core (BTC) whale, it garnered widespread praise in the cryptocurrency ecosystem for promoting the idea at least some of the recent years’ gains ought to be set aside for causes working for a brighter future. And it became yet another connection between crypto and the Institute for Justice. A Thirty Year History Meets Money’s Future\nIn fact, the IJ has come to terms with crypto payment provider Bitpay, allowing supporters to donate in bitcoin cash (BCH) as well. The higher fees and lag times of bitcoin core (BTC) made it less hospitable toward microtransactions such as lower-level giving. A hundred bucks worth here, twenty there, were simply eaten alive by transaction costs. A much better match, at the moment, is BCH for those very reasons. And all donations are tax deductible.\nSupporting work of the sort IJ does is something crypto enthusiasts can feel good about. A cursory gloss over the cases during their near 30 year history is proof enough. Eminent domain, whereby governments bully property owners into selling, or worse, under the rubric of the ‘greater good’ are causes rarely heard by other groups. IJ regularly fights them.\nCrypto fans are especially sensitive about the subject of licensing and certification, as they’re often frictions and barriers to entry into the polite, proper economy — something enthusiasts can empathize with. The IJ is a lone advocate in this regard, making sure those who wish to simply offer a nice meal or a haircut are protected from petty bureaucrats. The IJ is also keen on providing support for landmark cases via amicus briefs, as in the case of Carpenter v. United States . The Carpenter case deals with the 4th Amendment violations and may be instrumental towards the pending Ross Ulbricht Supreme Court petition as well.\nFor the BCH Gang, giving to important causes is yet another perk of decentralized cash. Groups such as EatBCH are “collecting bitcoin cash donations for the past few months and have been using the funds to purchase food and feed Venezuelans who are in need of assistance. Nearly every single day for over three months the group’s Twitter handle shows pictures of children and adults getting all kinds of food — and it’s all paid for with bitcoin cash,” these pages reported. The Institute for Justice is yet another use case.\nDo you donate crypto? Is it a good way to spread adoption?

A cyber-enigma with an enthusiastic following, it pops up in headlines and fuels endless media debate. You can apparently use it to buy anything from coffee to cars, yet few people seem to truly understand what it is. This raises the question: Why should anyone care about bitcoin? In \"The Age of Cryptocurrency,\" Wall Street journalists Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey deliver the definitive answer to this question. Cybermoney is poised to launch a revolution, one that could reinvent traditional financial and social structures while bringing the world s billions of \"unbanked\" individuals into a new global economy. Cryptocurrency holds the promise of a financial system without a middleman, one owned by the people who use it and one safeguarded from the devastation of a 2008-type crash. But bitcoin, the most famous of the cybermonies, carries a reputation for instability, wild fluctuation, and illicit business; some fear it has the power to eliminate jobs and to upend the concept of a nation-state. It implies, above all, monumental and wide-reaching change for better and for worse. But it is here to stay, and you ignore it at your peril.Vigna and Casey demystify cryptocurrency its origins, its function, and what you need to know to navigate a cyber-economy. The digital currency world will look very different from the paper currency world; \"The Age of Cryptocurrency\" will teach you how to be ready.\"Author : Paul Vigna", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael j. casey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global economic order", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T15:39:47.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea057f84c874a7f999db033b37d7dec28843348a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniCUa5zKAKtPTfec9VGCPV26YbAsCB7hLWE5QhFYo925UqS9aHQ4qxc8_bKAUmj0WEvGmLnrspo5Juose8kLH2.Yy3g3n3SAEvQ--", "site_full": "www.firstorderhistorians.com", "site": "firstorderhistorians.com", "site_section": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Alibaba founder: “Bitcoin is a bubble, the Blockchain is not”", "title_full": "Alibaba founder: “Bitcoin is a bubble, the Blockchain is not”", "published": "2018-05-24T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cddee4d1ec00e539137b52697e6e466c.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea057f84c874a7f999db033b37d7dec28843348a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniCUa5zKAKtPTfec9VGCPV26YbAsCB7hLWE5QhFYo925UqS9aHQ4qxc8_bKAUmj0WEvGmLnrspo5Juose8kLH2.Yy3g3n3SAEvQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Top News", "published": "2018-05-24T15:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Alibaba founder: “Bitcoin is a bubble, the Blockchain is not”", "text": "Bitcoin, Crypto currency, Blockchain Alibaba founder: “Bitcoin is a bubble, the Blockchain is not”\nThe world of crypto-currencies is for the most directly with the Blockchain technology. Jack Ma, billionaire and Chairman of the Board of the Chinese E-Commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding and a longtime critic of Bitcoin, contrary to the however, and says that he sees crypto-currencies are still skeptical, Blockchain technology, however, is a good thing.\nThe founder of Alibaba, says that he has an estimated personal wealth of 42 billion dollars, shared his comments on the 2. World Intelligence Conference in Tianjin.\nAfter Blockchain-technologies have been researched for years, came to Ma at the conclusion that Blockchain-technologies, data security and privacy issues can improve on all levels of society, for individuals, governments and companies.\nSince Alibaba reports in its most recent tax return sales of 39.9 billion dollars, and trade volume of several trillion, stressed Ma, that security for the E-Commerce business is a top priority.\nThe renowned Business Magnate argues that the real point of discussion should not take into account whether a digital currency is profitable; Instead, the focus should be on how useful and beneficial the product is for the Ecosystem.\nThis is to find out the enizige way, whether or not an investment makes sense or not. According to him, a large part of the attention, the Blockchain-technologies come from people in the industry see it only as a massive Gold-Mine.\nJack Ma was already during Bitcoin’s finest hour at the end of last year, critical. He announced his thoughts to the end of 2017 on CNBC Shanghai and said:\n“[About] Bitcoin, I don’t know much, even if it works, but it is very surprising that the rules for the global trading and financial system will be distorted completely. I don’t think we are ready for it. I pay attention to Alipay and how it is to the Euro and the US Dollar, but Bitcoin, we don’t want to pursue. We have a Team, the Blockchain is studied, but we do not focus on Bitcoin.“\nAlipay, which is Alibaba’s most popular mobile payment system and which is executed by Ant Financial, was recently, thanks to growing users in the headlines.\nIn a recently published press release, Ant Financial announced that it had, in the meantime, 622 million customers. Alipay, Ant Financials ‘ main-Zahlungsarm brings 520 million customers to the Website. Barclays is to bring to the end of the year 600 million customers.\nAnt Financial is ahead of many companies in one step, since the company has already integrated in the summer of 2016, the Blockchain technology in its business activities.\nThis step was created to improve the accountability and transparency of Chinese charities. Ant Financial has recruited the following year, Blockchain experts.\nDespite the fact that Alibaba holds the largest share of patents in connection with Blockchain, is entered the E-Commerce giant, in line with the Beliefs of Jack Ma in the case of the introduction of digital currencies on the brake.\nThe beginning of this year, the company had quashed rumors about his P2P-Node System, the information, that it was currencies of a Mining platform for Crypto.

Market manipulation has been an increasingly popular topic in crypto world - particularly since prices started their historic surge.\nLast summer, the SEC established the legal precedent that all digital tokens should be treated like legitimate securities and required them to be registered with the agency. Meanwhile, the CFTC, which is also working with the DOJ, declared bitcoin a commodity back in 2015, and is responsible for regulating bitcoin futures.\nInvestigators will likely look to bring charges against traders who engaged in spoofing - flooding the market with fake orders to push a price up or down depending on one's position. Another illicit tactic that the DOJ is looking into is called wash trading, which is also prevalent in equity and futures markets. Wash traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume in an otherwise illiquid market.\nThe probe is reportedly focusing on bitcoin and ether, according to Bloomberg's sources.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US's latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise - it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 - has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nGiven the pressure that the IRS has put on companies like Coinbase to turn over customer information, the DOJ investigation could also ensnare a few exchanges - particularly after the collapse of Mt Gox, the former Tokyo-based exchange has been liquidated after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its customers' bitcoin.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the limited oversight of the crypto market (the same reason given by the SEC for rejecting a proposed rule change that would've cleared the way for an ETF) makes it vulnerable to fraud. And exchanges are increasingly realizing that if manipulation isn't eliminated, or at least suppressed, that customers could start walking away from what they now believe to be a rigged market... then again, investors have stuck with stocks and bonds through every financial crisis in the history of modern, post-central bank \"capitalism.\"\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets. \"There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,\" Griffin said. \"It would be easy to spoof this market.\"\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThat said, good luck : determining who is manipulating prices and who has inside information would be next to impossible in the anonymous world of bitcoin, which is subject to different regulations in different markets. Japan and the Philippines have already developed their own legal framework for crypto markets.\nStudies have shown that 1,000 people own 40% of the bitcoin market. Given this naturally top-heavy concentration, it could be difficult for prosecutors to prove that there's anything illegal going on when the largest players step up to trade.\nIronically, most of the recent \"manipulation\" has been to the detriment of bulls: for example, when the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee who has earned the nickname \"the Tokyo Whale\" for his ability to crash prices while unloading massive quantities of bitcoin decides to sell tens of thousands of bitcoins in a single block - crashing the price - is he manipulating the market?\nBut that doesn't mean spoofing isn't happening. For years, the twitter user @bitfinexed (who has since switched his account to private) has documented the work of \"spoofy\" ( who was also profiled here ) - a nickname he used for a group of traders who would place, and then cancel, large orders on different exchanges. He has also highlighted other shady behavior, like the Bitfinexed tether token, which is supposed to allow crypto traders to go from cash to coin more quickly.
