For much of the fund’s history, that allocation was relatively stable in number of shares, and hovered between 6 percent and 10 percent of the portfolio, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin often led the list of top holdings in ARKK. Only one other ETF on the market offered parallel access to bitcoin ARKK’s internet-focused counterpart ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW).\nMore from ETF.com:\nThe next bond crash: An ETF story\nWhy I don’t use target date funds\nWorld’s cheapest ‘do good’ ETF\nBitcoin, accessed through the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), was a major driver behind both these funds’ returns last year. ARKK and ARKW were each up more than 87 percent in 2017. GBTC itself was up a whopping 1,550 percent.\nHere’s the ETFs’ rally last year, and that impressive rally relative to GBTC’s, in two charts:\nBut these ETFs’ big bet on bitcoin is no longer the case. In mid January of this year, ARK began trimming exposure to bitcoin in both funds, and today bitcoin represents only 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent in ARKK and ARKW, respectively. The cryptocurrency is almost a negligible allocation in these portfolios now.\nWhy? According to ARK, the “complicated decision” to dramatically trim bitcoin exposure was more driven by regulatory and tax-related concerns than by the “merits” of bitcoin itself.\nBut performance probably played a major role in this portfolio shift. Bitcoin as measured by GBTC rose dramatically in 2016 and in early 2017, and then began to fall later in the year. So far in 2018, GBTC has already dropped 37 percent, bringing its losses from its mid-December 2017 high to more than 63 percent in just five months. (ARKK and ARKW are each up about 15 percent year-to-date.)\nshow chapters\nEarly bitcoin investor reveals which cryptocurrencies he would HODL or FODL 21 Mins Ago | 10:16\nIt could very well be that ARK was simply taking profits on its bitcoin allocation earlier this year, and has been trimming that position since as bitcoin prices continue to struggle. If GBTC price performance did in fact motivate the move, any recovery in bitcoin prices could mean an increase in allocation down the road.\nFor now, however, given that the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve the launch of a bitcoin ETF many issuers have thrown their hats into that ring investors who want access to the cryptocurrency through an ETF wrapper have slim pickings at best.\nBy Cinthia Murphy, ETF.com.

Maybe you’re wrong about Bitcoin?”\nThis references his admission in a shareholders event that he was wrong about Google and Amazon, saying it was “stupidity” that held him back from investing in Amazon. On Google, he admitted that he made a mistake not buying the share years ago.\nThe blog post states:\n“Warren – you said two weeks ago during your annual shareholders event that you were wrong about Google and Amazon. You had a chance to invest and you didn’t because you didn’t fully understand them. Now you make public comments about Bitcoin, but how much time have you truly spent studying the industry?”\nGenesis spoke at large about legacy industry experts expressing negative views on emerging technologies, pointing out a pattern between an ‘expert’ speaking negatively about a technology that has a potential to disrupt markets.\nThey went on to say that the power that blockchain holds is that it lives forever. These statements made by the purported “Oracle of Omaha” will indeed live on forever in the blockchain for people to find.\nGenesis stated:\n“The world’s most famous investor will always be associated with being completely wrong about the most famous investment class and technology that we’ve seen in decades.”\nThey do clarify that this doesn’t necessarily mean that Buffett is ‘dumb’, only that a person of his position and stature in expertise is expected to take the time to understand something before speaking about it.\nThey finished the article by urging Buffett to take a second look at Bitcoin, as he was ‘dead wrong’ about it. They also said that time will tell him how wrong he was eventually, but on a much larger scale.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "omaha genesis mining", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T13:56:47.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21e94abee1e7e34c0ff3e4578e9078548067ad20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mEfmTr4kCaN1lxvdM0H35iPJB1Kw0h1awOzSwsRrHMRwe6fw9ahcC", "site_full": "www.latestnigeriannews.com", "site": "latestnigeriannews.com", "site_section": "http://www.latestnigeriannews.com/feed/allnews/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest Nigerian News Headlines", "title": "First Government Office in the US To Accept Bitcoin As Payment", "title_full": "First Government Office in the US To Accept Bitcoin As Payment", "published": "2018-05-20T07:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 36301, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21e94abee1e7e34c0ff3e4578e9078548067ad20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mEfmTr4kCaN1lxvdM0H35iPJB1Kw0h1awOzSwsRrHMRwe6fw9ahcC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-20T07:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "First Government Office in the US To Accept Bitcoin As Payment", "text": "First Government Office in the US To Accept Bitcoin As Payment Published by Slashdot on Sun, 20 May 2018 Long-time Slashdot reader SonicSpike quotes the Orlando Sentinel: If cash, check or credit card seems too old-fashioned, Seminole County, Florida Tax Collector Joel Greenberg said this week his office will begin accepting bitcoin as payment for new IDs, license plates and property taxes starting next month. Greenberg said accepting bitcoin and bitcoin cash as a payment method will promote transparency and accuracy in payment. \"There's no risk to the taxpayer,\" said Greenberg, who has often raised eyebrows since his 2016 election by moves including encouraging certain employees with concealed-weapons permits to carry a firearm openly as a security measure. \"Blockchain technology is the future of the whole financial industry.\" A spokesperson for a neighboring county's tax collector said they had no plans to follow the move. \"Frankly, I think the currency is so volatile that I don(TM)t think it makes sense.\" And an official at a nearby county said bitcoin payments were \"not on our to-do list\", adding that no one in the county had requested the ability to pay their taxes in bitcoin.Read more of this story at Slashdot.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/sNL6YlwQedY/first-government-office-in-the-us-to-accept-bitcoin-as-payment"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "slashdot", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joel greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "first government office", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "payment first government office", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "orlando sentinel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seminole county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T11:07:33.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72e93efc2cc8f015256b826376f88611f1f61875", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQLS7I2.b_lYMhW2nBmwHW0qH3F_zdpXcV.SvAqpGd5Y8ES.ALqi15bQ0duVcDnVBQ.cCuDHwUl8qdR9QhB91WKnjyuT4MtQu37aB0ysgAMxM-", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Cryptocurrency – 2+ GH/s Custom Bitcoin / Litecoin Mining Overview #HDFr", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency – 2+ GH/s Custom Bitcoin / Litecoin Mining Overview #HDFr", "published": "2018-05-20T07:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hqdefault-1429.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72e93efc2cc8f015256b826376f88611f1f61875", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQLS7I2.b_lYMhW2nBmwHW0qH3F_zdpXcV.SvAqpGd5Y8ES.ALqi15bQ0duVcDnVBQ.cCuDHwUl8qdR9QhB91WKnjyuT4MtQu37aB0ysgAMxM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Canadian Stock Trader", "published": "2018-05-20T07:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency – 2+ GH/s Custom Bitcoin / Litecoin Mining Overview #HDFr", "text": "”HDFr” brings to you new video about 2+ GH/s Custom Bitcoin / Litecoin Mining Overview from this month!\nDo not forget to Like and Subscription to videos others … Subscribe: http://bit.ly/2HEuUcS\nTips are appreciated and donated.

While there are plenty of bulls calling for 25,000 on Bitcoin by the end of the year, the honest answer is true chart technicians do not know if Bitcoin will breakout or breakdown just yet. Ultimately, crypto-currency investors need to wait for either a break above the consolidation trend line highs or lows. If it breaks out, it is likely headed to a double top at $20,000 within months. If it breaks down however, $4,000 is the target. As of now, a breakout would occur if price trades above $9,500, while a break down would occur if price trades below $7,000.

This is because of the news about the profits being accrued through trading in bitcoin. People who bought bitcoins five years ago, when they were hundreds of dollars in valuation, are reported to have made profits in the thousands of dollars. As a result of this jaw-dropping revelation, everybody wants a piece of the Bitcoin cake. As such, we would understand if you are asking whether you are too late to the Bitcoin train or you can still board it. However, to answer that question, there are some things you have to have in mind before venturing into the unknown waters that are Bitcoin.\nOne, you have to understand what Bitcoin is. Well, Bitcoin refers to the network or the payment system while bitcoin refers to the currency or the currency unit. Enough about grammar now. Bitcoin was the pioneer in established cryptocurrencies. It was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity is still unknown. It became open to the public in 2009. In 2011, the source code and domains were given to the Bitcoin community by Nakamoto. What all this goes to show you is that Bitcoin is a digital currency.\nThis means that there are no physical bills or coins with its name on it. Also, it is decentralized which means that no authority, government or financial institutions, control it. Another exciting fact is that the owners of bitcoins are anonymous and there is no information, say social security numbers, account numbers or names that can connect bitcoins to their respective owners. Furthermore, it incorporates blockchain technology as well as encryption keys which acts in connecting the buyers and the sellers.\nSecondly, you have to understand how one can get their hands-on bitcoins. There are two ways that you can acquire bitcoins. One, you can buy in the hope that its value will appreciate. Coinbase is a well-known bitcoin broker like Trade111 , but you can still find other places to buy. Once you’ve purchased, the next step is to secure the bitcoins as they are susceptible to thieves, scammers, and hackers. Bitcoins are secure in Bitcoin wallets, and many companies offer wallet services. Two, you can ‘mine’ the bitcoins. This is through powerful computers. The mining process involves a computer solving difficult mathematical problems which get harder as time progresses. Once a problem is solved, a block of Bitcoin is processed, and its miner receives a new Bitcoin. The miner then establishes a Bitcoin address where they can receive the bitcoins they mine. As of now, there are about 16 million bitcoins that have been mined while the total number of bitcoins is 21 million as capped by Nakamoto.\nWith that said, let us look at some of the reasons why you should invest in Bitcoin. One is that they are scarce as well as useful. As we mentioned earlier on, there are 21 million bitcoins as time progresses on, mining them becomes harder and harder. This then is an assurance that their price will keep on rocketing or will maintain an all-time high. Besides being scarce, they are also useful. This is because they provide for a monetary policy that is not only sound but also predictable. This is because one can easily see when new bitcoins are produced and the number of bitcoins that are in circulation.\nWith all these factors considered, the question remains, is it too late to get into Bitcoin? Well, it is hard to establish whether the price will keep on skyrocketing or the crypto bubble will burst and lead to loss of money like the internet bubble in the 90s. This is because its price remains volatile, depending on the news about it.\nIn conclusion, if you are looking to invest in Bitcoin, don’t put in more money than you can afford to lose. This will help shield you from sudden declines in prices in bitcoins.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/104804670768704679777", "https://twitter.com/Trade111_"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T00:17:32.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ffa3fba604ef6c8f5c3882fd6b7091dccc5365e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46sZwZ8rsqUJOH5h6A_O00fw--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=33", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Publicidad - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-20T06:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ffa3fba604ef6c8f5c3882fd6b7091dccc5365e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46sZwZ8rsqUJOH5h6A_O00fw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-20T06:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW revolutional soft for breaking any Captcha\n can solve\nReCaptcha , XEvil 4.0 + any SEO/SMM software = PROFIT! , HOT: programmers defeated ReCaptcha-3! , Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!\nReCaptcha-3 beta DEFEATED! , XEvil 4.0 allow to get Crypto-coins via Coin-crans , XEvil 4.0 + XRumer: NEW bypassing Recaptcha v.1,v.2,v.3 software :) , ReCaptcha-3 beta CRACKED!?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://emprendimiento.unach.edu.pe/index.php/forum/in-neque-arcu-vulputate-vitae/67524-xevil-4-0-beat-recaptcha-2#67608", "https://faraonibrahim.com/foro/index.php?topic=6250.new#new", "http://xrumersale.site/", "http://forum.astoria.amwp.ru/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1529", "http://fate-kaleido.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=68581", "http://ignis.ro-gaming.net/forum/index.php?topic=24085.new#new", "http://sktanam.com/forum/index.php?topic=292911.new#new", "http://head-forum.ru/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=2656", "http://XEvil.net/", "http://spro.tv/index.php?topic=10588.new#new"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T07:41:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfb6ce4722a3a083c908eef0e2e23b528d7024f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcCTYT2poEKzeGfUSoK.dR.PR2TjzrK1cwkWd9MO2ix85mHOpcQ_67pDnGpq2UmHf94H814Elm.mHN60b2tn1i6c-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "GiftCardGranny the largest seller of second hand gift cards should accept Bitcoin.

"In Bitcoin in Brief today, billionaire Warren Buffett has been reminded that he was wrong about Google and Amazon, and told he might be wrong about bitcoin, too. Billboards have appeared outside his office to convey the message of the crypto community. Also, a report suggests that the US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase may apply for a banking license. Some conflicting views on the future of the Internet and its money complete Saturday’s roundup.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation\n“Warren: Maybe You’re Wrong About Bitcoin?”\nBillionaire investor Warren Buffett, known for his negative attitude towards cryptocurrencies, has been targeted in a bitcoin advocacy campaign lead by one of the largest cloud mining companies. Genesis Mining has recently posted billboards in front of Buffett’s office reminding him that he was wrong about Google and Amazon, and telling him that he may very well be wrong about bitcoin, as well.\nThe initiative has received a lot of support from the crypto community on social media. Genesis co-founder Marco Krohn posted on Twitter photos of the message to the investment guru with a short note saying: “Some new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! ”\nEarlier this month, the American business magnate issued another warning in regards to bitcoin and the like. “Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad ending,” he said during the annual Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholder meeting, but he didn’t stop there. “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it but I would never short a dime’s worth,” he said, concluding that bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.” Needless to say, Buffett’s comments provoked reactions and even inspired new business ideas. A tokenized marketplace called Ecoinmerce has announced the “Rat Poison Squared clothing line.” Т-shirts and hats are already offered online, but one can also order a mug with the winged phrase.\nThe Money of the Internet and the Internet of Money\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey has recently reiterated his views about bitcoin. “The internet is going to have a native currency, so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen,” he said during a blockchain conference, adding: “I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.” Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter, wants his payment processing company to be at the forefront of the efforts to achieve adoption of cryptocurrencies as global means of payment. In an interview in March, he predicted that there will be a single world currency in the next ten years. The billionaire believes that will be bitcoin, although he admits the cryptocurrency is still slow and costly.\nCircle co-founder and President Sean Neville, however, has a different vision of what’s to come for the digital space and the digital currencies. “Very excited about the idea of reimagining what global finance can be,” he says that a dollar token is the future of the Internet of money. “One of the things that’s interesting for us is how we take fiat money and put in on blockchains, how do we get the benefits of a public blockchain infrastructure, which might underpin something like HTTPS of money,” he told Bloomberg .\nNeville thinks there is a problem with using existing crypto assets for payments and settlements – they are very volatile. “So, it makes sense to have something like the US dollar represented as a token that can transfer anywhere in the world, to any digital wallet and any exchange that can support it,” he explained. Sean Neville, whose company raised $110Mn USD in a fundraising round led by Chinese giant Bitmain , believes that “we need a replacement for SWIFT .” He also predicted that eventually everything of value will be tokenized in a “hybrid world” of centralized and decentralized services. Boston based Circle has announced plans to issue a dollar-backed cryptocurrency called USD-C.\nCoinbase May Apply for a Banking License\nBy attracting some serious investments, Circle has actually joined the club of the most well-funded cryptocurrency companies. Another of its members, Coinbase , seems tempted to expand its financial business to include banking services. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal , representatives of the crypto brokerage have met with US regulators to talk about the possibility to apply for a banking license.\nA source Quote: d by the WSJ has revealed, that the company, which operates the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, has contacted officials from the US Office of the Comptroller of Currency earlier this year to discuss the matter. Beside the opportunity to broaden the types of products it offers, a banking license would allow Coinbase to operate without the need to partner with banks.\nhttps://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-in...ed-by-billboards-coinbase-tempted-by-banking/ 2\n 20/05/18 12:10 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mkrohn5/status/996892758299303937?s=12", "https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-in-brief-monday-elon-musk-takes-on-bitcoin-bashing-warren-buffett/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/circle-raises-110mn-plans-to-launch-usd-backed-coin/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-remains-the-most-successful-and-important-company-in-the-crypto-industry/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/bitmain-opens-repair-center-russia/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-in-brief-friday-un-backs-crypto-solar-project-in-moldova-malta-uses-blockchain-in-public-transportation/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS", "https://news.bitcoin.com/warren-buffett-bitcoin-is-gambling-a-game-not-an-investment/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication", "https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-in-brief-saturday-warren-warned-by-billboards-coinbase-tempted-by-banking/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/twitter-square-ceo-bitcoin-worlds-currency/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T05:55:18.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84fac0e610c3908b262d93e224d035d6a5b70a98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWPbI86qO0u1ARLaIiWYHmg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "people criticizing Bitcoin", "title_full": "people criticizing Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-20T06:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "84fac0e610c3908b262d93e224d035d6a5b70a98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWPbI86qO0u1ARLaIiWYHmg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dificanovi", "published": "2018-05-20T06:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "people criticizing Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: kauban2018 on May 19, 2018, 11:23:16 AM\nHow come other people can easily judge Bitcoin like telling that Bitcoin won't last in a long period of time without knowing its capabilities and understanding the real function of it?\nthey say that bitcoin will not last long because the number of bitcoin in the whole world is small. every year lots of people lose their bitcoins and some people die so nobody knows the private key of his bitcoin wallet.\ntherefore the number of bitcoins annually decreases so they can criticize that bitcoin will not last long.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T03:08:46.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efc53ae9e9ba13261ecc98badf2527b855bf6ed2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT_WdBOLI2.uh01JJBAfkAY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Can bitcoin survive beggars?", "title_full": "Can bitcoin survive beggars?", "published": "2018-05-20T06:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efc53ae9e9ba13261ecc98badf2527b855bf6ed2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT_WdBOLI2.uh01JJBAfkAY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sir Legend", "published": "2018-05-20T06:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can bitcoin survive beggars?", "text": "Quote: from: lyledark10 on January 24, 2018, 11:22:47 AM I think it will happen if one who earn in bitcoin help them so that beggars can eat foods tricely.

It was a particularly choppy day for Bitcoin, which had endured 4 consecutive days of losses ahead of Friday’s open, with a start of the day intraday low and new swing lo $7,925 certainly not helping the cause.\nIn spite of the early tumble, holding above the day’s first major support level at $7,864.27 led to a break back through to $8,000 levels, with a 2nd rally through the afternoon seeing Bitcoin hit an intraday high $8,277.2 before a slight easing back through to the day’s ending $8,243.4.

Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today” data-reactid=”16″>Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 0.27% to $8,216.8, with Bitcoin managing to recover from an early morning dip to an intraday low $8,164.1.\nWith support and resistance levels left untested on Friday, the morning’s low held above the day’s first major support level at $8,019.87, with the morning’s $8,277.8 falling short of the day’s first major resistance level at $8,372.07, in what could be yet another day where Bitcoin fails to test major resistance levels, Bitcoin having last tested major resistance levels on Monday. For the day ahead, Bitcoin will need to move back through to $8,250 levels to support a run at $8,300 levels to bring the day’s first major resistance level at $8,372.07 into play, though the bulls will need to take control for Bitcoin to break through to $8,300 levels Failure to move through the morning’s $8,277.8 high to $8,300 levels will likely lead to another slide to reverse Friday’s gains, with the day’s first major support level at $8,019.87 a certain target for the Bitcoin bears, Bitcoin having managed to avoid closing at sub-$8,000 levels since 18th April.\nFor the bulls, a shift away from Friday’s start of the day swing lo $7,925 should provide some support, while side lined investors find little cause to jump back in, a roll out of regulations in key jurisdictions expected at any time. Current levels may look attractive, but when considering Bitcoin’s 2018 sub-$6,000 low that came off the back of heightened regulatory risk, there could more red to come in the coming weeks before the dust settles and the bulls take control.

Now, the PRC is the first country to come out with official government crypto rankings. Its China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) used three filters through which coins would be judged: innovation, technology, application. Rather surprisingly to some enthusiasts, bitcoin core (BTC) didn’t even crack the top ten, while bitcoin cash (BCH) almost didn’t make the list at all.\nAlso read: Alec Baldwin’s Lambo Movie Backed by Crypto Tech China Lists Ethereum as Best in Crypto Class\nIn what is either widely being referred to as a case of communist schizophrenia or a passive nod to the inevitable financial future, the PRC’s CCID released its first set of cryptocurrency rankings. China, of course, outright banned crypto in all its various forms, and the broader market was thought to have plummeted for a time as a result. That it is now publishing coin rankings is confusing to many observers.\nCN Ledger, a popular Twitter handle, was the first to expose the rankings to the outside world. Its author, Eric Zhao, explained how “most old-school experts haven’t followed the crypto space long enough to grasp some of the traits of tech and community that can’t be found elsewhere.”\nIndeed, this year found Weiss Ratings’ inaugural list of their rankings, as these pages reported. It too was very controversial. “The eagerly-anticipated report rates 74 of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, scoring them from A to D,” we wrote. “Such was the level of interest in the report, the company’s website was knocked offline as interest peaked on Wednesday morning. Weiss Ratings include some controversial scores for currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum that are sure to spark debate.” Then, as now, BTC ranked lower than Ethereum. Weiss spent a great deal of time defending their decision.\nMr. Zhao hoped the CCID effort signals a kind of new opening. “I believe at least it’s a sign that the officials are starting to treat crypto projects more like a neutral endeavour towards better technology and innovations, rather than just challenging the power and authority of banks and government,” he stressed. BTC Listed 13 of 28\nJust a week ago, the PRC ministry surprised enthusiasts with a press release announcing its Global Public Chain Assessment Index . “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide for government, enterprise and research institute,” news.Bitcoin.com quoted the government notice as stating.\nThe Center for Information Industry Development used three main criteria in scoring cryptocurrencies, though scant information exists about methodology. Application, innovation, technology were used to place 28 total cryptos and their respective blockchains (which the rankings, at least at first glance, weigh heavily).\nOf the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum ranked first, followed by bitcoin core (BTC) at number 13, ripple in the 17th spot, and bitcoin cash (BCH) lagging well behind them all at the lowly number 25 of 28. For the CCID, however, the top five cryptos to their liking include ether, steem, lisk, neo, komodo. For those who worry about such rankings, PRC appears to, again, value blockchains over currencies – a common refrain heard in the Western corporate world. If, alternatively, one were to assess various cryptocurrencies according to their efficacy as mediums of exchange, BCH and BTC would likely rank quite high, and could be considered a most obvious threat to a regime bent on control. Whatever the case, cracks do happen inside the communist stronghold: quite a few crypto tech related patents are owned by China, its central bank has openly mused about state-backed crypto, and, of course, its burgeoning video game industry is very bullish on tokens and distributed ledgers. And just announced , “The most popular stock trading app in China, Straight Flush (同花顺), now adds support for showing the price of Crypto-Currencies.”\nDid you think China’s rankings will have any real impact?

Bitcoin? Blockchain? A Information To Digital Currency", "text": "by Lonna Kell on 6 minutes ago 3 views We waves crypto at e-chat the moment are launching our bounty campaign for our ICO. Here is how an ICO sometimes works: A brand new cryptocurrency is created on a protocol equivalent to Counterparty , Ethereum , or Openledger , and a price is arbitrarily decided by the startup crew behind the ICO primarily based on what they assume the community is price at its current stage. ICO is at all times scam because those providing it purchase into it themselves to fool you so you think there can be high demand - and when shopping for their own ico they get to keep the coins they purchase from their very own providing PLUS the bitcoin and they will dump those extra cash on you later too. 5 Below Half IV of the SFO, an issue of providing paperwork of a collective investment scheme to the public of Hong Kong is subject to authorisation by bitcoin talk the SFC until an exemption applies. It is effectively a Kickstarter campaign that uses blockchain-based mostly \"tokens\" (aka app cash, cryptocurrencies, digital belongings) to raise money. Since you'll be able to't stuff quarters right into a blockchain, Brave created a unit of exchange that it dubbed a Fundamental Consideration Token, or BAT, which is a digital forex issued by the company.AIO's tokens are at the moment being distributed by way of an Preliminary Coin Providing (ICO) that will, at press time, last for little over twenty extra days. Your level 5 although means there would nonetheless be some liability because the tokens\" can be exchanged at a later date for other property as well as used to pay for companies in our ecosystem. They usually can use ICOs to promote tokens to individuals all in favour of using the brand new service when it launches, or in speculating as to the future value of the service. Personally, I think it will not be lengthy till many corporations switch to utilizing tokens as a way of fundraising previous to their IPO (initial Public Providing) just like how Pebble famously raised thousands and thousands via Kickstarter crowdfunding thrice before it was acquired by FitBit It's a house to look at however I recommend that you simply get your toes wet with trading bitcoin and ethereum should you're completely new to the sport. Ripple's XRP, the cryptocurrency that many critics hail will observe the footsteps of Bitcoin, is also likely to expertise a worth surge within the close to future. This type of token has had some investors on the fence, because it has been eyed by the Securities and Change Commission for some time however as of yet, they have not decided on if this model of ICO falls below their jurisdiction. NOTES: Not every ICO uses the ethereum blockchain, however KIK's KIN and Unikrn's UnikoinGold do, this walkthrough assumes you are shopping for into an ICO that makes use of the ethereum blockchain. Rather of inventory, in an ICO a enterprise sells a wide range of cryptocurrency tokens. Ultimately, it is exhausting to think about regulators sitting on the aspect traces when contemplating cryptocurrency valuations, the rising number of ICOs and the inherent risks related to investing in begin ups in this method and the way both traders and the businesses respond to the magnifying glass of regulators will probably decide the destiny of ICOs, which for now are in a position to increase sizeable sums because of the inflated valuation of cryptocurrencies equivalent to Bitcoin and Ether. Final Friday the US regulator gave the CME group and CBOE Global Markets the green mild to launch bitcoin futures.

LTC also will be able to use the lightning network and has the advantage of being known as bitcoin lite since it literally is exactly that.\nneo has practically no adoption outside of the crypto space\nzcash is interesting and i could see having a very bright future. it's growth in the past year is noteworthy. part of that i suspect is due to the easy of GPU mining which brings and more people to it. if they allow that z9 from bitmain to mine it, well, it's hard to say how that will go\ni'm also not sure if everyone grasps what litecoin being the next bitcoin really means. litecoin in theory should be worth roughly 25% of bitcoin if it receives the same level of adoption. another next step should be trading pairs. right now BTC is the world reserve currency of crypto and ETH is hot on it's heels. for litecoin to take the #3 spot which i personally could see happening it needs to accomplish all of these things.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T02:57:16.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5e0c00665d876f63a457fcd8315591eef155ef4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYuQ5IFYIwwRG05b5jUejZ6NLwAdk8xzOEOQjODyFd9jTqDt2xJH95ERYMZgIeXwycZyGfhF9R9Ltj1FtwkGTHjuB1Jma4keIXN9Aiz7owjuNgWA9on2C_Swc.H4p.y0Nz5C4Kh2tsOaUjaPdoqvdeljbW0k9.IUgN3kk2nio336Ow--", "site_full": "jazzmozaiek.be", "site": "jazzmozaiek.be", "site_section": "http://jazzmozaiek.be/feed", "site_categories": ["music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Jazzmozaïek", "title": "BitCoin payment Is Available.

Thus there is no customer support number for bitcoin, like you may be used to with your bank, credit card, etc.\nNote that even though bitcoin itself is not run by a business, there are businesses that operate within the bitcoin ecosystem. For customer support regarding those businesses, you'll need to contact them directly.\nBut for general bitcoin questions, you're in the right place to ask for support regarding your problems. Just like bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency where no particular person is in charge, its 'support team' is also decentralized and scattered across the world. I put 'support team' in quotations because the participants of this Stack Exchange site are not employees of bitcoin or Stack Exchange, instead, they are here of their own accord, volunteering their time and knowledge to help others. There are many users here with a great knowledge regarding cryptocurrencies, so if you ask a good question, you will likely receive a great reply.\nYou could elaborate on your problem a bit for a better response. Where did you do the transaction? Did you pay the miner fees? Did your wallet software give any response? Were you trading/transacting on an exchange? The transaction id ( TXID ) Did your transaction make it to the memory pool ( mempool )?\nI see that you're new to StackExchange.\nPlease edit your question for some significant help.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "stack exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T07:11:42.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc4a77defb7ab70f54dbda89139bef2d8359ce72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaQdK0GYa6bKQwJ2QZ.Xj.0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Best way to earn bitcoin ?", "title_full": "Best way to earn bitcoin ?", "published": "2018-05-20T04:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc4a77defb7ab70f54dbda89139bef2d8359ce72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaQdK0GYa6bKQwJ2QZ.Xj.0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dancingnancy", "published": "2018-05-20T04:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best way to earn bitcoin ?", "text": "Quote: from: huntingbtc5 on May 19, 2018, 10:45:34 AM What is the best method for earning bitcoin ?

There are people who are looking to ride the highs and make money speculating on different coins. And there are people who truly believe in Bitcoin and the blockchain, and look forward to seeing a time when digital currencies replace dollars and euros for making transactions. Each group behaves in different ways. In fact, they behave in opposite ways. When the price drops, speculators rush to sell. They worry that any fall could be the moment the bubble bursts so they offload much of their Bitcoins, and push the price down further. They also lose money. For true believers those falls are an opportunity. They might not know what price Bitcoin will reach when it stabilizes, but they do expect it to last. They know that Bitcoin won’t disappear so they buy when the price drops. When the coin rises again, they’ll either be able to turn a profit or they’ll know that they’ll have saved money when they’re ready to spend. True believers also use Bitcoin. They don’t just hodl. They look for ways to accept Bitcoins in their businesses. They use cryptocurrency payment APIs to add Bitcoin payments to their websites. Even if they convert the coins back to fiat as soon as they receive them to ensure stability, each payment is a thumbs-up for the future of Bitcoin. And true believers look beyond the price of a cryptocurrency. They look at what it’s for. Cryptocurrencies aren’t created to make money for speculators. They’re launched to support businesses or services. They provide a way for companies to track movements of money or goods. They’re a tool for increasing security and reducing fraud. Speculators bought Ripple, pushing up its price and increasing demand for more purchases. But true believers understood that the bank transfers that Ripple was created to enable didn’t need the cryptocurrency. They needed the blockchain infrastructure beneath it, but it was always possible for banks to make faster and cheaper international transfers using a blockchain without using Ripple. Those who understood how Ripple worked stayed away. Speculators who looked only at the candlesticks in the graph searched for patterns and made losses. That means believing in Bitcoin and the blockchain won’t just prepare you for a future in which digital currencies are regularly used across the Web. They’ll also make you a better speculator. When you believe in cryptocurrencies, you want to know exactly what each coin does. When you can’t wait for the day Bitcoin stabilizes and is universally accepted, you hold through the falls and buy in the dips. When you recognize what the blockchain will do for businesses, you look for ways to install it in your own business before your competitor does. There are plenty of differences between cryptocurrency speculators and true Bitcoin believers but there’s one that stands out the most: true believers are much better placed for the cryptocurrency revolution.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://inc.com/joel-comm/your-business-can-accept-bitcoin-right-now.html", "http://inc.com/joel-comm/5-cryptocurrency-pioneers-who-should-be-as-famous-as-mark-zuckerberg.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T21:49:22.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4bfa5cfb8bc0930400e6c5898240eb893e4d9993", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgOlCH9rIX5dmqfBwTtIwCH.Pz7CYxYdGDTZ36kZLq1_iuZ3SppYc8EE3TDZ9llJ8olmee1FrLpv5euJ4uytbfS9LqPgxQ5feXJh4_h76OiFY-", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Tom Lee Explains Why Consensus Failed to Spark the Bitcoin Rally", "title_full": "Tom Lee Explains Why Consensus Failed to Spark the Bitcoin Rally", "published": "2018-05-20T04:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4bfa5cfb8bc0930400e6c5898240eb893e4d9993", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgOlCH9rIX5dmqfBwTtIwCH.Pz7CYxYdGDTZ36kZLq1_iuZ3SppYc8EE3TDZ9llJ8olmee1FrLpv5euJ4uytbfS9LqPgxQ5feXJh4_h76OiFY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-20T04:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tom Lee Explains Why Consensus Failed to Spark the Bitcoin Rally", "text": "Osato Avan-Nomayo · May 19, 2018 · 6:00 pm Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global is standing by his $25K end-of-year Bitcoin price despite the failure of Consensus to cause the much-anticipated crypto price rally.

According to local media, the state is currently considering a draft proposal concerning crypto donations for political campaigns. Colorado is Joining the Trend\nWayne Williams, the Colorado Secretary of State, submitted the proposal earlier in the week. According to the details of the draft, Bitcoin donations would comply with the same rules as cash donations. Due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the value of such donations are determined at the time of the contribution. Wayne Williams, Colorado Secretary of State\nCommenting on the move, Suzanne Staiert, the Deputy Secretary of State, said:\nThe FEC is doing it now, so we are just going along for the ride.\nWith the move under consideration, the state government welcomes comments from the general public. Interested persons can contact the office of the Colorado Secretary of State on or before May 23rd. Bitcoin in Politics\nDonations are an integral part of the American political landscape and sometimes play a profound role in shaping policy developments. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies indeed play a significant role in the political campaign fundraising arena.\nSince the Federal Election Commission approved cryptocurrency contributions to campaign financing in 2014, its use has increased considerably. The FEC’s decision categorized such contributions as “in-kind donations.” New Hampshire was the first to jump on the trend back in 2014 when Republican Andrew Hemingway became the first U.S. politician to accept Bitcoin contributions.\nRand Paul also accepted crypto donations during his 2016 presidential bid. To date, the largest reported crypto donation to a political campaign is the 0.284 BTC ($4,500) received by Austin Petersen from Missouri. Presently, Congressional hopeful Patrick Nelson from New York is accepting Bitcoin donations to his campaign via Bitpay.\nThere are those who oppose the adoption of crypto contributions in campaign fundraising. Issues arising from anonymity and the risk of “dirty money” being funneled into politics are top of the list of objections against the trend. The lack of full transparency in crypto transactions seems for some to be at odds with the philosophy of political donations in America. There is also the problem of volatility which makes cryptos an enormous accounting headache.

Instead of just sitting on the cryptocurrency and hoping it appreciates, the LedgerX Savings product lets investors&a;mdash;or savers as the case may be&a;mdash;do what&a;rsquo;s called a call overwrite.\nThe investing technique, where a person deposits bitcoin to LedgerX then sells a call option at a slightly longer date, with a higher strike call option, has proved to be one of the New York City-based startups most popular services using the existing options service. Related: Best Stocks To Buy For 2018\nBut with the new savings product, that process is reduced to its most basic point-and-click functionality, designed in part to make it easier for less sophisticated bitcoin bulls to potentially receive a premium in U.S. dollars for selling the option.\nAs the CFTC looks to take a more &l;a href=&q;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cftc-bitcoin/u-s-cftc-sues-three-virtual-currency-operators-for-fraud-idUSKBN1F81K9&q; target=&q;_blank&q; rel=&q;noopener noreferrer&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;aggressive&l;/a&g; stance toward some unlicensed bitcoin companies, the LedgerX &l;a href=&q;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cftc-bitcoin/u-s-cftc-sues-three-virtual-currency-operators-for-fraud-idUSKBN1F81K9&q; target=&q;_blank&q; rel=&q;noopener noreferrer&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;product&l;/a&g; that requires both a CFTC derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license and a swap execution facility (SEF) license signals an increasing level of sophistication being offered to bitcoin users. Related: Top Stocks To Buy For 2018\n&a;ldquo;Everything we do requires both the licenses,&q; said Chou in an interview at her New York City headquarters. &q;And a lot of that is intentional, because by making it a package deal we can offer a number of services to our customers in a really clear, vertically integrated way.&a;rdquo;\nThe new savings interface lets a user select the implied rate he or she is looking to earn&a;nbsp;and the number of bitcoins&a;nbsp;he or she hopes to earn the yield on and then submit it to the same LedgerX matching engine that powers the existing bitcoin options product.\n&l;!–nextpage–&g;\nThe options contracts will initially be offered for transactions over a three-month duration and a six-month duration, and LedgerX is charging a transaction fee for each service.\nChou expects to see high volumes on this product, as it was designed to serve&a;nbsp;the use-patterns of LedgerX&a;rsquo;s existing customers. She estimates that more than half the company&a;rsquo;s volume comes from using similar techniques, but following a much more complicated workflow. Related: Best Stocks To Buy For April 2017\nOver the past three months, LedgerX has averaged $30 million in notional transactions per month, with an average trade size is $60,000, she said. Seventy percent of that volume comes from options, with the rest&a;nbsp;being swaps.\nIn a potential sign the bitcoin users are looking for more advanced ways to both place long bets and short the cryptocurrency, which is currently valued at $149 billion, Chou says 20% of the company&a;rsquo;s volume since it launched has been generated in the past three weeks. However, over that same period, the price of bitcoin has dropped by 5% percent, from $9,191 on April 24 to $8,715 today. At its peak price last year, a bitcoin was trading for nearly $20,000.\nWhile Chou says it is exactly this volatility that makes the call overwrite such a potentially attractive investment opportunity, she acknowledges the unpredictability might not be attractive to everyone.\n&a;ldquo;This interface will definitely be skewed to the long bitcoin holders,&a;rdquo; she said, &a;ldquo;who will likely only deposit bitcoin and who will want to earn interest off of that bitcoin.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.top5stocks.com/best-stocks-to-buy-for-2018.html", "http://www.top5stocks.com/top-stocks-to-buy-for-2018.html", "http://www.top5stocks.com/best-stocks-to-buy-for-april-2017.html", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cftc-bitcoin/u-s-cftc-sues-three-virtual-currency-operators-for-fraud-idUSKBN1F81K9&q;"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fidelity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center on budget and policy priorities", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T04:15:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39cca99a64034da70268956d71d16aa29ea3f35d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ467xJKEGkCjBkzuBkABoR3mA--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=8", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Phython - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-20T03:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39cca99a64034da70268956d71d16aa29ea3f35d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ467xJKEGkCjBkzuBkABoR3mA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-20T03:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Coin-crans", "text": " soft for breaking any Captcha\n can bypass more\nyii2 antigate componentearn money by captcha , ReCaptcha-2 BROKEN!?

According to him, the technology behind bitcoin is capable of so much more than it is being used for today. Jack Ma becomes the latest influential figure in the business world to call bitcoin a bubble.\nJack Ma. Source: CNBC\nInterested in Blockchain and not Bitcoin The Alibaba founder revealed that his company is heavily invested in blockchain research. He also went on to say:\n\"Blockchain is now a hot word. First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era.\"\nAccording to Ma, Alibaba believes that there is enormous potential for blockchain application in several areas of the company's business. The e-commerce giant has been researching on blockchain-based solutions with a focus on data security and privacy protocols. The company is also investing in the technology as it reportedly owns the highest number of blockchain technology patents in the world.\nDespite the considerable promise that blockchain holds, Ma is disappointed with the general profit-making narrative that pervades the industry. Speaking during the conference, he bemoaned the fact that many stakeholders seem to view blockchain as a money-making tool rather than a value creation technology. He condemned those who make blockchain to be a \"huge gold mine\" at the expense of leveraging the technology to improve upon the global business process.\nSo far, Alibaba has implemented some blockchain-based protocols in its business. The company plans to utilize blockchain tech in for public welfare and e-commerce applications. Alibaba signed a partnership with PwC in 2017 to research ways of leveraging the technology in creating a robust food traceability framework to combat counterfeit food products. The previous year, the company launched the first ever blockchain-based email repository service.\nBusiness Elites Believe Bitcoin is a Bubble Jack Ma also spoke about bitcoin , the number cryptocurrency in the world. Ma's attitude to bitcoin seems to be one of disinterest even going as far as to call it a bubble. This declaration of his is a marked departure from earliest comments where he expressed the fact that he had little knowledge of bitcoin. In the past, he also said that he prefers to focus on blockchain as it shows more potential for development than bitcoin.\nBy calling bitcoin a bubble, Ma has joined the ranks of Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Charlie Munger and several other business moguls who in the bitcoin bashing brigade. Warren Buffett has previously labeled bitcoin as \" rat poison square ,\" \" speculation ,\" and \"lacking any intrinsic value.\" Bill Gates recently declared that he would \"short bitcoin\" if he could. Charles Munger, the second-in-command to Buffett, called bitcoin a \" noxious poison .\"\nThe post Bitcoin, Not Blockchain, is a Bubble Says Alibaba Founder appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc interested", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tianjin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T03:54:46.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8bba8f31926b232f882abfa09ee21232c8269b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmajUVVNq0oEr6wYnaDgxiWM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?", "published": "2018-05-20T03:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8bba8f31926b232f882abfa09ee21232c8269b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmajUVVNq0oEr6wYnaDgxiWM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Antonina", "published": "2018-05-20T03:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?", "text": "In this situation, I would do a couple things, first, I would remind your friend that the \"Ponzi scheme\" was actually executed with the currency fiat, and not with the crypto currency.

There is so much potential on what can be accomplished with blockchain technology that it would be awesome to see a generation ready to take the challenge (similar to what happened with the internet).\nHaving it as an elective would be wonderful! Sadly not many people would probably take it. I know that if not enough people take a class it doesn't run which usually takes around twenty students. So it would be a rare class to get into probably which really sucks. I know apparently some schools have had Bitcoin / crypto currency clubs that students made themselves and registered with the school.
