In an interview with CNBC, Mr Pinto had this to say when asked about Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies:\nWe are looking into that space. I have no doubt that in one way or another, the technology will play a role. [Regarding bitcoin], you cannot have something where the business proposition is to be anonymous and to be the currency for unknown activities. That will have a very short life, because people will stop believing in it, or the regulators will kill it. I think the concept is valid, you have many central banks looking into. The tokenization of the economy, for me, is real. Cryptocurrencies are real but not in the current form.\nHe also remarked about the current trend of Wallstreet firms offering Futures products on Bitcoin and other prominent cryptocurrencies:\nIf we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No\nMr. Pinto’s comments came almost 6 months after Jamie Dimon had slammed Bitcoin by calling it a fraud. Mr. Dimon had further declared that his firm was willing to fire any employee willing to trade Bitcoin for it was a stupid act. He would later backpedal on his comments to the delight of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who in turn predicted that it would only be a matter of time before he sees the benefits of the crypto and blockchain industry.\nJ.P Morgan Chase has done just that when it filed for a blockchain patent back in October. The news was not unveiled until earlier this month. The patent outlines a system that would essentially use distributed ledger technology – blockchain – to keep track of payments sent between financial institutions.\nIn a nutshell, ‘big’ Wallstreet firms have finally seen the light and are in the process of investing in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\n[Photo source, money.cnn.com]\nThe post J.P Morgan Chase ‘Looking Into’ Bitcoin (BTC), Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies appeared first on Ethereum World News.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jamie dim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel pinto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.p morgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wallstreet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:41:27.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d20a730e7909df2d682a8d5dbd82d9cf0ab616f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQrhiEHi9Go1ZMGIZVzPvT5sW1bfZyrmfIH2c45v7XHR.kn3C4SamRop10vV7MmlMlLWANkE16hCCfUOeCbpeHuJ0iTogZ5G1Fk1qgSAkSQkA--", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin And Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential In a Decade", "title_full": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin And Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential In a Decade", "published": "2018-05-17T12:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d20a730e7909df2d682a8d5dbd82d9cf0ab616f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQrhiEHi9Go1ZMGIZVzPvT5sW1bfZyrmfIH2c45v7XHR.kn3C4SamRop10vV7MmlMlLWANkE16hCCfUOeCbpeHuJ0iTogZ5G1Fk1qgSAkSQkA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-17T12:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin And Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential In a Decade", "text": "Webmaster Tools Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

Get WIRED’s daily briefing in your inbox. Sign up here 1. Study: Bitcoin is on course to consume as much energy as Austria by 2019 New research into the energy consumption of bitcoin indicates that, by the end of the year, the cryptocurrency could account for 0.5 per cent of the world’s energy demand: 7.67 gigawatts, roughly the same as that consumed by Austria (Motherboard). Financial economist Alex de Vries’s conservative estimates, based on the energy consumption of the most efficient bitcoin miner available, show that the bitcoin network currently consumes at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity – as much as Ireland. But the miner network is growing at an extremely fast rate. Bitcoin’s value and the energy required to mine it both change over time, but on March 16, about 60 percent of the bitcoin value produced by a miner was spent on electricity and de Vries anticipates that when the network reaches 7.67 gigawatts, it will hit a point of equilibrium, where miners are only able to break even. 2. Mark Zuckerberg to meet with European Parliament Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will meet with leading members of the European Parliament to discuss data privacy concerns ahead of GDPR coming into force (BBC News). A date has yet to be set for the meeting, but it’s most likely to take place next week. Zuckerberg is also scheduled to meet French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris on May 23 but has thus far rejected demands by Britain’s government to appear before Parliament to give evidence about Facebook’s enabling of the Cambridge Analytica data siphoning scandal. 3. Someone appears to have secretly begun CFC production again A new paper on an unexpected rise in ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons has shockingly concluded that someone, somewhere has once again begun production of the banned chemicals (Ars Technica). Research carried out by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found the ongoing drop in levels of CFC-11 since its 1987 ban has slowed dramatically, indicating that the gas is once again being produced and released. Speaking to BBC News , leap author Dr Stephen Montzka identified east Asia as the likely source of the emissions, observing that “we are making the measurements from very far away from these regions and I think more specificity is going to come once the people… in that region…look carefully at their measurements and publish their results.” 4. The high-stakes race to stop the trafficking of priceless artefacts In December 2016, David Hidalgo received a photograph of a 17th-century Peruvian painting (WIRED). The unsigned artwork, of the Virgen de Guadalupe , depicts the Virgin Mary surrounded by apparitions and tells the story of her appearance to Saint Juan Diego near Mexico City in 1531. Hidalgo’s tip-off came via email from a source who had seen the painting on show at the Bowers Museum in California, where it was on loan. Hidalgo’s source suspected that the painting had been stolen. 5. Microsoft’s latest controller is built for gamers with limited mobility Microsoft’s new Xbox Adaptive controller looks like a DJ mixing console at first glance (Motherboard). Large enough to cover your lap or sit secure on a table thanks to its grippy rubber feet, it’s designed to meet the needs of gamers with a wide range of mobility-limiting conditions. It has a directional pad, the usual Xbox and menu buttons, and a pair of large, domed buttons that can be easily pressed with whatever body part the player users, even if they have very little strength and coordination. The $99 controller is also set up to work with external peripherals for foot control and more.

As to It's accuracy, I'd be Interested to see the grounds on which their calculations are based. Quote: It takes a lot of electricity to mine bitcoins, and as more miners try to cash in on the crypto craze, the amount of energy required to win new coins increases accordingly. New research suggests the entire bitcoin network could consume as much as 7.7 gigawatts of electricity by the end of this year—enough to power a country the size of Austria. But the new analysis is not without its critics, who say there are many other factors to consider. By the end of this year, bitcoin could use half a percent of the world’s electric energy, according to research published today in the science journal Joule. What’s more, if bitcoin’s value rises as high as some experts predict, the network could eventually consume upwards of five percent of the world’s electricity.

Cabinet announced that a new option will be introduced to fund Antigua and Barbuda’s proposed university at Five Islands and according to coinbase.com and coingeek.com, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will now be accepted for a specific CIP offering.\nLet’s start with the new U.S.$150,000 offering. According to the Cabinet notes, “Cabinet decided to create a fourth option under the CIP for the sum of U.S.$150,000 per file. The innovative legislative change to the CIP law will be used to fund Antigua’s university at Five Islands.” Now that we have that out of the way, we have to wonder who will pay U.S.$50,000 more for the University option, when they can contribute just U.S.$100,000 for the National Development Fund (NDF) option? If the answer is, ‘just because’ then we have a hard time accepting that.\nTo make sure we were not going crazy, we visited U.S. CIP website, cip.gov.ag, and clicked on the “Schedule of Fees” link. Sure enough, the National Development Fund (NDF) option is a one-time payment of U.S.$100,000 plus all the associated fees. The new university option is U.S.$150,000 but we do note a difference in terminology. The NDF is per “application” while the university option is per “file.” Unfortunately, our investigations have not yielded a definitive answer as to whether the terminology makes a difference and if so, what that difference may be. The people we expected to be ‘in the know’ were not, or gave conflicting (and unofficial) responses.\nThat lack of success has caused us to pose the question here so that hopefully, it will invoke a response that will explain the different terminology and the differences in the two options. As well, maybe we can learn the logic behind the offering and the reason why it is believed that interested parties will pay the premium just to ensure that the money goes to the university.\nThis ‘University option’ also raises another question. If the university is to be a full University of the West Indies (UWI) campus, would they have to give permission for the UWI brand to be associated with the selling of citizenship/passports? Maybe UWI does not want the brand leveraged in this manner. It could be a case where the UWI scholars fundamentally disagree with CIP. Unfortunately, the inquiry sent to the university did not receive a response in time to report.\nThe next very interesting thing in the world of CIP surrounded the announcement that “specific Citizenship by Investment Program has been devised by Calvin Ayre, the Bitcoin Envoy for Antigua and Barbuda,” and “These CIP units can only be paid for in Bitcoin Cash (BCH).” Wait, if that is not interesting enough, the release states that the government of Antigua and Barbuda recognises Bitcoin Cash as “the only real Bitcoin and the world’s most scalable and flexible cryptocurrency.” <a href='https://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a165bcc8&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'> <img src='https://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=20&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&n=a165bcc8' border='0' alt='' /> </a> <a href='https://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af6a1a93&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'> <img src='https://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=21&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&n=af6a1a93' border='0' alt='' /> </a>\nOh boy, do we have a lot of questions on this one. Too many for this piece, but we will start with the obvious ones. What is the “specific” CIP programme that has been developed by Calvin Ayre? How does it differ? If it is simply a payment method then why not just make it a payment option? By accepting Bitcoin Cash, isn’t the government opening itself to significant exchange risks because of the cryptocurrency’s volatility? What will the government do with the Bitcoin Cash it receives? If it is an immediate conversion, then what is the point of the exercise beyond a payment option – why make something “specific?”\nHere is a biggie. What is the forecasted response of other nations, which are weary of our current due diligence process, when we add anonymous cryptocurrency to the mix? Doesn’t this increase our risk of losing visa-free status in some countries? Have we discussed this new CIP programme with any of those we might deem ‘high risk’ of visa-free revocation?\nLast but not least (for now), what analysis contributed to the proclamation that the government of Antigua and Barbuda recognises Bitcoin Cash as “the only real Bitcoin and the world’s most scalable and flexible cryptocurrency?” A minor point, but doesn’t the original Bitcoin hold claim to being the “real” Bitcoin? More importantly, how does a cryptocurrency that is not even a year old garner that kind of endorsement from our government?\nTo understand our concerns, realise that Bitcoin Cash is a relatively new cryptocurrency. It was developed by interests that wanted a change to the Bitcoin code and made what is called a hard fork. On August 1, 2017, the cryptocurrency went live and POOF! everyone with Bitcoin had the same amount of coin in Bitcoin Cash. That is the kind of thing that makes it hard for the average person to understand how cryptocurrency works. Not only that, at launch, Bitcoin Cash was worth under U.S.$300, just before Christmas it was over U.S.$3,200, early April it was trading just over U.S.$600 and now it is about U.S.$1,400.\nWe are not attempting to fear-monger regarding cryptocurrency, but we need more information. CIP and cryptocurrency are complex enough on their own.

However, in order for this to happen, cryptocurrency “structure” would have to improve, he said.\n\"We need to see this [cryptocurrency] structure continue to build,\" Master said, as quoted by CNBC. “We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we're talking about and measure our performance.”\nInitial coin offerings (ICOs), the controversial fundraising mechanism that allows companies and individuals issue and sell their own crypto tokens, also need to improve, he said.\n\"We need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle,\" Master said. \"And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.\"\nMaster pointed out that the cryptocurrency space is “nowhere near” to the stage where it has enough of these tools to attract institutional investors.\n“[T]hese things — indexation, custody and so on — aren't there to bring in those bigger people just yet,” he told CNBC.\nSome industry players have already taken steps in that direction. Earlier this week, the largest US crypto exchange Coinbase launched its Custody service as part of a suite of products aimed at institutional investors.\nAlso this week, US derivatives marketplace operator CME Group and British digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities launched an Ethereum (ETH) reference rate and a real-time Ethereum-dollar index. The move came just a few days after Bloomberg announced that it was teaming up with billionaire investor Mike Novogratz to launch a cryptocurrency index, designed to “track the performance of the largest, most liquid portion of the cryptocurrency market”.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $8,305.30, as of 09:29 BST. The cryptocurrency has gained 0.6% in the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinmarketcap.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/16/bitcoin-prices-will-surge-again-this-year-coinshares-chairman.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "danny master", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:50:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bbdf7ee0966d4e2d28de8d78fb53400cc73f665", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLsosuQMFhY_lV__JyTgK.lqD3tl7Ekc0jG5a2oUvyDnbTvjyfx5z4PVqxPnxMNNenAz9yQ_x8EZs8BrYELmW_Q3", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Stack Overflow", "title": "Cross platform windows build for bitcoin on ubuntu", "title_full": "Cross platform windows build for bitcoin on ubuntu", "published": "2018-05-17T11:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bbdf7ee0966d4e2d28de8d78fb53400cc73f665", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLsosuQMFhY_lV__JyTgK.lqD3tl7Ekc0jG5a2oUvyDnbTvjyfx5z4PVqxPnxMNNenAz9yQ_x8EZs8BrYELmW_Q3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nirajkumar", "published": "2018-05-17T11:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cross platform windows build for bitcoin on ubuntu", "text": "All the exe get build successfully but when I move it to windows machine None of the exe is working.

Modified 17 May 2018 09:35 Facebook Bitcoin Bears show their teeth as price dips below $8000\nThe performance of Cryptocurrency markets continues to suggest that the value of many digital coins reached was a serious overshoot, and could still be set to fade much of the last year's gains. However, if you forget about the viper's nest which is trying to value them, a lot of things continue to look up. Over the last few days news has broken about Facebook’s apparent plans to launch a cryptocurrency of their own, presumably to try and incentivise users to interact with their platform (and possibly to distract from the recent data drama). Bloomberg is also apparently set to launch a cryptocurrency index sometime in the future. Major companies continuing to a acknowledge both the utility of the technology and its legitimacy as an asset class Techs darkening for Bitcoin\nKey supports are giving way in many Cryptocurrency charts, but Bitcoin is, of course, the most important price to be watching. A move beneath $8000 is definitely concerning, and in his daily roundup of the technical picture, Omkar Godbole, a technical analyst at Coindesk believes that the loss of momentum now suggests that the price of Bitcoin is set to return beneath the psychological level,\n“Bitcoin's (BTC) bears have unraveled the minor rally in prices since Saturday and are now looking to pull the cryptocurrency below the $8,000 mark, the technical charts indicate.”\nThe major support just below $8000 is now clearly in range and it seems quite possible that with no real fundamental news moving the price that the technical picture will continue to dictate the price action as Mr. Gobole indicates,\n“The cryptocurrency looks set to test support at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from April 1 low to May 5 high) and could go as low as $7,524 (expanding channel breakdown target) in the next 24-48 hours. An unexpected break above $8,884 would abort the bearish view.”\nFor me, the most concerning aspect of the recent price action is the total lack of volume. With no real news there is little to drive any trading and instead, it appears we simply have investors sitting on investments with profit taking and bears holding the edge for now. The environment makes things very slippy and bulls are understandably cautious. François Auré Traded Forex for 6 years. Trading consultant for Private Sports Betting Fund out of Edinburgh.

He thinks it will become the world’s single currency in ten years from now. However, his companies have always been adverse to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That recently came to change when Square integrated Bitcoin support. It seems there is a good reason as to why the company decided to gamble on cryptocurrency after all. Square Embraces Bitcoin Thanks to Jack Dorsey\nA lot of people were surprised when Square enabled support for Bitcoin. Its Cash app lets users buy and sell BTC with relative ease. It has been a positive decision for the company. Revenue has increased ever since this implementation was added. Even so, the key reason for this integration has always been a mystery.\nIt appears Jack Dorsey has been intent on integrated Bitcoin with Square Cash for some time now. Earlier this year, attending a hackathon finally opened up a lot of perspectives. Together with engineer Mike Brock, they embarked on a mission to bring the Square Cash Card and Bitcoin together. The purpose was to make BTC as spendable as real currency without too many hurdles. It is not an easy task, as payment cards and cryptocurrency do not work well together these days.\nAfter eventually succeeding, the decision was made to take it to the next level. Brock, the engineer, leads a team working on Square Cash’s Bitcoin brokerage features. It is evident the company and the world’s leading cryptocurrency will remain entwined for some time to come. This is mainly due to Jack Dorsey’s fascination with Bitcoin and what it represents. Bitcoin Checks the Right Boxes\nThese days, it is difficult to keep shareholders happy. In the case of Square, a lot of people continue to oppose cryptocurrency. These same individuals still question the decision to offer Bitcoin support in an official capacity. Jack Dorsey, however, wants to offer even more functionality in the near future. What those features will look like, remains unclear.\nBitcoin is an interesting form of money for Jack Dorsey. Earlier this year, he stated how BTC can become the world’s “one’ currency in the next decade. It may become the single currency of the internet, and by extension, the rest of the world. An ambitious goal and a bullish outlook. The global interest in cryptocurrency is surging as of late. Even so, it is still mainly for investment purposes, rather than using it as a currency.\nThe question remains whether or not Jack Dorsey can drive this change Bitcoin really needs. It still remains inaccessible to a lot of people. Square Cash addresses that problem in a way, but not on a global scale just yet. If other companies take a similar approach, change can occur fairly quickly. For now, Bitcoin is still a fringe market. It will remain to be for some time, albeit things are slowly improving.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/", "http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/2018/05/square-embraced-bitcoin-after-twitter-ceo-jack-attended-a-hackathon/#respond", "http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/category/bitcoin/", "https://work.qz.com/1279669/bitcoin-is-in-squares-cash-payments-app-because-ceo-jack-dorsey-joined-a-hackathon-to-get-it-there/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/25/bitcoin-will-eventually-be-the-single-global-currency-twitters-jack-dorsey.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hackathon bitcoin |", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hackathon square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:20:30.058+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d56fdb02dbababb514d61bdf218868aab5a6a13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfJYyEuXc8URrr4K63eTAgo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is it possible to grow demand of bitcoin?", "title_full": "Is it possible to grow demand of bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-17T11:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.999, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d56fdb02dbababb514d61bdf218868aab5a6a13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfJYyEuXc8URrr4K63eTAgo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "boddy.dy", "published": "2018-05-17T11:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is it possible to grow demand of bitcoin?", "text": "There is a high percentage for the possibility of growth in demand in bitcoin.

The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. The third largest market share of cryptocurrency, XRP, is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012.\nHere are all three cryptocurrency prices over time along with their trading volume. Data for all three is sourced from Coinbase.com and by request, we have shortened the time frame for a more recent picture.\nWe have also created an index in order to chart these together given their very different pricing history.

We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we’re talking about and measure our performance. We need to do more mature work around the ICOs… and just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.”\nMasters was speaking as the Consensus 2018 conference drew to a close in New York. The event received criticism this year after Bitcoin industry figures said it focused too much on blockchain-based tokens and “buzzwords” instead of examining progress.\nIn summary comments online, Bitcoin core developer Johnathan Corgan even described the atmosphere as “like all the popular kids (Blockchain) are publicly bashing the geeks and nerds (Bitcoin) while privately trying to copy their homework.”\nOutside, traders were also disappointed by the bullish price forecasts on the back of the conference, such as the 70% gains from Fundstrat Global Advisors cofounder Tom Lee , so far failing to come true.\nFor Masters, however, a longer-term first-mover advantage is a decisive aspect of Bitcoin.\n“Bitcoin is almost… a reserve currency in crypto; the thing that everybody goes back to because it’s got the infrastructure, because it’s got the most network connections, the most exchanges connections – that’s sort of a bedrock,” he added.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cnbc", "https://twitter.com/jmcorgan/status/996434257026453506", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tom-lee", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/16/bitcoin-prices-will-surge-again-this-year-coinshares-chairman.html", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-07/bitcoin-to-rally-on-consensus-conference-fundstrat-analyst-says"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "danny masters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T13:45:41.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "97dc232527f1a1ad86033c695547ee7bfb10560c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmV4tIL2S1LeMBkGIzvET1ro-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How to invest Bitcoin?", "title_full": "How to invest Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-17T11:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "97dc232527f1a1ad86033c695547ee7bfb10560c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmV4tIL2S1LeMBkGIzvET1ro-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "hakertajniak", "published": "2018-05-17T11:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to invest Bitcoin?", "text": "There are several ways to invest in bitcoin.

CEO Jack Dorsey expressed optimism about cryptocurrency’s role in the future of payments, saying that “the internet deserves a native currency” and “it will have a native currency,” Bloomberg reports May 16.\nAt the Consensus conference on Wednesday, Dorsey shared crypto enthusiasts’ vision that virtual currencies are the future of a legitimate means of global payment. He said that he doesn’t know whether it will be Bitcoin (BTC), but “I hope it will be.” Dorsey said:\n“This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes. We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.”\nSquare, a developer of payment and financial services solutions, allowed merchants to accept BTC in 2014 and made BTC trading available for almost all users of its Cash App in February of this year.\nNot everyone at Square shares Dorsey’s enthusiasm however. He said that “this was a pretty contentious move in the company,” adding that there are still debates and fights over the topic. According to Dorsey, some of the company’s board of directors are also resistant to the idea of cryptocurrency.\nIn the beginning of May, Square reported low profits from BTC trading in the first quarter, which only amounted to around $200,000. While BTC trading constituted a 5 percent overall revenue of $34.1 mln, the company spent $33.9 mln to purchase the tokens.\nDorsey’s recent speech reaffirms previous comments that Bitcoin will become the world’s “single currency” within a decade\nsource https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitt...global-payment ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reaffirms-bullish-future-on-bitcoin-crypto-as-global-payment"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T17:02:48.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8f8ea0b3312545726570ed60c6526ae32eff9db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTMYQlBBlMix9QNzAYu7QyVem0I0YUUrKdRRJmeQR_zC3l2an3ZuFysCZIehgvo.8A_DS76FwEeF3mtXTNl2e9BISndHAFYius-", "site_full": "mnfaindia.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://mnfaindia.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Media News And Feature Alliance", "title": "Bitcoin Could Consume More Electric Energy Than All Of Austria", "title_full": "Bitcoin Could Consume More Electric Energy Than All Of Austria", "published": "2018-05-17T11:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8f8ea0b3312545726570ed60c6526ae32eff9db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTMYQlBBlMix9QNzAYu7QyVem0I0YUUrKdRRJmeQR_zC3l2an3ZuFysCZIehgvo.8A_DS76FwEeF3mtXTNl2e9BISndHAFYius-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MNFA India (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T11:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Could Consume More Electric Energy Than All Of Austria", "text": "By the end of last year, it seemed ‘Bitcoin’ was the word on everybody’s lips.\nThe hype has died down some in the last few months, but the cryptocurrency is still generating substantial demand – so much that one expert estimates it will use up as much electricity as all of Austria by the end of this year.\nAs Bitcoin relies on a network of computers performing non-stop calculations, each transaction requires a staggering amount of energy.\nA new study quantifying Bitcoin’s energy requirements estimates it will use about half a percent of the world’s total consumption before the end of the year; in the near future, the study shows it could consume as much as 5 percent.\n‘Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.’\nIn a paper published to the journal Joule, the researcher uses a new technique to assess the future of Bitcoin’s electric energy consumption.\nSoon, the researcher says it will likely use up about half a percent of the world’s total consumption.\nIt might not sound like much, but with a minimum usage now estimated to be at 2.55 gigawatts, it means Bitcoin already uses nearly as much electricity as Ireland.\nAccording to de Vries, a single transaction uses roughly the same amount of electricity as an average household in the Netherlands consumes in a whole month.\nWhen it hits half a percent, it will be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts – or as much as Austria.\n‘To me, half a percent is already quite shocking,’ de Vries says.\n‘It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.’\nIf it jumps to 5 percent, as de Vries believes it someday could, the researcher says ‘that would be quite bad.’\nComputers in the Bitcoin network are constantly performing calculations, as they must time-stamp the transactions in the ongoing chain.\nAs a result, even those who don’t win are drawing power.\n‘You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity,’ says de Vries.\n‘But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines.’\nWhat is a Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is what is referred to as a 'crypto-currency.'\nIt is the internet's version of money - a unique pieces of digital property that can be transferred from one person to another.\nBitcoins are generated by using an open-source computer program to solve complex math problems. This process is known as mining.\nEach Bitcoin has it's own unique fingerprint and is defined by a public address and a private key - or strings of numbers and letters that give each a specific identity.\nThey are also characterized by their position in a public database of all Bitcoin transactions known as the blockchain.\nThe blockchain is maintained by a distributed network of computers around the world.\nBecause Bitcoins allow people to trade money without a third party getting involved, they have become popular with libertarians as well as technophiles, speculators — and criminals.\nWhere do Bitcoins come from?\nPeople create Bitcoins through mining.\nMining is the process of solving complex math problems using computers running Bitcoin software.\nThese mining puzzles get increasingly harder as more Bitcoins enter circulation.\nThe rewards are cut in half at regular intervals due to a deliberate slowdown in the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation.\nWho's Behind The Currency?\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts.\nNakamoto dropped off the map as Bitcoin began to attract widespread attention, but proponents say that doesn't matter: the currency obeys its own, internal logic.\nDr Craig Wright was suspected as the creator following a report by Wired last year and he has now confirmed his identity as the cryptocurrency's founder.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T11:11:19.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29a2c17bf80d1be798b59198bc73a112e0889982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXLP20uytrBZUqnkSRhahRQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bounty Campaigns vs Bitcoin Mining", "title_full": "Bounty Campaigns vs Bitcoin Mining", "published": "2018-05-17T11:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "29a2c17bf80d1be798b59198bc73a112e0889982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXLP20uytrBZUqnkSRhahRQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "toantk", "published": "2018-05-17T11:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bounty Campaigns vs Bitcoin Mining", "text": "If you want bitcoin mining, you must pay for GPU, very expensive but you receive coin every day.

Although the block size increase is quite a feat, BCH developers have also expanded the network’s default data-carrier-size to 220 Bytes and re-enabled some old Satoshi OP_Codes that were previously removed from earlier codebases.\nNow over the past 24-hours, lots of people have been playing around with the new BCH features.

This means users of both social media applications can now post more content and everything is saved on-chain.\nThen shortly after the fork, another OP_Code feature was shown to the community by Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia. Pacia built the first tree signature on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain by utilizing the OP_CAT functionality — which creates a more efficient multi-signature combination.\nThe Openbazaar programmer explains for addresses with a large number of keys, a tree signature can use less data. “For addresses with a large number of keys a tree signature can use less data.

This is the latest step on the way to introducing cryptocurrencies in the country, informs local press service.\n\"The initiative aims to minimize the existing risks associated with the use of digital objects to transfer assets to an unregulated digital environment to legalize criminal income, bankruptcy or sponsorship of terrorist groups\" - said Pavel Krasheninnikov from the United Russia political party and head of the legislative work commission. The initiative to be considered next week does not mean that digital currencies will become a legal tender. Instead, a separate act developed by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development will set the conditions for digital currencies to be used as payments \"in controlled quantities.\" The initiative will make the digital confirmation by the user in a smart contract equal to his written consent.\nRussia first prepared a draft \"On Digital Financial Assets\" bill in March this year, which would provide federal laws regulating cryptocurrencies and ICO, after President Vladimir Putin's decision to initiate crypto-regulation from July 1. The project of 20th March defines cryptographic and digital tokens as assets intended exclusively for trading on authorized exchanges, also requiring that user accounts on the cryptographic exchange comply with AML regulations and terrorism financing regulations. \"It is important that cryptocurrencies and tokens are included in the legal field of the Russian Federation. On the one hand, these are opportunities that we can not miss. On the other hand, when they are outside the legal field, you can use them to give bribes, withdraw money in the event of bankruptcy, pay black salaries and simply steal - without any consequences [for criminals]\"- said Igor Sudets, director of the \"Blockchain for Lawyers\" program at the Russian University of Economics in Plekhanov in Moscow.\nIn conclusion, one might speculate, that after the cryptocurrency use in Russian Federation will become legal and regulated, it might be a good time for a national cryptocurrency? According to the current path of events this idea does not seems to be far fetched.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The price has bounced from the 50% Fibo at the level of $8,132 again, but the bounce was short-lived so far. The market is still trading below the golden trend line, so the outlook remains bearish.

Yes, you read that correctly: in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 BTC to purchase two pizzas in Jacksonville, Florida. Now, if you’re familiar with all things bitcoin, the rise and popularity of this digital currency can’t come as a surprise. But if you don’t really know all that much about BTC, you probably have a lot of questions about it, including what it is, how and where does one get bitcoin, and how in the world did someone manage to buy a pizza using it. Well, it all began back in 2009, when a person (or a group of people) using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a white paper introducing the concept of a “new electronic cash system” which would function on a decentralized, peer-to-peer technology (today called blockchain). The main goal here was for people to be able to make transactions without involving banks, governments, and other institutions, i.e. intermediaries. The biggest advantage of the bitcoin network lies in the fact that it works on the basis of consensus and, that way, keeps all your transactions as secure as possible. What does this mean? If you decide to purchase, say, pizza, all the members of the network need to verify your purchase first and only if/when it’s verified, can it go through. Done like this, the system can successfully avoid fraud and misuse—it stops a user from using the same amount of money more than once (double-spending). Once you decide to dive into the world of bitcoin, the first thing you might want to do is explore which digital currency exchange platforms exist, how they differ from one another, and which one would suit your needs the best.

Yes, you read that correctly: in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 BTC to purchase two pizzas in Jacksonville, Florida.\nNow, if you’re familiar with all things bitcoin, the rise and popularity of this digital currency can’t come as a surprise. But if you don’t really know all that much about BTC, you probably have a lot of questions about it, including what it is, how and where does one get bitcoin, and how in the world did someone manage to buy a pizza using it.\nWell, it all began back in 2009, when a person (or a group of people) using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a white paper introducing the concept of a “new electronic cash system” which would function on a decentralized, peer-to-peer technology (today called blockchain). The main goal here was for people to be able to make transactions without involving banks, governments, and other institutions, i.e. intermediaries.\nThe biggest advantage of the bitcoin network lies in the fact that it works on the basis of consensus and, that way, keeps all your transactions as secure as possible. What does this mean? If you decide to purchase, say, pizza, all the members of the network need to verify your purchase first and only if/when it’s verified, can it go through. Done like this, the system can successfully avoid fraud and misuse—it stops a user from using the same amount of money more than once (double-spending).\nOnce you decide to dive into the world of bitcoin, the first thing you might want to do is explore which digital currency exchange platforms exist, how they differ from one another, and which one would suit your needs the best. When you pick one, you’ll be able to easily buy and sell your bitcoin (exchange it for “real” money), and store it in your digital wallet until you decide to purchase something.\nThe infographic below will tell you all about the process of verification, provide you with some useful stats, and let you know what types of crypto wallets exist.

Apple’s co-founder quoted CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey, who had said in March that Bitcoin will become the world’s “single currency.”\nThis is not the first time that Steve Wozniak has made positive comments about cryptocurrencies and blockchain. At the “Money 20/20” conference in Las Vegas, back in October last year, he said that Bitcoin is better than gold and the US dollar.\nAccording to Wozniak, Bitcoin’s big advantage is that there is only a limited amount of coins, while fiat money, like the US dollar or euro, can simply be printed by banks.\nNonetheless, Wozniak sold all his bitcoins except one, as he said at the WeAreDevelopers Conference in Vienna, because “[he] does not want to be an investor and constantly watch the prices.”\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://de.cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-ceo-says-bitcoin-will-become-worlds-single-currency-within-a-decad", "https://www.wearedevelopers.com/", "https://de.cointelegraph.com/news/apple-co-founder-blockchain-is-an-interesting-technology-but-not-yet-ready-for-the-market", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/money2020-wozniak-thinks-bitcoin-better-gold/", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/twitter", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:33:18.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "735a172fd43ba5afaf7245fdcfdd3baa0d569435", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBdJQ4GOXbGi61pCjplAgmJ", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp;

The top five included Ethereum, Steem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo, all of which utilize smart contracts to efficiently and securely process information in a decentralized manner.\nThe addition of Steem in the top five rankings of the Chinese government’s blockchain network was unexpected by the community because unlike Lisk and NEO, Steem is not a base layer blockchain technology that can be used to create decentralized applications. Steem is a content distribution platform based on the blockchain with a primary purpose of distributing content. Essentially, Steem is like Reddit based on the decentralized blockchain.\nAnother surprising addition to its top 10 rankings was Monero at number 9, given that several governments including the Japanese government and its financial services agency (FSA) have expressed their concerns towards cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash that are capable of processing anonymous payments that could be associated with money laundering and criminal activities.\nThe cryptocurrency community was taken aback by the ranking of bitcoin at 13, which was co-ranked with privacy-focused cryptocurrency Verge. The bitcoin community was understandably outraged by the ranking of bitcoin at 13, considering that bitcoin has the longest track record as the most secure and dominant cryptocurrency in the global market.\nThe argument that bitcoin’s application is limited to a form of money and payment is illogical, as the Chinese government ranked Steem, which has a single application on its blockchain network that is a content distribution platform, as the 2nd best blockchain network behind Steem.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steem", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "komodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steem", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T04:46:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d133dbcb63b694e38995269075333294f61469cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5YF.oto7FkcFMab614h8NW5gesHF0A1RzK85RlXOwqI1DUpU_OLAlkpAqyqW6qFxakVKKjzqjPy8lHOfOKMTZFFsSSdlbkexGkurzHmg64nZJVtFdUvrd", "site_full": "www.albawaba.com", "site": "albawaba.com", "site_section": "http://albawaba.com//rss/business", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Al Bawaba - Business", "title": "Bitcoin Falls as 'Consensus Pump' Fails to Materialise", "title_full": "Bitcoin Falls as 'Consensus Pump' Fails to Materialise", "published": "2018-05-17T10:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/im/bitcoin_May16_PixaBay.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17087, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d133dbcb63b694e38995269075333294f61469cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5YF.oto7FkcFMab614h8NW5gesHF0A1RzK85RlXOwqI1DUpU_OLAlkpAqyqW6qFxakVKKjzqjPy8lHOfOKMTZFFsSSdlbkexGkurzHmg64nZJVtFdUvrd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T10:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Falls as 'Consensus Pump' Fails to Materialise", "text": "Bitcoin Falls as 'Consensus Pump' Fails to Materialise Bitcoin Falls as 'Consensus Pump' Fails to Materialise 2.5 5\nPublished May 17th, 2018 - 08:30 GMT via SyndiGate.info Rate Article: The drop in total crypto market cap further below $400 billion signalled the lack of the demand for cryptos amid widespread selling.

anticipated.\nBitcoin fell 3.25% to $8,255.2 on the Bitfinex exchange and remained close to session lows of $8,100.0.\nNew insights into the current crypto environment from market participants attending the conference were few and far between, providing little reason for investors to pile into bitcoin.\nSome participants claimed the general takeaway from the conference was \"Blockchain continues to be in an embryonic phase, with speculators eager to cash in.\"\nIn the run up to the conference, some had claimed it would act as the touch-paper for a rally in bitcoin but the \"consensus pump\" failed to materialize as sentiment on cryptocurrencies remained negative following renewed regulatory fears.\nLet's Talk Crypto, 'What Really Is Bitcoin?'", "highlightText": "",

On May 17, 2018 0 0\nBy Jeffrey Gogo\nThe explosive growth in the use of, and investment in, cryptocurrencies by Zimbabweans in the last few months has put financial regulators on the defensive.\nIn 2017, more than $5,3 million worth of Bitcoin – the benchmark cryptocurrency – was traded on the country’s biggest digital currency exchange Golix.\nAnd as the price of Bitcoin peaked at $33 000 on the exchange late last year, from just $1 000 in January, more people joined in what has become the modern day “gold rush”.\nAltogether, Golix has traded $20 million Bitcoin’s worth since it started operations in September 2015.\nBut it is the exchange’s latest plans to raise $35,8 million through a special token sale that has forced the hand of authorities at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to ban cryptocurrencies.\nSo what exactly is Bitcoin, and what’s behind the investors’ mania, and the regulators’ fears?\nWhat is Bitcoin? To illustrate our case, we use Bitcoin to represent the rest of the smaller cryptocurrencies, which number more than 1 500.\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created in 2009 by shadowy Japanese developer Satoshi Nakamoto, and has become the most valuable and most popular digital asset.\nIt is not your everyday currency, the kind that one can hold in the hand like bond notes or US dollars.\nIt is stored virtually – on smartphones, computers and tablets etc – more or less like your Ecocash and Telecash, but without the central regulatory authority.\nUnlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not issued by a central bank or government – although Venezuelan authorities have issued their own cryptocurrency – with only 3 600 coins created through a process called mining each day.\nAbout 16,5 million Bitcoins are in circulation today, and only 21 million can ever be issued, a situation that has led some into predicting a growth of unhindered proportions for the digital currency.\nThe technology behind Bitcoin is a complex one. Put simply, the system rounds up transactions by investors into what are known as “blocks”, to be solved by math – the blockchain.\nTo do this, one needs very powerful computers to work out a solution whether the transaction was possible.\nThis is what is called mining. Once the other “miners” confirm the solution, the transaction goes through, with “miners” earning Bitcoin.\nWhere can I buy Bitcoin in Zimbabwe? There are two main digital currency trading platforms in Zimbabwe, Harare-based Golix, and Styx24 in Gweru. With more than 50 000 investors actively trading on its exchange, Golix is the bigger of the two.\nThe currency can also be bought on Local Bitcoins.com , a much bigger platform that connects thousands of people from all over the world.\nThe price of Bitcoin, like other currencies, is typically decided by those willing to buy or sell it.\nTo receive a Bitcoin, the buyer must have a Bitcoin address – a long list of alphanumeric characters.\nThe system is built to protect privacy, so investors often get off without their identities being revealed.\nBut once the address is lost, the Bitcoins are lost with it.\nI have got Bitcoin, so what? While there is no shop known to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment here, a small number of Zimbabweans have become active trading in cryptocurrencies. Some are using Bitcoin to pay for goods and services like university fees and health bills abroad easily, without having to queue up at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for it.\nAnd those overseas to send money back home.\nLast year, Golix processed about $1,8 million of such payments.\nLargely though, cryptos are now being looked at as an investment, buoyed by the 1 400 percent growth in the price of Bitcoin last year.\nThose with the coin are now unwilling to sale, hoping it will gain more value in future. It is not clear what will happen when the 21 million maximum Bitcoins are fully issued.\nOn account of this, a number of optimistic experts have predicted the price to shoot to between $100,000 and $250 000 per coin in the next few years.\nHere, Golix has gone a step further. It launched a Bitcoin ATM in Harare last month, allowing investors to withdraw hard US dollars from the sale of their cryptocurrencies, a novelty in an economy where traditional ATM no longer dispense cash.\nBut the biggest challenge remains a lack of liquidity and high demand, which have forced Bitcoin to trade a premium of about 40 to 60 percent to the global average price. For example, the international price of one Bitcoin was quoted at around $8 253 early morning on May 16. On Golix it was about $13 000.\nWhat are regulators saying? Regulation of digital money still remains as obscure as the virtual currencies debate itself. Bitcoin represents an era in financial technology that at best remains speculative, seldom understood by both citizens and by Government, though, in its current state, open to criminal abuse.\nThere is no law that specifically supports or criminalises trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Zimbabwe, registered or not.\nThe currency is neither defined as a security, commodity nor currency.\nThough somewhere the Securities and Exchange Act could help form the basis for future digital currencies regulation, should Securities Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe, which is mandated to regulate all securities, decides to do so.\nLooking at the stricter definition of a security, how it relates as any financial asset that can be bought, held or sold like shares, Bitcoin is in that sense a tradable security. And, therefore, subject to supervision by the SecZim, just like common stocks on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.\nWhen the regulation eventually comes, it may not necessarily directly apply to investors, rather to the cryptocurrency exchanges that support the trading of digital currencies.\nBut the Reserve Bank has recently come down hard on crypto, directing commercial banks to stop dealing in, or with exchanges and people trading virtual money.\nThis is by far the biggest blow yet to the development of digital assets in the country.\nClearly, Zimbabwe’s financial laws had not anticipated a situation when trusted bank notes and other value storers like gold risked losing style to a currency that’s not even physical, only tangible to computers or smartphones – and one that is turning into a hit with those investors taken to risk.

This is the latest step on the way to introducing cryptocurrencies in the country, informs local press service.\n\"The initiative aims to minimize the existing risks associated with the use of digital objects to transfer assets to an unregulated digital environment to legalize criminal income, bankruptcy or sponsorship of terrorist groups\" - said Pavel Krasheninnikov from the United Russia political party and head of the legislative work commission. The initiative to be considered next week does not mean that digital currencies will become a legal tender. Instead, a separate act developed by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development will set the conditions for digital currencies to be used as payments \"in controlled quantities.\" The initiative will make the digital confirmation by the user in a smart contract equal to his written consent.\nRussia first prepared a draft \"On Digital Financial Assets\" bill in March this year, which would provide federal laws regulating cryptocurrencies and ICO, after President Vladimir Putin's decision to initiate crypto-regulation from July 1. The project of 20th March defines cryptographic and digital tokens as assets intended exclusively for trading on authorized exchanges, also requiring that user accounts on the cryptographic exchange comply with AML regulations and terrorism financing regulations. \"It is important that cryptocurrencies and tokens are included in the legal field of the Russian Federation. On the one hand, these are opportunities that we can not miss. On the other hand, when they are outside the legal field, you can use them to give bribes, withdraw money in the event of bankruptcy, pay black salaries and simply steal - without any consequences [for criminals]\"- said Igor Sudets, director of the \"Blockchain for Lawyers\" program at the Russian University of Economics in Plekhanov in Moscow.\nIn conclusion, one might speculate, that after the cryptocurrency use in Russian Federation will become legal and regulated, it might be a good time for a national cryptocurrency? According to the current path of events this idea does not seems to be far fetched.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The price has bounced from the 50% Fibo at the level of $8,132 again, but the bounce was short-lived so far. The market is still trading below the golden trend line, so the outlook remains bearish.

Referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core Ver said the software is\\u00a0“ slow, expensive and unreliable .” \\n\nVer who is CEO of Bitcoin.com a website which guides investors in the cryptocurrency market told the host of Fast Money that innovative\\u00a0business\\u00a0are being built with Bitcoin Cash in mind\\u00a0“ because it actually works .” He continued on the show to say: \\n\n“All of these existing businesses are building their new products on top of bitcoin cash, the economic path that bitcoin cash is on is the one that lead to bitcoin’s original success,” \\n BCH Hard Fork Brings no Relief From Sliding Price \\n\nBitcoin Cash beat other large-cap currencies in the last month like Ethereum and Bitcoin to be the best performing coin even though it has been on a steady decline leading up to the May 15 fork. \\n\nTrading at a low today of $1,250 according to livecoinwatch.com, BCH is down considerably from its recent high of $1,754 on May 6 but still almost double it’s April 17 low of $763 when Brian Kelly of BKCM said it would make a comeback within the year. \\n\nTuesday’s hard fork introduced several changes to the network which included an increase of the maximum block size to 32 MB which allows as many as 61 transactions per second to occur. However it didn’t generate\\u00a0an uptick in price during the lead up\\u00a0to it. \\n\nJust the opposite has happened in fact, BCH has lost around 12% in the 24 hours since the fork. Why? Because this latest fork offered no benefits to those who already own BCH. Traditionally a fork would reward currency holders by doubling their amount of equivalent coins. Holders would retain their original investment and receive the same amount on the new blockchain. With this fork, holder’s coins will simply be moved to the new blockchain at the same value. \\n\nVer isn’t put off by Tuesday’s decline though and has even predicted that Bitcoin Cash will double in price by years end. As he told CNBC; \\n\n“ That’s what actually gives it it’s underlying value, that you can use it in commerce to pay for things. Whereas, a lot of these other tokens out there just kind of turn into speculative assets that don’t actually have any utility .” \\n\n \\n\nImage from Shutterstock \\n\nThe post “Bitcoin Jesus” Still Bullish on Bitcoin Cash After Hard Fork appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:13:56.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4ad5e1dcccacf49f8f806d0dc4dd75d8754a177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhADeie7uYLil3Fvz4GruOv4-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-17T10:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4ad5e1dcccacf49f8f806d0dc4dd75d8754a177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhADeie7uYLil3Fvz4GruOv4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T10:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 17, 2018 NEWS Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Reaffirms Bullish Future on Bitcoin , Crypto as Global Payment Cointelegraph Dorsey noted that, at the moment, Bitcoin is \"slow and costly,\" which makes it difficult to use as a medium of exchange.

Photo: Reuters London: Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, currently uses almost as much power as Ireland does, and could be consuming about 0.5% of the world’s total electricity by the end of this year, a study has found.\nBitcoin’s burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency’s wildly fluctuating value. However, estimating exactly how much electricity the bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.\n“We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,” said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts—as much as Austria and 0.5% of the world’s total consumption.\n“To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said. If the price of bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, De Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world’s electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins—a process known as “mining” bitcoin.\nHowever, all the time, even the users that don’t win are expending computing power. “You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines,” de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries’s estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the bitcoin being mined. That information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.\nFirst Published: Thu, May 17 2018. 12 40 PM IST ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters london", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:15:26.052+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "932811e087651ca7ed8dfd1b03dbb5b57032dd79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQpt28piUaOBU9pwFEeyNYPW3HYcReESh8K2PhkW8qtDaEaa999RnOfmo6dIXMN7MaahSPXlkhm1FNsRUpgIoCCPHC1ADcj7xs-", "site_full": "keskustelu.kauppalehti.fi", "site": "kauppalehti.fi", "site_section": "http://keskustelu.kauppalehti.fi//5/i/keskustelu/rss/rssthreads.jspa?categoryID=10&numItems=30", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Support Forums : Aiheet - Kauppalehti", "title": "Bitcoin, kilpailija koko nykyiselle pankkijärjestelmälle", "title_full": "Bitcoin, kilpailija koko nykyiselle pankkijärjestelmälle", "published": "2018-05-17T10:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FI", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15729, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "932811e087651ca7ed8dfd1b03dbb5b57032dd79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQpt28piUaOBU9pwFEeyNYPW3HYcReESh8K2PhkW8qtDaEaa999RnOfmo6dIXMN7MaahSPXlkhm1FNsRUpgIoCCPHC1ADcj7xs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T10:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, kilpailija koko nykyiselle pankkijärjestelmälle", "text": "30.10.2008\nViestit: 12 362", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:27:53.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "181aa7317dba894c71c3816391311c07e57ad637", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFS9SlgQNliDkCrapYVHdrs6WcOoh_4ZsakbpHv9kdN4Qc6k6kWsHUrCKIDaTPyQgDFAvXeYRAHrrAbiY9K32wwv", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Jack Dorsey Hopes Bitcoin Will Become Web’s ‘Native Currency’", "title_full": "Jack Dorsey Hopes Bitcoin Will Become Web’s ‘Native Currency’", "published": "2018-05-17T10:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "181aa7317dba894c71c3816391311c07e57ad637", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFS9SlgQNliDkCrapYVHdrs6WcOoh_4ZsakbpHv9kdN4Qc6k6kWsHUrCKIDaTPyQgDFAvXeYRAHrrAbiY9K32wwv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-17T10:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jack Dorsey Hopes Bitcoin Will Become Web’s ‘Native Currency’", "text": "Webmaster Tools Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

However, estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.\n“We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,” said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts - as much as Austria and half of a per cent of the world’s total consumption.\n“To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume five per cent of the world’s electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every 10 minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins - a process known as “mining” Bitcoin. However, all the time, even the users that don’t win are expending computing power.\n“You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines,” de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries’s estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined.\nThat information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium. Getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.

However, estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.\n\"We've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries , who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland.\nA single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts - as much as Austria and half of a per cent of the world's total consumption.\n\"To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he said.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume five per cent of the world's electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins - a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. However, all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power.\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined.\nThat information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:46:13.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "762b827268d032a1f7fdf5f167dfe9985ecc5e9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS1zjMf86qIRR9S._ctKQje5N1mN1h7_rZPe.nON3y0tlasB_LW9MAGzOvIOVq9KTSu0OX1gLGshpG6Kys20GzvMiY0sO8zAw52yxBhb9eUT5b18Y3jypCA", "site_full": "www.wkrb13.com", "site": "wkrb13.com", "site_section": "http://wkrb13.com//rss/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "WKRB News", "title": "United Bitcoin Price Hits $11.39 on Exchanges (UBTC)", "title_full": "United Bitcoin Price Hits $11.39 on Exchanges (UBTC)", "published": "2018-05-17T09:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2293.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "762b827268d032a1f7fdf5f167dfe9985ecc5e9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS1zjMf86qIRR9S._ctKQje5N1mN1h7_rZPe.nON3y0tlasB_LW9MAGzOvIOVq9KTSu0OX1gLGshpG6Kys20GzvMiY0sO8zAw52yxBhb9eUT5b18Y3jypCA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "John.

Square started accepting Bitcoin in 2014 before nearly any other major credit card processing or payments platforms, and Dorsey has long been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\nWhen @jack himself walked onstage to close out the Consensus conference in New York City, moderator Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs couldn't help but reference a famous crypto tweet about Jack Dorsey walking into a Bitcoin conference. Jack Dorsey walking into the Bitcoin conference pic.twitter.com/ibQfgh3noa — Neeraj K. Agrawal (@NeerajKA) November 15, 2017\nDorsey touched on a host of different topics during his appearance: Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency landscape; the role both Square and Twitter might play in using and advancing blockchain technology; and why he thinks it's only a matter of time before we have a global digital currency. Here are some of the higlights.\nOn Square's decision to support Bitcoin in 2014 :\nDorsey: I didn't really understand the implications of it until three or four years ago when we had some Square engineers who wanted to build Bitcoin acceptance into our online store. I said yes, it took about three or four months, and they made it so any seller could accept Bitcoin without knowing they were taking Bitcoin at all.\nOn the backlash to supporting Bitcoin as a public company:\nDorsey: This was a pretty contentious move in the company. We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were skeptics of the technology. [Square] always takes the mindset that we can't wait for things to happen to us. If we want responsible, healthy uses of this technology that I believe is a fundamental shift in our world with so many positive outcomes, we need to make that happen.\nWe pushed through and it really tested us. Not just because we're a public company, but because there was more of a spotlight on us. There are a lot of unknowns, and we just ran toward them and tried to figure them out.\nOn adding support to Square Cash in 2017:\nDorsey: With Square Cash another opportunity came up back in January 2017. I saw all these conversations on Twitter about it, and the community was interesting. It felt like Usenet all over again.\nAt a hackathon that January I asked one of our engineers if we could work on Bitcoin, and the next day we committed to a goal to build a system where using my Cash card I could go across the street to Twitter HQ and buy a cappucino with a Bitcoin. We worked all week and started listening to other folks as well. We almost got there...we ran into a deployment issue and didn't actually hit the goal but it felt electric. We decided to dedicate Mike [the engineer] to building Bitcoin within Square Cash.\"\nOn the inevitability of a global digital currency:\nDorsey: We want to continue to level the playing field and give people a chance to participate in the economy. I don't know whether it will be Bitcoin or something else, but I'm a huge fan and appreciate the technology and principles behind it. We're going to have a native currency that can be global, that was invented on the internet, evolved on the internet, critiqued on the internet, and developed on the internet. It's going to happen.\nOn Square's role in the future of cryptocurrency:\nDorsey: The biggest thing I worry about as a company is making sure nothing from a corporate standpoint ever threatens the openness of the community and the open-source nature of cryptocurrency. No corporation or goverment body should own this. We're a centralized organization, but we can benefit from decentralization and I want to see more of it.\nThe internet is going to have a native currency. That's our ethos and we're going to do our part. If we ever go away from that, call us out, please. Hold us accountable to the right thing for the technology and the community. Our business concerns follow that. We can't do any of this without the technology being strong.\nOn blockchain's potential for Twitter:\nDorsey: On the Twitter side, there are a lot of applications in trust and identity. We can apply a lot of those technologies toward the problems we're seeing in terms of misinformation , manipulation, and we're trying to fight scams as well. There are broad applications of the technology and we're going to have an open mindset.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/6307-getting-started-with-bitcoin-in-cash-app", "https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/square-market-accepts-bitcoin-b1a2abce5eb", "https://t.co/ibQfgh3noa", "https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/930628771773853702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rob marvin may", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "squa", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth stark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neeraj k. agrawal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jack dorsey talks bitcoin and blockchain jack dorsey talks bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lightning labs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:49:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66fb346de95d76f60cb0e23cdb4e8f20b87146df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQzAN3wK43PY2hsU3aLUQiV3CyWhzwlbpQRfpDIoy1TpA--", "site_full": "huffduffer.com", "site": "huffduffer.com", "site_section": "https://huffduffer.com/new/atom", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "What's new on Huffduffer", "title": "Bitcoin BTC May 16 Morning Update -

Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nrelated news Donald Trump attacks China over US trade deficit Washington seeks global 'coalition' against Iran regime South Korea downplays Pyongyang's threats to cancel talks The estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland.\nA single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts - as much as Austria and half of a per cent of the world's total consumption.\n\"To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he said.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume five per cent of the world's electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins - a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. However, all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power.\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined.\nThat information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essar steel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:52:33.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be5748ce8da1a792270e261e7da4d862f9396eda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Al0rHa1hIfcGbCLtJkLPsed9xix87vju9Y3NrgN1_gKFvBI20PO8.gWrtNva24s8-", "site_full": "www.wired.co.uk", "site": "wired.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.wired.co.uk/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "WIRED UK", "title": "Thursday briefing: Bitcoin could consume as much energy as Austria by 2019", "title_full": "Thursday briefing: Bitcoin could consume as much energy as Austria by 2019", "published": "2018-05-17T09:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://wi-images.condecdn.net/image/xbr2v6NqOr1/crop/1440/0.5235602094240838/f/iStock-881768862.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11983, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be5748ce8da1a792270e261e7da4d862f9396eda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Al0rHa1hIfcGbCLtJkLPsed9xix87vju9Y3NrgN1_gKFvBI20PO8.gWrtNva24s8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WIRED", "published": "2018-05-17T09:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Thursday briefing: Bitcoin could consume as much energy as Austria by 2019", "text": "1. Study: Bitcoin is on course to consume as much energy as Austria by 2019 New research into the energy consumption of bitcoin indicates that, by the end of the year, the cryptocurrency could account for 0.5 per cent of the world's energy demand: 7.67 gigawatts, roughly the same as that consumed by Austria ( Motherboard ). Financial economist Alex de Vries's conservative estimates, based on the energy consumption of the most efficient bitcoin miner available, show that the bitcoin network currently consumes at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity – as much as Ireland. But the miner network is growing at an extremely fast rate. Bitcoin's value and the energy required to mine it both change over time, but on March 16, about 60 percent of the bitcoin value produced by a miner was spent on electricity and de Vries anticipates that when the network reaches 7.67 gigawatts, it will hit a point of equilibrium, where miners are only able to break even. 2. Mark Zuckerberg to meet with European Parliament Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will meet with leading members of the European Parliament to discuss data privacy concerns ahead of GDPR coming into force ( BBC News ). A date has yet to be set for the meeting, but it's most likely to take place next week. Zuckerberg is also scheduled to meet French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris on May 23 but has thus far rejected demands by Britain's government to appear before Parliament to give evidence about Facebook's enabling of the Cambridge Analytica data siphoning scandal.

Someone appears to have secretly begun CFC production again A new paper on an unexpected rise in ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons has shockingly concluded that someone, somewhere has once again begun production of the banned chemicals ( Ars Technica ). Research carried out by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found the ongoing drop in levels of CFC-11 since its 1987 ban has slowed dramatically, indicating that the gas is once again being produced and released. Speaking to BBC News , leap author Dr Stephen Montzka identified east Asia as the likely source of the emissions, observing that \"we are making the measurements from very far away from these regions and I think more specificity is going to come once the people... in that region...look carefully at their measurements and publish their results.\" 4. The high-stakes race to stop the trafficking of priceless artefacts In December 2016, David Hidalgo received a photograph of a 17th-century Peruvian painting ( WIRED ). The unsigned artwork, of the Virgen de Guadalupe , depicts the Virgin Mary surrounded by apparitions and tells the story of her appearance to Saint Juan Diego near Mexico City in 1531. Hidalgo’s tip-off came via email from a source who had seen the painting on show at the Bowers Museum in California, where it was on loan. Hidalgo’s source suspected that the painting had been stolen. 5. Microsoft's latest controller is built for gamers with limited mobility Microsoft's new Xbox Adaptive controller looks like a DJ mixing console at first glance ( Motherboard ). Large enough to cover your lap or sit secure on a table thanks to its grippy rubber feet, it's designed to meet the needs of gamers with a wide range of mobility-limiting conditions. It has a directional pad, the usual Xbox and menu buttons, and a pair of large, domed buttons that can be easily pressed with whatever body part the player users, even if they have very little strength and coordination. The $99 controller is also set up to work with external peripherals for foot control and more.

According to Reuters , the Governor of the US Federal Reserve, Lael Brainard, expressed concerns about cryptocurrency. In her opinion, they represent a serious problem. FedCoin is cancelled\nEarly, in an interview with the former Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank, Kevin Warsh spoke in favor of the release of FedCoin, the official cryptocurrency of the FED.\nBut this time the current Governor of the Federal Reserve put an end to this issue. She stated the following:\n“There is no compelling demonstrated need for a Fed-issued digital currency”\n“Although central bank digital currencies may be able to overcome some of the particular vulnerabilities that cryptocurrencies face, they too have significant challenges related to cybersecurity, money laundering, and the retail financial system.” Federal Reserve Fears Cryptocurrency , but not too\nAt the Fed conference in San Francisco, Lael Brainard discussed in detail and in depth issues concerning bitcoin and other digital currencies. This is the first time when representatives of the FED discuss cryptocurrencies in such detail. Proceeding from this, we can conclude that they are seriously studying this sphere.\nConcerning the danger of spreading cryptocurrency, she expressed the following:\n“Cryptocurrencies are strikingly innovative but also pose challenges”\nassociated with speculative dynamics, investor and consumer protections, and money-laundering risks. ”\nBut she also discussed on the positive side of digital currencies. Noted the potential of the underlying technology for payments and the possibility that digital coins may have limited application for transactions between banks and certain payments in financial markets.\nRegarding the size of the threat, she also gently noted that their volume in the overall financial system is so small that they represent a small risk of stability. Conclusions\nIn general, from her words, it was possible to conclude that cryptocurrencies present some danger, although not very great. Basically, the Federal Reserve fears cryptocurrency . But at the same time, they do not believe that the time has come for the society to accept digital currencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://telegram.me/share/url?url=https://alextones.com/us-federal-reserve-fears-cryptocurrency&text=US", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-brainard/feds-brainard-sees-no-compelling-case-for-fed-digital-currency-idUSKCN1IG3G8"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lael brai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin warsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lael brainard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve fears bitcoin us federal reserve fears cryptocurrency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:40:24.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bba0917962acf2bb980a7a82dba0e263b0ef36ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCsQTTr.SE3D8rdj2_ddDk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Will Bitcoin become a long-term trusted store of value?", "title_full": "Will Bitcoin become a long-term trusted store of value?", "published": "2018-05-17T09:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bba0917962acf2bb980a7a82dba0e263b0ef36ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCsQTTr.SE3D8rdj2_ddDk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Vaskiy", "published": "2018-05-17T09:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will Bitcoin become a long-term trusted store of value?", "text": "Quote: from: chibimanau on May 17, 2018, 12:52:27 AM Quote: from: Indrawan77 on March 05, 2018, 09:29:29 AM Yes it can be used for long term investment but the price of 2 million per bitcoin is too high, it's possible but it will take time and the chances is pretty slim, but for sure it will be very profitable if we keep bitcoin for long term, there are some positive news that makes the chances of bitcoin grow big\nTake a look at the early years of Bitcoin, no one can think it has reached over $18,000. $2,000,000 is a very high level but I think nothing is impossible, for a long time to come. I am investing in Bitcoin and I encourage people to do so in the long term.\nOf course, Bitcoin will become a reliable and valuable store in the future. Maybe not for long.\nWhat's been mentioned is the true fact. Apart from this we need to know the growth it has acquired over time.
