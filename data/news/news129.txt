She quickly took to local online forums and in-town pet communities, posting pictures of the dog and her telephone number while asking people to call her right away if they had seen him.\nWithin a few days, she received a text message from a burner phone demanding $600 in Bitcoin or else Happy would be sold off or even killed. The scammer claimed to be using a burner phone, supposedly so that the call couldn't be traced, and advised Howell not to go to the police.\nThe only issue was Howell had been reunited with Happy earlier that day thanks to the help of someone who had seen the online post. Apparently, the scammer had found her personal phone number from the lost dog advertisements.\nHowell immediately recognized it as a scam as she could literally see her dog. She reported the call to the police, who said that they had heard of similar cases from around the country.\nFake Threats Becoming Common Another North Carolina resident and his duo of dogs also fell victim to the same scam. After posting his information on websites that look to help people find lost dogs, he received an all-too-similar text message from a burner phone, demanding approximately $2,000 in Bitcoin or his dogs would be killed in less than ten days. Like the case with Howell, the dogs were already back with the owner before the text message was sent out.\nIt seems scammers are hoping that the attachment that owners have for their pets will convince them to pay up. Not to mention the ease of Bitcoin transactions along with the lack of actually having to physically receive any ransom demand. In the end, Howell says it best when she states:\nThey need to find a better way to make money. They need to leave people alone and realize that what they're doing is hurtful and so cruel.\nWhat do you think about these recent scams? What do you do to protect yourself from them?

With the bears already on the offensive following the recent sell-off, prices are likely to suffer if bitcoin closes on Sunday below the key support, currently seen at $7,611. More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency has not traded below the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended.\nAs of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,449 on Bitfinex, having dropped below the 50-week MA on May 23.\nAs seen on the chart above, the long-term moving average had acted as a strong support in the first quarter. BTC found strong bids in mid April following the repeated failure (marked by a circle) on the part of the bears to penetrate the 50-week MA.\nSubsequently, the rally from the 50-week MA to $9,990 (May 5 high) reinforced the moving average as a strong long-term support. Hence, a downside break would raise the odds of a slide to fresh 2017 lows below $6,000.\nLooking ahead, price chart analysis suggests that bitcoin is likely to end the week below the key $7,611 level.\nTo start with, the weekly relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory) and trending south in favor of the bears.\nThe RSI has also found acceptance below the key support zone of 53.55–55.00, which only strengthens the bear case.\nMeanwhile, the daily chart below also shows scope for a drop below $7,000. The bears currently have the upper hand, as indicated by the lower highs and lower lows pattern, downside break of the channel, downward sloping (bearish) 5-day and 10-day MAs.\nThe RSI is holding below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but well above 30.00 (oversold region), indicating room for sell-off to $6,870 (triangle support).\nDespite the bullish price RSI divergence on the hourly chart, BTC failed to cross the falling trendline hurdle, underscoring the strong bearish sentiment in the market.\nView\n- BTC looks set to close below the 50-week MA (at $7,611) for the first time since October 2015, signaling a major bearish breakdown and opening the doors for a re-test of $6,000 (2018 low).\n- A corrective rally may save the day for the bulls, however, the probability of a bearish weekly close below the 50-week MA will remain high as long as bitcoin is trading below $8,644 (May 21 high).

Berkat solusi 2 wallet yang unik, Rainbow Currency selalu transparan, terdesentralisasi, dan aman di blockchain, sementara pembayaran sehari-hari untuk belanja dan layanan dapat dilakukan secara online dan di Titik Penjualan Lokal (POS = Point Of Sales) dengan cepat, aman, dan tanpa biaya. Rainbow Currency didukung oleh United American Capital Corporation, yang telah didirikan di Oregon. Tujuan bisnis utama American Capital Corporation adalah berinvestasi pada perusahaan start up yang menjanjikan, salah satunya adalah SafeZone. Rainbow Currency dirancang untuk mencegah orang jahat yang berada di luar sana untuk menggunakannya karena Anda perlu mengidentifikasi diri Anda sebelum Anda dapat mulai membelanjakannya secara online dan offline meskipun Point of Sales (POS). Rainbow Currency memiliki tiga denominasi - Rainbow yang berisi 1.000 Glitters, Glitter yang berisi 1.000 Twinkles and Twinkle yang merupakan denominasi terendah dalam Rainbow Currency dan akan diperdagangkan di pasar terbuka. Hanya ada 100 miliar twinkles secara total dan jumlah ini tidak dapat ditingkatkan selamanya. Ini berarti karena lebih banyak pengguna di seluruh dunia menggunakan Rainbow Currency sebagai cara pembayaran, permintaan akan Rainbow Currency akan meningkat sementara pasokan tetap. Kedua kekuatan pasar ini akan menghasilkan harga Rainbow untuk bangkit. Safe Zone adalah anak perusahaan Unicorn Network yang berbasis di Las Vegas, AS yang didirikan pada tahun 2011 dengan lebih dari 4.000 anggota tersebar di seluruh dunia dan sekarang memiliki lebih dari 30 anak perusahaan yang melakukan bisnis online dan offline baik di seluruh dunia maupun lokal. Anak-anak Perusahaan Unicorn Network tersebut sekarang masuk ke Safe Zone satu per satu bersama-sama dengan perusahaan lain yang tidak ada dalam keluarga Unicorn Network yang telah direkomendasikan oleh anggota-anggotanya di seluruh dunia dan telah memilih untuk bergabung dalam jaringan terbuka setelah bisnis mereka direkomendasikan ke dalam keanggotaan Safe Zone. Hanya bisnis berkualitas yang direkomendasikan oleh anggota Unicorn Network (sekarang jutaan dan terus bertambah setiap hari) yang diizinkan bergabung dengan Safe Zone untuk mempromosikan dan menjual produk / layanan mereka kepada pengguna Safe Zona dengan syarat bahwa bisnis tersebut siap untuk mematuhi keamanan, privasi dan standar kualitas yang dibutuhkan oleh Safe Zone. Ini disebut Safe Zone (Zona Aman) karena semua bisnis yang bergabung dengan jaringan terbuka Safe Zone dengan situs web mereka akan dipindai setiap hari oleh Safe Zone untuk memastikan bahwa tidak ada virus, malware, hacker, dan kode berbahaya lainnya yang ada di situs web mereka untuk melindungi pengguna Safe Zone dan bisnis mereka yang tergabung dari serangan kode berbahaya yang disematkan di situs web mereka. Bisnis yang dihosting di Safe Zone dapat mengiklankan dan menjual produk / layanan mereka ke basis anggota Unicorn Network yang tumbuh setiap hari berkat model bisnis afiliasi Safe Zone yang unik dan menguntungkan yang dibuat oleh We Share Success Inc., anak perusahaan lain dari Unicorn Network, yang memungkinkan anggota untuk dibayar komisi pasif kedalaman 5 generasi tanpa kewajiban untuk membeli atau menjual apapun untuk mendapatkan komisi pasif tersebut ketika Anda mengundang pembeli untuk membeli produk / layanan di Safe Zone, saat Anda dan undangan merekomendasikan bisnis di Safe Zone, saat Anda dan undangan mengundang orang-orang Safe Zone untuk mengunjungi bisnis yang direkomendasikan di bidang bisnis dan penjualan paket bisnis Safe Zone mereka, saat Anda dan undangan mengundang Dokter untuk berpasangan dengan anak perusahaan Happy Health dari Unicorn Network, dan banyak peluang pendapatan afiliasi lainnya yang tersedia di Safe Zone. Selain komisi pasif di atas, anggota dibayar komisi aktif saat mereka menggunakan tautan undangan mereka untuk menjual produk / layanan Safe Zone kepada orang lain, mereka dibayar DealPoints yang memungkinkan mereka untuk melakukan belanja gratis di Free Shopping Club di Safe Zone dan di Twinkles, karena aktivitas mereka di Safe Zone dan orang-orang yang diundang pada kedalaman 5 generasi. Dengan diperkenalkannya Rainbow Currency, anggota sekarang akan mendapatkan diskon eksklusif tambahan hingga 5% saat mereka membeli produk / layanan di Safe Zone menggunakan Twinkles mereka daripada membayar menggunakan mata uang lainnya. Ingat, hanya ada 100 miliar twinkles secara total dan jumlah ini tidak dapat ditingkatkan selamanya. Hanya dalam waktu 9 hari sejak Rainbow Currency dijual di hadapan para pemangku kepentingannya di seluruh dunia pada masa ICO, lebih dari 30 miliar Twinkles terjual. Dan sekarang masa ICO telah berlalu. Sekitar 35 miliar koin telah terjual selama ICO. Itu berarti sekitar 65 miliar koin yang masih bebas. 5 miliar koin akan diberikan ke yayasan Rainbow Currency, sesuai anggaran mereka selama bertahun-tahun, sehingga mereka bisa menjadi penjaga dan perwakilan Rainbow Currency. Jadi, itu menyisakan (sekitar) 60 miliar koin lagi untuk didistribusikan ke seluruh dunia. Dan, inilah fakta yang paling penting, tidak satu pun dari 60 miliar Twinkles yang tersisa akan dijual, semuanya akan diberikan kepada anggota. 50% dari koin ini, yaitu (sekitar) 30 miliar koin, akan digunakan untuk memberi imbalan kepada anggota Rainbow Currency untuk kegiatan afiliasi, sehingga mereka akan dibayar sebagai komisi dan bonus dalam Safe Zone. Sementara 50% lainnya, yaitu 30 miliar koin akan digunakan sebagai hadiah untuk aktivitas di Safe Zone. Saat ini, satu-satunya cara untuk menerima satu atau lebih dari 60 miliar Twinkles yang tersisa adalah aktif. Tidak ada kesempatan lagi untuk membelinya di Safe Zone. Jika Anda ingin membeli Twinkles Anda hanya bisa melakukannya di bursa kriptocurrency, tapi itu adalah Twinkles yang dijual oleh anggota. Dan untuk bisnis, tentu saja ada cara lain untuk mengumpulkan Twinkles, dan itu adalah dengan menerima Twinkles sebagai metode pembayaran. Rainbow Currency mulai diperdagangkan di bursa koin (pasar sekunder) dengan harga US$ 0,01 pada 15 November 2017. Dan hari ini (31 Desember 2017) harganya naik lebih dari 1.570 % menjadi US$ 0,167 / Twinkle. Sebuah kenaikan yang cukup signifikan. Salah satu petinggi Safe Zone pernah berbicara di skype, bahwa harapannya di akhir 2018 setidaknya harga menjadi US$ 100 / Twinkle. Dan itu sudah luar biasa, menciptakan para miliarder baru di seluruh dunia, dan mungkin Anda salah satunya.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://go-bisnisonline.blogspot.co.id/", "https://go-bisnisonline.blogspot.co.id/2017/12/safezone-standar-baru-dalam-privasi.html", "https://go-bisnisonline.blogspot.co.il/2017/12/rainbow-currency-mata-uang-global-yang.html", "https://go-bisnisonline.blogspot.co.id/2017/12/rainbow-currency-twinkle-crypto.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zona aman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "titik penjualan lokal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mata uang global yang akan menggeser bitcoin domain & hosting crypto currency rainbow currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainbow currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american capital corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united american capital corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T20:28:48.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fcebd9b3486565a712add127e45e780b7bd7e7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cVsry0F0PBOo_IAfIocV2w0TXE3YLzGsOHykNMqR_334NwHD2HYTtwrfFjt7x5S.ctaWiPql4ed5CoBMtJpGhAct_zzMlU23vNfOfoWEC7jsJ1wUQYD2YkRo9Bb3G8hRlkYkl1CJ1UL748PhIaQVH2KgKTwOVvFLNOZxD_hp5FGHAJcrje2uvWcZTTJJJfbFtWh4mx054Rx6wz.kPGQcQKkWspUXkVzxZNmOG4I8ARA--", "site_full": "www.briefreport.co.uk", "site": "briefreport.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.briefreport.co.uk/feed.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BriefReport.co.uk", "title": "'These crypto-currency crooks are utterly ruthless': Alan Sugar is the latest high-profile figure to be used in a scourge of Bitcoin scams", "title_full": "'These crypto-currency crooks are utterly ruthless': Alan Sugar is the latest high-profile figure to be used in a scourge of Bitcoin scams", "published": "2018-05-27T00:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fcebd9b3486565a712add127e45e780b7bd7e7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9cVsry0F0PBOo_IAfIocV2w0TXE3YLzGsOHykNMqR_334NwHD2HYTtwrfFjt7x5S.ctaWiPql4ed5CoBMtJpGhAct_zzMlU23vNfOfoWEC7jsJ1wUQYD2YkRo9Bb3G8hRlkYkl1CJ1UL748PhIaQVH2KgKTwOVvFLNOZxD_hp5FGHAJcrje2uvWcZTTJJJfbFtWh4mx054Rx6wz.kPGQcQKkWspUXkVzxZNmOG4I8ARA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T00:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "'These crypto-currency crooks are utterly ruthless': Alan Sugar is the latest high-profile figure to be used in a scourge of Bitcoin scams", "text": "Search 'These crypto-currency crooks are utterly ruthless': Alan Sugar is the latest high-profile figure to be used in a scourge of Bitcoin scams\nInvestors keen to join the ‘crypto-craze’ are being warned to steer clear of phoney firms claiming household names back their projects.

Given that the US dollar is inflationary by design, 1 dollar to a 1 cent buying power has essentially already occurred. The buying power of 4 cents in 1913 is equivalent to the buying power of 1 dollar today (Source: http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ ) to put that in perspective, a bitcoin is worth only $300 USD in 1913 money.\nI don't see that a satoshi/dollar equivalency issue is problematic so long as the buying power of a satoshi remains reasonable, and as Monstrum's evaluation of the market cap suggests, a massive amount of cryptocurrency would have to have been lost/destroyed to create such a deficit of supply and demand, so much so that the current iteration of the bitcoin network would be unfeasible, a hard fork or altcoin would be adopted I suppose.

It costs energy, electricity, & manual labor.\nIt costs significantly less to produce cryptocurrencies.\n— Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 24, 2018\nPerhaps a better way to phrase the statement was to replace energy with resources, as fiat currencies do require significantly more resources than cryptocurrencies. Myth\nCurrently, the vast majority of people are comparing bitcoin’s electricity consumption to the production of paper money at central banks like the Federal Reserve, dismissing manual labor, energy, and electricity required to distribute and transfer money.\nFiat requires commercial banks, central banks, ATMs, armored cars, hundreds of thousands of employees, among other things to work. The central bank, in this case the FED, does not magically distribute the US dollar to every person in the country at their doorstep. The FED distributes its US dollar to banks and its friends, who then distribute money with the hopes of trickling down the US dollar to the bottom of the economy.\nCash requires a truly massive infrastructure to function. In the US alone, there are more than 6,000 banks that process cash transactions. Most people no longer uses cash in its physical form to transact. They rely on third party service providers and banks like JPMorgan, Visa, and MasterCard to process payments. The amount of resources and energy these companies and their hundreds of thousands of employees consume should be included in the comparison between the energy consumption of bitcoin against banks.\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer financial network and due its decentralized nature, no third party is required to transact. Alice can send Bob $100 by broadcasting the transaction to the mempool, which is than picked up by miners to process. In return, miners are incentivized by receiving bitcoin and transaction fees included in the block.\nHence, while it may be accurate to claim it requires more electricity to mine cryptocurrency, it is false to claim that to create or generate bitcoin, more resources are required than to create cash or paper money, as the majority of the energy used by the miners is attributable to confirming and validating transactions, which most of the banks do globally. Improvement Bitcoin Mining Farm\nJohn Lilic, member at Ethereum blockchain development studio ConsenSys, stated that the cost per transaction is significantly higher with crypto and that is undoubtedly correct. Major banks like JPMorgan processes trillions of dollars on a daily basis. Lilic said that in the long-term, blockchain projects will have to find better ways to process transactions and information more efficiently.\n“The per unit cost of each tx is significantly higher with crypto. Data centres banks use are much more efficient than mining operations & legacy systems process orders of magnitude more tx’s per day than crypto. We need specificity around the energy issue, not conjecture. The real question is whether the gross energy inefficiency costs in crypto is worth the benefits like custody over assets. My contention is Yes! It is worth it but only if our industry prioritizes & continues to work towards energy efficiency gains like Proof of Stake.”\nAs cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology mature, they will experiment with more efficient methods of consensus algorithms and mining methods that may decrease the energy output of cryptocurrencies in the long-term.\nImages from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/iamjosephyoung/status/999565178382385153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin franklin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fiat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T02:23:48.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bee94fe0a2a3959a5b031d6fd94744c621d0a239", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGpPoOPXz4GfUWpLKT2vTAVRn0h49eFTMqxI.EF9omcnZSM1avhX10yI-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Chat from r/Bitcoin", "title_full": "Chat from r/Bitcoin : btc", "published": "2018-05-27T00:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bee94fe0a2a3959a5b031d6fd94744c621d0a239", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGpPoOPXz4GfUWpLKT2vTAVRn0h49eFTMqxI.EF9omcnZSM1avhX10yI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GolferRama", "published": "2018-05-27T00:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chat from r/Bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/GolferRama\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T19:42:52.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35e1e0a0c06b57b90b74eca06a118cbe2b65d6e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSp0Q.woTJktmCxC3Emfqbc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=71.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Games and rounds", "title": "[DAILY FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 26.0 BITCOIN COIN", "title_full": "[DAILY FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 26.0 BITCOIN COIN", "published": "2018-05-27T00:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35e1e0a0c06b57b90b74eca06a118cbe2b65d6e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSp0Q.woTJktmCxC3Emfqbc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "krogothmanhattan", "published": "2018-05-27T00:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "[DAILY FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 26.0 BITCOIN COIN", "text": "Yes...I am still in a good mood so giving out a BITCOIN coin.\nFirst come first served.

Economy Man accidentally threw away $79 million worth of Bitcoin Michael Kaplan, New York Post May 27, 2018 4:19pm\nAFTER Matthew Mellon, scion of the Mellon banking fortune, died on April 16 of a drug-related heart attack in Mexico, his family was unable to locate the pass code needed to retrieve his fortune — said to have been worth as much as $1 billion — in XRP cryptocurrency, according to the Daily Mail.\nLosing passwords is the kind of nightmare that haunts bitcoin investors. In fact, there are an estimated three million bitcoins — totalling nearly $33 billion — lost because the retrieval codes have gone missing or the currency owners died without passing the codes onto their next of kin.\nJust ask James Howells — who lost a hard drive with the key to more than $79 million in bitcoin.\n“I mined more than 7500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” said the IT worker turned crypto investor, 32, who lives in Newport, Wales.\nmedia_camera James Howells threw away his Bitcoin key.\n“Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my bitcoin private keys,” Howells recalled. “I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information.”\nIn 2008, bitcoin’s alleged creator Satoshi Nakamoto published an open-source code through which bitcoins are “mined” by solving complex calculations, embedded throughout the internet, via extremely powerful computers. There is a finite number of 21 million bitcoins.\nPart of cryptocurrency’s appeal is that it’s anonymous, untraceable and can only be retrieved by the person with the private key. Randomly generated by the Bitcoin algorithm, these can be more than 50 characters long — not exactly something you can memorise.\n“People put them on laptops, storage drives, USBs,” said Brian Stoeckert, a legal consultant in the crypto field. “Lose one of them without having it backed up, and you are out of luck.”\nHowells didn’t realise the value of his coins for a few weeks after he lost them. “I looked up the price, did the calculation ... and thought, ‘S **tt. [My investment is] worth around $2 [million] or $3 million.’ A few months later it was worth $9.9 million [$A13 million]. I was annoyed, pissed off, sick. I spoke to the people at the landfill and told them that I threw away a hard drive worth $10 million. They looked at me stupidly.”\nHis story echoes a plot line in the recently wrapped season of the HBO show Silicon Valley , where blowhard venture capitalist Russ Hanneman, played by Chris Diamantopoulos, is seen leading a crew of hired trash pickers at the local dump, on a mission to turn up a mistakenly discarded thumb drive that contained the code needed to retrieve his $300 million in bitcoin.\nmedia_camera A scene from HBO’s Silicon Valley. Picture: Ali Paige Goldstein/HBO\n“We heard a lot of stories about people having incredibly long numbers [as their pass codes, known as private keys] and losing them,” series creator Mike Judge told The Post . “There’s definitely a part of the tech culture, Silicon Valley in particular, where people take pride in failure. But I don’t think losing a hard drive with your Bitcoin code on it falls into that category. I think it happens more than people want to admit.”\nAtlanta-based software developer Syl Turner, 33, can relate. After mining two bitcoins in 2010, he didn’t give much thought to the cryptocurrency and ended up moving the computer to his attic when he bought a new one.\nThen, “last November, [the value of a bitcoin] hit $10,000 [$A13,200]. Everybody was talking about bitcoin, and it seemed like I should go into the attic to find the computer,” he said.\nHe found what he was looking for but had inadvertently written over the hard drive — erasing his private key. “I’m pretty sure I wrote over it because bitcoin had no real monetary value at the time I did it,” Turner said.\nSo why don’t more people keep better track of their magic numbers? “It’s problematic in that if you have your code written down in too many places, people can find it and take your money,” said Judge. “But if it’s in too few places, you may not be able to find it yourself.”\nWhich can become a nightmare when investors pass away without having shared their private keys with their heirs.\nAccording to Michael Yang, who runs a cryptocurrency exchange in the Bay Area, “One of my friends had half of a bitcoin private key in his hand and half in his [business] partner’s hand. Then the partner passed away.” Now, the living friend cannot access the funds.\n“It’s a tragedy,” Yang added. “They had at least 500 bitcoins” — worth around $5.3 million. (A source close to Mellon’s family, meanwhile, denied they were unable to locate his money.)\nSome believe that bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Nakamoto, may have lost his private key.

scion of the Mellon banking fortune, died on April 16 of a drug-related heart attack in Mexico, his family was unable to locate the pass code needed to retrieve his fortune — said to have been worth as much as $1 billion — in XRP cryptocurrency, according to the Daily Mail.\nLosing passwords is the kind of nightmare that haunts bitcoin investors. In fact, there are an estimated three million bitcoins — totalling nearly $33 billion — lost because the retrieval codes have gone missing or the currency owners died without passing the codes onto their next of kin.\nJust ask James Howells — who lost a hard drive with the key to more than $79 million in bitcoin.\n“I mined more than 7500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” said the IT worker turned crypto investor, 32, who lives in Newport, Wales.\nmedia_camera James Howells threw away his Bitcoin key.\n“Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my bitcoin private keys,” Howells recalled. “I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information.”\nIn 2008, bitcoin’s alleged creator Satoshi Nakamoto published an open-source code through which bitcoins are “mined” by solving complex calculations, embedded throughout the internet, via extremely powerful computers. There is a finite number of 21 million bitcoins.\nPart of cryptocurrency’s appeal is that it’s anonymous, untraceable and can only be retrieved by the person with the private key. Randomly generated by the Bitcoin algorithm, these can be more than 50 characters long — not exactly something you can memorise.\n“People put them on laptops, storage drives, USBs,” said Brian Stoeckert, a legal consultant in the crypto field. “Lose one of them without having it backed up, and you are out of luck.”\nHowells didn’t realise the value of his coins for a few weeks after he lost them. “I looked up the price, did the calculation ... and thought, ‘S **tt. [My investment is] worth around $2 [million] or $3 million.’ A few months later it was worth $9.9 million [$A13 million]. I was annoyed, pissed off, sick. I spoke to the people at the landfill and told them that I threw away a hard drive worth $10 million. They looked at me stupidly.”\nHis story echoes a plot line in the recently wrapped season of the HBO show Silicon Valley , where blowhard venture capitalist Russ Hanneman, played by Chris Diamantopoulos, is seen leading a crew of hired trash pickers at the local dump, on a mission to turn up a mistakenly discarded thumb drive that contained the code needed to retrieve his $300 million in bitcoin.\nmedia_camera A scene from HBO’s Silicon Valley. Picture: Ali Paige Goldstein/HBO\n“We heard a lot of stories about people having incredibly long numbers [as their pass codes, known as private keys] and losing them,” series creator Mike Judge told The Post . “There’s definitely a part of the tech culture, Silicon Valley in particular, where people take pride in failure. But I don’t think losing a hard drive with your Bitcoin code on it falls into that category. I think it happens more than people want to admit.”\nAtlanta-based software developer Syl Turner, 33, can relate. After mining two bitcoins in 2010, he didn’t give much thought to the cryptocurrency and ended up moving the computer to his attic when he bought a new one.\nThen, “last November, [the value of a bitcoin] hit $10,000 [$A13,200]. Everybody was talking about bitcoin, and it seemed like I should go into the attic to find the computer,” he said.\nHe found what he was looking for but had inadvertently written over the hard drive — erasing his private key. “I’m pretty sure I wrote over it because bitcoin had no real monetary value at the time I did it,” Turner said.\nSo why don’t more people keep better track of their magic numbers? “It’s problematic in that if you have your code written down in too many places, people can find it and take your money,” said Judge. “But if it’s in too few places, you may not be able to find it yourself.”\nWhich can become a nightmare when investors pass away without having shared their private keys with their heirs.\nAccording to Michael Yang, who runs a cryptocurrency exchange in the Bay Area, “One of my friends had half of a bitcoin private key in his hand and half in his [business] partner’s hand. Then the partner passed away.” Now, the living friend cannot access the funds.\n“It’s a tragedy,” Yang added. “They had at least 500 bitcoins” — worth around $5.3 million. (A source close to Mellon’s family, meanwhile, denied they were unable to locate his money.)\nSome believe that bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Nakamoto, may have lost his private key. (Another theory is that he committed suicide and failed to leave the pass code behind.)\n“None of the [1 million] coins he mined have moved,” said Kim Grauer, senior economist with Chainalysis, a Manhattan-based digital forensics firm. “It’s odd that they have not been cashed out.”\nIf an investor remembers at least a portion of a pass code, a talented hacker could potentially use software to decrypt it.

Economy Man accidentally threw away $79 million worth of Bitcoin Michael Kaplan, New York Post May 27, 2018 4:19pm Share this on Twitter social-twitter_circle Share this by Email social-email_circle\nAFTER Matthew Mellon, scion of the Mellon banking fortune, died on April 16 of a drug-related heart attack in Mexico, his family was unable to locate the pass code needed to retrieve his fortune — said to have been worth as much as $1 billion — in XRP cryptocurrency, according to the Daily Mail.\nLosing passwords is the kind of nightmare that haunts bitcoin investors. In fact, there are an estimated three million bitcoins — totalling nearly $33 billion — lost because the retrieval codes have gone missing or the currency owners died without passing the codes onto their next of kin.\nJust ask James Howells — who lost a hard drive with the key to more than $79 million in bitcoin.\n“I mined more than 7500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” said the IT worker turned crypto investor, 32, who lives in Newport, Wales.\nmedia_camera James Howells threw away his Bitcoin key.\n“Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my bitcoin private keys,” Howells recalled. “I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information.”\nIn 2008, bitcoin’s alleged creator Satoshi Nakamoto published an open-source code through which bitcoins are “mined” by solving complex calculations, embedded throughout the internet, via extremely powerful computers. There is a finite number of 21 million bitcoins.\nPart of cryptocurrency’s appeal is that it’s anonymous, untraceable and can only be retrieved by the person with the private key. Randomly generated by the Bitcoin algorithm, these can be more than 50 characters long — not exactly something you can memorise.\n“People put them on laptops, storage drives, USBs,” said Brian Stoeckert, a legal consultant in the crypto field. “Lose one of them without having it backed up, and you are out of luck.”\nHowells didn’t realise the value of his coins for a few weeks after he lost them. “I looked up the price, did the calculation ... and thought, ‘S **tt. [My investment is] worth around $2 [million] or $3 million.’ A few months later it was worth $9.9 million [$A13 million]. I was annoyed, pissed off, sick. I spoke to the people at the landfill and told them that I threw away a hard drive worth $10 million. They looked at me stupidly.”\nHis story echoes a plot line in the recently wrapped season of the HBO show Silicon Valley , where blowhard venture capitalist Russ Hanneman, played by Chris Diamantopoulos, is seen leading a crew of hired trash pickers at the local dump, on a mission to turn up a mistakenly discarded thumb drive that contained the code needed to retrieve his $300 million in bitcoin.\nmedia_camera A scene from HBO’s Silicon Valley. Picture: Ali Paige Goldstein/HBO\n“We heard a lot of stories about people having incredibly long numbers [as their pass codes, known as private keys] and losing them,” series creator Mike Judge told The Post . “There’s definitely a part of the tech culture, Silicon Valley in particular, where people take pride in failure. But I don’t think losing a hard drive with your Bitcoin code on it falls into that category. I think it happens more than people want to admit.”\nAtlanta-based software developer Syl Turner, 33, can relate. After mining two bitcoins in 2010, he didn’t give much thought to the cryptocurrency and ended up moving the computer to his attic when he bought a new one.\nThen, “last November, [the value of a bitcoin] hit $10,000 [$A13,200]. Everybody was talking about bitcoin, and it seemed like I should go into the attic to find the computer,” he said.\nHe found what he was looking for but had inadvertently written over the hard drive — erasing his private key. “I’m pretty sure I wrote over it because bitcoin had no real monetary value at the time I did it,” Turner said.\nSo why don’t more people keep better track of their magic numbers? “It’s problematic in that if you have your code written down in too many places, people can find it and take your money,” said Judge. “But if it’s in too few places, you may not be able to find it yourself.”\nWhich can become a nightmare when investors pass away without having shared their private keys with their heirs.\nAccording to Michael Yang, who runs a cryptocurrency exchange in the Bay Area, “One of my friends had half of a bitcoin private key in his hand and half in his [business] partner’s hand. Then the partner passed away.” Now, the living friend cannot access the funds.\n“It’s a tragedy,” Yang added. “They had at least 500 bitcoins” — worth around $5.3 million. (A source close to Mellon’s family, meanwhile, denied they were unable to locate his money.)\nSome believe that bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Nakamoto, may have lost his private key. (Another theory is that he committed suicide and failed to leave the pass code behind.)\n“None of the [1 million] coins he mined have moved,” said Kim Grauer, senior economist with Chainalysis, a Manhattan-based digital forensics firm. “It’s odd that they have not been cashed out.”\nIf an investor remembers at least a portion of a pass code, a talented hacker could potentially use software to decrypt it. For someone like Howells, however, who has no clues to go on, “hacking it would take a couple billion years and require all the energy of the sun”.\nInstead, he’s offered the town of Newport 10 per cent of the bitcoins’ value if they’ll let him excavate the landfill. So far, they’ve denied his requests.\nFor the time being, Howells views the dump as the ultimate safe. “Nobody else can get in there and take my hard drive,” he said. “It’s like having $75 million in the bank, but you cannot get into the bank account.”\nTurner, however, has learned his lesson and is done.\n“I have no crypto now and have little desire to get more,” he said. “Some [aspects] of it are fascinating. But it also seems like a cult.”\nmedia_camera There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins created and their worth fluctuates.

Reports about these promising developments in the labor market and the public sector come from Australia. Also, the Slovak tax authority intends to use blockchain technology for more efficient tax collection. Also read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash Crypto-Based Hiring Platform Supports Instant Pay Option A new employment service offers to cut out banks and pay workers in real-time using cryptocurrency. Another feature will rate employees using a blockchain-based reputation and review process, designed to ensure that higher quality work gets paid better. The “Pay As You Go” system has been launched recently in Australia. Sergei Sergienko, the entrepreneur behind the project, claims that instant salary payments are possible with cryptos, tokens, and thanks to the underlying technology – blockchain. His “global job platform” Laborx is developed to do exactly that – pay employees while they are working, so that everyone can start spending on the way home. “The way for people to be remunerated is based on pre-Industrial Revolution kind of wages – you spend the time in the factory, and you get paid,” he said, quoted by Business Insider Australia . “If you look around, everything else has changed. And it’s really, really weird that the way people get paid for their services, for their time, for their work, has not gone through any revolution of sorts,” Sergienko noted. The businessman, who owns a successful labor hire, staffing and training company called the Edway Group, believes that the revolution comes in the form of the “Labour-Hour Tokens” (LHT) and the hiring ecosystem of Laborx, which is now live in beta version. Using it, companies can hire anyone – from top experts from around the world, to local fruit pickers – and pay them instantly with cryptocurrency. “A fair hour’s pay for a fair hour’s work” has been promised. Laborx also features a tokenized reputation system. Its developers say that it combines dozens of candidate data points and stores the information on a blockchain. The platform is said to ensure job seekers get their best market rate, while also eliminating payment delays and disputes. “If your reviews are consistently good, you can charge more per hour for your services. And the person who hires you knows you’re worth it,” Sergei Sergienko explains. Other cryptocurrency projects to be trialing this model include time-based “knowledge transfer” service Whenhub , founded by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. Distributed Ledger to Be Used For Welfare Delivery While the private sector has been developing a crypto-hiring platform, Australian authorities have been planning to employ blockchain technology to improve the welfare payments delivery in the country. The intentions were made public recently by the Digital Transformation Agency, a government body tasked with the digitization of public services and government institutions. The project to put social security payments on blockchain will pilot the wider implementation of the technology. “Our plan is to look for use cases across the Commonwealth with an initial focus on the welfare payment delivery system. Then, working with our digital service standard, we’ll conduct user research with a view to having a prototype by the end of next financial year,” said DTA’s acting CEO Randall Brugeaud during the Cebit Australia conference in Sidney last week. Recently, The DTA received AU$700,000 from the 2018-19 budget to probe the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the public sector. Brugeaud commented that the funds will give his agency an opportunity to explore innovative ways to securely and efficiently deliver government services using blockchain. Slovak Tax Authority Eyes Blockchain for Efficient Collection The Financial Administration of Slovakia aims to become a pioneer in blockchain technology implementation. The tax authority in Bratislava intends to use it to streamline its processes and procedures. The main objective is to make tax collection more efficient, the president of Finančná Správa , František Imrecze told Hospodárske Noviny . The technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, will be implemented in Slovakia’s taxation system to initially process about 2 percent of all tax payments, the publication details. The use of blockchain technologies is expected to increase the trust of taxpayers and protect their personal data. Authorities also hope to increase the transparency of tax collection, reduce red tape and minimize costs, Imrecze explained. Members of the local crypto community and the non-government sector are not sure about the prospects of the project. According to Martin Lindák, analyst with the liberal think-tank F. A. Hayek Foundation, the transparency and security of blockchain applications are there only when they are decentralized. A blockchain lacking this key feature would be just an overpriced database for the public administration, Lindák warned in conversation with the newspaper.

Bchpls is currently in open beta which means the public can test the software at their own discretion, so news.Bitcoin.com decided to test the program’s feature services. Also read: Chinese Exchange Launching Southeast Asian Crypto Trading Hub Giving the New PoS System Bchpls.io a Test Run This week we decided to test out a new PoS system specifically designed for merchants who want to accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at any physical location. The application called Bchpls.io is free, and there are no servers needed as all it takes is an internet connection and two devices (cashier & customer). Merchants can accept the funds into any wallet of their choice and set up the name of their business on the invoice. Funds are sent to a one-time-only address as a new address is used for each sale so incoming revenue is kept private. Setting Up a Store Name and Fiat Currency Pair for Pricing When entering the website users are greeted with a purple-orange themed page that asks the user to sign up. After hitting the register tab the merchant enters a valid email address and sets a strong password to set up their account. The next screen asks the merchant to add the store name and the fiat currency they wish to use to calculate BCH invoices. Following this step the user has to tether a Bitcoin Cash wallet to the store account and Bchpls uses the Xpub (extended public keys) to generate a receiving address on the cashier side. Tethering a Wallet to Bchpls.io With Extended Public Keys Using the Bitcoin.com Wallet simply create a new wallet with the store’s name and go to the section called “wallet information.” The next screen will reveal the BCH wallet’s Xpub keys, after scrolling down to the bottom. Tap the Xpub section and the Bitcoin.com Wallet will automatically copy and paste the extended public keys. Paste this text into the Bchpls page where it says ‘derivation path,” and hit next. After that, the merchant is all set, and a page is created which shows information for an access key, cashier screen, and the customer screen. Both screens provide a URL with a QR code created on the invoice page. Unfortunately, there is no address section yet available to copy and paste, as the invoice only supplies a QR code that needs to be scanned. After the merchant set-up is complete the account holder simply registers a sale on the platform which calculates a new invoice every time. Merchants can also cancel the invoice as well before it is paid just in case there happened to be an error during the process. The Softwares’ Roadmap and Monetization Plans The Bchpls developer explains in the future they plan to monetize by adding custom features or the “ability to operate more than one PoS session at the same time.” Down the line, Bchpls plans to add products management, custom designs, receipts, multiple PoS, and a merchant directory. Currently, the beta program is not open source nor does it offer a client-side (trustless) option but the developer says he will provide these things soon. “This is not available on Github at the moment — It is currently a hosted service — The site does not store any private keys or BCH on your behalf,” explains the Bchpls developer. “You provide your Xpub (public key), then any orders made will be made directly to addresses generated from your Xpub.” Note that this is not an e-commerce payment gateway solution, it is a POS system for a brick-and-mortar setup. It is also not a solution for people who want automatic settlement into Fiat. It only settles in BCH directly into your wallet — The client-side-only implementation will be open sourced once it is ready. Bchpls is yet another application that helps promote Bitcoin Cash infrastructure and adoption and most BCH proponents seem to like the platform. Some individuals will likely wait for a more reliable release and others will also wait for a client-side open source version. All in all, Bchpls was extremely easy to set up and any brick-and-mortar business could start using it at their shop. What do you think about Bchpls.io?

Slowly but surely it’s becoming easier to spend BTC, BCH, and a range of other cryptos throughout the continent, with payment services like Wirex and Paytomat leading the charge. It’s now possible to spend bitcoin in hundreds of restaurants and stores throughout Eastern Europe, as well as anywhere that accepts Visa in the whole of mainland Europe and the UK. Also read: SA Central Bank Comes Up With Another Nickname for Cryptos –“Cyber Tokens” Wirex Rolls Out Its New Crypto Debit Cards When crypto debit cards were cancelled in Europe last year, with a Visa subsidiary to blame, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency holders were left clutching worthless pieces of plastic. But as crypto companies have forged new alliances with payment processors, crypto debit cards have started to return, and hopefully this time they’re here to stay. In the past two weeks, Wirex has begun dispatching physical cards to UK and mainland European customers who were on its waiting list. News.Bitcoin.com had a chance to put one of the cards to the test, topping it up with BTC and then spending it in-store and online, and was impressed with the results. Processing a cryptocurrency payment with Paytomat A full review of the Wirex crypto debit card follows below, after a quick look at what Paytomat have been up to. The cryptocurrency payment system supports 11 cryptos including bitcoin cash and zencash, and has support from over 330 restaurants and stores at present, mostly in Eastern Europe. It’s since expanded into Western Europe, however, with a launch that took place in an Amsterdam soup kitchen earlier this month. Paytomat CEO Yurii Olentir said: “Amsterdam is one of the most crypto-friendly places, so we chose it for our kick-off in Western Europe. With millions of tourists visiting every month, cryptocurrencies can be a very convenient payment method. For example, a transaction in Bitcoin Cash takes just a couple of seconds and the fee is miniscule.” In total, Paytomat supports BCH, ZEN, XEM, DASH, WAVES, LTC, ETH, NANO, DCR, XZC and BTC, and as a video demonstration shows, paying for a meal with bitcoin cash is quick and easy: A Quick Look at the Wirex Crypto Card in Action I applied for a Wirex card weeks ago, and succeeded after several failed attempts at address verification. At one point I feared I was never going to convince their KYC I lived where I claimed to live, but a stamped bank confirmation letter finally did the trick. The team’s customer support was helpful throughout, to their credit. Last week, Wirex announced that its cards were finally ready to ship. Mine arrived in a beautifully packaged sleeve that folds out to reveal the slogan “The most versatile payments card in the world” accompanied by a heart emoji face. If I thought the presentation was good, the activation turned out to be even slicker. With the Wirex app already installed on my phone, all I had to do was hold the card in proximity to the device and the NFC chip automatically extracted the last four digits of the card and the CVV number. I clicked the verification email link and that was it: my card was good to go. Wirex accepts BTC and LTC, but no BCH or ETH unfortunately. Hopefully they’ll add more cryptocurrency support in due course. For now, I fired over some BTC, and not long afterward a notification informed me that my coins had arrived. A Few Hiccups, But Otherwise Impressive For users who don’t already have cryptocurrency to hand, Wirex enables you to top up your card using your existing bank account; transfers reportedly clear within a few hours. With my BTC loaded, I tried to transfer the balance to GBP so I could spend it, but accidentally swapped into LTC instead; the process is a little confusing. At the second time of asking, I worked out how to complete the swap, and within seconds my litecoin had been exchanged for British pounds. My daughter had been pestering me to buy more reading credits for her iOS app, and so my first £10 of crypto went on purchasing virtual gems. I planned to test the card at a restaurant next, but when it came to pay the bill realized that I didn’t know the PIN for the Wirex card, and was forced to use an alternate method to settle up. Back home, I searched through every submenu of the Wirex mobile app and desktop platform to find where the PIN number was located. I got there, eventually, though it wasn’t intuitive at all. This minor grumble aside, the card works perfectly, and there’s even 0.5% in cashback to be earned on all purchases – paid in BTC.

Slowly but surely it’s becoming easier to spend BTC, BCH, and a range of other cryptos throughout the continent, with payment services like Wirex and Paytomat leading the charge. It’s now possible to spend bitcoin in hundreds of restaurants and stores throughout Eastern Europe, as well as anywhere that accepts Visa in the whole of mainland Europe and the UK. Also read: SA Central Bank Comes Up With Another Nickname for Cryptos – “Cyber Tokens” Wirex Rolls Out Its New Crypto Debit Cards When crypto debit cards were cancelled in Europe last year, with a Visa subsidiary to blame, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency holders were left clutching worthless pieces of plastic. But as crypto companies have forged new alliances with payment processors, crypto debit cards have started to return, and hopefully this time they’re here to stay. In the past two weeks, Wirex has begun dispatching physical cards to UK and mainland European customers who were on its waiting list. News.Bitcoin.com had a chance to put one of the cards to the test, topping it up with BTC and then spending it in-store and online, and was impressed with the results. Processing a cryptocurrency payment with Paytomat A full review of the Wirex crypto debit card follows below, after a quick look at what Paytomat have been up to. The cryptocurrency payment system supports 11 cryptos including bitcoin cash and zencash, and has support from over 330 restaurants and stores at present, mostly in Eastern Europe. It’s since expanded into Western Europe, however, with a launch that took place in an Amsterdam soup kitchen earlier this month. Paytomat CEO Yurii Olentir said: “Amsterdam is one of the most crypto-friendly places, so we chose it for our kick-off in Western Europe. With millions of tourists visiting every month, cryptocurrencies can be a very convenient payment method. For example, a transaction in Bitcoin Cash takes just a couple of seconds and the fee is miniscule.” In total, Paytomat supports BCH, ZEN, XEM, DASH, WAVES, LTC, ETH, NANO, DCR, XZC and BTC, and as a video demonstration shows, paying for a meal with bitcoin cash is quick and easy: A Quick Look at the Wirex Crypto Card in Action I applied for a Wirex card weeks ago, and succeeded after several failed attempts at address verification. At one point I feared I was never going to convince their KYC I lived where I claimed to live, but a stamped bank confirmation letter finally did the trick. The team’s customer support was helpful throughout, to their credit. Last week, Wirex announced that its cards were finally ready to ship. Mine arrived in a beautifully packaged sleeve that folds out to reveal the slogan “The most versatile payments card in the world” accompanied by a heart emoji face. If I thought the presentation was good, the activation turned out to be even slicker. With the Wirex app already installed on my phone, all I had to do was hold the card in proximity to the device and the NFC chip automatically extracted the last four digits of the card and the CVV number. I clicked the verification email link and that was it: my card was good to go. Wirex accepts BTC and LTC, but no BCH or ETH unfortunately. Hopefully they’ll add more cryptocurrency support in due course. For now, I fired over some BTC, and not long afterward a notification informed me that my coins had arrived. A Few Hiccups, But Otherwise Impressive For users who don’t already have cryptocurrency to hand, Wirex enables you to top up your card using your existing bank account; transfers reportedly clear within a few hours. With my BTC loaded, I tried to transfer the balance to GBP so I could spend it, but accidentally swapped into LTC instead; the process is a little confusing. At the second time of asking, I worked out how to complete the swap, and within seconds my litecoin had been exchanged for British pounds. My daughter had been pestering me to buy more reading credits for her iOS app, and so my first £10 of crypto went on purchasing virtual gems. I planned to test the card at a restaurant next, but when it came to pay the bill realized that I didn’t know the PIN for the Wirex card, and was forced to use an alternate method to settle up. Back home, I searched through every submenu of the Wirex mobile app and desktop platform to find where the PIN number was located. I got there, eventually, though it wasn’t intuitive at all. This minor grumble aside, the card works perfectly, and there’s even 0.5% in cashback to be earned on all purchases – paid in BTC.

Thus, customers will be able to buy the two added cryptos from the Revolut mobile app. This move signals the company’s desire to establish itself in the emerging cryptocurrency fintech market. Bitcoin Cash Added to the Mix Revolut was founded in London in 2015 as a fintech firm with a core focus on providing alternative digital banking solutions. The company dabbled in cryptocurrency in 2017, offering exchange services for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Revolut has a partnership with Luxembourg-based Bitstamp to facilitate its cryptocurrency transactions. Bitstamp is reportedly the oldest surviving cryptocurrency exchange platform in the world. The addition of Bitcoin Cash and Ripple brings the London-based firm’s crypto catalog to five supported cryptocurrencies. The firm charges 1.5 percent on every cryptocurrency transaction, and it reportedly facilitates 100,000 such deals per day. Not bad for a company whose primary focus isn’t digital currency trading. Revolut supports about 120 different fiat currencies, allowing people from different parts of the world to make use of its services. The firm differs from most traditional crypto exchange platforms in a few ways. Account holders cannot use the Revolut app to transfer or receive cryptocurrency tokens. The platform only enables the buying/selling and holding of cryptocurrency tokens. Revolut also has a vault service that allows users to save small amounts of cryptocurrencies. Recent Revolut Developments Revolut currently has a user base of 1.95 million customers with more than 20 percent of that figure engaged in the company’s cryptocurrency exchange service. The company wants to increase its user base to 100 million in the next five years. As part of these expansion efforts, Nikolay Storonsky, the CEO of Revolut announced recently that the firm plans to issue a new debit card. He went on to say : In the next three months, we’re going to launch Platinum cards; it’s a metallic card that allows you to get 1% cash back in cryptocurrencies and also provides you a concierge service. Despite being only three years old, Revolut is already a fintech unicorn valued at more than $1.7 billion. The company recently completed a $250 million fundraising round targeted at expanding its operations. The London-based fintech firm also plans to apply for a European banking license. The company is no stranger to successful funding rounds having already completed three of such rounds in the past. Will Revolut be able to meet its target of 100 million users in the next five years?

The apple has enough room to create its own block system. Only there must be reasons for openness. Using Apple Pay and Apple Pay Cash company hides personal information on user payments. I don't understand what actions in the business of Apple need openness.\nIn deed, they have inaff resources and technology to build their own blockchain. That would be really cool, i suppose is their next step i the next 5 years.\nExactly! But I think the main point here is to attract more investors and users to participate, knowing that Apple is a big name in the business globally and if it gets to join the market, Bitcoin will become more popular. However, I don't think it's going to happen easily because Apple itself has the potential to create its own blockchain technology. Nobody could tell yet, but I think that's not something to focus more, instead we need to think of ways on what we can contribute more for the growth and stability of Bitcoin.", "highlightText": "",

Check out the tricks fraudsters are using to stay safe Lord Sugar says: ‘This is becoming routine for many prominent business people and there seems to be little that can be done about it because these cowardly crooks hide behind short-lived anonymous overseas websites. ‘It puts members of the public at risk who may unwittingly think I am endorsing an investment scheme. It also puts my reputation at risk by linking me to these scams.’ He is working with his lawyers to get the online adverts removed and has reported the matter to UK police and authorities in the US. Trading on reputation: Sugar’s name has been exploited by con artists along with that of Richard Branson (left) and Deborah Meaden (right) Action Fraud, the UK’s national fraud reporting centre, has highlighted the trend of using famous faces in scams as a ‘growing problem’. It received 21 reports of this kind in March this year with victims cheated out of £34,000 in one month alone. This is just a snapshot of financial losses as most people do not report incidents of fraud. Mark Ward, head of execution trading at wealth manager Sanlam UK, says: ‘People do not always know what they are buying. They mistakenly believe Richard Branson is saying it is good, so feel it is good enough for them. Others are buying for fear of missing out.’ It’s high risk... but you can make it happen Know that investing is high risk for many reasons – volatility of the asset, the fact it is unregulated and it is hard to determine which companies offering trades are reputable. Use an exchange to trade in crypto-currency. Many exist around the world; Coinbase and Coinfloor are two examples. Open a digital wallet to store coins. This can be held either online or offline (on a hard drive). The latter is known as ‘cold storage’ which is harder for thieves to access as it cannot be hacked via the internet. Consider a company that facilitates both trades and storage. For example eToro, which keeps purchases in cold storage. It will also soon launch a digital wallet if customers want responsibility for storage themselves. Learn how to avoid investment scams using the regulator’s ScamSmart website at fca.org.uk/scamsmart . THE COIN STINGS Recent reports of widespread crypto-currency scams are emerging worldwide – in the UK, Australia and China. In North America regulators say they have opened 70 investigations into scams of this kind under a crackdown called ‘Operation Crypto Sweep’. Suspect practices to be aware of include: Dodgy ICOs – These are ‘initial coin offerings’. Entrepreneurs will ask for investment in a new project in return for digital tokens linked to it. Some will be outright scams, some will be doomed to fail. Fake exchanges – websites claiming to allow investors to buy Bitcoin or its alternatives but which take the money, then disappear. Criminals offering to buy traders’ legitimate coins on a private exchange but withholding payment – much like someone buying your goods via a website such as Gumtree, then failing to pay. The US Department of Justice is also said to be investigating crypto traders over suspicions of price manipulation, such as ‘spoofing’, where the market is overwhelmed with fake orders that are later cancelled when prices have changed. Another trick is ‘wash trading’, where people trade with themselves to give an impression of high demand to attract other investors. With so many ways to get stung, experts warn the risks are likely to outweigh the benefits. Ward adds: ‘It is still the Wild West. Investors are handing over banking details to companies based in parts of the world where there is no chance of getting their money back.’ INVESTMENT PERILS Those who do sidestep crypto-cons are susceptible to other risks. Price volatility is one – and the ease with which digital currency can be lost is another. Crypto-currency owners store a password known as a ‘private key’ in a digital wallet. This key reveals what coins a person owns. If the password is forgotten or stolen those tokens are lost forever. Exchanges have also been hacked and crypto-currency stolen. Unlike with a bank that is hacked, there is no recourse for getting your money back. Other investors in crypto-currency do not actually own any coins at all but have entered into a ‘contract for difference’. CASE STUDY: We accept Bitcoin - but it is a gamble for beginners ‘New era’: Eleesa Dadiani’s art firm is planning to launch its own currency Eleesa Dadiani is a crypto-currency enthusiast – but admits that novice investors are taking a great risk. Her Mayfair gallery, Dadiani Fine Art, was the first in the UK to accept payment in crypto- currencies such as Bitcoin. The company is also planning to launch its own coin soon. She says: ‘This is a new era. It is not wrong to want to make money, but it is not easy to make money. It is gambling if you do not know what you are doing.’ She says misuse of a technology is ‘inevitable’ during a pilot phase but real opportunity is emerging. An example of this is women in Afghanistan earning crypto-currency and managing their own finances for the first time, rather than a father or brother retaining control of the purse strings. Eleesa is Georgian by birth but came to the UK from Russia as a teenager in the mid-2000s. She says school life was a ‘complete disaster’. Being a 15-year-old runaway meant she had to ‘learn fast’. Ultimately this has led her to a successful working life in art which is as unconventional as her early education. Through the brokerage arm of her business, Eleesa has helped facilitate the purchase of luxury items by wealthy individuals using crypto-currency. This included helping a Chinese buyer use Litecoin to pay for four Formula 1 cars worth £4 million. She attributes crypto-currency with helping people from all over the world pay for works of art. Eleesa says: ‘My interest is borderless trade. Sanctions against countries such as Russia make it difficult for ordinary individuals to trade overseas. So a currency or technology bypassing that changes everything for me. It is both symbolic and functional.’ Many online firms sell these deals, which are essentially risky bets on the price movements of the coins. City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority states they are ‘extremely high-risk, speculative investments’ where you are not only at risk of losing your entire investment but of owing the firms a debt too.Though these companies may be regulated, this does not protect consumers from losses when they trade via their platforms. Iqbal Gandham is managing director of social trading platform eToro. The firm used to provide contracts for difference but now offers real investment in crypto-currency. Gandham says: ‘With contracts for difference the main concern is leverage. These instruments are extremely volatile and as an individual investor I would shy away. Leveraged trading is not for the faint-hearted.’ REGULATION Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies – such as Litecoin, Ripple and Ether – are now in the spotlight. A taskforce set up by Government and regulators had its first meeting last week to start investigating the merits and challenges of a market dogged by scandal. Senior figures from the Government, Treasury, FCA and the Bank of England helped form the Crypto-assets Taskforce which is looking at how best to oversee a phenomenon in its infancy. Its first report will be published later this year. Crypto-currencies are not yet regulated but thousands exist. Some firms that offer investments in them do fall under the scope of the regulator – creating blurred lines for ordinary investors. In a bid to provide clarification and develop a set of standards, eight companies have formed a trade body known as CryptoUK. All its members dealing in trades go through ‘know your customer’ and anti-money laundering checks. If they store crypto-currency for customers they must do so offline, to reduce the chance of theft by hackers. One of the founder members is eToro and Gandham is CryptoUK’s chairman. He says: ‘We need clarification on regulation and to foster innovation in the UK.’ Bitcoin has been criticised for fuelling trade synonymous with illegal transactions related to drugs and even child pornography. But regulators cannot wash their hands of crypto-currencies because of the technology underpinning them – highly sophisticated databases known as blockchains which record the buying and selling of tokens. Supporters say they are innovative, potentially useful to society in the future and are not created with criminal intentions, even if they are exploited unlawfully. Gandham adds: ‘Blockchain will change money and finances. It is as revolutionary as the internet.’ Blockchains are not controlled by a central bank or government in one place, but rather by a collective of people with access to them. For example, with Bitcoin these are ‘miners’ who use software – and a lot of electricity – to solve mathematical puzzles. They can then update a database of Bitcoin transactions and are also paid in Bitcoin. Each miner will have an immutable copy of the ledger. THE BENEFITS Fans of crypto-currency say it gives people the chance to be part of a social revolution – supporting a global currency and investing in technology of the future. The only way to invest directly in the technology is to buy the associated tokens. In future the databases employed by crypto-currencies could be used to make banking more efficient. All computers could show the same indisputable details about financial transactions without constant cross-checking at individual banks. Similar efficiencies can be made in other sectors – with the payment of benefits by government, for example. Champions and sceptics of crypto-assets both say research is vital and investors should be prepared to stomach risk.

These require in the order of 2 128 steps to find a private key from the public key is known. This is Bitcoin's security level: we aim to always require an attacker to perform 2 128 steps. If the seed has less than 128 bits of entropy, this inevitably leads to a faster algorithm, where an attacker can simply iterate through all possible seeds in less than 2 128 steps. Because of that, BIP32 requires at least 128 bits of entropy .\nWhen the seed has less than 256 bits of entropy (but more than 128), the resulting keys will also have less than 256 bits of entropy. As elliptic curve cryptography uses keys with a full 256 bits (despite there being a faster attacker than breaks it in 2 128 steps), BIP32 also recommends 256 bits of entropy .\nThe combination of private key and chaincode (the \"extended private key\") in BIP32 are 512 bits in size.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

At first, he was singing, and then he broke down into a rap in an attempt to rhyme.\nHere is our approximation of the words Draper used: “Nakamoto made a token, perfecto, no friction,Cross-border, decentralized,The world he did join was chanting ‘Bitcoin to be global!’ No border, harmonized,Connecting the world with pervasive money,He opened our minds, made the banks look funny, But the world past Satoshi is forever changed,Whether his origin block is lost or unclaimed, The world is wrought, and distraught, bureaucrats, too,Governments don’t know what to do! We want a new world order,We want play across the border,I just want to be a hodler,I’m a Bitcoin hustler,I’m a Bitcoin hustler,I’m ‘a Bitcoin hustlin’, yeah, Get your hustle goin’,Flex that crypto-muscle, Bitcoin had turmoil,It’s been in hot oil,When Silk Road, Mt.\nGox committed crimes,But Draper said to me,The unbanked economy will use coin to drive their times, He went and predicted, 3 years, 10K,The press said, ‘He’s stupid, he’s nuts, go away,’ He said money would transcend borders,The military might stop giving orders,The governments will have to compete for us now,Cause if we don’t like one we can now bust out, We won’t think twice when you control movement and price,We won’t be victims of political device, Get your hustle goin’,Flex your crypto-muscle! So, Satoshi, wherever you are,Thank you for Bitcoin, the blockchain, and more, You started this snowball,From the top of the hill, And now it’s pervasive,It’s the people’s will,It’s the people’s will.\nWe want a new world order,We want play across the border,I just want to be a hodler,I’m a Bitcoin hustle,I’m a Bitcoin hustle,I’m a Bitcoin hustle, yeah, Get your hustle goin’,Flex your crypto-muscle!Yeah!” After his short singing debut, the audience applauded, some of them even giving him a standing ovation. This is a tribute to the brief moment Tim Draper was a singer on stage at the TNW Conference 2018.\nWe encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other.

businessman from southeast Delhi was duped of approximately Rs 91 lakh after being offered bitcoins from an international exchange firm.\nThe businessman from Jamia Nagar told police that he was introduced to the firm by a person he met at a bank, who claimed to be a representative of the MNC. A case was registered at Vasant Vihar police station after the victim’s complaint.\nThe man told police that he met the fraudster in 2017, who said that he was working at an exchange firm dealing in crypto-currency . “He later called me and started offering deals for buying bitcoins. I bought one for Rs 5.4 lakh. As soon as I paid the money, I received a message on my phone updating me about the purchase. I sold them a month later for Rs 6 lakh,” the businessman said.\nHe was again asked to make a similar purchase, this time being told that he could earn a 50% profit if he holds the bitcoin for at least three months. The victim agreed and sold it for Rs 9.75 lakh after buying it for Rs 6.5 lakh. Convinced of the legitimacy of the trade, he was then given a bigger offer.\n“They told me that there will be a huge surge in the prices of bitcoins after 20 days and I can almost double my profit. They offered me a discount of 5% if I bought 10 bitcoins worth approximately Rs 91 lakh,” the businessman said.\nThe victim borrowed the amount from his family and friends and said he would return the money after 20 days in January 2018.\nHe went to the company’s office with the amount but was told that the bitcoins would be transferred to his wallet after the money was transferred to China. The crypto-currency would then be sent from Dubai after getting a confirmation on the money transfer. But later, the fraudster fled cheating the man.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bizman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vasant vihar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamia nagar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mnc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T09:50:07.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f000db813909dc1cb3171340830923fc10c94438", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSQsqGw5HVINU9bakNqZXVctIsfRj0Tlg.XOBJCr.oz5ILVTMsAcvz61dN.e2M1hAxagIvt7CWUzv", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Rep.

The most workable one came in the form of batching bitcoin transactions, and batching’s popularity has increased in the background of a general bear market that started in early 2018.\nTechnical Underpinnings of Batching At the time, it was noticed that blocks were not used to their fullest potential. This inefficiency led to higher fees across the network. As CCN reported , the Coinbase exchange was called out for dragging their feet on batching, which increased the fees everywhere since Coinbase engaged in massive transaction volume.\nMiners are limited to 2MB worth of transactions per block, which also creates the economic gain for them. Batching relieves fee costs because multiple transactions in a single block take up less space than if they were spread across multiple blocks. Exchanges were congesting the mempool with smaller transactions that weren’t optimized in batches.\nDavid Harding explained the solution in August 2017. While average bitcoin users couldn’t implement batching with bitcoin wallets, the work fell on exchanges to implement batching as “good stewards of the bitcoin network.”\nFindings on the Batching Adoption bitcoin mempool More Batching is taking hold gradually, according to a recent analysis .\nWith a time frame starting from November 2017, the analysis looked at total output value of all transactions and separated out batched transactions from unbatched. The increase in batching is not as dramatic when you look at the number of transactions. However, the report’s biggest finding was the increase value amount in btc of the transactions processed as batches.\nIt states:\n“…even though batched transactions make up an average of only 12% of all transactions, they move between 30%-60% of all Bitcoins, at peak times even 70%.”\nThe finding is evidence for a huge stress relief on the network, along with SegWit adoption. As reported last year, the mempool drama let to $700 million being stuck as unconfirmed transactions. As everyone knows, nobody likes it when they are confused about where their money is. While the fiasco had a few issues at play, batching transactions as a custom could help minimize it from happening again if the bitcoin network is ever attacked with fake transactions or another surge of volume.\nExchanges are stepping up to the call, probably helped by the fact that batching helps business.\nAdditionally, in contrast to some in-fighting about the scaling debate, batching stands as an accomplishment for the bitcoin community as a whole. As an organic effort, users put pressure on exchanges and other high-volume users to take up batching, and that pressure appears to be working.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nThe post After Last Year’s Mempool Drama, Batched Bitcoin Transactions Finally on the Rise appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/700-million-stuck-115000-unconfirmed-bitcoin-transactions/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/urgent-necessity-of-a-scaling-solution-recommended-bitcoin-fees-go-past-2/", "https://medium.com/@hasufly/an-analysis-of-batching-in-bitcoin-9bdf81a394e0&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/coinbase-criticized-spamming-bitcoin-mempool-ceo-responds/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/after-last-years-mempool-drama-batched-bitcoin-transactions-finally-on-the-rise/&quot;", "https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb&quot;", "https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mempool-size.jpeg", "https://www.ccn.com/after-last-years-mempool-drama-batched-bitcoin-transactions-finally-on-the-rise/", "https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IzWMvjWtcf7.2b6Gs2a8_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/e67d0da8d2aa0ef953a11ca2242cff3f", "https://www.ccn.com/urgent-necessity-of-a-scaling-solution-recommended-bitcoin-fees-go-past-2/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/700-million-stuck-115000-unconfirmed-bitcoin-transactions/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8iZdeEuh0NLcdvt1IFU6rw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/96aec43812b98a7d27503a63fe3700c8);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8iZdeEuh0NLcdvt1IFU6rw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/96aec43812b98a7d27503a63fe3700c8", "https://medium.com/@hasufly/an-analysis-of-batching-in-bitcoin-9bdf81a394e0", "https://www.ccn.com/coinbase-criticized-spamming-bitcoin-mempool-ceo-responds/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david harding", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mempool drama", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:34:45.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59f03150d9bf8eb0abdf45b92b01ecb4a15c0575", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYd4eojDa_PqniMFq4yn8SM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin and altcoin: Who will take control of the market?", "title_full": "Bitcoin and altcoin: Who will take control of the market?", "published": "2018-05-26T22:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59f03150d9bf8eb0abdf45b92b01ecb4a15c0575", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYd4eojDa_PqniMFq4yn8SM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Griegura", "published": "2018-05-26T22:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin and altcoin: Who will take control of the market?", "text": "Ripple wants the government to take control of the matter.
