The update was announced last November,\nA bitcoin hard fork A hardfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade. An alteration which changes the block structure of the chain including block hash, or increases the set of valid transactions is a hardfork. If users do not all agree on the upgrade then a new coin will be produced with a new blockchain. The appended You Tube video explains what a hard fork is. It uses the creation of bitcoin cash as an example. It also explains the difference between a hard fork and soft fork.\nThe creation of bitcoin cash\nIn mid-2017 some developers were not satisfied with the changes planned to the bitcoin code and as a result on August 1 of 2017 they split the bitcoin blockchain in two forming bitcoin cash while bitcoin carried on with the original suggested changes.\nA list of bitcoin hard forks can be found at this site: Bitcoin Cash: Forked at block 478558,[7] 1 August 2017, for each bitcoin (BTC), an owner got 1 Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nThe appended video from early August of 2017 describes the birth of bitcoin cash. Since that time, the coin has done much better than the person on the video predicted although it comes nowhere near the price of bitcoin.\nAmong the main changes bitcoin cash made to the bitcoin blockchain was an increase in the maximum block size to 8 megabytes from one. The transaction signature hashing algorithm was changed so that it prevented replay protection for bitcoin cash transactions from the original chain. Finally, the original bitcoin difficulty algorithm (adjusted ever 2016 blocks) was replaced with a new emergency difficulty adjustment (EDA) algorithm. This was designed to respond more quickly to any drastic drops in the hash rate that might happen after the fork.\nThe new proposed changes to the bitcoin cash protocol\nSome of the new changes are quite radical. The size of the block will change from 8 MB to 32 MB. This will allow vastly more transactions per block. Some of bitcoin cash's seasoned developers have suggested that moving ahead too fast with the changes could jeopardize the situation where the market cap of bitcoin cash was $24 billion and a single coin was going for a little less than $1,500.\nHowever, that viewpoint seems not to be prevalent now. Joshua Yabut , a contributor to bitcoin cash's main protocol software implementation, BitcoinABC, said he doesn't expect any protest when users are finally given the choice on May 14 to upgrade their software. Yabut said to CoinDesk: \"Block size increases are kind of non-controversial at this point, but it's nice to see on-chain scaling happen.\"\nThe return of smart contracts\nThe developers of bitcoin cash have now added in new kinds of smart contracts. These had been stripped from the chain because of security concerns that have now been addressed. The addition of the contracts will add even more functionality to users of the bitcoin cash system.\nSteve Shadders, nChain developer said: \"Essentially out of an abundance of caution and lack of time to fully explore and fix the edge cases that needed to be addressed, the decision was taken to simply disable any opcodes around which there were doubts or even hints of doubts. Seven years have passed and the edge cases around these opcodes are much better understood now. Additionally, the decision to disable them was taken hastily and under duress. The [bitcoin cash] community now has had the luxury of time to address these issues thoroughly....It's the first step for enabling smart contracts with the protocol which will allow us to compete with ethereum later on.\"\nSome critics of the changes\nA minority of users have complained that the sweeping changes being made should have been put to a community-wide vote before being adopted. The critics complain that there has been no chance to debate on the merits of the specific changes.\nHowever, the disagreements are not deep enough or extensive enough to cause a new coin to come into existence when the planned fork takes place.\nA few critics also are concerned that data-heavy projects such as Memo a recently launched censorship-resistant social network might even require even larger block sizes.\nPresent price of bitcoin cash\nAs of 19:50 UTC April 29th the price of bitcoin cash was $1437.38 a far cry from its larger brother bitcoin but it has been doing relatively well. A weekly analysis can be found here. The low in the last 24 hours was $1,374.85 and the high $1482.43. The price is up about 2.9 percent on the day at present.\nPreviously published in Digital Journal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T23:06:52.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec26246468b8d433e97a454322eefdaf102a770a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYBeAjeJbFitDR_LQ.wlnhJm.aTmqsmlpd5EYeE2L.OG_uF.eCuUEFXVumhZjLOS__w-", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Benzinga's Bulls & Bears Of The Week: Apple, Bitcoin, Macy's, Verizon And More", "title_full": "Benzinga's Bulls & Bears Of The Week: Apple, Bitcoin, Macy's, Verizon And More", "published": "2018-05-13T22:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec26246468b8d433e97a454322eefdaf102a770a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYBeAjeJbFitDR_LQ.wlnhJm.aTmqsmlpd5EYeE2L.OG_uF.eCuUEFXVumhZjLOS__w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nelson Hem", "published": "2018-05-13T22:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Benzinga's Bulls & Bears Of The Week: Apple, Bitcoin, Macy's, Verizon And More", "text": "After three weeks with little to no gain, despite the largely solid first-quarter results and even some big positive surprises, the broader equity markets finally got a little air under them this past week.

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.\nBitcoin Press Release: Decentralised token swap site Swap.Online release details of their upcoming protocol.\n11th May 2018, Tallinn, Estonia – Decentralization is the basis for blockchain technologies. Decentralization ensures the security, transparency and integrity of all transactions in the network. But are the popular cryptocurrency exchanges really decentralized, and safe? Most DEX’s are not able to accept BTC without using an unreliable gateway between the two blockchains.\nExploring the Token Swap Ecosystem\nThere are several different types of DEX (Decentralised Exchange) such as pseudo-decentralized, working in the Ethereum network only, for example projects that link blockchains to each other using their own tokens, and decentralized exchanges that use “Hashed Timelock Contracts”.\nEarlier, it was common knowledge that a crypto exchange that did not store user keys, and was decentralized and therefore safe. However, most of these exchanges are built on a single blockchain, which makes them vulnerable – in order to get funds from the Bitcoin network to such a crypto exchange for example, one needs to use a gateway, which takes bitcoin and produces a “holding” kind of bitcoins in another network in return. A similar principle lies with Ethereum-based exchanges, for example, EtherDelta.\nSecurity: Paramount\nDevotees of centralization believe that storing private keys on a secure server is safer than storing encrypted keys in the user’s browser. However, if a central server is hacked, everything will be stolen (as it was with a million bitcoins), and paranoids can remove signing of transactions from the browser into the application on the computer and encrypt it.\nSince all code is executed in the user’s browser, the greatest risk is the intrusion of extraneous scripts into the code. It is likely to be made by the extensions the user installed in the browser, or by a hosting provider.\nTo prevent such attacks, Swap.Online will use cloudflare.com together with Workers, a solution that, in response to any request to the domain, sends a “Content Security Policy” header with the hash of the JS code allowed for execution in the user’s browser. Thus, server hacking and most attacks based on the introduction of malicious code will be eliminated. To understand how this works, see the video of the system operation below, or try to make an exchange yourself at https://alpha.swap.online.\nThe Swap Online Platform\nBy using Bitcoin.js, web3.js, and the libp2p library in IPFS, Swap.Online created a cross-blockchain swap system directly in the browser. The full details of the system can be found below:\nThe solution operates on an average 2 to 10 times faster than the existing stock exchanges (taking into account the time to deposit and withdraw funds). On average, the exchange takes 2 to 3 minutes.\nSwap Online does not store secret user keys. Moreover, even messages between users do not pass through our servers (we use IPFS).\nThe exchange works right in the browser – users do not need to download or install anything.\nThe platform already works between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, with Tether, and Lightning Network planned.\nTheoretically, Swap Online is able to work with most cryptocurrencies, except for those where there is no scripting language. Even for currencies like Monero, solutions will be created over time.\nThe source code of the exchange is published in GitHub, and the protocol is distributed as Open Source. The AirDrop is scheduled for June 30th.\nThe Swap.Online team is also engaged in commercial implementation and release of related products:\nFor the B2C market (swap.online): Exchange solution for BTC -> ERC20 (with an orderbook and a reputation system)\nFor the B2B market (b2b.swap.online): Widget in the form of html code, which allows accepting any cryptocurrencies directly in the wallet of the site owner by sending tokens in return. The solution has a confirmed demand both from projects in the crowdfunding stage and from those who are already making a real product.\nFor large holders of cryptocurrencies: Ability to safely exchange cryptocurrency without bringing it to centralized exchanges (by replenishing the account only during the exchange).\nAs part of research, the possibility of using the solution as a bridge for the sidechains is being studied.\nTry the Swap Online Alpha\nVisit the AirDrop website\nConnect on Facebook\nChat on Telegram\nRead the WIki\nConnect on LinkedIn\nFollow on Twitter\nCheck out the Medium\nMedia Contact Details\nContact Name: Alexandra Matveeva\nContact Email:[email protected]\nSwap Online is the source of this content.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the US, according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T05:14:20.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f324538e9c47b945d36ed83588ec05db697b6846", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbRQaZADIfN_Svxkf7ZUjaa1dwImHmHmfmvgxeYBSavSbuI2KXfUMn9Q0Z2QtFlIeQzIZgO_wBqpyh9HiyKJB.iqami3BrZ7.SJk89x0i.pg--", "site_full": "samdailytimes.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://samdailytimes.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "SAM Daily Times", "title": "Headline May 14, 2018/ ''' *BITCOIN -HEIST- BITTERLY* '''", "title_full": "Headline May 14, 2018/ ''' *BITCOIN -HEIST- BITTERLY* '''", "published": "2018-05-13T21:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f324538e9c47b945d36ed83588ec05db697b6846", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbRQaZADIfN_Svxkf7ZUjaa1dwImHmHmfmvgxeYBSavSbuI2KXfUMn9Q0Z2QtFlIeQzIZgO_wBqpyh9HiyKJB.iqami3BrZ7.SJk89x0i.pg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hussain Ali (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T21:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Headline May 14, 2018/ ''' *BITCOIN -HEIST- BITTERLY* '''", "text": "\n''' *BITCOIN -HEIST- BITTERLY* '''\n*HIS BRAND IS UPROAR* : THE THEFTS - it was actually three separate thefts over the course of a few weeks, starting December 5. One occurred -\nAt a compound near the airport, home to a handful of cryptocurrency mining warehouses leased to different companies. The warehouses look like hangers, though instead of containing jets -\nThese are densely packed with computers, numbered and neatly arranged on shelves. Giant fans hum noisily overhead\nAfter the recent series of cryptocurrency-related crimes, many of them gunpoint stickups of people forced to empty their virtual wallets -\nA theft like this seemed all but inevitable.\nIn a twist that seemed from a cheesy caper film, the place also carried Katrin Jakobsdottir, the prime minister of Iceland.\n''We did not chat,'' Mr. Stefansson said, calling from a prison near Amsterdam.\nSpeaking by phone in a gloomy monotone, he said, he had worn a baseball cap and avoided the gaze of everyone on the plane.\n''I kept my head down as much as I could.''\n*And Iceland is one of the world's premier venues for mining operators, who are drawn to the country's cheap electricity and chilly weather, which helps keep computers cold*.\nMr. Stefansson would not discuss what the media has named The Big Bitcoin Heist.\nInstead, he focused on his regret for having fled, a decision that he said, he rued as soon as he landed in Sweden and realized that his mug shot was all over the media.\n''I did not eat and had a constant knot in the pit of my stomach,'' he said ''I was disappointed in myself for making my family suffer and nervous about being recognised.''\nDetectives in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, would like to have a conversation of their own with Mr. Stefansson, and they will get the opportunity, now that he has returned to Iceland, having been extradited on Friday.\nHe returned to a country riveted by his case. calls have poured into a tip line with theories about where the computer's are stored and, until recently, where Mr. Stefansson might be found.\n''I can tell you the Icelandic public has been very interested,'' Olafur Kjartansson, the lead police investigator, said in an interview.\n''I'm sitting in the public hot baths and friends, and colleagues will say to me, ''Did you find him?''\nThe theft suggests that security at some of the Iceland's Bitcoin mining operations has yet to catch up to the value of the commodity, now trading at around $9,000 a piece.\nIf the warehouse that was robbed were digging for gold instead of running an algorithm in a quest for cryptocurrency, odds are that the crime would have been far trickier to pull off.\nThen again, this is Iceland, a place that seems to presume its citizens will abide by the law.\nAn astonishing amount of social trust is embedded in society, a phenomenon that is especially evident in the country's penal system.\nMr. Stefansson had been kept at Sogn, which is known as an open prison. Inmates live in their own rooms, which have flat-screen TVs, and talk on their own cellphones.\nInmates earn the equivalent of a $4 an hour cooking, cleaning maintaining a chicken coop.\n''It's a friendly atmosphere,'' said Gudmundur Thoroddsson, a prisoner advocate who was recently released from Sogn. ''there's a good relationship with the guards. Never any fighting or arguing.''\nThe prison at the foot of a treeless hill and and looks more like a rural two-story home with a penitentiary.\nDuring a recent visit, the entrance road was blocked by the sort of gate used by pay-by-the-hour garages.\nThe property, which includes a soccer field, is surrounded by wire fencing a few feet high.\nMr. Stefansson wouldn't have needed a running start to jump it.\nThe night he bolted, he started browsing for international flights on his cellphone at about 11, he said in the interview. After booking one under an assumed name, he opened his window and left.\nHe claims that he walked a mile to Route 1, the road that rings the island, and hitchhiked 59 miles to Keflavik, a town near the airport. [The police maintain that an accomplice drove him]. From there, he called a cab.\nOnce in Stockholm, he traveled via train taxi and ferry to Germany, through Denmark. There he met ''individuals'' who drove him to Amsterdam.\nHe enjoyed just three hours of freedom in the Dutch capital. The local authorities had been tipped off by two pedestrians with a cellphone photograph of a person they believed was the much-publicized wanted man.\nSoon after, an officer approached Mr. Stefansson and demanded identification.\n''I was just walking when it happened,'' he said.\nThe police in Iceland have said little about any evidence they have linking Mr. Stefansson to the computer theft. It was actually three separate thefts over the course of few weeks, starting Dec 5.\nOne occurred at a compound near the airport, home to a handful of cryptocurrency mining warehouses leased to different companies.\nThe warehouses look like hangars, though instead of containing jets these are densely packed with computers, numbered and neatly arranged on shelves.\nGiant fans hum noisily overhead.\n''If you spent a day here, you would probably go deaf,'' shouted Mia Molnar of Genesis Mining, which is based in Hong Kong and mines coins for Ethereum, a Bitcoin rival.\nThe Honor and Serving of the latest Operational Research on Freedom, Heists, Cryptocurrency and State of the World continues.\nWith respectful dedication to the Grandparents, Parents, Leaders, Students, Professors and Teachers of Iceland, and then the World.\nSee Ya all ''register'' on WSSCIW. blogspot. com - !W O W!

them assume there's no scope and hope for bitcoin.\nMaybe, Umm Maybe they are right but strongly they are wrong based on the fact the world is moving.\nGaint's company and people who are running an organization would never support in the future of bitcoin because they feel powerless when they won't control the money, but because of the power and technology is being used behind this coin they might surrender.\nOk, I've been listening to some people saying \"We won't be relying on money generated by electrcity\" my point is what's the problem in this \"Are we going back to the era where there will be no electricity? No Never\".\nAs a normal person like you, I believe there' no bad in these coins although they are making our lives easy and saving us from crazy taxes. I'm not a millionaire I think for my every single $ like most people. There is the downside of these coins that I might not aware of but overall it's a good experience for me. Although during my trades I always lost my money never get profit. (I'm bad at my luck or not know how to play)\nAs a resident of Las Vegas, I can see a dramatic change in this cryptocurrency no matter if it's going down but surely will raise based on the growth and usage.\nIf you wear some cool unique dress and other peoples starting to wear the same dress and after sometimes that same dress starts selling on the shops at your city and in the world that means your dress was really awesome.\nSame with this bitcoins It's been used all over the city. Let me give you some real facts.\nLas Vegas is the city of tourist and we all know people all around of world came here and these people have good money.\nCasinos and gambling are the heart of Vegas the moment you step into the airport you will see poker machines and now casino's are accepting bitcoin ...\nGentlemen's Club in Vegas have started to accept bitcoin. However, not all of them but the point is they realized and started to accept this powerful thing.\nIf you walk to the restaurant and have NO Dollar that's fine you can use your bitcoin to pay for food as Restuarants accepting Bitcoin ...\nI know there are many other big places you will see bitcoin being used I just mentioned places which are most visited places in Vegas.\nPS: No matter how much the value of coin goes down we still can't predict the future and hope this currency should grow...\nYour expert thoughts are always welcome\nI'm still sure bitcoin can last as long as possible, and I would not believe if bitcoin will disappear like people say. If bitcoin goes down there will be a lot of people who buy bitcoin and it will make the bitcoin price rise again, and that will make bitcoin survive.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.gamblingsites.com/blog/vegas-casinos-accept-bitcoin-64554/", "http://bitcoinsinvegas.com/category/bitcoin-accepted-here/food/", "https://johnnyvegasclub.com/topless-nude-las-vegas-strip-clubs-guide"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T10:41:27.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "244c255fffdf88d576f50296b547f893a3a0f0ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfpaEQpJ3UDyCN7YgwX.Aks-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "investment bitcoin ??", "title_full": "investment bitcoin ??", "published": "2018-05-13T21:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "244c255fffdf88d576f50296b547f893a3a0f0ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfpaEQpJ3UDyCN7YgwX.Aks-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "teddyppap", "published": "2018-05-13T21:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "investment bitcoin ??", "text": "Quote: from: Imoote on January 09, 2016, 06:06:00 AM I am very curious about this case please answer because I really do not know ..\nHow do I invest bitcoin?

However, as of Sunday the price of bitcoin was well above its recent low but is still trading well below the $9,000 level. Cryptocurrency markets end first week of May trending down On Friday, the total capitalization for all cryptocurrencies fell below $400 billion. This was the first time for the capitalization to go this low since April 26th. Over the week, bitcoin depreciated 12 percent. Ethereum and EOS each dropped 15 percent and Ripple dropped even more at 34 percent. Even though bitcoin's price is down, its dominance rate was above 38 percent for the first since April, indicating that some money may be rotating back into bitcoin from other coins. Other coins in the top 25 losing even more are NEM, Stellar, and Cardano. Only bytecoin and zilliqa, lesser known coins bucked the down trend. CoinDesk's Friday analysis Early Friday bitcoin's (BTC) price hit a three-week low of $8,741 and it looked to suffer further losses according to chart analysis. This prediction was correct as on Saturday the price of bitcoin appears to have bottomed out near $8,250. The price has failed to cut through the bearish 5-day moving average (MA) that was at $9,382 yesterday and fell below the $9,000 level. The price was below the 100 day MA of $8,849 and down 2.42 percent from the previous say's close of $9,018. There has been a 10 percent decline from the recent high of $9,990 when it appeared that the price would break through the $10,000 level last weekend as reported in a recent Digital Journal article. This decline has weakened the bulls and boosted the chances of a deeper drop to $8,282 the 50-day MA. This happened on Saturday morning but near that point the price appears to have bottomed out. The daily chart was bearish. The relative strength index(RSI) dipped below 50 indicating a short-term bullish to bearish trend change and a further drop in prices. This appears to have been correct although the decline was relatively short-term into Saturday. Both the 5-day MA and the 10-day MA are descending indicating a bearish trend. The 4-hour chart is somewhat bearish but the RSI index shows oversold conditions indicating the price could hold for a few hours. The down trend continued however on Saturday morning. CoinDesk's prediction on Friday The CoinDesk analysis of the bitcoin(BTC) price is: \"Bitcoin will likely break below $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), signaling the end of the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 and may fall to $8,282 (50-day MA) at the weekend.BTC could revisit $9,000 as indicated by the oversold conditions 0n the 4- and 1-hour charts. That said, upticks will likely be short-lived as indicated by generally bearish setup. Bearish invalidation scenario: A rebound from the mildly bullish 200-candle MA located at $8,628 in 4-hour chart and a close above 10-day MA of $9,390 would abort the bearish view.\" The price of bitcoin has been below the $8,628 level and did fall even slightly below $8,282 but so far the price has not rebounded near the $9,000 level. It seems not likely at present that the close will be above the 10-day MA of $9,390. However there are more than seven hours left before the close. Present situation At present, 16:23 UTC the price of bitcoin (BTC) is trending upwards at $8,661.09. The price opened on May 13 at $8,467.66 with low so far of $8,348.31.

Memproses daya untuk menebak solusinya dikenal sebagai hash power, yang diperkirakan Fundstrat akan tumbuh 350 persen hingga tahun 2019.\nKami percaya bahwa jalur pertumbuhan hash power saat ini mendukung harga BTC sekitar $ 36.000 pada akhir tahun 2019, dengan kisaran $ 20.000- $ 64.000, Sam Doctor, kepala penelitian ilmu data di Fundstrat, mengatakan dalam sebuah laporan.\nBitcoin diperdagangkan mendekati level $ 9.300 dalam perdagangan pada hari Kamis (10/5). Sementara di tahun lalu, bitcoin melonjak dari level dibawah $ 1.000 hingga ke atas level $ 19.000, karena besarnya minat investor terhadap mata uang virtual tersebut. Namun, kekhawatiran tentang tindakan keras regulasi telah membantu mengirim harga lebih rendah sepanjang tahun ini.\nNamun, ekonomi pertambangan bitcoin kemungkinan menciptakan tingkat dukungan untuk cryptocurrency. Penambang bitcoin lebih cenderung memegang bitcoin karena harganya jatuh ke titik impas untuk biaya operasi, dan menjual ketika harganya naik, yang mengarah ke keuntungan yang lebih besar. Hal tersebut dikarenakan penjual bersih utama adalah penambang bitcoin, dan sisanya adalah transaksi antar investor.\nPenambangan cryptocurrency tergantung pada faktor-faktor seperti biaya listrik, peralatan pendingin dan perangkat keras khusus, yang dikenal sebagai rig.\nPada 6 Mei, Fundstrat memperkirakan harga cash break-even untuk model lama Antminer S7 adalah $ 6.003 per bitcoin, dan $ 2,368 untuk Antminer S9 yang lebih baru. Keduanya dibuat oleh Bitmain yang berbasis di Beijing, yang analis Bernstein memperkirakan memiliki $ 3 miliar hingga $ 4 miliar dalam laba operasi tahun lalu.\nPelepasan perangkat keras rig generasi berikutnya akan memicu putaran capex baru serta pertumbuhan hash power, yang dapat mempercepat jika harga BTC menguat, kata Doctor.\nPendiri Fundstrat, Tom Lee adalah satu-satunya strategi utama Wall Street untuk menutupi bitcoin. Dia mengeluarkan laporan formal pertamanya pada cryptocurrency di bulan Juli lalu, ketika bitcoin diperdagangkan mendekati $ 2.540. Pada saat itu, Lee memprediksi bitcoin bisa menjadi pengganti emas dan mencapai $ 20.000 hingga $ 55.000 pada tahun 2022.\nSumber : inforexnews.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T00:50:46.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55d2d38bb76cc9c29a517ba66db5ea756ee00640", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeusSBoMCyfIPNCPdLb9ltg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Best wallet for bitcoin?", "title_full": "Best wallet for bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-13T21:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55d2d38bb76cc9c29a517ba66db5ea756ee00640", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeusSBoMCyfIPNCPdLb9ltg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Df9898", "published": "2018-05-13T21:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best wallet for bitcoin?", "text": "I use blockchain for bitcoin storage that I have right now, and until now I feel pretty safe and good. so I believe that blockchain is one of the best wallets for bitcoin storage.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T18:59:48.103+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3bb37c22b6293e212b1df44a45cee870c9295d5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFXaXeg196eBPSih2yZCa90KHfp40kevmcjaDRXzFBRBhRLnS_17P5n5Z5ihIe57rewZD1xvMNTCU_OrHiUZISqKPOk2GFJ8GjsFbbWDSfvKD", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "The trouble with bitcoin: Keeping it from getting hacked, lost or stolen", "title_full": "The trouble with bitcoin: Keeping it from getting hacked, lost or stolen", "published": "2018-05-13T21:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5b14e52a-549c-11e8-9e73-bbeddc6a4482-1200x630-1024x538.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3bb37c22b6293e212b1df44a45cee870c9295d5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFXaXeg196eBPSih2yZCa90KHfp40kevmcjaDRXzFBRBhRLnS_17P5n5Z5ihIe57rewZD1xvMNTCU_OrHiUZISqKPOk2GFJ8GjsFbbWDSfvKD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-13T21:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "The trouble with bitcoin: Keeping it from getting hacked, lost or stolen", "text": "The trouble with bitcoin: Keeping it from getting hacked, lost or stolen by 0\nIn the Wild West world of bitcoin and other digital currencies, many new investors may not fully grasp the challenges of keeping their crypto investments safe. WASHINGTON — Here are the drawbacks with digital currencies: Hackers and scammers can make them vanish.\nIf an owner has a poor memory, the bitcoins can get locked for eternity in an electronic wallet, like a fly in amber. Some high-profile people have admitted this year to losing cryptocurrency, among them Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\nIn another case last month, a cryptocurrency promoter doing a livestream on his YouTube channel was notified by a viewer that digital currency was flowing out of the host’s virtual account. The host later acknowledged he suffered losses of “over $2 million.” In the Wild West world of bitcoin and other digital currencies, many new investors may not fully grasp the challenges of keeping their crypto investments safe, whether on their own devices or lodged in accounts at exchanges around the globe.\n“I suspect many small investors may assume that their money is as safe as it would be in an online bank. But that’s not necessarily the case,” said Graham Cluley, a British security blogger and researcher.\nBitcoins first emerged in 2009, spawning the creation of dozens of other digital currencies that exist only in electronic form. They operate independently of central banks and have fluctuated wildly in value.

And, there's even a bank ready to serve Iran when it comes knocking: according to Reuters, German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin.\nThat's right: bitcoin's money-laundering, capital-controls evading capabilities - the reason why we said it's going much, much higher back in September 2015 when it was just above $200 - are finally going mainstream. And not only that, but in one move it is disintermediating the multi-trillion industry behind private money creation known as \"banking.\"\nIt's therefore hardly a surprise that the company's motto is \"see no bank, hear no bank, speak no bank.\"\nAlbrecht's Bitbond uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to completely bypass the Swift international transfer system which has a monopoly and ultimate veto power on who is in - and isn't - in the global petrodollar club, to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nBut what about the risk of intermediary price fluctuations?\nThat, too, has been factored in as clients hold the loans in their choice cryptocurrency for only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitbond's novelty is that while bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, it never served as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. And judging by the company's rapid growth, there is more than enough demand for its services: Albrecht’s service, which has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013, employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. However, those amount are set to grow: in 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since. More importantly, not a single regulator has reached out to Albrecht to tell him to shut down his service, and for good reason: according to Bitnodes, adoption of bitcoin has been rapid in Germany, only trailing the U.S., based on the location of all the bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.

To compete for business from large trading firms, some crypto exchanges are building out their infrastructures to look like traditional equities exchanges. Exchanges such as Gemini and Coinbase have begun supporting block trading. Some crypto exchanges are rolling out new liquidity programs and considering co-location and other market structure developments, according to executives.\nCrypto exchanges are trying to step up their game to lure the fastest traders on Wall Street.\nThese exchanges, which helped shepherd the nascent market for digital currencies through 2017's boom, have been adding customers and making money hand-over-fist. Bloomberg estimates crypto exchanges bring in $3 million a day in fees.

News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

Escape will cancel and close the window.\nGerman businessman Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that will use Bitcoin to facilitate international money transfers. Albrecht says that Bitbond’s use of cryptocurrency will allow it to transfer money quicker and at a lower cost than standard banks. “Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” he told Reuters.\n“With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.” Clients who use Bitbond only hold onto the cryptocurrencies for a few minutes before they are exchanged for local currency.\nThis ensures that clients won’t have to deal with the rather volatile cryptocurrency market. Bitbond was founded in 2013 and has grown into an officially licensed bank with a large number of investors.\nCurrently, Bitbond’s Berlin office employs 24 people from a dozen countries managing loans for about 100 clients. In total, the loans amount to about $1 million each month.

Genesis, as many of you reading this might know, is the world’s largest cloud bitcoin mining company, with over 2 million customers worldwide. It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm. Designerkottayam / Pixabay\nNext week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation.\nTell us how you got started in this industry.\nI’ve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin—it progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it.\nHow would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It’s a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.\nThe conventional banking system really shows its limitations when we try to move money between developed and underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa. There are some serious inefficiencies that, frankly, many of the big banks just aren’t interested in fixing. But with bitcoin, you don’t have to worry about that. You can send money to, say, a coffee farmer in Africa, and he’ll receive it directly.\nMoney transfers are only one among a number of many other uses. Bitcoin is also a store of value. It’s one of the few assets that I would say are uncorrelated to the broader financial markets.\nAs for blockchain, it has innumerable world-changing applications across a wide range of industries. That’s why I believe it’s crucial that people have the right information about blockchain and understand it. If people don’t understand it, and it gets overhyped, I’m afraid it could start going in the wrong direction.\nWe recently mined the 17 millionth bitcoin, leaving only four million left. Explain why it becomes exponentially more difficult to mine coins the closer we get to that 21 million-coin ceiling.\nIt’s not that the mining itself becomes more difficult. To answer this, I think we have to look at two components.\nOne component is the daily supply of bitcoin. At the moment, only 1,800 bitcoins can be generated every day by the whole network, meaning all the miners worldwide. But it’s important to remember that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined, the rewards are halved. What this means is that after the next halving, which I believe is expected sometime in 2020, the number of bitcoins mined a day will fall from 1,800 to 900. And then after the next halving, it’ll be 450. This helps reduce the supply in a natural way. click to enlarge\nThe second component is a measure of how many miners and how much computing power is in the network. If more miners come online, then of course the competition becomes greater. Because the daily supply is already fixed, your market share shrinks. click to enlarge\nThink of it like the California Gold Rush. Mining gold at first was relatively easy because the metal was plentiful and there were few miners. By the end, it became more difficult because the easy gold had already been claimed, and you were competing with far more miners. We’re seeing the same thing happen with bitcoin and other mineable digital currencies.\nSpeaking of computing power, HIVE Blockchain just announced that it expanded to 24.2 megawatts (MW), up from 2.4 MW in August. What’s next in the pipeline for HIVE?\nYes, the last expansion was a massive build-out in Sweden. It was done in three phases. I think this was a remarkable achievement for HIVE, that it could add so much computing power so quickly.\nThis is only the beginning. The year is still long and you can expect to see some bigger expansions on the way. In September, for example, we’re going to ramp up another bitcoin mining facility worth 20 MW, which is very exciting. And from there it goes even further.\nG20 finance ministers are scheduled to share their plans for more uniform regulation of cryptocurrencies by July. What are your expectations?\nI personally think that this is very good and that it will bring more professionalism into the market. The momentum and adoption has grown so much and so rapidly that there really needs to be some kind of strategy—the world’s economic leaders can’t just leave this space untouched. Anyone who believes otherwise isn’t facing reality.\nHaving said that, regulating this market will not be easy because it’s in a whole other dimension than anything that has come before it. As an analogy, imagine someone trying to regulate flying cars using the same measures that have been written for cars driving on the street. It wouldn’t make any sense. So there will certainly need to be some innovation to get it right. I think it’s also important that the regulators talk to the right people, the industry leaders. They have good input, and I think it could be a very fruitful dialogue.\nAlong those same lines, South Korea’s central bank just announced that it was looking seriously into how the Korean economy might use blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, there’s talk of the country going cashless by 2020. Do you think that’s where the global financial systems are headed?\nI think there’s a natural incentive for governments to go in that direction because, of course, they want to have greater control over their economies. But as is the case with overregulation, too many controls—or going completely cashless—could be harmful to the economy. This is certainly part of a long and interesting debate, and I’m curious to see how it plays out, in South Korea and elsewhere.\nWhere do you see the best application of blockchain technology right now?\nBlockchain’s greatest contribution is its ability to erase boundaries. It completely removes the element of trust—or distrust, I should say—and adds a stabilizing effect to nearly every industry because of decentralization.\nTake the global banking industry, for example. You don’t need to look far to find some serious inefficiencies, as I mentioned earlier. We’re already seeing some very concrete instances where blockchain can be of help here. The banks recognize this and are getting together to make use of this technology to improve their services.\nWhat’s been the greatest challenge you’ve faced so far in your journey?\nFor me, the greatest challenge can usually be found in the moment that you’re currently in. I always compare this industry to the beginning of the internet—no one knew where it was headed or what it would eventually look like. Most people had a general idea that it was innovative and could benefit the world, but the full implications were unclear.\nSimilarly, no one knows where blockchain and cryptocurrencies might take us, and having to deal with this constant uncertainty is, I’ll admit, not trivial. You must always be prepared to act quickly in response to another bitcoin fork, a hack or some other unexpected event. These are things that keep you up at night.\nBut it’s exciting. I think what history has shown again and again is that it’s dangerous to be ignorant and to not have an open mind. Not everything was euphoric and wonderful when the internet first emerged. Problems still occur online, but I believe most people would agree that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nNo industry is without its challenges, and as long as you’re willing to address them, it can be very rewarding. As for blockchain technology, I’m very happy and thrilled to be a part of it this early on.\nInterested in learning more?

To be clear, PicsArt already offers its users its own AI-powered solution which underlines its \"Magic Effects\" feature that lets users change the look of an image, and in some cases quite drastically –…", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data", "https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/mobile-events/google-io", "https://ndrdnws.blogspot.co.il/2018/05/picsart-confirms-ml-kit-support-rolling.html", "https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/app", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr", "http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b", "https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/05/google-announces-android-p-beta-new-a-i-features-i-o-2018.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "app store huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T20:16:05.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c5fb3dbd4f7494addbe166c6538c236d0603388", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQMKHbQGShziHvn4O2Jh6DYMCRDWPFafpFyVfVmNH5CXuy1AQ6jSe6k0QiXtoRULs.XX5BkPLGNscSlRzrgrmIv2XOgmLIHUOo-", "site_full": "gas2.org", "site": "gas2.org", "site_section": "http://gas2.org/comments/feed/", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Comments for Gas 2", "title": "Comment on Sono Motors Plans Solar Powered Car Reveal On July 27 by Tesla’s latest cash flow quandary – bitcoin mining - Crypto Insider", "title_full": "Comment on Sono Motors Plans Solar Powered Car Reveal On July 27 by Tesla’s latest cash flow quandary – bitcoin mining - Crypto Insider", "published": "2018-05-13T19:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/gas2.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Sono-Motors-Sion.jpg?fit=916%2C658&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96965, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c5fb3dbd4f7494addbe166c6538c236d0603388", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQMKHbQGShziHvn4O2Jh6DYMCRDWPFafpFyVfVmNH5CXuy1AQ6jSe6k0QiXtoRULs.XX5BkPLGNscSlRzrgrmIv2XOgmLIHUOo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tesla’s latest cash flow quandary – bitcoin mining - Crypto Insider", "published": "2018-05-13T19:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Comment on Sono Motors Plans Solar Powered Car Reveal On July 27 by Tesla’s latest cash flow quandary – bitcoin mining - Crypto Insider", "text": "Steve Hanley 2 Comments DHL electric van , Sion electric car , solar powered car , Sono Motors\nWhat has room for six passengers, an all electric range of up to 155 miles, and a body covered in solar panels that can add as many as 18 miles of driving a day from sunlight? That would be the Sono Motors Sion , an innovative solar powered car from a team of German entrepreneurs that is scheduled to have its world debut on July 27.\nThe Sion project was able to move forward thanks to an Indiegogo crowd funding campaign last year that raised over a half million dollars. More than 1,000 people have participated so far. The car will have two versions. The Urban comes with a 14.4 kilowatt-hour battery pack. It has a range of about 75 miles and will cost $13,200. The Extender version has a 30 kilowatt-hour battery and a range of 155 miles. Its target price is $17,600. Neither price includes the battery. Like the Renault Zoe, customers will either buy the battery separately or lease it. The leasing option gives owners the flexibility to upgrade the battery later as improvements in battery technology become available.\nThe hood, roof and rear hatch of the Sion are covered with monocrystalline silicon cells that are 21% efficient. On a sunny day, they can generate enough electricity to add 18 miles of range. The solar cells are eight millimeters thick and embedded in a polycarbonate layer that is shatterproof, weather resistant and light in weight. The Sion can also be 80% charged using an AC outlet in about 30 minutes, according to company claims. No DC charging option is available. The car also comes with an outlet that can power electronic devices.\nInside, all the seats of the five door hatchback fold flat, offering multiple configurations for carrying passengers and cargo. There is a 10 inch center display and smartphone connectivity via wifi or Bluetooth. The ventilation system is called breSono and incorporates a dollop of moss, which is said to act as a natural filter when an electrical charge is applied.\nThe company will offer an online maintenance and repair system it calls reSono. It allows owners to order parts online and comes with a video that shows them how to install the parts when they arrive. Or they can take the car and the parts to any local auto repair shop facility to get them installed.\nTest drives will be available starting in September with production beginning next year. Sono is emulating the approach used by DHL with its electric delivery vans . It is sourcing most of the components to build its cars from existing OEM suppliers so it can concentrate on getting the design right and incorporating suggestions from its online community into the final product. The Sion is perhaps a bit small for American customers but it should appeal strongly to Europeans who live in crowded cities where parking is at a premium.\nSource: Hybrid Cars Note: This post was inspired by comments made on a prior post about Lightyear , a Dutch company that also promises a solar powered car, but for much more money.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cleantechnica.com/2017/07/07/1st-solar-electric-cars-consumers-come-lightyear/#comment-3407198189", "https://www.sonomotors.com/updates/", "http://www.hybridcars.com/sono-motors-crowdfunds-innovative-electric-car-with-solar-panels/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve hanley", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sion", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sono motors", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dhl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sono motors sion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renault zoe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indiegogo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T02:18:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e23ff1ec3ad3497b0fa64d8ef0091f92b1196cdf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHL1t5BMGZk4zSmxT_BtTEbCinK.PytOUNiJNvf5yJqj7aElX1B9xulsZUbdaJx2DfumEeoSRdYDfuZhNsP1kdVSf6pTOsimqog-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – Bahrain Hopes to Cut Vehicle Data Storage Costs Using Blockchain", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Bahrain Hopes to Cut Vehicle Data Storage Costs Using Blockchain", "published": "2018-05-13T19:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://abitco.in/wp-content/themes/newspapertimes-codebase/icon/delicious.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e23ff1ec3ad3497b0fa64d8ef0091f92b1196cdf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHL1t5BMGZk4zSmxT_BtTEbCinK.PytOUNiJNvf5yJqj7aElX1B9xulsZUbdaJx2DfumEeoSRdYDfuZhNsP1kdVSf6pTOsimqog-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-13T19:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Bahrain Hopes to Cut Vehicle Data Storage Costs Using Blockchain", "text": "Bitcoin – Bahrain Hopes to Cut Vehicle Data Storage Costs Using Blockchain 13 May 2018\nShare This Tags\nBahrain’s General Directorate of Traffic has a plan to develop a blockchain-based vehicle registry system.\nRead more –> click here all content is copyright Coin Desk.\nNeed Bitcoin marketing and PR?

The move sees a swift demise of a promising coin startup that allowed P2P cryptocurrency exchange with little or no fees.\nWhile CoinTouch cannot objectively claim that it was the only startup in the space, the strict GDPR enactment is likely to affect similar startups in the coin economy before long. Most of the exciting new companies are based in Europe and the new legislation could become a serious headache for many website owners who are looking to challenge the dominion of well-established exchanges and big platforms that charge a lot in transaction fees.\nThe GDPR or the General Data Protection Regulation is the latest in the series of regulations passed in Europe to enact what the governments believe necessary checks and balances in the fintech space, mostly targeted at the coin economy.\nThe legislation was enacted after four years of extensive preparation and debate from the European powers and was finally approved by the European parliament on 14 April 2018. A May 25 deadline was given to all organizations that were in non-compliance with these latest rules and heavy fines are to be imposed if a lack of implementation is observed after the deadline. These could amount to hefty amounts like 4% of the actual revenue of a company or 20 million EUR.\nThe most important features of the new ruling included strict compliance of the Know-your-customer (KYC) protocols for all companies. While in essence, the KYC seems like a reasonable ask, companies like P2P trading platforms cannot simply implement them without destroying the fundamental aspects of their operations. So, the regulation is starting to take its toll on them and CoinTouch is the first one to go out because of these latest measures.\nCoinTouch’s owner was of the opinion:\n“This new EU law hurts small website[s] like mine but helps reinforce the dominance of Facebook, Google, and Twitter, who are able to prepare and defend themselves using established legal teams and cash reserves, and who now face less competition from startups. The EU Cookie Law, EU VAT regulation and now the EU GDPR are all examples of poorly-implemented laws that add complexity and unintended side-effects for businesses within the EU”\nThe same person is also reportedly operating the StreetLend platform and it may be forced to shut down on the same grounds. While GDPR is seen as a positive step to ensure transparency and accountability of platforms, the wide-ranging effects of the initiative might make grounds for redefining the whole procedure for a nascent industry like P2P cointrading.\nCentralized exchanges are more popular with the crypto community due to the ease of use and other features but their high trading fees and centralization of assets may prove to be a vital hindrance for the future of the coin economy as it was originally meant to be decentralized and P2P.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://www.cointouch.com/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "general data protection regulation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T06:39:48.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f943084f822125acffac912397ef459e8a43a8ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhBE6E0M90pamDA6x2Hi1DaA-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-13T19:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f943084f822125acffac912397ef459e8a43a8ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhBE6E0M90pamDA6x2Hi1DaA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T19:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 13, 2018 NEWS News of Bitcoin (BTC) Paper Money and Maybe China Warming Up To Crypto Ethereum World News (blog) The King of Crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), is currently trading at $8,464 and up 1.2%.

This is the first time BTC’s been allowed for transferring credit internationally.\nSubscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts\nBypass the SWIFT\nFounded by Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond now lets clients, specifically small businesses, transfer loans internationally using BTC.\nThe most interesting dynamic at play? Bitbond is making use of bitcoin as opposed to the SWIFT international transfer system due to the cryptocurrency’s quick transfers and low fees.\nAlbrecht noted to Reuters TV :\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days. With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nBitbond clients do not have to worry about BTC price fluctuations as the online bank only holds the loan in bitcoin for minutes and thereafter exchanges it for the desired fiat currency. The exchange duration is short and therefore BTC price swings do not subvert the process.\nPeer-to-Peer Loans Using Bitcoin\nBitbond’s use of bitcoin is just one clear example of how cryptocurrencies can be employed in traditional financial institutions and credit businesses around the world. Many banks globally are piloting projects dealing with the blockchain , the underpinning technology of cryptocurrency, but none hitherto have made direct use of cryptocurrencies.\nThe German online bank has gained a fair amount of popularity and facilitates loans for over 100 clients equating to $ 1 million USD monthly. As reported by Reuters , a large percentage of clients are freelancers and small businesses owners.\nBitbond’s loan amounts are typically small and usually do not exceed $50,000. The standard loan period is from six weeks to three years. Moreover, willing individuals can also offer loans to borrowers resulting in lower interest rates for borrowers and higher interest rates for the lender as compared to conventional loans.\nWill financial institutions use bitcoin to transfer credit?
