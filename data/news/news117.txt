The last time that the pair made a slight high was on May 20. The bears have had a greater advantage on the market over the bulls over the past few weeks. The major critical territory the pair is believed not to easily break remains the immediate accumulation territory of $6,000.00. The cryptocurrencys price only touched it on February 6.\nThe 13-day SMA has briefly crossed the 50-day SMA. Both moving averages are a bit above the distribution territory of $8,000.00, whilst price is currently averaging towards the accumulation territory of $7,000.00.\nThe Stochastic Oscillators have breached past range 20 in the oversold zone suggesting the bearish trend is soon going to end. The market behavior is still expected to see the bears push harder than the bulls. Current possible foundational territories within which strong catalysts can be obtained for a bullish reversal are the accumulation territories of $6,000.00 and $4,000.00.\nInvestors can probably lookout for a reversal from the bearish movement to go in, but traders can possibly watch out for a sudden breakout of either the accumulation territory of $7,000.00 or distribution territory of $8,000.00 to join in the direction of the breakout trend with the use of fund management rules.\nThe views and opinions expressed here do not reflect that of CryptoGlobe.com and do not constitute financial advice.

But the crowd that showed up in Wenatchee two weeks ago for a hearing about Bitcoin mining in Chelan County was so large that utility staff had to open a second room with a video feed for the overflow. The turnout wasn't surprising. Chelan County, along with neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, has been at the center of the U.S. Bitcoin boom since 2012, when the region's ultracheap hydropower began attracting cryptocurrency \"miners.\" [...] As a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtown, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds. By the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum. But as in any boomtown, success has come at a cost. As the cryptocurrency industry morphs into larger, more energy-intensive operations, the Basin's three public utilities districts (PUDs) are reassessing how they deal with it, and whether they can -- or should even try to -- keep up.Read more of this story at Slashdot.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/qlfeynmDPxo/bitcoin-backlash-as-miners-suck-up-electricity-stress-power-grids-in-central-washington"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "slashdot", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stress power grids", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stress power grids in central washington bitcoin backlash", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "douglas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenatchee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid-columbia basin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelan county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:19:55.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65e11e2267539d38d264c32477a2e59fb789a5bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUa_jNE2CDt0czGjj3GLvkc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Why Bitcoin Price Going Down?", "title_full": "Why Bitcoin Price Going Down?", "published": "2018-05-28T07:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.028, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "65e11e2267539d38d264c32477a2e59fb789a5bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUa_jNE2CDt0czGjj3GLvkc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Topaz72", "published": "2018-05-28T07:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Bitcoin Price Going Down?", "text": "Quote: from: Lazada on May 26, 2018, 02:03:02 PM Quote: from: spartanrules on May 26, 2018, 01:37:47 PM Whole market goes down because now we see correction of Bitcoin and whole the market.

Known as Bitcoin Incognito, it is another attempt at fixing some of the glaring issues which Bitcoin presents.\nWhether or not this new fork will succeed is unclear, but more competition isn’t necessarily a bad thing. One of the biggest misconceptions people have about Bitcoin is that it is anonymous.\nThat is anything but the case, though, as Bitcoin has neither anonymity nor privacy features. The currency allows one to be pseudonymous – similar to an online nickname – but not anonymous. Some projects are trying to address this lack of anonymity through various means.\nIn the case of Bitcoin Incognito, there isn’t much information to go by at this time, as the project was only announced Friday afternoon. From what little information has been made public, it’s evident Bitcoin Incognito will primarily focus on proof-of-stake and masternode solutions.\nAnyone who has paid close attention to the various altcoins on the market will have noticed that masternodes are quickly becoming more popular. It is a system that many currencies are embracing, although it is not something one would ever see as being part of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin Incognito thinks it is a good time to take the plunge in this regard, although it remains to be seen how this will pan out when combined with proof-of-stake capabilities.

Image Source: Cointelegraph\nExperts told the Evening Standard that crypto trading can become a form of behavioural addiction, with traders obsessively glued to “minute-by-minute” market fluctuations. The devised treatment program is therefore closer to existing methods for treating gambling addictions, rather than to substance abuse programs.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was quoted by the Evening Standard as saying:\n\"The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.\"\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center’s new treatments. Marini told the Standard that “introducing life structure is key,” adding:\n\"I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don't like the world they're in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they're not alone.\" Castle Craig said that there are currently no figures for the number of ‘crypto addicts,’ but “around 13 mln” people worldwide are trading in the system.\nLast year, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his home as collateral for a $325,000 equity loan, in pursuit of making a mid-term profit on the cryptocurrency. Crypto community members, evidently viewing his investment mindset as equivalent to gambling , remarked that the move was “almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.”\nFrom another perspective, there has been some discussion in the UK as to whether declaring your crypto trading to be gambling could help to avoid taxes with the British tax authority HMRC, which generally deems crypto profits as subject either to income or capital gains tax laws.

Tweet Sharing this cool Bitcoin exchange website to those who are into Bitcoin trading and those who are new to Bitcoin trading! You might have already heard about Binance but for those who are not yet familiar with it, Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange website. They cater a wide variety of coin pairs to trade with. They also have mobile application for both Android and iOS. I live in the Philippines and have been using their service for quite some times now without any problem. So, check it out! For those who are living in the Philippines and want to try Bitcoin trading out but dont know where to start, this is what I did when I start trading at Binance: 1.) You cannot buy coins directly from Binance. So, I created an account on Coins PH https://coins.ph/m/join/gvtxzj (easiest way to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in PH as of now). 2.) You can deposit funds to Coins PH thru Cebuana Lhuillier. You can also do it in 7/11 convenient store but the fees are quite high so I used Cebuana Lhuillier. 3.) Buy Bitcoin(BTC) or Ethereum(ETH) on Coins PH and transfer the coins to Binance (In my case, the transfer took about 10 minutes. It might take longer depending on the network). 4.)

The price declined sharply and broke two important support levels at $8,150 and $7,900. The decline was such that the price even broke the $7,600 pivot level. It traded close to the $7,000 level and found support near $7,200. A low was formed at $7,220 before the price started consolidating in a range. \\n\nIt traded a few points above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,220 low. However, buyers failed to gain momentum above the $7,600 pivot level. Therefore, the price is in a downtrend below $7,600. More importantly, there is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $7,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. A break above the channel resistance and $7,650 is needed for an upside push . Above $7,650, the next hurdle for buyers sits around the $7,950 and $8,000 levels. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is struggling to recover above $7,600.

But all is not as it seems.\nThe drama began with an Etsy seller publishing a letter from a lawyer representing the bitcoin trademark holder in relation to bitcoin-branded clothing items the person was offering for sale.\n“It has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a variety of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk. [Our Client] has not authorised your use of the Bitcoin trademark on and in relation to clothing. Such use, therefore, amounts to trademark infringement pursuant to s10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994,” the letter read.\nIn an apparent act of benevolence, the letter goes on to note though the trademark holder could take action against the seller, it instead gave the seller 14 days to remove the infringing goods instead.\nCryptocurrency sites have gone into meltdown over the fact that someone has not only trademarked bitcoin and were enforcing the trademark, with one site even going as far as saying the trademark holder will “have authority over everything Bitcoin, at least in the U.K.” But the truth is nowhere near that bad, and it’s clear the vast majority of those covering the story don’t understand basic trademark law.\nPutting aside the moral arguments over anyone holding a trademark over the term bitcoin, trademarks relate to specific products. The trademark used in this case, UK00003279106 , registered by a company called A.B.C. IP Holdings South West only covers three classes of goods: U.K. classes 25, 32 and 33, covering clothing, beverages and alcoholic beverages, respectively.\nSince the particular trademark only pertains to those classes, the trademark owner has absolutely zero influence over anything to do with bitcoin outside those classes.\nThere is a catch, but it’s not related to this trademark specifically. A search of the U.K. Intellectual Property Office trademark registry finds multiple trademark registrations for bitcoin, such UK00003029238 from 2013 which pertains to “chocolate and confectionary.” But the more interesting one is a trademark for bitcoin with protected status: WE00001288610 , covering a pile of bitcoin-related services that, unlike a trademark relating to T-shirts, should rightfully scare the bitcoin community.\nThe protected trademark is registered to Japanese bitcoin exchange bitFlyer and covers the use of bitcoin in six different classes. The list of items it covers is in the thousands, but among the most important and disturbing it includes the use of bitcoin in computer programs, advertising, financial services, electronic commerce and more, all of which are vital parts of bitcoin itself.\nDigging around Google, it appears that the trademarks, registered in Japan and the European Union, originally belonged to Mt. Gox and were acquired by bitFlyer in 2014 A discussion on Reddit in January discusses some of implications, such as whether it could be used to stop sites such as bitcoin.com from using the name.\nThere appears to be no record of bitFlyer having actually attempted to enforce its trademark in the past and it’s not clear it ever would. But if the cryptocurrency community wants to get its knickers in a twist over trademarks, this is where people should be looking, not at a two-bit seller on Etsy selling T-shirts.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pkqtl/bitflyer_holds_trademark_on_bitcoin_is_ver/", "https://imgur.com/FfppuVR", "https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/23/WE00001288610", "https://www.coindesk.com/mt-gox-sell-bitcoin-trademark-buyer-enforce/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/a-london-based-company-successfully-trademarks-the-name-bitcoin/", "https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003279106", "https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003029238", "https://cryptovest.com/news/apparently-the-name-bitcoin-was-trademarked-since-december-2017/", "https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-public-domain-illegal-trademark-uk/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T06:04:32.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e0b1824e8e4f6124f8cdccb15dbca15cdd07cbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pfPe.QSEtUeHbyPfdUg_.FVjKX4kSU4CQbgZdWZDVZSHfKvsIb8M5pyFW3KcQFtuu8R0WWrAEg9TeGE3EmuKau4In3yQR1VaUBdNN_Hx8OtRSPfsU8KS9NQ--", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Guy: Laszlo Hanyecz on Why Bitcoin is Still the Only Flavor of Crypto for Him", "title_full": "Bitcoin Pizza Guy: Laszlo Hanyecz on Why Bitcoin is Still the Only Flavor of Crypto for Him", "published": "2018-05-28T06:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/725_aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy85NmQyZGFlMjgyYjY3M2RiNDhiNjk5ODJjZDVhNDgzZC5qcGc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e0b1824e8e4f6124f8cdccb15dbca15cdd07cbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pfPe.QSEtUeHbyPfdUg_.FVjKX4kSU4CQbgZdWZDVZSHfKvsIb8M5pyFW3KcQFtuu8R0WWrAEg9TeGE3EmuKau4In3yQR1VaUBdNN_Hx8OtRSPfsU8KS9NQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-28T06:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Guy: Laszlo Hanyecz on Why Bitcoin is Still the Only Flavor of Crypto for Him", "text": "Bitcoin Pizza Guy: Laszlo Hanyecz on Why Bitcoin is Still the Only Flavor of Crypto for Him by 0\nMeet Laszlo Hanyecz, the first person to conduct a Bitcoin transaction for a physical item—10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas back in 2010. You may think that you have never heard of Laszlo Hanyecz, a Florida-based programmer working for online retail company GoRuck, but you’d probably be wrong — Hanyecz was behind the inspirational purchase of two pizzas from Papa John’s for 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC) back on May 22, 2010, making this week a celebration of Pizza Day’s eight year anniversary.\nBut the transaction did not involve only one person: Jeremy Sturdivant, also known as Jasco, participated in the original Bitcoin pizza deal as the recipient of those 10,000 BTC that he turned into two pizzas. Ever since the fateful first-ever recorded transaction of Bitcoin for a physical good, the use case for the currency has taken off, with customers now able to use Bitcoin for real estate deals, online shopping, airplane bookings and, of course, pizza.\nCointelegraph got the chance to speak to both Laszlo and Jeremy this week about their views on Bitcoin, how they feel about the legacy of the “Bitcoin Pizza” and their favorite type of pizza. LH: You know, I don’t regret it.\nI think that it’s great that I got to be part of the early history of Bitcoin in that way, and people know about the pizza and it’s an interesting story because everybody can kind of relate to that and be [like] –“Oh my God, you spent all of that money!” I was also kind of giving people tech support on the forums and I ported Bitcoin to MacOS, and you know, some other things – fix bugs and whatnot, and I’ve always kind of just wanted people to use Bitcoin and buying the pizza was one way to do that.\nI didn’t think it would get as popular as it has, but it’s gotten to be a really catchy story for people. LH: Yeah, I do, I try to whenever I can.

There are numerous discussions regarding Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash fees in this regard. It now seems the average Bitcoin transaction cost is lower than that of BCH. As is usually the case, such a temporary snapshot can look very different in a few hours. The Bitcoin Fees in Perspective When directly comparing BTC with BCH fees, it seems there is no real contest. The cost of a Bitcoin Cash transaction has been far lower compared to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In fact, the BHC costs have been relatively flat for quite some time now. Bitcoin’s fees, on the other hand, are erratic as they have always been.\nBitcoin fees have been lower than BCash fees in the last 6 hours. pic.twitter.com/XAll68BbC9 — Ben Verret (@verretor) May 27, 2018\nHowever, temporary snapshots often tell a different story. The Tweet by Ven Verret shows the BTC fees are lower than BCH in a six-hour period. An interesting development, albeit one that only tells a small part of the story. The screenshot itself shows these fees for Bitcoin have spiked just an hour or two prior. Why that sudden increase took place, remains a bit unclear at this time. This doesn’t mean Bitcoin has suddenly become cheaper to use. When timing transactions correctly, that may be the case temporarily. Additionally, users with patience can still send transactions at 1 Satoshi per byte. It may take several hours to confirm, but it is another interesting option worth exploring. When looking at the bigger picture, however, BCH remains the cheaper option by quite a margin. The Debate Continues As is usually the case when trends like these are pointed out, the public backlash is palpable. Bitcoin Cash supporters do not take kindly to this development. However, they also point out how their average TX fee is 0.24 cents or lower. That is quite cheap, although others will argue this point. The overall use of the BCH network compared to Bitcoin is very different. The bigger question is how this situation will evolve. More specifically, there is a growing need for faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions. The Lightning Network may effectively provide that functionality. Thanks to the growth in payment channels, it seems this logical development may occur pretty soon. Even so, the technology is still in beta testing, and an “official” launch has not yet been announced. Developments like these are interesting to keep an eye on. However, keeping the bigger picture in mind needs to be a top priority first and foremost. That picture clearly shows Bitcoin has the highest market cap and Bitcoin Cash remains the altcoin.

The major critical territory the pair is believed not to easily break remains the immediate accumulation territory of $6,000.00. The cryptocurrency’s price only touched it on February 6.\nThe 13-day SMA has briefly crossed the 50-day SMA. Both moving averages are a bit above the distribution territory of $8,000.00, whilst price is currently averaging towards the accumulation territory of $7,000.00.\nThe Stochastic Oscillators have breached past range 20 in the oversold zone suggesting the bearish trend is soon going to end. The market behavior is still expected to see the bears push harder than the bulls. Current possible foundational territories within which strong catalysts can be obtained for a bullish reversal are the accumulation territories of $6,000.00 and $4,000.00.\n Investors can probably lookout for a reversal from the bearish movement to go in, but traders can possibly watch out for a sudden breakout of either the accumulation territory of $7,000.00 or distribution territory of $8,000.00 to join in the direction of the breakout trend with the use of fund management rules.\nThe views and opinions expressed here do not reflect that of CryptoGlobe.com and do not constitute financial advice.

Transactions of 1.60368338 bitcoins (Rs 8.16 lakh) were done in this account. And the entire amount was later transferred to some other account,\" STF sources said here today.\"A total of six transactions, between 6.46 PM on May 2 and 4 AM on May 18, were done in the crypto-currency e-wallet during which bitcoin was received and sent through different e-wallets. One transaction each was done on May 2, 3, 4, and 18 and two transactions on May 17,\" they said.The matter came to the fore when the MLAs complained about receiving threat messages asking them to pay Rs 10 lakhs through bitcoins, they said.The sources said probe agencies are investigating as to who did all these transactions.After Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took note of the matter, an SIT was constituted on May 23 to probe the high-profile matter.The state police is suspecting the handiwork of \"professional hackers\" behind this to create panic and has issued an advisory to the people not to be scared.\"An advisory has been issued across the state asking all not to get panicked over such messages,\" DIG (Law and Order) Pravin Kumar said.\" Prima facie , it appears to be the handiwork of some mischief makers,\" he said, adding that the SIT constituted to go into the matter was already working on it.In all the messages, the sender had given out his name as Ali Budesh Bhai from Dubai, a reference to a gangster once linked to the now Pakistan-based Dawood Ibrahim.The MLAs who got the messages include Veer Vikram Singh (Meeranpur Katra in Shahjahanpur), Manvendra Singh (Dadraul in Shahjahanpur), Prem Prakash Pandey (Tarabganj in Gonda), Vinay Kumar Dwivedi (Mehnam in Gonda), Vinod Katiyar (Bhognipur in Kanpur), Shahshank Trivedi (Mahauli in Sitapur) and Anita Rajput (Debai in Bulandshahr), Dhirendra Bahadur Singh (Sareni-Raebareli).The opposition had also attacked the Adityanath government over the issue.Comments\"No one is secure under the present regime. The MLAs are being threatened of dire consequences,\" Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had said. \"There is no law and order in the state.\"Congress spokesman Arun Prakash levelled similar charges, saying the threats to legislators \"expose the tall claims of the BJP government\".

But the crowd that showed up in Wenatchee two weeks ago for a hearing about Bitcoin mining in Chelan County was so large that utility staff had to open a second room with a video feed for the overflow.The turnout wasn’t surprising. Chelan County, along with neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, has been at the center of the U.S. Bitcoin boom since 2012, when the region’s ultracheap hydropower began attracting cryptocurrency “miners.” Entrepreneurs - Bitcoin - Problems - Creators - Currency These entrepreneurs earn Bitcoin by solving increasingly complicated mathematical problems established by the shadowy creators of the digital currency. The process, which the industry calls mining, involves trillions of computer calculations and sucks up huge amounts of power.As a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtown, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds. By the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum. Boomtown - Success - Cost - Cryptocurrency - Industry But as in any boomtown, success has come at a cost. As the cryptocurrency industry morphs into larger, more energy-intensive operations, the Basin’s three public utilities districts (PUDs) are reassessing how they deal with it, and whether they can — or should even try to — keep up.The sector’s recent growth spurt poses “a very different kind of problem than anything we have addressed before,” Steve Wright, Chelan County PUD general manager, told the crowd at the May 14 hearing. Determining whether the PUD can handle the growth, Wright said, has “required a whole new way of thinking.” Gold - Rush", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T05:58:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bdcdeea68a3d71131685ffe9c63ede791d16581d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcLOTanri5DA8Tn3iR3j.QY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What Ways you are using to Promote bitcoins in you Locality?", "title_full": "What Ways you are using to Promote bitcoins in you Locality?", "published": "2018-05-28T05:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bdcdeea68a3d71131685ffe9c63ede791d16581d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcLOTanri5DA8Tn3iR3j.QY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nick Abimanyu", "published": "2018-05-28T05:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Ways you are using to Promote bitcoins in you Locality?", "text": "Quote: from: newinbtc on November 27, 2017, 01:13:25 PM What Ways you are using to Promote bitcoins in you Locality?\n1.

The drop was attributed to the acquisition costs of the Warehouse Group Financial Services. Both lending and retail funding increased 11% year-on-year, SBS says. Chairman John Ward says the acquisition was a strategic decision to facilitate growth.\nBRENDAN O'DONOVAN TO CHAIR THE CO-OPERATIVE BANK The Co-operative Bank has posted a 1.2% increase in annual profit before rebates and tax to $16.7 million for its March year.

To further help address this threat GCSB will offer its Malware-Free Networks cyber threat detection and disruption service to a broad cross section of New Zealand’s organisations of national significance. The decision to expand Malware-Free Networks follows a successful pilot with Vodafone and a small subgroup of Vodafone’s consenting customers. The pilot showed the Malware-Free Networks capability has the potential to disrupt a significant volume of malicious cyber activity. There was a substantial increase in the volume of activity detected and disrupted when the Malware-Free Networks information was used in conjunction with the network operator’s existing cyber security capability.\" Minister Little said.\nCHINA INDUSTRIAL PROFITS Profits earned by Chinese industrial firms in April rose at their fastest pace in six months , data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Sunday, as factories benefited from higher prices and strong demand. Profits in April rose 21.9 percent year-on-year to 576 billion yuan ($90.14 billion), the quickest since October, bringing gains for the first four months of 2018 to 15 percent. The data suggests China’s industrial sector is still seeing solid growth momentum despite curbs on pollution and rocky trade relations with the United States. Last month’s rebound was helped by lower comparison figures for April 2017, higher factory prices and stronger demand, He Ping, head of NBS’ industrial division, said in a statement.\nBENCHMARK INTEREST RATES LOWER Local swap rates are lower today, with the short end down -1 bps and the long end down -3 bps.

When I look at 2014, bitcoin was still being affected by the mt.gox FUD, but when I look at 2017, it seems like bitcoin is continuing the crash from when before institutional money began investing in bitcoin before the futures launch.

Transactions of 1.60368338 bitcoins (Rs 8.16 lakh) were done in this account.

Well, there’s a chance for you to do this when you play Two Stupid Investors’ (real name of developer) “Bitcoin: The Crypto Card Game.”\nTwo Stupid Investors recently launched a Kickstarter campaign for their card game that’s inspired by the Bitcoin fad. The game is designed to replicate bitcoin investing, so players will have to put their thinking caps on and look out for the up and down mood of the market before splurging on anything.\nThe developers, named Brandon and Sam, originally thought of the concept behind the game as a prank, but then decided to fully develop a strategy game out of it. “The game was built and tested by people familiar with investing in crypto and other crazy assets. Originally made to MOCK the idiots that blindly invest money they don't have into Bitcoin, it soon became a real life simulation of Bitcoin investing,” the developers explained.\n“Bitcoin: The Crypto Card Game” Photo: Two Stupid Investors The main advantage of playing their game over real-life Bitcoin spending is guiltless entertainment. Players don’t need to break a sweat to obtain Bitcoin and play the game. Nevertheless, the developers warn that “Bitcoin: The Crypto Card Game” is not as easy as it looks. “Whilst easy to pick up and play straight away, the complexity of strategies and tactics gets much richer with experience where you have to think moves in advance to protect yourself and ruin your opponents.”\nThe developers also poked fun at people who went to extreme measures just to invest in Bitcoin. “If you like fast paced strategy games, laugh at people that sold their house to buy bitcoin, or simply want to show grandma how to lose all your cash online: buy Bitcon,” they said. Brandon and Sam added that the thing that drove them to create the game was the absurd things people were doing just to get on the cryptocurrency trend.\nAccording to them, the turning point of their project happened when a friend used his $7,000 government university loan just to invest in Bitcoin. “And so we decided to satire all the stupid bitcoin scams, cons, and investing stories we heard and create this crazy game. Now you can lose all your money, without losing all your money!”\n“Bitcoin: The Crypto Card Game” is now live on Kickstarter. It has an initial goal of AU$10,000. The developers said that the project will only be realized if the campaign reaches its goal by June 22, 2018. As of writing, the project has 33 backers and a total of AU$1,607 worth of pledges.\nA Bitcoin-inspired card game is seeking for funding support via Kickstarter.

But I am gonna tell everyone to keep faith on bitcoins power. I think who have already introduced with bitcoin last 2 years they know the orginal scenario of bitcoin. Last couple of weeks bitcoin price fall dramatically but we wish it will recover its turn up soon. Crypto currency is the first choice of modern generation. Already bitcoin got millipms of standard users who knows the pros and cons of bitcoin. Hence its downwords now because of some reasons like:\n1] Bank owners thinks its gonna spoil their banking business.\n2] Some merchant investors thinks its not safe to invest on bitcoin. It can be stolen or freeze.\n3] Some users doesn't know the exact use of bitcoin.\n4] Some government haven't got the exact technology to regulate bitcoin.\n5] Some users are not used to with BTC.\nThese are the exact reason why bitcoin price is surrounded on a limited area. Its just a matter of time to resolve all these issue.Then it will be a new era of Bitcoin.\nHere is some reasons what's gonna make the difference:\n1] Already most of the countries agreed to lead their economical strategy with bitcoin. Just government wants to make some rules and regulation to make a safer financial environment.\n2] Rival online companies are keen to accept their payment on bitcoin. Because its the fastest and secure payment gateway for them.\n3] In some countries bitcoin ATM is going successfully & users are pretty much happy with it.\n4] Crypto trading platforms are getting much popular than forex, stock markets. Worldwide investors are showing their interest to crypto trading.\n5] peoples are very interested to use bitcoin on their daily purchase payment option specially on super markets grocery shops, rental services where BTC is Accepted.\nIn my opinion bitcoin holders should keep calm and wait for the better future.

All coins went up. Things seemed just peachy. But last week was not that good as most coins lost some value against the USD. Take Bitcoin . It’s currently at $7365 against the dollar when it was beyond $8500 just a week or so ago. It is its lowest point since last April 18th when it was close to breaking the ten thousand barrier, and the market was all about rising prices. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is now at 126 billion, and it remains the biggest slice of the pie with a thirty-nine percent dominance.\nFears about Bitcoin are just identical as with all other main crypto coins such as Litecoin (LTC) or Ripple (XRP) . XRP has gone down by 0.34% over the last twenty-four hours, and 13% in the last week so it’s now at $0.60. Litecoin has found itself in a similar situation as it’s lost 0.18% in the last day, and 15.29% for the week – so it’s now at $117.9 USD. The Consensus 2018 conference a couple of weeks ago was supposed to prompt a market comeback that has not happened yet. Even as this is happening, observers are still predicting a market rally that will see Bitcoin and other digital assets reach new historical highs. Projections, studies, and analyses all agree on that, so investors should not be worried about the current lows, but financial markets have never been driven by rationality anyway. It seems we’ll just have to wait until the wind changes again, and we can all ride the bear back to the top. Even in the current context, there are good reasons to stay optimistic about Litecoin, Ripple, and Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC): The power of permanence Bitcoin has the name. It was the first cryptocurrency ever and it remains the one coin that holds the greater status, value, and demand. It’s been criticized by governments and observers, it’s been at the center of most scandals in the crypto world, it’s slow, the transfer fees are too expensive and, even when you take all into account, Bitcoin is still Bitcoin. It’s been around the longest, and it’s most certainly here to stay. Every other cryptocurrency owes its existence, at least to a point, to Bitcoin and it remains the safest option around. Besides the fact that it can be used for payments and for storing value, BTC has shown incredible resilience, it always recovers its value back, which is why Wall Street is getting involved with it. If cryptocurrency apocalypse were to happen today, there’s a ninety percent chance that Bitcoin would stick around anyway. So don’t bet against Bitcoin. It is going to stay around as long as there’s a crypto market. It has demand and as its network is scheduled for an upgrade. It can only become more valuable. Litecoin (LTC): Growing quietly but steadily Whatever else is happening with other alt-coins, LTC retains some kind of charm that is allowing it to be increasingly accepted everywhere around the planet. As Bitcoin becomes more of a means to store wealth, Litecoin is becoming a retail payment currency the world over. As more businesses accept it as a payment option and more people use it to buy goods and services, its demand and value can only increase. Ripple’s XRP: Partnerships matter From all three coins mentioned in this article, Ripple’s XRP is the one having the hardest time. Questions remain about Ripple Lab’s role in controlling (or not) the coin’s performance, and there’s the issue of the lawsuit (is it a security or not?) that could affect every coin in the crypto world. But the fact remains that, even in that context, Ripple is the one cryptocurrency that has proved it has practical value in the real world as at least seventy-five banks in the world are now using it to do their international transactions. There is every chance that the financial world will radically change because of Ripple’s technology and Ripple’s coin. Ripple’s xRapid has gained acceptance among many big players in the financial sector (Western Union is one of them). It’s shown it can make international payments quicker, cheaper and more reliable. This is making XRP entrenched in the real world. There’s demand for it and Ripple’s technology customers need it. Last thoughts The market is down at the moment; there’s just no doubt about that. But it will bounce back for sure and when it does these three coins will be leading the way to recovery. So don’t panic, just wait a bit.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Even if there are announcements supportive of individual cryptos as Bitcoin, we are not seeing any strong movement on the charts. Only lower lows and negative gains across the board is what we see. Despite everything, news of US DoJ and CFTC looking into possible market manipulation is a good thing for investors desirous of smooth volatility.\nFrom the News Straight from Argentina's Banco Masventas to Czech Republic's Prazska Plynarenska, there is a changing tide on the horizon guys! It's a monitoring tide, that which could lift cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin hopefully to new levels.\nIn a bid to remain relevant and not to be perceived as \"old\" by the young people of Czech Republic, their energy giant distributor Prazska Plynarenska will from June 2018 begin accepting payment in Bitcoin. It came as no surprise though. The country is a host of several Bitcoin ATMs and several eCommerce platforms accept payment in Bitcoin. However, while elaborating, the company was categorically stating that they won't be holding any Bitcoin themselves. Instead what would happen is that every time a customer settles their electricity bill in Bitcoin, conversion to fiat-national reserve currency Koruna-will be immediate. Moves like these buoy the cryptocurrency market and in the future-and following the lead of Argentina and Japan, more countries would follow suit and legitimize cryptos.\nWhile this was happening, the US DoJ is looking into what appears to be collective pump and dump efforts. For the keen eyed, this is something that is needed and of course, eyes will be popping soon considering the unregulated nature of cryptos. In the crypto world, especially for traders trading against BTC, wild moves are common. As a matter of fact, it's not a surprise to see Bitcoin prices swinging more than $1,000 within some few minutes. This worries many and now, together with the CFTC, the DoJ are investigating to check the level of this manipulation and fraud they are sure exists in the market. Efforts of spoofing-where unscrupulous traders place and pull different orders simultaneously or wash trading activities will in the coming days attract the keen eyes of the justice department.\nBitcoin Price Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Weekly Chart by Trading View\nIf we pull Bitcoin statistics then we see a gloomy situation. Bitcoin prices are down 12 percent in the last seven days but pretty stable in the last 24 hours shedding 3 percent as I type this. It has been mild but what we should be looking at is the close of each candlestick and the extent of losses within that week. Notice that relative to previous bars, last week depreciation was steep and saw Bitcoin prices slicing though $8,000. At this rate, trend traders should be looking for sell opportunities this day now that our close is below our previous support line at $7,800. Because of this predisposition, Bitcoin sell targets should be at February lows at $6,000.\nDaily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nTo get a perspective of possible trend, May 22 and 23 candlesticks should paint a better picture. During these two days, there was a literal doubling of trade volumes with prices sinking below $7,800. After that, the follow through has been fair in volumes but then prices are not recovering safe yesterday's weak attempts of buy shore.\nIn my view, taking shorts anywhere between $8,000 and $8,800 would present with better trade opportunities with targets at $6,000. This is only valid if and only if there is a short covering. Accompanying this appreciation would be light and below average volumes.\nOn the flip side though, if there happens to be sharp spikes in trading volumes and a bullish engulfing edging past May 23 candlestick, then it will be above time to exit shorts and buy.\nThe post Bitcoin is Down 50% From 2018 Highs But up 700% From 2017 Lows: Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis (May 28, 2018) appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T03:34:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aaedf7401032e3a79a07266631403481add74131", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQpkhtxmqxMi_vhyqU6FOQREbbjGbnmtHovDy6s3IdtWyP8drequCJ4Yav1hmqW8TzyBz3CpvAQz1mQ1J.3EuVAdf6r9wsXQu3q0GRgYdofXg--", "site_full": "videomatikportak.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://videomatikportak.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Videomatik Portakal", "title": "Coinadder.com sitesinde nasıl bitcoin çekme isteği yollanır?", "title_full": "Coinadder.com sitesinde nasıl bitcoin çekme isteği yollanır?", "published": "2018-05-28T03:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aaedf7401032e3a79a07266631403481add74131", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQpkhtxmqxMi_vhyqU6FOQREbbjGbnmtHovDy6s3IdtWyP8drequCJ4Yav1hmqW8TzyBz3CpvAQz1mQ1J.3EuVAdf6r9wsXQu3q0GRgYdofXg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Videomatik Portakal (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-28T03:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coinadder.com sitesinde nasıl bitcoin çekme isteği yollanır?", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T03:32:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca55056e7e0c33cc13a34ecc91bc409905d54fe9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQIf4szshrlQTNQqKJfkgmQCuv1NqC6S0L5u7LX1cCcjjEWwTPGYIuDwZLJVd41fL1xz22hbzHacFRObjfF9hMSOpsRpuh3gnY-", "site_full": "financialstrend.com", "site": "financialstrend.com", "site_section": "http://www.financialstrend.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Financial Trends", "title": "Bitcoin Is Dead | Could Be Time To Short!", "title_full": "Bitcoin Is Dead | Could Be Time To Short!", "published": "2018-05-28T03:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://financialstrend.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/63025249_s.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ca55056e7e0c33cc13a34ecc91bc409905d54fe9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQIf4szshrlQTNQqKJfkgmQCuv1NqC6S0L5u7LX1cCcjjEWwTPGYIuDwZLJVd41fL1xz22hbzHacFRObjfF9hMSOpsRpuh3gnY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brandon Manns", "published": "2018-05-28T03:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Is Dead | Could Be Time To Short!", "text": "Bitcoin Is Dead | Could Be Time To Short! share on: A Great Bitcoin Meltdown is Coming (its time to get rich)\nBrandon Manns, FT Editor\nIf you suspect Bitcoin is going to crash, I just want you to know, you’re right.\nMy name is Brandon Manns.\nI’ve worked at the financial sector for more than 20 years.\nAnd I’m writing today to tell you the truth about the Bitcoin that no one else will tell you…\nIt’s true… One Bitcoin is now worth more than ten times the price of one ounce of gold.\nI called it in 2013, when I personally bought Bitcoin…\nBut now I have an urgent new prediction about Bitcoin that I think could make you even more money.\nIt’s partly to do with what will happen after the Bitcoin crash … and what the #1 investment of 2018 will be.\nPrepare now, and get rich later.\nNobody else sees this coming.\nClick here and I’ll reveal what’s going on in full…\n© 2018 | Financials Trend.

S/Africa Authorities Probe $80million Bitcoin Scam 0\nSouth African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that caused investors a loss of 1 billion rand ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialized, police said on Friday.\nThe fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 percent per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent in a month, the police said.\nA search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended.\nThe website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations, Reuters reports.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T04:00:43.014+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 20508, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=11700", "requestsLeft": 545}
