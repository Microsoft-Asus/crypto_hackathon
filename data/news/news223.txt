Philippines Bank ‘Exploring How Bitcoin Works’ Through Mining\nImages uploaded to social media from the BusinessWorld Economic Forum 2018 by Satoshi Citadel Industries cofounder Miguel Cuneta show UnionBank CEO Edwin Bautista running four GPU miners at the bank’s booth.\nAccording to Cuneta, who was also present at the conference, UnionBank set up a “small mining rig to experiment and explore how it works.”\n“They want to learn more and best way is (through) experience,” he wrote in comments.\nBautista himself delivered a presentation on Bitcoin and Blockchain, during which he told audience members about the mining-focused “Bitcoin experiments” by the bank.\n— Miguel Cuneta (@MiguelCuneta) May 18, 2018 First Blockchain, Now Crypto For UnionBank\nMining Bitcoin marks the latest move in UnionBank’s digital “pivot” it originally announced earlier this year.\nOriginally targeting Blockchain, Bautista oversaw the development of the Philippines’ first Blockchain-based payment system for businesses called Visa B2B Connect from January onwards.\nAt the time, the CEO appeared considerably more optimistic about Blockchain than cryptocurrency itself, suggesting the latter’s reputation negatively influenced perceptions about the technology.\n“The blockchain technology is one of those technologies that are predicted to really alter the face of banking,” he told local news outlet ABS CBN.\nA lot of people will still associate blockchain with bitcoin, and because of that you have that negative impression of blockchain, but they are two different things. One is just simply riding on the other.\nNow, it appears, Bautista’s position has softened, bringing UnionBank beyond the level of participation of the majority of legacy financial institutions, which have stuck rigidly to Blockchain evangelism.\nThe major exception to date has been Switzerland, where banks have actively offered Bitcoin-based products since 2016 in what has become a highly-supportive environment for cryptocurrency usage.\nWhat do you think about UnionBank’s Bitcoin mining?

One is just simply riding on the other.\nNow, it appears, Bautista’s position has softened, bringing UnionBank beyond the level of participation of the majority of legacy financial institutions, which have stuck rigidly to Blockchain evangelism.\nThe major exception to date has been Switzerland, where banks have actively offered Bitcoin-based products since 2016 in what has become a highly-supportive environment for cryptocurrency usage.\nWhat do you think about UnionBank’s Bitcoin mining?

Now, it wants to fill a similar role in the artificial intelligence (AI) field as well.\nSpeaking in a rare interview, enigmatic Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu told Bloomberg that the company is channeling its expertise in developing application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips toward a nascent AI division.\nWu explained that ASIC chips , which the company uses to produce powerful and efficient cryptocurrency miners, are also important components for particular types of deep learning.\nMoving into this field provides the company with an excellent hedge, not only against a decline in the cryptocurrency market writ-large but also against a potential ban on mining from China’s government, which has already shown hostility toward other sectors of the cryptocurrency industry.\n“As a China company,” he said, “we have to be prepared.”\nBitmain’s interest in AI is not new. The company has already released several products through Sophon, its AI chip brand, and it has announced plans to release two more chip generations in the coming months.\nHowever, the scale of that interest may raise some eyebrows. The company, Wu said, believes that in five years as much as 40 percent of its revenue could come from its AI division.\nThat’s not an insignificant figure. Wall Street research firm Bernstein estimates that Bitmain made as much as $4 billion in operating profit last year, which makes it as or more profitable than chipmaking giant Nvidia.\nWhile Bitmain is the far-and-away market leader in the cryptocurrency mining space, the company is currently playing catch-up in the AI field. That’s because Google — whose parent company Alphabet is worth $750 billion — already has a head start.\nIn this field, however, Bitmain has regulation on its side, because the Chinese government has effectively banned local companies from using Google’s chips. Consequently, Bitmain has a much more viable road to becoming the mainland’s AI market leader.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Bitcoin at SD Bullion May 18, 2018 521\nThe following is a short review on what bitcoin (BTC) is and just how blurry the lines between fiction and reality are indeed getting…\nSD Bullion now allows customers to buy gold bullion with bitcoin and buy silver with bitcoin for single purchases of up to $ 20,000 USD .\nCryptocurrency bulls and bears are virtually anywhere you look these days.\nFuture US dollar bitcoin price predictions range from total worthlessness (e.g. Silver Doctor’s very own Half Dollar ) to potentially $6 or 7 figure price ranges (e.g. bubble vision, i.e. CNBC ).\nEven this guy, in his rented garage even has a masterclass to sell you.\nRegardless of opinions.\nHindsight is 20/20.\nSo lets review…\nIn less than 10 years, there has been an explosion in the number of private digital cryptocurrencies now available (there are currently more than 1,592 of them).\nThe consensus remains that the vast majority of them will be rendered worthless in time.\nThe most popular cryptocurrency to date remains bitcoin (BTC). With some 9 years in existence, by late 2017 bitcoin reached an all time record price above $19,500 USD per BTC.\nWith a starting price below 6¢ BTC in 2009, this marks a more than 325,000x return based on its price appreciation over this 9 year timeframe.\nAn unprecedented historic price rise dwarfing past Tulip manias, Mississippi bubbles, or virtually all other financial manias one could name.\nThe combination of somewhat early stage adoption, 2013 front page media headlines, and even more recent full spectrum media coverage have all alerted and even conditioned the public for further digital cryptocurrency adoption, speculation, and interest.\nYou likely all know that bitcoin has dominated media coverage over the last year or so. Yet we also must include its increased mentions and plot points in popular television shows and other tawdry entertainment venues.\nThe following tweeted short clip from season three of USA’s Mr. Robot should hold your attention.\nI like his antagonistic work as Phillip Price in @USA_Network ‘s Mr. Robot aka @WhoIsMrRobot\nre: bankster wet dream for more centralization, bank consolidation, less fractional reserve lending pic.twitter.com/OBBcXhZgFf\n— James Henry Anderson (@jameshenryand) January 12, 2018\nFictions aside, t here is no denying bitcoin’s adoption has increased yet it’s distribution still remains dominated by a small percentage of IP Addresses to date (e.g. nearly 40% of BTC are held at 1,526 addresses).\nIt remains to be seen if there will be another price ramp , errr… price run up in bitcoin (and other crypto currency) prices ahead.\nFor those lucky few out there who do hold profits in bitcoin, remember that physical precious metals like gold bullion and silver bullion have and will be around far longer than any other non-precious currency project mankind has or ever will continue to undertake (with or without data proven, price ramps behind or ahead).\nEven our dear banking lords at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has been transparent enough to acknowledge that fact.\nNever forget the stem from which all eventual failing currencies stem from.\n3 Steps to buy Silver and Gold with bitcoin at SD Bullion\nStep 1 ➤ Add gold and or silver bullion products to your SD Bullion cart\nStep 2 ➤ Proceed to checkout and select bitcoin as your form of payment\nStep 3 ➤ Order and immediately pay your bullion for bitcoin payment invoice\nWe use a proven bitcoin payment processor called BitPay, which gives customers the ability to buy silver and gold bullion with bitcoin (BTC) rather easily.\nUpon committing to buy bullion for bitcoin at SD Bullion, you’ll receive an invoice via email with our bitcoin address. Simply pay this invoice in full within 15 minutes using one of the approved bitcoin wallets above.\nNote that your bullion for BTC order can be in a pending status for as long as one business day. The reason why is the silver for bitcoin payments pass through several Bitcoin “blocks” for approval. During high congestion times it can take as long as 24 hours for your payment confirmation email to arrive.\nAlthough during heavy congestion timeframes bullion for bitcoin payments are not instantaneous, bitcoin is often one of the quickest forms of payment for bullion that we process and accept.\nBullion for bitcoin payments are also one of the cheapest options we offer: SD Bullion currently offers Bitcoin customers a 3% discount from our credit / debit card price on all orders. Do take note however that the bitcoin network always charges a transaction fee.\nBest of luck bitcoin and cryptocurrency hodlers out there. We over at SD Bullion remain ready to serve you in exchanging any future crypto BTC profits into physical bullion you can hodl tangibly.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

That is often true yet many don’t understand exactly how it works. In the case of the blockchain, its popularity is certainly bringing with it a lot of hype. The media has associated it with the cryptocurrency movement particularly with Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin is the most popular example of a blockchain at work. Bitcoin was also the first blockchain to ever be implemented successfully. Now some companies resurrected their stock price just by adding the word “blockchain” to their name e.g. Long Blockchain Corp. aka Long Island Iced Tea. Even Kodak made their move by announcing a cryptocurrency on their own blockchain. Many IT consulting firms have also hopped on the bandwagon about the relevance of blockchain technology. Blockchain garners plenty of attention, both good and bad. There are critics who don’t believe it will be scalable and proponents (mostly in cryptocurrency) who have strong faith in the technology. Most people however, do not understand how it works or assume it can be applied to anything. It is true that you can use blockchain anyway you like, but there are some purposes that are more practical than others. For starters, you don’t need to have a cryptocurrency to implement a blockchain. The blockchain is just the underlying technology of cryptocurrency projects in general. It’s like you can use the Internet without requiring you to buy anything online. A blockchain is an immutable digital ledger that is a continuously growing distributed database that is cryptographically secured. It primarily records transactions in a digital manner, so it involves computers called nodes. The transactions are stored in a transparent manner which makes it available to all parties. It is also censorship resistant, meaning it cannot be hidden from others once it has been recorded. This is because the transactions are distributed among many computers on a network that replicate a copy of the blockchain. If anyone is considering manipulating data on a blockchain, they will have to decrypt that on each computer. This is not only time consuming, but the blockchain was designed to discourage any sort of attack due to a consensus algorithm. That means that any block that contains a transaction cannot be manipulated by a single computer unless it has the resources to do so. That would mean expending a majority of compute resources which is not only costly, but requires expending plenty of electricity. An attacker will just be wasting more resources when it could be more profitable to help the network instead. All transactions on a blockchain are also not retroactive, meaning they cannot be changed once they are recorded. No one owns the blockchain itself, so it was meant to be a decentralized system. That way no one can control it the way they like. Instead it allows a distributed consensus mechanism for validating transactions which participating nodes must agree upon. A visual representation of a blockchain. Each computer is called a node denoted by letters A to F. Each node is connected to all other nodes in a distributed decentralized topology, meaning no particular node controls everything. The connection does not have to be directly physical, it can be logical. Often the Internet or a public IP network is used as the infrastructure for blockchains. From what we mentioned so far, a blockchain stores information of transaction data that is immutable, distributed across computers, transparent to all and resistant from any form of censorship. It is the version of what happened, which can be accepted as the truth because it is digitally stored on a public ledger. For the most part blockchains are public, though there are other implementations which can use a private or a hybrid architecture that is based on business requirements. A blockchain can also be centralized for different purposes, so not all are decentralized in nature. The blockchain is also a form of bookkeeping that uses a similar concept to “Triple Entry Accounting”. In a transaction you often just use two entries, one for the buyer and one for the seller. That is basic “Double Entry Accounting”. On a blockchain when you record the transaction you have a third entry, which is also cryptographically secured from any sort of tampering. Anyone can then be witness to what has been recorded on the blockchain. In a blockchain, computers don’t actually have to be physically connected to one another. This is why it uses the Internet and its protocols TCP/IP for interconnectivity. Each computer maintains a copy of the blockchain database so this makes it decentralized. In the event one computer goes down, the rest of the system still works because of their decentralized and distributed architecture. In reality, you cannot and should not, put everything on the blockchain. Personal and private information are best kept on a centralized database rather than a distributed decentralized public database. You would certainly not want that, otherwise you’re just feeding information freely to bad actors. Certain information needs to be anonymized. Remember when Equifax was hacked and the information hackers were able to steal? Social security numbers, drivers license numbers and annual income should not be put out on a public ledger. Another example of what not to make public is sensitive medical records. This is protected by laws like HIPAA which guarantees safety of a patient’s medical information. Certain scams and identity theft will be problems should any confidential information be stored on a public database. If that is the case, then what sort of transactions are being recorded on a blockchain? Let’s take a look at Bitcoin. Supposed we have a buyer named Bob and a seller named Alice. Bob sends 5 Bitcoins or BTC to Alice as a payment for an item she sold him. This is recorded as a transaction when nodes called miners validate the transaction in a block that is then added to the blockchain on the Bitcoin network. The transaction will prove that Alice received a payment of 5 BTC from Bob. That can no longer be contested since it is digitally encoded for all to see. What is important here is that it is about the receipt of payment, not the item. This can also help Bob prove he paid Alice in the event that Alice failed to deliver the item she was selling. So the blockchain validates the truth in this way: For Alice — Proves that she received a paymentFor Bob — Proves that Bob made a payment Bob, a buyer, pays Alice, the seller, in Bitcoin BTC As you can see from this example, what we should put on the blockchain is information that cannot be disputed. Things that are, so to speak, “written in stone”. Contracts come to mind as another example. An agreement in the sale of property can be implemented on the blockchain using Smart Contracts. They basically contain conditions that when satisfied, execute code to release funds. This has been successfully done already using a real estate example by a real estate company named Propy back in October 2017. This was regarding a Smart Contract sale of property in the Ukraine that used the Ethereum blockchain. It allowed Michael Arrington, co-founder of the website TechCrunch, to buy property in the Ukraine from developer Mark Ginsburg. This shows how a properly executed contract on the blockchain can work. What happened here was Propy connected a buyer, Michael Arrington to a seller, Mark Ginsburg. Through the Smart Contract, the payment and settlement was made and is now an indisputable transaction recorded on a blockchain. Today transparency is becoming a key requirement in many transactions for tracking purposes. This information is also meant to be always shared, requiring transparency. Advertising is one such industry that can benefit with records stored on a blockchain. This is because the ad industry suffers from lack of transparency and murky reconciliation. The lack of quality control, security and financial transparency between many parties involved can become a problem. Fraud is something that the ad industry has been trying to prevent. What blockchain can provide is a solution built on trust that addresses the problems fraud can bring to this ecosystem. By design, a blockchain solution prevents data from being altered retroactively, ensuring the verifiability and integrity of transactions. This can also guarantee accuracy and prevention of any sort of data manipulation. According to IBM “Blockchain will not only ensure trust and transparency, it can help advertisers of all sizes reduce transaction costs, increase efficiency, simplify contracts and improve invoice processing.” Companies in the ad industry like Unilever are developing their own blockchain projects as a way for companies to disclose reliable information about their business footprint. This can help prevent fiascos like what happened with Facebook ads. Due to lack of transparency, bad actors purchased ads to use for malicious purposes without Facebook knowing. When bad actors try to show ads on social media platforms that use a blockchain, they will have to provide their real identity and this can discourage those from misusing the platform. No more fake accounts pretending to be legit companies trying to buy ads. Applications of a blockchain beyond Bitcoin (source: IBM) Businesses will also benefit from this transparency in sharing information among themselves. For healthcare, insurance providers can have a better way to exchange this data in a private manner. This is not shared outside their circle so it can still meet compliance. The supply chain can also become more efficient for business to business dealings. When transactions are more readily available, it creates more trust with security. This will encourage all parties involved in a business deal to be more honest and not hide anything since audits can now use the blockchain. Inventory can also become more efficient when there is a public record of all items sold. Accounting can then verify the figures for items sold and revenues made. That way a business will know what items to stock up on and which ones are not selling. Perhaps it is the concept of removing the middleman in business deals that make blockchain sound lucrative, but blockchain is really about the process of recording transactions. It can still involve a middleman, unless the blockchain was used with a cryptocurrency using a peer-to-peer payment system. What else can we put on a blockchain? Here are some more examples: Books — Copies of popular books will benefit all. To put a public copy of texts like “The Origin of Species” do not require any changes and can be permanently written in digital form that is available to all. Historical Records — Digital versions of artifacts including the US Declaration of Independence can be stored on the blockchain forever without being tampered with to guarantee authenticity. Voting — There are concepts of voting systems that implement blockchains. Colombia is one of those countries to try it out with a plebiscite system that allowed expats to vote. It makes plenty of sense to see votes recorded in real time, making it also harder to change or doctor by a bad actor. Gaming — Online gaming is one way to use blockchains to incentivize gamers with tokens as a reward to accomplishing new levels. Gaming networks can develop ecosystems that use these tokens to purchase accessories, upgrades, new games, new levels and even characters. This would be rather more practical than “loot boxes” because they are legitimized on the platform. This will also be better for gamers since they don’t need to worry about using their credit card to make purchases each time when they have a digital wallet that uses a gaming platform’s own tokens. These are then recorded on a blockchain for verification. Public Data — Whether from the government or any other agency, published information for the public can be recorded on the blockchain. A Korean developer has even put the treaty between North and South Korea on the Ethereum blockchain. Other public information like agreements, laws and statistical figures can be made readily available on blockchains. Fintech — The financial world, including banks are exploring blockchains. Real time point-to-point transfer of funds removes more friction and speeds up the clearing and settlement process when using a blockchain. This also makes better document management with trust using the blockchain to record financial data. That way, banks can also disclose financial information to the public and to meet their own compliance. Content Protection — Creatives can monetize and protect their content like music, poetry, songs and art when it is put on a blockchain. This is to establish copyright protection and allows them to also get incentives for their content. An artist can claim their rights to a certain painting when it is recorded on a blockchain, much the same with songwriter’s claims to writing the lyrics for a song. This is still an emerging field and new platforms are exploring the possibilities. Platform — There are various projects building decentralized applications or DApps that use blockchains with a tokenized system. Executable Distributed Code Contract or Smart Contracts can be created to execute conditions to a transaction also built on top of a blockchain, in this case for the Ethereum network. These are ways to use a blockchain as a platform for application development. Decentralized Applications DApps have no central server. This uses the blockchain as a platform. We can use blockchains for many purposes, decentralized or centralized, public or private. There is always a vetting process of what information is the truth before being permanently recorded, but that is another aspect. Once past that what gives blockchains its purpose is how information can be shared. Information that requires transparency are the most important thing to store on public blockchains. Otherwise, it should not store confidential data. For security purposes, no one would want a database that stores their social security number online for all to see, that should only be for government and other agencies that require it. If the data is confidential and must only be shared among certain groups, a blockchain can be a private and permissioned system. People can also use a hybrid blockchain system like public data on the Internet and private data in an intranet. All this can be done with blockchains and it doesn’t need to involve cryptocurrency. Blockchain revenue projections to 2025 (Source: Tractica https://www.tractica.com/ ) On a final note, blockchain is also not the solution to every problem. It may not even be around in the future if a better technology can replace it. Even existing centralized database solutions will work for what they were designed to do. What blockchains can do is improve upon sharing information in a transparent and secure way, so we can build trust in a verification system. That has many possibilities to be explored.

For much of the fund's history, that allocation was relatively stable in number of shares, and hovered between 6 percent and 10 percent of the portfolio, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin often led the list of top holdings in ARKK. Only one other ETF on the market offered parallel access to bitcoin — ARKK's internet-focused counterpart ARK Web x.0 ETF ( ARKW ).\nMore from ETF.com:\nThe next bond crash: An ETF story\nWhy I don't use target date funds\nWorld's cheapest 'do good' ETF\nBitcoin, accessed through the Bitcoin Investment Trust ( GBTC ), was a major driver behind both these funds' returns last year. ARKK and ARKW were each up more than 87 percent in 2017. GBTC itself was up a whopping 1,550 percent.\nHere's the ETFs' rally last year, and that impressive rally relative to GBTC's, in two charts:\nBut these ETFs' big bet on bitcoin is no longer the case. In mid January of this year, ARK began trimming exposure to bitcoin in both funds, and today bitcoin represents only 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent in ARKK and ARKW, respectively. The cryptocurrency is almost a negligible allocation in these portfolios now.\nWhy? According to ARK, the \"complicated decision\" to dramatically trim bitcoin exposure was more driven by regulatory and tax-related concerns than by the \"merits\" of bitcoin itself.\nBut performance probably played a major role in this portfolio shift. Bitcoin — as measured by GBTC — rose dramatically in 2016 and in early 2017, and then began to fall later in the year. So far in 2018, GBTC has already dropped 37 percent, bringing its losses from its mid-December 2017 high to more than 63 percent in just five months. (ARKK and ARKW are each up about 15 percent year-to-date.)\nshow chapters Early bitcoin investor reveals which cryptocurrencies he would HODL or FODL 10:19 AM ET Fri, 18 May 2018 | 10:16 It could very well be that ARK was simply taking profits on its bitcoin allocation earlier this year, and has been trimming that position since as bitcoin prices continue to struggle. If GBTC price performance did in fact motivate the move, any recovery in bitcoin prices could mean an increase in allocation down the road.\nFor now, however, given that the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve the launch of a bitcoin ETF — many issuers have thrown their hats into that ring — investors who want access to the cryptocurrency through an ETF wrapper have slim pickings at best.\n— By Cinthia Murphy, ETF.com .

Incidentally, bitcoin’s bottom on February 6 th coincided with the record volatility spike in mainstream global equity markets, indicating that the two spaces may have more correlation and interlinks than orthodox market analysts would like to believe.\nWith the fiat price of bitcoin, ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and ripple ( XRP-USD ) contracting yesterday and closing in on support, crypto markets may in the coming days establish a stabilizing trading-range that could help lessen some of the systemic volatility that has been keeping many mainstream investors and institutions out of the crypto space. At current prices, bitcoin is still 31% above support at $6,200, ethereum is 83% above it, and ripple has a 42% buffer zone. While we have not quite yet established a stable trading range, we are getting closer. Once we do, we could start seeing more mainstream acceptance for the sector and higher liquidity, which would add to the stabilization affect.\nMeanwhile, initial coin offerings (ICO) continue to thrive despite the fall from highs, indicating that enthusiasm for crypto-finance has not waned despite price swings and regulatory threats. While ICOs do have their dangers, we believe that in order to fully understand the potential of blockchain technology, those interested in the space should be acquainted with promising tokens being offered, not necessarily to invest, but in order to broaden investors’ views and understanding about the applications for the infrastructure that underpins the cryptocurrency space.\nHere are three ICOs that investors may want to take a look at with the aim of understanding how blockchain may be applied in the very near future.\nValorem\nToday’s ultra-centralized fiat banking system relies on unelected representatives running central banks to set interest rates not in accordance with the supply and demand for money, as the free market would set rates, but in accordance with central bankers’ hunches about what interest rates should be, based on data that they collect and extrapolate from. The dangers of today’s central-bank-controlled system of interest rates and loans are obvious. Central banks could simply be wrong about what they believe the price of money should be, thereby aggravating the business cycle, causing booms and busts.\nValorem is an ICO that plans to use the valorem token, at a rate of 1 ETH to 1000 VLR, to facilitate a decentralized banking system that uses an Airbnb-type feedback and trust mechanism to secure microloans, student loans, and car loans to start. Decisions regarding interest rates will be determined by individual lenders in accordance with the level of trust the borrower has on the system and how much funds are available at any given time.\nThis ICO is 73% funded with 41 days left until closing. Investors by May 28 th can benefit from a 10% bonus.\nEthereum Travel Token\nThe myriad of institutions that a traveler’s financial information passes though on its way to booking an actual flight includes the travel website, airlines, payment merchants, governments, and border control agencies. At each stage there is risk of data leaks and hidden fees are taken at each stage. Since there is no unified ledger for each of these layers in the travel industry, redundancy is rampant and efficiency is diminished. An added disadvantage is that disparate systems of travel rewards are often incompatible, making it impossible in many cases to maximize travel discounts.\nThe Ethereum Travel Token (ETHTT) aims to simultaneously unify and decentralize the process of travel booking by bringing all aspects of travel including airlines, hotels and car rentals under one roof using one token. This both maximizes efficiency and eliminates data transfer redundancies that creates susceptibility to hacking. Rewards become streamlined and intercovertible across airlines and hospitality industries.\nThis ICO is not live yet, but the pre ICO begins in 18 days on June 5 th , with crowdfunding beginning on the 5 th of July at an exchange rate of 10,000 ETHTT to 1 ETH.\nSmoke Network\nThis one is for the cannabis crowd. The SMOKE Network aims to protect cannabis content producers from government censorship. Participants upload content, and based on quality decided by participant feedback, are rewarded in tokens by the network which can be exchanged for cryptocurrency. The basic idea here is to create a secure community separated from regulatory authorities where users can maintain anonymity while creating cannabis-related content without the risk of being called out by family members or regulators.

Data supports that notion. In fact, bitcoin mining is expected to be a major source of global energy consumption this year.\n“In the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin’s energy requirements, a Commentary appearing May 16 in the journal Joule , financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin’s electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there,” reports Science Daily .\nThere is significant room for growth in the cryptocurrency universe. Recent data suggest a small amount of American investors own any digital currencies and, after bitcoin, the numbers of crypto ownership dwindle .\nSome bitcoin bulls believe the cryptocurrency can return to $20,000 or even move to $25,000 as soon as later this year. As of this writing Thursday, bitcoin has a market value of $141.32 billion. Mining Costs And Consumption\nEstimates from de Vries confirm that bitcoin mining consumes massive amounts of energy.\n“His estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland,” according to Science Daily. “A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month.”\nMining costs are pivotal for bitcoin miners. The higher the break-even point, the more likely some smaller miners give up or temporarily get out of the game. Estimates vary on the break-even point for bitcoin mining, ranging from $6,000 to $8,000 and higher. With bitcoin currently trading just under $8,300, a break-even point of $8,000 may not be enough for some miners to take on the expense of higher energy bills.\n“The huge costs associated with Bitcoin mining – a process that ‘timestamps’ transactions and performs extensive calculations – has been a subject of criticism since years. And with the increase in the network’s size, the costs are further poised to grow, possibly consuming 5 percent of the world’s total electricity in the future,” reports CCN .\nFor more information on the cryptocurrency market, visit our Bitcoin category .

The trial is expected to be tested in a number of areas of Japan next year.\nThe move may not have a strong influence on cryptocurrency market, as the M U F G coin will be issued next year. However, the fin tech project does facilitate wider adoption and acceptance of digital currency. Twitter CEO Supports Bitcoin to Monopolize Cryptocurrency Industry\nJack Dorsey, Twitter and Square Chief Executive Officer confirmed to be a fan of crypto currency. He believes that Bitcoin will win the battle with other crypto currencies like Ethereum goes on to become the internet native currency in the future. Dorsey declared that he has hopes that bitcoin will continue to establish itself as the primary method of payments. He is also a personal investor in bitcoin who expects the digital currency to be applied in trading of simple things like coffee and he anticipated a ten-year timeline for bitcoin to have dominated the industry. Bing to Disable Cryptocurrency Ads\nCrypto currency ads were not taken friendly by a number of world’s biggest companies on the financial market, including Facebook and Google. Developed and operated by Microsoft, Bing platform joined the movement and decided to ban crypto tokens ads starting July 2018. Microsofts move was highly predictable, as the company had already shown its mistrust to digital currency ads. However, the decision to ban advertisements of virtual coins on Bing is quite logical and barely has an influence on the crypto currency market.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mitsubishi ufj financial group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mufg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T21:27:51.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f52d7215a669481a4a7bee7126077fed9808902", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd0Ois4p26MhgoZW1GrS0yE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=161.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marketplace (Altcoins)", "title": "Bitcoin can return $ 20,000?", "title_full": "Bitcoin can return $ 20,000?", "published": "2018-05-18T18:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.057, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f52d7215a669481a4a7bee7126077fed9808902", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmd0Ois4p26MhgoZW1GrS0yE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Koarpeniwu", "published": "2018-05-18T18:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin can return $ 20,000?", "text": "Bitcoin actually topped $ 20,000\nOr just an unfounded statement?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:17:43.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "470703291efeff32f9b1c42d6d98d840fbac0e77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTA8_uO46SEPG9oENxPifs_iqJmnnVli_2NvHLJG3Hjwzrgbq_VVtLrM6H1i_PrAWowAPk1_k88zvY2Af8poiJ5", "site_full": "www.earnforex.com", "site": "earnforex.com", "site_section": "https://www.earnforex.com/videos", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex Videos", "title": "Bitcoin Forecast — May 18th 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin Forecast — May 18th 2018", "published": "2018-05-18T18:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 35073, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "470703291efeff32f9b1c42d6d98d840fbac0e77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTA8_uO46SEPG9oENxPifs_iqJmnnVli_2NvHLJG3Hjwzrgbq_VVtLrM6H1i_PrAWowAPk1_k88zvY2Af8poiJ5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "K.

The 8,000 level below looks supportive, but if we can break down below this level, I think we could unwind to 7,000. Any rally at this point should continue to be a selling opportunity. The 9,000 level above is a bit of a ceiling currently. With US dollar strengthening overall, I think that makes sense.\nBitcoin/JPY — Against the Japanese yen, the bitcoin is testing the 900,000 yen level. If we can break down below there, we should go to 800,000, and then 700,000. That is the bottom of the overall consolidation. So, it makes sense as a target. We have failed to reach the high of the consolidation. So, really at this point, I think we are going to drop from here.

I have been going through a lot of speculations threads and many of them are saying that bitcoin is going to clash after splitting but I disagree with that and for your information another pump is about to happen and this is going to push bitcoin price above $8,000. I have also see that this may happen before end of this year.\nYou can see that bitocin prices have fallen for several days in a row and this has caused the market to go down in the past few days and are heading back down. As far as my analysis, bitcoin prices are likely to increase in the short term and there will be some next correction before falling further.

I am not an expert crypto currency but I have my doubts about it and my doubts center around the fact that what's the social utility of crypto currency. I'm not talking a block chain block and the technology I think has real value. But currency markets are the most liquid most efficient markets probably of any markets that exist. But there are markets where they aren't liquid and they aren't efficient. Emerging markets for instance are markets where everything from nationalization or Venezuela or fish to countries in Africa. OK so you're talking on a couple of countries a couple of countries I a whole continent like my problem crypto currency is that I think the social utility is at least in certainly in developed countries is extremely small and the only thing I can really figure out the usage of it is that it's good for speculation and it's good for money laundering. And what I really can't figure out is you know the United States we have massive regulations about money laundering. You know the banks have to comply with rules that from here to my apartment. And there is there are banks in this country today that are certain restrictions because they still not completely comply with the regulations even think about all this and think oh this is an opportunity to sort this thing air has to come out of this because regulation is the reason why it's trying to find one without almost nothing in currency.\nAnd the reason why I'm not interested in investing in bitcoin or shorting bitcoin is to me it's like arguing how many angels dance on the head of a pin. I have no idea how to value it and and are they going to be elst as either. Author: VW Staff The post above is drafted by the collaboration of the ValueWalk Team.

The news caused Trueusd (TUSD) to rise by an unprecedented 40% before eventually subsiding. Trust Token, the coin’s developers, have now explained to news.Bitcoin.com how this sequence of events came to be.\nAlso read: “Stablecoin” Trueusd Pumps After Binance Listing Trueusd and the Moon Mission That Wasn’t Meant to Be\nAs reported on Thursday, TUSD pumped to $1.39 off the back of news that Binance would be listing the supposed stablecoin. Binance has since postponed its listing of the token, pushing the event back by a few days “to prepare for sufficient liquidity”. Trust Token, for its part, has responded to the incident in a blogpost, writing:\nTrueUSD saw a large, sudden increase in demand after Binance first announced that they are listing TUSD. We believe that bots (and some misinformed traders) purchased TrueUSD as soon as the announcement was made.\nThe post continues: “Generally, our policy is that “redeemability leads to stability.” The value of a TrueUSD token is that it can be redeemed for one US dollar. There will only be as many tokens in circulation as there are dollars in the escrow account to collateralize the tokens. In the long run, this feature precedes price stability, since the price will return to $1.00 (as it did today) as long as the token continues to be redeemable.” Trust Is Earned\nAs a piece of parting advice, Trust Token advises traders not to pay any more than $1.05 per token, otherwise “you may lose money.” Trust Token’s co-founder and CTO Rafael Cosman spoke to news.Bitcoin.com to clarify some of the issues raised in the blog post, and pointed out that when TUSD was listed on Bittrex in March, traders were issued with the same advice – not to pay more than $1.05 per token.\nAssuaging concerns that TUSD could dip discernibly below $1, Rafael Cosman said:\nPrice stability is maintained by market-making incentives. Today, market-makers buy TrueUSD for $1.00 directly from the bank, anticipating that if the price hits even $1.01 they can arbitrage some profit. The opportunity for redemption incentivizes market-makers to keep at $1.00 and not below: if the price was to dip to $0.99, then market-makers could buy it and redeem it for $1.00. Market-makers would quickly scoop in and buy all the “sell” orders for below $1.00 until none were left and the price returned to $1.00. Bot or Not?\nFollowing up on claims that bots were to blame for TUSD’s sudden price spike this week, Rafael Cosman added: “It’s fairly common knowledge in the crypto industry that there are bots that “listen” for announcements of coins listing on exchanges and buy any coin as soon as it is listed on a new exchange. This is usually profitable, since more buyers for a token can mean a higher price. However, in the case of Trueusd, any person who knows that the token is redeemable for $1.00 knows they will lose money if they buy it for more, and so market-makers holding Trueusd happily sold it to bots for above $1.00 until there was no more demand.”\nStablecoins are still highly experimental at this stage, and while some “stable bears” believe perfect dollar parity will never be reached, others are confident that anomalies such as that which befell TUSD will be ironed out in time. As Trust Token acknowledged , even “the most stable of stablecoins will occasionally experience variance.”\nDo you think occasional volatility is inevitable with stablecoins?

It has existed on the grounds that January 1st, 2009, and may be used as payment components in webstores and for different on-line services. Bitcoin isn’t, like typical funds, made via a valuable bank. as an alternative, all bitcoin that exist are created by way of having computer systems take part in fixing specific mathematical issues. This works as follows: every person can run particular software on his or her desktop that participates in fixing this type of mathematical difficulty. The owner of the laptop that solves the difficulty receives 25 (newly created) bitcoin as a reward. because it became the case that in 2014 such an issue is solved each 10 minutes, 25 new bitcoins have been created every 10 minutes. On January 1st, there were (about) 12.2 million bitcoin.”\nFollowing from the previous introduction, students had been requested to remedy 5 diverse mathematical problems. The questions requested that students “calculate in what 12 months the quantity of bitcoin exceeded 18 million,” “calculate from which 12 months on the reward will be below one bitcoin,” “determine the maximal quantity of bitcoin that can be in circulation,” apart from posing addition complications according to the components used to employed to clear up the aforementioned questions. Netherlands Warming to Cryptocurrency\nThe check has been offered to students following expanding focus of cryptocurrency on the a part of Holland’s associations.\nthroughout March, the court docket of Amsterdam decided that bitcoin possesses “residences of wealth” while adjudicating a civil rights case between a person looking for compensation from an unfulfilled contract touching on bitcoin mining. The court docket concluded that “bitcoin represents a price and is transferable” and “as a consequence suggests qualities of a property correct. A claim for payment in Bitcoin is, hence, to be considered as a claim that qualifies for verification.”\npast this month, the ambassador of the Dutch Blockchain Coalition, Rob van Gijzel, offered a countrywide blockchain analysis agenda, which had been commissioned with the aid of the Dutch Ministry of economic Affairs and climate coverage. The ministry had created a designated committee, TopTeam ICT, tasked with examining the capabilities legal, economic, and ethical implications of dispensed ledger know-how within the Netherlands.\nDo you think that greater colleges the world over will are looking for to combine subject matters pertinent to bitcoin into examinations as cryptocurrency adoption grows?

The cost associated with mining the bitcoin could become difficult to handle, especially with so much energy used today\nBitcoin Mining Using Nearly 0.5 Percent of the World’s Energy. There have been concerns in recent time over how the bitcoin is being mined. As the bitcoin mining process becomes more complicated with fewer rewards coming out of mined blocks, there becomes a need for people to use more energy to get their coins mined with the industry producing enough energy to power all of the country of Ireland. Even then, there is no guarantee a miner will get the proof of stake needed for collecting the rewards.\nThe greatest concern surrounding the bitcoin mining process is that the amount of energy being used for it is increasing. A report from prominent bitcoin analyst Alex de Vries was released on Cell.com stating that the bitcoin mining efforts around the world have become extensive enough to where close to 0.5 percent of the world’s energy usage is being used for bitcoin mining.\nThe report is based on an analysis of data points. These points are the bitcoin-mining computers that have been operating within the year. The amount of energy consumption and the sizes of the mining farms working were reviewed to come up with a calculation of the bitcoin network operating at 2.55 gigawatts of power. This is about the same amount of energy used through Ireland.\nThe de Vries report states that based on the growth of the mining market, the number may go up to around 7.67 gigawatts before the year ends. This would be close to the amount of energy used in Austria according to general reports.\nThe greatest concern in de Vries’ report is that the mining process is becoming increasingly expensive as added energy is being used to produce coins. This could make it to where the cost to produce the bitcoin could be higher than the value of the bitcoin. Unless the bitcoin’s value dramatically rises, there is a chance that the mining industry will become less savory as the expense involved become too prohibitive.\nHowever, the mining process continues to be appealing for people based on how well the reward is laid out. When a mining group manages to produce a new block with a proof of stake, 12.5 bitcoins are provided to that group. This is good for close to $100,000 in value when the current value of the bitcoin is considered. But the most powerful systems that use more energy would be more likely to get this due to the need to resolve extensive equations to get the currency mined accordingly.\nThe cost of bitcoin mining is expected to increase as the complexity of getting the bitcoin produced increases. But what is most concerning is that in the future, the reward that will come from a bitcoin block will decline to 6.25 coins per block. This dramatically reduces the reward that the person will get. There is anticipation that the increased difficulty might result in the currency being more valuable for mining purposes because of how tough it is to find and get new coins, but there are no guarantees that the value will certainly increase thanks to this change.
