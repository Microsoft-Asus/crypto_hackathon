main digital currency - Bitcoin market chart. Bitcoin price failed to succeed in overcoming the mark above $7755 dollars - the strategic level of resistance, under which the market is traded during the second week. This is not an easy task for Bitcoin, given current market levels, besides there is a descending trend line close to the level, which starts on May 6 at $ 9700. If in the coming trading sessions, bulls will not resume attempts to seize the initiative, supported by the growth in volume, Bitcoin dropping to levels of $6500 will almost inevitably.\nCorrective rally from $7020 to $7755 caused some optimism, especially among short-term bulls, as on analytical resources there were talks that the Bitcoin price would recover to $10000 in June. Although the target at $10000 is still in play, another correction is likely to occur in the next few days, but this time downward correction given that the corrective rally from $7040 stopped at $7755, and then Bitcoin fell to $7450 dollars.\nJune 4 daily candle was to become a major short-term market breakthrough, rising above the monthly downtrend from 6 May and actually creating a bottom at $7020. However, this did not happen, as the closing shorts most likely triggered the latest growth. The market capitalization at the beginning of the American trading session is at the level of $339 billion.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jun", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T17:19:37.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2b3c397fea4584d779db19dea6e4686612d3629", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfON688I2DGqUtD3TiNuUjr1cGy7ebbSfL0P4nmf27Jm43r_3b_lPl6qw_.LI4uxvsHF4MvsB8W8EYeddj6dydmWByiOF.a_GJsg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "This is insane.

But why is Bitcoin (BTC) falling and will it continue to fall below $7,500? PUBLISHED: 15:10, Mon, Jun 4, 2018 | UPDATED: 15:19, Mon, Jun 4, 2018 0\nThe bitcoin price has struggled to turn around the one-month descending trend since the start of May.\nIf the upward movement of bitcoin fades, experts predict there could be a decline in the currency to the $6,000 region.\nThe corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,700 looked optimistic, particularly among short-term bulls who have predicted the price of bitcoin would hit back to the $10,000 region within June.\nA short-term break out to the $8,000 region supported by the corrective rally from $7,040 was conditional, as this required the volume of BTC to rise and the cryptocurrency to keep going at its weekly peak. Related articles Ripple price RISES as new currency exchange is launched TODAY\nDue to its low trading volume though, BTC has not met a major short-term support level at $8,000 and so has fallen to to $7,600.\nA drop to $7,500 could result in BTC experiencing yet another minor correction, potentially to the higher end of $6,000 or even lower.\nWriting for Daily FX, market analyst Paul Robinson said: \"Keep an eye on the daily trend-line on weakness – a hold may give us the larger pattern at some point, while a break could lead down towards 6400.\"\nWhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of BTC is 43.3, it is not showing an oversold condition for BTC.

And that’s what makes IBM a better long-term investment than the digital currency.\nInvestors running behind Bitcoin while their price is constantly changing, hoping to find other investors to sell them at a higher price, have not realized anything: the promise of the technology behind Bitcoin, as opposed to the promise of Bitcoin himself as an alternative currency.\nUndoubtedly, the technology behind Bitcoin, the so-called blockchain, has the potential to change capitalism, bringing efficiency, transparency and accurate recording to daily transactions. Bitcoin, as an alternative to national currencies, can change capitalism by democratizing transactions, eliminating corruption and shifting power from central banks to the people.\nThat is why I have called it “the currency of the people”. The problem is, in both cases, that Bitcoin will face the opposition of economic elites.\nThe use of the anti-corruption blockchain, which prevents developing countries from becoming developed, is expected to come to terms with the opposition of the elites who benefit from corruption. Indeed, Bitcoin is already being fired by central banks because it is used instead of national currencies.\nThese are unpleasant news for those who invest in Bitcoin, as banks can find ways to delay demand for Bitcoin by limiting price rises and – sometimes – by shaking it, as the Chinese government did last September. There is also another problem: blockchain technology can be used to create other encryption that will compete with Bitcoin. Such examples are, for example, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple.\nThese are also bad news for investors. More crypnombos could at some point crush the price of Bitcoin, as happened with the 17th-century tulip. To put it simply, the technology Bitcoin created at some point will undermine its survival. This is not the case for leading companies in blockchain technology – IBM is one of them.\n“Yes, IBM can overcome Bitcoin, because most of the initial IPO bids are central businesses using decentralized solutions.” Ether and Bitcoin are decentralized solutions without some companies running them, but all are mainly decentralized solutions at central IBM is therefore in the same category as business functions that are 90% more profitable than cryptosanisations that do not have IBM’s operating profit history, “says David Dir ic, president of LDJ Capital.\nA few weeks ago, IBM announced an investment of $ 5.5 million to build the first blockchain solution center in Sao Paulo, Brazil. (There are already similar centers in England, USA, Canada, Japan and Germany.) Additionally, IBM is already running many quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and cyber-security research projects.

I meant the thread as a place to discuss predictions of Bitcoin to help or raise awareness in a time where some real things in the world are changing in a big way. If you think it's a bubble, feel free to go into detail why you think so, and why/what will cause the bubble to burst? Here's the thing: In order to give valid reasons for Bitcoin being a bubble; you have to dig into what Bitcoin is, how it operates, how it's created, how it's maintained, etc. You can't get this from bits and pieces you hear on CNBC or websites or friends.. Once you do dig, like me (because I was once very cautious on Btc), you will be very impressed at how the whole system works.. and you'll see the points of argument you had about it being bubble turn more into points that reflect 'inflated pricing'. Now; there is a fine area that you want to stay in where you aren't \"too deep into the tech & full blown Bitcoin fanatic\" and then \"my opinion and understanding of Btc is purely on bits and chunks of what I randomly hear or run across\".. but somewhere in between. Because if you are in either, you have some serious blind spots. Not saying everybody will, but most people that I know who have given some research into how Bitcoin works generally turn into or have an Optimistic stance on Bitcoin, blockchain, and everything between. And most of these people would agree \"Yes, Btc can get over-inflated\" but it's the real deal, it's reached critical mass, and at it's current state - it is not a bubble. Now; that is not to say that 5-10 years down the road; it could turn into one. But currently; bubble. No. But this thread isn't here to try to convince you into Bitcoin. It's for people already progressed into the movement... I could spend my time trying to convince a 9-5 is wasting precious life to someone, or I could find others already adopted into the Fastlane mentality and have life-changing, world-changing discussions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Person"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T17:45:51.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ae5c202f8c91e1f3292a419920b56742d1364ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9.9TXUU_siMkzkQB7HTasNbvXQgGdBSkH2Gz6dmCaqcgSKKtrusnjNNBwY4i3jjJ_l0Rf7g3ObZ.VSpIDmKNbumMqfTpa8j3a8bo8MlXjO9rSkx6e.ZQ0HkY1Fy35v9a2OTkis41F4RPxE_P5NjUuPfGeGF6Y2k7cnmp327p10tGI2uw.GGu93c-", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Bitcoin technical analysis: BTC/USD runs into problems within $7700 area, down 2.5%, price breaks supporting trend line", "title_full": "Bitcoin technical analysis: BTC/USD runs into problems within $7700 area, down 2.5%, price breaks supporting trend line", "published": "2018-06-04T16:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ae5c202f8c91e1f3292a419920b56742d1364ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9.9TXUU_siMkzkQB7HTasNbvXQgGdBSkH2Gz6dmCaqcgSKKtrusnjNNBwY4i3jjJ_l0Rf7g3ObZ.VSpIDmKNbumMqfTpa8j3a8bo8MlXjO9rSkx6e.ZQ0HkY1Fy35v9a2OTkis41F4RPxE_P5NjUuPfGeGF6Y2k7cnmp327p10tGI2uw.GGu93c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Forex Crunch", "published": "2018-06-04T16:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin technical analysis: BTC/USD runs into problems within $7700 area, down 2.5%, price breaks supporting trend line", "text": "Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

Of course, there are exceptions to this trend, such as when bitcoin losses translate to gains for some cryptos.

And that doesn’t make a lot of sense when you consider that every crypto is backed by an independent open-source technology, including the hordes of bitcoin clones.\nThe Ripple Effect\nBut Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, reckons that it's about time we begin to see the crypto market behaving rationally with various degrees of decoupling between individual cryptos and the top dog.\nGarlinghouse says the nascent industry is still largely driven by speculation mostly because there are so many cryptocurrencies that people don't understand very well. He claims most cryptos have no real utility, and a massive shakeout will see to it that 99 percent of cryptos won't be here a decade down the line.\nOf course, he capped it all by claiming that Ripple itself has real utility, and will survive the test of time.\nMaybe the CEO felt the need to talk up his brainchild after the pounding it received during the last crypto sell-off, which led to its XRP token cratering 82 percent from its January all-time high.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nBut what does Ripple do (or claim to do)?\nBlockchain technology can be used to lower costs of money transfers by reducing or eliminating the need for banks to manually settle transactions. Ripple is a blockchain-powered interbank money transfer platform, while XRP is its crypto token. You can think of it as the blockchain equivalent of SWIFT, the leading electronic platform when it comes to interbank money transfers.\nBut what purpose does Ripple serve that SWIFT does not?\nAccording to Garlinghouse, the current banking model whereby liquidity needs are managed via nostro and vostro accounts, which hold trillions of dollars, is highly inefficient. Using digital assets to fund liquidity is a better model, and Ripple is better-positioned to capitalize on it than other cryptos. For instance, the XRP token takes just 3.6 seconds to settle a transaction compared to four hours for bitcoin.\nRipple can help banks move money from point A to point B cheaply and in record time. Further, the XRP token can be used as a bridge currency and a lingua franca that helps banks avoid the hassle of tying up money in varying currencies at foreign accounts.\nSounds like a fairly compelling business case on paper, especially when you consider that banking networks around the world move around $76 billion a day. But do banks need it?\nUnfortunately, banks have been giving Ripple and XRP the cold shoulder. Although Ripple has signed up lots of banks on its network, only Stockholm-based Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB has actually used RippleNet in a money transfer, moving just shy of $1 billion in payments. Even Ripple investors Santander and Standard Chartered have only been testing the network and haven’t yet really taken the plunge.\nThat's not very encouraging considering that Ripple has been around for nearly seven years now. It appears that banks are balking at Ripple and XRP mainly due to regulatory hurdles. Further, the main movers of cross-border payments are large corporates, and it's going to be mighty tough to convince them to forego established banking networks in favor of a digital startup.\nIn this David-and-Goliath struggle, Garlinghouse’s confidence that Ripple and XRP won’t eventually join thousands of others in the crypto graveyard may be misplaced.\nOriginally published by Alex Kimani for Safehaven.com .\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/sec-shoots-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-bid/", "https://safehaven.com/article/45551/The-Crypto-Market-Is-Much-More-Than-Bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T16:43:34.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15fc9d063d482d18050a7f60258f6c2bb53a4fb2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVRp6pY4ggi3X", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Epazz-Inc-EPAZ-11753/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Epazz Inc.

The initial announcement came out in January when the Brisbane airport authorities announced plans to initiate the procedure of using cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange at all outlets within the airport premises.\nThe airport’s administration has quoted “the reduction of customer inconvenience due to the requirement of carrying multiple currencies and credit cards” as one of the major reasons behind this move. Amidst a period of Bitcoin’s downfall, this step is likely to push the cryptocurrency’s value up again. Last year, Bitcoin peaked out at more than $20,000 per coin, whereas as of now the value sits at roughly $7600.\nThe payment system has been developed by a Brisbane-based fintech startup, TravelbyBit. TravelbyBit reportedly received more than $85000 from a commercialization assistance fund, which helped them develop a system where customers can pay using Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency and merchants can choose which cryptocurrency or real currency they want to receive the money in.\nSpeaking to a local media outlet, the General Manager of Strategic Planning and Development of the airport said that this step has been taken keeping the number of crypto investors worldwide. Furthermore, he added that he’s proud of Brisbane airport for being the first global airport that has worked with a local startup to bring such a service to the table.\nTravelbyBit is also reported to be working on a “tourist map route” that lists all businesses that are currently accepting Bitcoin as a medium of exchange along the way to famous tourist spots in the country.\nCurrently, there are 30 outlets in Brisbane airport that are using the new system. Speaking to the media, the CEO of TravelbyBit commented that they will launch their service throughout the country gradually, wherein the only thing holding them back is the lack of trained staff of retailers.\nHe further added that their initiative can prove to be quite vital in establishing Bitcoin as a method of payment instead of “an asset”, which was a major reason behind Stripe withdrawing support for Bitcoin last year. × TechJuice for Browser : Get breaking news notifications on your browser.

While it does have a first mover advantage and is a great gateway to other coins, there are tons of other alternative coins that are just as promising. If you want to diversify your assets and possibly find hidden gems, then you should consider looking at other coins as well. Here are some of the cryptocurrencies you should get to know besides Bitcoin.\nEthereum Ethereum is the second coin in market capitalization in circulation and you cannot truly understand cryptos unless you understand it. While Bitcoin was made to be a store of value and for exchange purposes, Ether goes way beyond that. Ethereum is based on the principle of decentralized apps and provides programmers with a platform to build decentralized apps based on their own proprietary code. This allows programmers to build decentralized apps that are hosted on the Ethereum platform and are powered by Ether, which is the platform’s cryptocurrency.\nWhat separates Ether from Bitcoin is its strong use case. While Bitcoin’s value is based on trust and is still seeing minimal support, Ether’s value is based on utility. So, while Ether might be somewhat pumped by speculators, it will most likely always have a certain value based on demand for decentralized apps and programmers wanting to use the platform. However, it also means that it will be less likely to reach Bitcoin’s heights since it wouldn’t be in the interest of the platform. And we can assure that the founders, who still control a large portion of the coins, will do their best to prevent Ether from spinning out of control, to make the platform accessible for developers.\nRipple Often dubbed as the anti-crypto, Ripple, and its token the XRP, are a huge departure from other coins. For one, it is by far the most centralized coin out there. While this might be an issue for some, it’s actually a strength in Ripple’s case . This is because XRP was created as a token for the banking system and isn’t trying to disrupt it like other cryptos do. Its main goal is to facilitate cross-border transfers and it has become an alternative to the Swift system. Since it’s heavily centralized, Ripple’s owners can have greater control over the currency to make it less volatile, which is a major plus considering who it is geared towards.\nLitecoin Another coin any crypto investor should know is Litecoin. Litecoin originated as a fork to the original Bitcoin blockchain and was created to be lighter cryptocurrency. One of the major issues with Bitcoin is its sluggish transaction times and Litecoin aimed at creating a much faster alternative that could handle more transactions in a shorter period of time.\nBecause of its many advantages over Bitcoin, many crypto investors have opted for the Litecoin to make coin-to-coin exchanges. Litecoin is also very easy to buy and can be found on pretty much every crypto exchange out here, no matter the country. For Australians citizens, sites like Crypto Head can help you find out where and how to buy Litecoin.\nConclusion These three coins form the three major pillars when it comes to altcoins. They all have strong use cases and fill a very specific need in their sectors.

"2018-06-04T15:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bigger Bubble: Bitcoin Or The Stock Market?", "text": "21 hours ago (04, Jun 2018 5:42:29 AM) By Avi Gilburt, ElliottWaveTrader.net Bubbles in Nasdaq, bubbles in financial assets, bubbles in cryptos . . . bubbles are being reported everywhere. Moreover, more and more analysts are pointing to some financial crisis after another as each day goes by. Whether it is because of the cessation of QE, or because of the issues in Italy, or trade wars, etc., we are clearly not lacking for any reasons as to why this market should crash. The problem is that most bubble-callers have no objective perspective through which they can determine that any market is in a bubble. As an example, one article I recently read suggests we are in a bubble in the Nasdaq because we have exceeded the 2000 bubble high in the market. Well, along those lines, maybe the Dow should not have exceeded the “bubble high” it struck in 1929!? Now, I want to highlight the ultimate intellectual dishonesty and inconsistency in most of their thinking regarding bubbles. You see, many of these same analysts are looking for a massive rally in gold. Yet, one has to wonder why they can logically see gold rally well past its “bubble high” struck in 2011, but they are unable to accept any other market rallying beyond their “bubble highs” struck in recent history? I think one has to start viewing much of the analysis being published today as more emotionally-based rather than analytically-based. For those that have followed my analysis through the years, you know that I use Elliott Wave analysis to provide me with an objective context through which I am able to analyze markets. This methodology allowed me to identify the high in gold in 2011 within $6 of the high struck, as well as buy back into the market right at the lows almost 2 years ago. This same methodology allowed us to catch the lows in the US Dollar in 2011, and called for a multi-year rally in the DXY to the 103.50 region when most everyone else at the time was looking for a dollar crash, especially when you consider all of the QE thrown at the market (another fundamental analysis failure). And, this methodology has kept us on the correct side of the equity market, as we have been looking to exceed 2600SPX for years, when most others were quite certain this bull market was going to end years ago. You see, Elliott Wave analysis provides the context for viewing markets objectively, and in a non-linear fashion. So, just because one views a market as having struck a “bubble high” years ago does not mean that the market will not well exceed those highs in the future. And, the perfect example we are seeing set up like that is in the crypto-world as well. While many have told me that the fundamentals suggest that crypto’s should be closer to zero than they are today, the structure of the market suggests that we could be setting up for a major rally in 2018. And, anyone who really wants to understand the crypto market’s should be following Ryan Wilday , as he is the most accurate crypto-analyst I have seen. In fact, he nailed the bottom we struck in ETH last week, and is now providing guidelines to determine when that bottom is confirmed. Weekly Opportunities In Cryptocurrency: Bottom Held – Can We Go? So, based upon Ryan’s analysis, it does not look like it is highly likely that the crypto-bubble-callers will be correct in their assessments. And, I don’t think the bubble-callers for the stock market will fare any better. You see, the action we have seen over the last several months have been corrective, and support our expectation that the S&P500 is still pointing to 3000. Last weekend, I noted that once we break below 2700SPX, it will have us looking down to the 2600-2650SPX region. While I had initially thought we could see one more micro rally towards my ideal target at 2758SPX, the market only reached a high of 2742SPX, so we came up about 16 points short of my ideal target. It certainly reminds me that there is no way one can be 100% accurate when dealing with our non-linear markets. But, the break down below 2700SPX still came up short of our target below as well. This now places the market in a position wherein it will likely tell us in the coming week whether the drop below 2700 has completed all the pullback we are going to see before we rally to 3000, or if we are still setting up to drop to the 2600-2650SPX region. As long as we remain below the 2742/53SPX resistance, the market still retains the potential to drop down to those lower targets. However, if we rally through 2753SPX, then it certainly increases the probabilities we have begun our trek to 3000SPX in 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://seekingalpha.com/author/ryan-wilday/articles#regular_articles", "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4178947-weekly-opportunities-cryptocurrency-bottom-held-can-go", "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FElliottWaveTrader.net%2F&h=ATM40R4_eXM9kwwgn43uV1wB1I76TnBZSpr1JrszFOuDDts0yJj4VN-3K3GlJ5vUerq949aMHrd640CGwUg4LT3Ld0vV87UFcPqR2PBi_lQeJmgn61lBSs1Sily5KOlK3eQLHtC9Fps"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avi gilburt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T17:58:49.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee754434896176ae55a7d3aab4c4108b0cf98556", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1aSp_nrW_RIkfEbqhnXMHSrBBrymHfv5sg75g_N25zQoB7JAZGlXb._sb9pl9eUOp4-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "http://stocks.investingdaily.com/investingdaily/action/rssfeed?ChannelID=6517", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "MarketWatch", "title": "Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note", "title_full": "Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note", "published": "2018-06-04T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee754434896176ae55a7d3aab4c4108b0cf98556", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHKpH5KQfzS1aSp_nrW_RIkfEbqhnXMHSrBBrymHfv5sg75g_N25zQoB7JAZGlXb._sb9pl9eUOp4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T15:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note", "text": "June 04, 2018 at 08:35 AM EDT Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note Digital currencies are struggling to hold on to gains made over the weekend, as all major cryptocurrencies are in the red Monday.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T17:16:16.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce585a6628e619c36a68b3b0381de721457aa20d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF_yWpWy60ceBg4zaqfYb0AbsASQ1dHoMyTjMwRwwukAh7.XfrMoMF7PLlxIY2etwkpcoxqmuMakWPeqDO99iaeNoLsIo.UxPx7xItR3fCSgCiatmYrobdkuKghioenX.SsGqFT6362q4", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://www.globaladvisors.biz/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Strategy Consulting | Management Consulting | Global Advisors", "title": "CryptoWatch: Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note", "title_full": "CryptoWatch: Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note", "published": "2018-06-04T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/marketwatch/topstories?d=yIl2AUoC8zA", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce585a6628e619c36a68b3b0381de721457aa20d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF_yWpWy60ceBg4zaqfYb0AbsASQ1dHoMyTjMwRwwukAh7.XfrMoMF7PLlxIY2etwkpcoxqmuMakWPeqDO99iaeNoLsIo.UxPx7xItR3fCSgCiatmYrobdkuKghioenX.SsGqFT6362q4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MarketWatch", "published": "2018-06-04T15:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "CryptoWatch: Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note", "text": "By MarketWatch Digital currencies are struggling to hold on to gains made over the weekend, as all major cryptocurrencies are in the red Monday.

It is also used to process customer payments, and some businesses even use it to simplify their payroll. Bitcoin is also traded on various global markets, which is ultimately how its worth is established.\nBitcoin exists only in the digital world, which means there is no actual physical form of currency. Instead, the cryptocurrency is reserved in a digital wallet that utilizes a blockchain ledger that enables Bitcoin users to keep track of their Bitcoin amounts as well as both send and receive payments from other Bitcoin users, also known as peer-to-peer transactions. The point being, to enable people to avoid financial institutions and instead become kind of their own bank.\nWith Bitcoin, you have full authority over your funds through the use of the digital wallet, which sort of serves as your bank account or safety deposit box. However, these funds can only be accessed via a hash address, which is generated from the public key.\nYour digital wallet can be stored in various locations, such as on a third party online platform, hardware, a computer, or a mobile device, and more.\nIs there Anything About Bitcoin that is Illegal?\nThe use of Bitcoin as a form of digital currency is legal in the United States, and payments require the same reporting and taxes as physical currency. Furthermore, just like traditional currencies as well as other payments by financial institutions, anti-money laundering regulations also apply.\nHow Does it Work?\nBitcoins act as sort of virtual gold coins that are designed to have value in and of themselves. In other words, just as having actual gold coins in your possession, Bitcoins have worth and can be traded.\nOnce you own Bitcoins, they can be transferred from one Bitcoin user to another via the digital wallet. This is essentially a small database that contains useful information, such as the private security key that allows transactions, which can be stored in the cloud, known as hot storage, or on a computer drive, known as cold storage. You can store your Bitcoins away in aspiration that their worth will increase over time, or use them to purchase services and goods from retailers.\nAll Bitcoin transactions are logged and made available in a public ledger, which helps keep the use of Bitcoins honest. In other words, it helps prevent illegal Bitcoin activities, such as fraud, copied Bitcoins, and duplicated transactions. However, personal details, such as the name of the person who owns the wallet, are not recorded in the public ledger. This way, each transaction is confirmed, but the person's personal information is kept anonymous.\nHow Much Does It Cost?\nBecause there are no financial institutions involved with Bitcoin transactions, it gets rid of continuous bank charges as well as costly wire and bank transfers. However, there are usually small charges to use specific Bitcoin services, including online services that change your Bitcoins into paper money, services that aid the group of miners, and any pools of miners you become a member of.\nMiners are a group of ledger keepers who use their own personal computers to monitor Bitcoin transactions, and they are compensated for their accounting work by earning new Bitcoins for their service to the network. Should a miner choose to join a mining pool, the pool will usually request a small donation, or they may charge a one percent support fee.\nAdditionally, some nodes will charge a small one-time transaction fee each time you transfer money using their servers, and online exchanges typically charge a fee when you exchange your Bitcoins for euros or dollars.\nCan a Small Business get Scammed or Hacked from Bitcoin Transactions? Is it Safe?\nAlthough the use of Bitcoins is considered fairly safe, they are not regulated by the government. This means there is no centralized issuing authority or individual who created the Bitcoin to trace back to, which carries its share of risks.\nFurthermore, there is no personal information required to open a Bitcoin account or to make a payment from an account the way there is with a bank account, so other than the group of miners; there is no oversight designated to ensure the information on the ledger is true and correct.\nAlso, when storing any information online, it always carries the risk of being stolen by hackers. However, storing your Bitcoins using the offline method, also known as cold storage, is more hacker-resistant. You should also be sure to back up your wallet with a copy whenever possible in the event that your computer is lost or stolen. In fact, each time you make a Bitcoin transaction, the .dat file is updated, so be sure to save this file as a backup each time it is updated.\nLastly, unregulated online exchanges also run the risk of human dishonesty or inadequacy, which can lead to financial losses. However, unlike conventional banking whose losses are partially insured, there is no insurance coverage for Bitcoin losses.\nHow does a Small Business Get Started Taking Bitcoin?\nGetting started taking Bitcoin is simple and can be done in the following three steps:\nCreate a Bitcoin Address\nFirst, create a Bitcoin wallet using your chosen service. The wallet functions similarly to an email account and will be the address where customers will transfer their funds. To complete a transaction, customers key in your wallet address, or scan your code using their smartphone, enter the amount to be transferred, and then select send.\nOr, you can opt for a bitcoin payment processor, such as BitPay, which will enable you to handle many transactions during a business day. Payment processors also include various applications, which provides added functions, such as add a shopping cart plug into your online shop or set up a POS. They also allow you to convert your money into fiat quickly. There is a percentage or monthly fee to use the service; however, it is typically less than what other companies charge.\nInform Customers that You Accept Bitcoin\nTo let your customers know that you accept Bitcoin, simply include a Bitcoin acceptance button on your online site near the Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal buttons you already have.\nIf you have a brick-and-mortar establishment, apply Bitcoin acceptance stickers on the door as well as the cash register to inform customers.\nConsult Your Accountant\nBecause Bitcoin is subject to the same tax obligations as traditional currencies, you may want to alert your accountant that you intend to accept Bitcoin payments, so they are prepared to handle Bitcoin tax-related issues. They can also determine how to keep your data.\nAbout the Author\nCraig Corbel is the Vice President of Marketing at Solution Web Designs, a leading SEO, online marketing agency, and Long Island Website Designers serving small and mid-sized companies nationwide.

Moreover, more and more analysts are pointing to some financial crisis after another as each day goes by. Whether it is because of the cessation of QE, or because of the issues in Italy, or trade wars, etc., we are clearly not lacking for any reasons as to why this market should crash. The problem is that most bubble-callers have no objective perspective through which they can determine that any market is in a bubble. As an example, one article I recently read suggests we are in a bubble in the Nasdaq because we have exceeded the 2000 bubble high in the market. Well, along those lines, maybe the Dow should not have exceeded the bubble high it struck in 1929!? Now, I want to highlight the ultimate intellectual dishonesty and inconsistency in most of their thinking regarding bubbles. You see, many of these same analysts are looking for a massive rally in gold. Yet, one has to wonder why they can logically see gold rally well past its bubble high struck in 2011, but they are unable to accept any other market rallying beyond their bubble highs struck in recent history? I think one has to start viewing much of the analysis being published today as more emotionally-based rather than analytically-based. For those that have followed my analysis through the years, you know that I use Elliott Wave analysis to provide me with an objective context through which I am able to analyze markets. This methodology allowed me to identify the high in gold in 2011 within $6 of the high struck, as well as buy back into the market right at the lows almost 2 years ago. This same methodology allowed us to catch the lows in the US Dollar in 2011, and called for a multi-year rally in the DXY to the 103.50 region when most everyone else at the time was looking for a dollar crash, especially when you consider all of the QE thrown at the market (another fundamental analysis failure). And, this methodology has kept us on the correct side of the equity market, as we have been looking to exceed 2600SPX for years, when most others were quite certain this bull market was going to end years ago. You see, Elliott Wave analysis provides the context for viewing markets objectively, and in a non-linear fashion. So, just because one views a market as having struck a bubble high years ago does not mean that the market will not well exceed those highs in the future. And, the perfect example we are seeing set up like that is in the crypto-world as well. While many have told me that the fundamentals suggest that cryptos should be closer to zero than they are today, the structure of the market suggests that we could be setting up for a major rally in 2018. And, anyone who really wants to understand the crypto markets should be following Ryan Wilday , as he is the most accurate crypto-analyst I have seen. In fact, he nailed the bottom we struck in ETH last week, and is now providing guidelines to determine when that bottom is confirmed. Weekly Opportunities In Cryptocurrency: Bottom Held - Can We Go? So, based upon Ryan's analysis, it does not look like it is highly likely that the crypto-bubble-callers will be correct in their assessments. And, I dont think the bubble-callers for the stock market will fare any better. You see, the action we have seen over the last several months have been corrective, and support our expectation that the S&P500 is still pointing to 3000. Last weekend, I noted that once we break below 2700SPX, it will have us looking down to the 2600-2650SPX region. While I had initially thought we could see one more micro rally towards my ideal target at 2758SPX, the market only reached a high of 2742SPX, so we came up about 16 points short of my ideal target. It certainly reminds me that there is no way one can be 100% accurate when dealing with our non-linear markets. But, the break down below 2700SPX still came up short of our target below as well. This now places the market in a position wherein it will likely tell us in the coming week whether the drop below 2700 has completed all the pullback we are going to see before we rally to 3000, or if we are still setting up to drop to the 2600-2650SPX region. As long as we remain below the 2742/53SPX resistance, the market still retains the potential to drop down to those lower targets. However, if we rally through 2753SPX, then it certainly increases the probabilities we have begun our trek to 3000SPX in 2018. See charts illustrating the wave counts on the S&P 500.

An early morning dip to an intraday low $1,072.2 was the only bearish move of the day, with Bitcoin Cash managing to hold above the day’s first major support level at $1,015.9 to rally to an intraday high $1,194 through the middle part of the day.\nBitcoin Cash’s break out from the 23.6% FIB Retracement level of $1,100 by mid-morning supported a break though the day’s first major resistance level at $1,128.5 and second major resistance level at $1,172 to the day’s high before easing back to the day’s ending $1,169.8. The break out from the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,100 and hold above the day’s first major resistance level at $1,128.5 supported the formation of a near-term bullish trend from 28th May’s swing lo $868.0.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 3.8% to $1,125.5, a start of the day high and new swing hi $1,214.8 falling short of the day’s first major resistance level at $1,218.47, with investors locking in profits following the new swing hi, leading Bitcoin Cash down to a morning low $1,111.8, calling on support at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,117, while steering clear of the day’s first major support level at $1,096.67. For the day ahead, a move through $1,145 would support a run through to $1,200 levels to bring the day’s first major resistance level at $1,218.47 back into play, though Bitcoin Cash will likely face plenty of resistance at $1,200, broader market sentiment to dictate whether Bitcoin Cash can breakout from $1,200 to bring key resistance levels into play later in the day.\nFailure to move back through $1,145 to take a run at $1,200 levels will likely see Bitcoin Cash test sub-$1,100 support levels, any material deterioration in market sentiment likely to see Bitcoin Cash resume the bearish trend, the current near-term bullish trend under pressure through the early part of the day. Get Into Bitcoin Cash Trading Today Litecoin gained 1.31% on Sunday, following on from Saturday’s 3.14% rise, to end the week up 6.31% to $125.27.\nAn early pull back from $123.97 to an intraday low $122.56 avoided the day’s first major support level at $119.96, with a broad based market rally driving Litecoin to an intraday high $127.95 in the early part of the afternoon, before easing back late in the day to $125 levels. The mid-morning extended rally saw Litecoin break through the day’s first major resistance level at $125.9 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $127 before easing back, with Litecoin unable to break clear of $127 levels to take a run at $130 levels.

This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 66.8273. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a buy 1 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 38.50. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 44 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -63. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a buy 2 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 15 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed down -118.191 at 7,431.672.

If the upward movement of bitcoin fades and the dominant cryptocurrency is unable to bounce back quickly to the higher end of $7,700, a bleed out to the $6,000 region can be expected. Conditional Rally The corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,700 sparked significant optimism, especially amongst short-term bulls that have predicted the price of bitcoin would rebound back to the $10,000 region within June. While the $10,000 June target is still in play, another correction in the upcoming days will likely occur, given that the corrective rally from $7,040 has stopped at $7,700 and BTC has declined to $7,600. A short-term break out to the $8,000 region supported by the corrective rally from $7,040 was conditional, as it required the volume of BTC to spike and the cryptocurrency to sustain momentum at its weekly peak, in the $7,700 region. However, due to its low trading volume, BTC has failed to test a major short-term support level at $8,000 and fell to $7,600. A drop to $7,500 could result in BTC experiencing yet another minor correction, potentially to the higher end of $6,000. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of BTC is 43.3, it is not demonstrating an oversold condition for BTC. A further drop in BTC would not lead the RSI to drop by large margins and thus, a short-term turn around back to the $7,700 mark if BTC falls to $7,500 is unlikely. The daily candle on June 4 was supposed to be the big short-term break for BTC, rising above the one-month descending trendline from May 6 and effectively establishing a bottom at $7,040. But, the recent decline in the price of BTC will likely send BTC back to the lower end of $7,000 or in worst case scenario, to the $6,000 region. Short-Term Not Important Despite the negative price trend of BTC, most multi-billion dollar hedge funds are still extremely optimistic in BTC and the entire cryptocurrency market. The expected decline in the price of BTC is a 5 to 10 percent drop maximum, which could extend to 15 percent at its worst. But, as Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead stated, which oversees more than a billion dollars in cryptocurrencies and digital assets, hedge funds look at the 5 to 10-year trend of the market. In the mid to long-term, Morehead stated that bitcoin is still a screaming buy, adding: “As digital tokens continue to multiply and gain wider use, the $400 billion crypto market could balloon to $4 trillion, and even $40 trillion is definitely possible. It’s the 10-year forecast.” If BTC recovers gradually from the $6,000 to $7,000 region and establish major support levels with strong and volume in the upcoming months, the $20,000 to $50,000 BTC targets of large-scale investors can still be in play. Often, tokens enjoy a surge in volume and price when the price of BTC is increasing gradually and volume of the cryptocurrency market picks up. If BTC enters the $7,500 region, it is likely that tokens will experience a substantial drop in value, once again. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Over 30 local businesses including accommodation providers, tour operators, restaurants and even the local pub in Agnes Water are now accepting cryptocurrencies, despite being a town of a mere 2,000 permanent residents. ‘Welcome to Agnes Water-1770, Australia’s First Digital Currency Town’ reads a billboard in welcoming visitors driving in, with support for cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, NEM, litecoin and ethereum. Source: Facebook/NEM The beach town’s initiative to embrace cryptocurrency payments stems from local real estate agent Gordon Christian who began looking into accepting cryptocurrencies after a client, a local business owner, explored how to go about processing a bitcoin payment from a customer. Soon enough, Christian’s interest was piqued further when he learned that Brisbane International Airport, a five-hour drive from Agnes Water, had begun accepting cryptocurrencies at a number of retail storefronts. Selling the idea to local businesses wasn’t hard, he revealed. “We started from the ground up, shared it with a couple of businesses and they were straight on board … I guess they were international travellers themselves and had heard of these types of payments,” he told ABC News . “Initially we had a good 10 businesses that just said, ‘Fine — let’s go for it’.” Local tourism operator Arty Cipak added : “If it’s going to take cryptocurrency to get tourists to town, then bring it on.” Presently, 31 local businesses including resorts, backpacking establishments, tour companies and eateries are now accepting cryptocurrency payments through a point-of-sale app developed by TravelbyBit, a Queensland-based crypto payments startup. “We’ve got merchants all over Australia but they’re very sporadic,” TravelbyBit CEO Caleb Yeoh said. “[Agnes Water and] the Town of 1770 has the highest concentration.” While it’s early days, Australia’s first ‘digital currency town’ could soon lure a nice group of international tourists to Agnes Water rather than mainstream destinations, according to the crypto executive. “The town has made a very strategic move in trying to appeal to a niche market to take perhaps some of those tourists … to come out to their little part of the woods,” he said. Yeoh added: “If you travel around the world you have to deal with multiple currencies, the exchange rate can be confusing, sometimes you struggle to find ATMs, and sometimes you get swindled by money changers. Travelling with one global currency like Bitcoin … makes sense.”” Agnes Water beach image from Shutterstock.

CryptoChips, which will initially support bitcoin, will allow players to receive cryptocurrency as “secret pocket money” based on players’ rankings within the game or when they acquire items or achieve missions. The players must have their own cryptocurrency wallets to receive the cryptocurrency. First Offering Available In August CryptoChips’ first initiative will be in August in “Whimsical War,” a real-time territorial battle game. CryptoChips will distribute bitcoin in accordance with player rankings. In Whimsical War, the placement of characters on the battlefield is key to winning the game. Players can form tag teams and engage in tag team battles. CryptoChips, which will be offered through a GMO group company, will be mounted on the group’s other game applications and will eventually include competitors’ game titles. Meanwhile, on June 6, the group will launch GMO miner B2, a mining machine equipped with mining chips using a 7 nm process technology. A Cryptocurrency Pioneer GMO Internet Group began offering cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency FX in May 2017. The company reported launching its cryptocurrency mining venture in Northern Europe in December, noting that it was utilizing renewable energy that is plentiful in that region. The facility has a production target of 500 petahashes per second. In February, GMO Group announced a two-year rental contract for its cloud mining venture for $5 million to cover power costs, maintenance, land, and security. The operation will support bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The company said it will accept up to eight contracts per month, and that it is considering a less costly alternative mining service. Earlier last year, GMO Click, the world’s largest forex broker, announced plans to integrate its trading services with its bitcoin wallet – GMO Wallet Co. Ltd. In 2014, GMO Internet announced it would allow its 48,532 Japanese merchants to accept bitcoin . The group’s partners began receiving part of their salaries in bitcoin this past February.

Ripple also at that time gave a good look.\nToday, we'll take a look at the recent rallies in Ethereum and Bitcoin as they are starting to show signs of ending and leading to another down-move in the not-too-distant future.\nSee how positioning changes in cryptocurrencies and other markets can help as a tool to determine price direction on the IG Client Sentiment page.\nEthereum rally brings familiar resistance into play\nEthereum spilled hard from the aforementioned head-and-shoulders pattern, but has since put in a sizable recovery.

This has BTC/USD positioned to make a move lower, but traders will want to see it roll down out of the pattern first, as there is still a chance it pops to the top-side.\nPotentially stopping downside momentum is a trend-line dating back to February, which may be apart of a maturing wedge in place since then. The pattern may want to further itself along towards the apex of the pattern, which, broadly speaking, would be a welcomed event as the pattern could down the line lead to a very strong move.\nFor now, leaning bearish and will continue to monitor.

The cryptocurrency market cap has garnered over $25 billion over the last week alone, and with roughly $300 to go, many investors are wondering whether the $8,000 mark can be reached soon. One source claims bitcoin is currently facing resistance where it sits, and that the price consolidation it’s undergone over the last few days may be a “good sign” for the long-term bulls granted the price is able to keep moving forward. It also suggests, however, that if present resistance proves too difficult to handle, or if bitcoin is unable to hold its current trendline, it may find itself spiraling all the way back down to an even $7,000. Another source agrees . It says that a price reversal is at hand, and that recovery is likely imminent if bitcoin can keep its current momentum going. While the present sell-off isn’t over just yet, buyers are likely looking to get back into the game, and the currency may continue to spike now that it’s moved beyond the $7,600 point. In the meantime, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has emerged to state that altcoins are likely to carve out their own paths in the coming months, and will no longer require bitcoin price uptrends to do well themselves. He suggests that altcoin technology has grown sufficiently over the previous year, and that bitcoin’s crypto-cousins can virtually take care of themselves, and will no longer require the support of leading or major cryptocurrencies to assist their relative ascensions. “Investor rationale,” he explains, will also have a lot to do with this. While the altcoin market is still in its infancy, he suggests that many investors are beginning to see specific altcoins as superior to bitcoin, or just as strong in some way, and they’ll garner the attention they deserve by attracting further institutional capital. He suggests this isn’t likely to occur with every altcoin, but he has a few specific ones in mind. We can’t help but wonder if he’s specifically referring to XRP… Founder of Pantera Capital believes bitcoin is still bound for big things, though he suggests further resistance may be encountered before a strong correction can ultimately occur, which he believes can be within the next few months. With so many clashing and differentiating opinions, it’s unclear what, exactly, bitcoin has in store for investors this summer. As we enter the month of June, we are getting closer to the mark in time where analysts like Tom Lee of Fundstrat fame first explained that bitcoin would begin its hike to the $25,000 mark. In addition, we are only 1.5 years shy of when he mentioned bitcoin would hit $91,000. These are obviously huge predictions, and it is difficult to understand how or why bitcoin could undergo a near $20,000 spike in just the next few months alone. Right now, one supposes it’s probably best to take things a step at a time. Considering bitcoin’s current trading mark, it might be best to wait for the jump to $8,000 and then take things from there. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T12:47:16.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19e82630eb7c9119526233fc319cb15449ea8ab0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkmXhZO_05BfXCl1ekjUholZFMzxxbaTBRt24BSsBjU7ctmt.wa9WyJSDRcpR9sxhzJIZOUpsUapOELF3lMnukH7pDEV_lbRrexia63hw6HlLL00G5XkRD99x.0jQ8RfOGuX8b4_2EUA0tGOvtCHq_", "site_full": "freeq.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://freeq.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BTC City â€“ Slovenia’s Largest Shopping Center to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’ – FREEQ Crypto News", "title": "BTC City â€“ Slovenia’s Largest Shopping Center to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’", "title_full": "BTC City â€“ Slovenia’s Largest Shopping Center to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’", "published": "2018-06-04T14:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19e82630eb7c9119526233fc319cb15449ea8ab0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkmXhZO_05BfXCl1ekjUholZFMzxxbaTBRt24BSsBjU7ctmt.wa9WyJSDRcpR9sxhzJIZOUpsUapOELF3lMnukH7pDEV_lbRrexia63hw6HlLL00G5XkRD99x.0jQ8RfOGuX8b4_2EUA0tGOvtCHq_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FR33Q", "published": "2018-06-04T14:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "BTC City â€“ Slovenia’s Largest Shopping Center to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’", "text": "\nBTC City – Slovenia’s Largest Shopping Center to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’ Bitcoin News (press release) Full coverage from FR33Q’s broadcasted articles on Inoreader http://j.mp/2Hgdx04\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc city", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "btc city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slovenia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T14:43:38.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9fdc555a818e5b949c043df364d126da3bbc726", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fChyUKx9frL1zRd7o7_9jyFSqFDCV0aptpmQ7VXBCK7tBKjGmORRS.xqijOwCpdPgB9VP15zJRccKaUkTBrNtTlBJKBcy1IKZiUpwgk8dGgK47t7H4veQzYA--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "BTC City – Slovenia’s Largest Shopping Center to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’", "title_full": "BTC City – Slovenia’s Largest Shopping Center to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’", "published": "2018-06-04T14:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1528099726_80386613.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9fdc555a818e5b949c043df364d126da3bbc726", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fChyUKx9frL1zRd7o7_9jyFSqFDCV0aptpmQ7VXBCK7tBKjGmORRS.xqijOwCpdPgB9VP15zJRccKaUkTBrNtTlBJKBcy1IKZiUpwgk8dGgK47t7H4veQzYA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T14:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "BTC City – Slovenia’s Largest Shopping Center to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’", "text": "1 hour ago International Bitcoin.com 53 Slovenia’s largest shopping destination is implementing strategies to become a “genuine Bitcoin City.” Coincidentally named BTC City already, the complex stretches 475,000 square meters and is filled with 500 retail stores. It was recently visited by the country’s prime minister who got acquainted with its bitcoin strategy. During his visit, the state secretary bought him a cup of coffee using cryptocurrency.

The Prime Minister of Slovenia, Miro Cerar, recently visited BTC City, a sprawling, 475,000 meter-squared commercial business and shopping complex in the capital city of Ljubljana. Fintech startup Eligma has created a point-of-sale system which is being used in a number of retailers in BTC City, in an effort to convert it into a “Bitcoin City.” Describing the commercial complex as “a business and shopping ecosystem based on the latest technological solutions including blockchain, AI, and cryptocurrencies,” Eligma elaborated: The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, as well as to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become Bitcoin City. During the morning meeting, Cerar received “a cup of ‘crypto coffee’ bought for him by Slovenian State Secretary Tadej Slapnik through the Elipay cryptocurrency transaction system,” the startup described. Slovenian Prime Minister Dr. Miro Cerar using Elipay. Photo credit: Eligma. The first successful use of the Elipay wallet at the city was to pay, using bitcoin, at the complex’s waterpark in April. Eligma added that the app would also be able to use bitcoin cash and Elipay’s own loyalty rewards token in the near future. BTC City to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’ Founded in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics enterprise, BTC company added many warehouses in the northeast of Ljubljana over time. In 1990, the complex was repurposed as a commercial shopping area and adopted the name BTC City. Ever since it has added large commercial ventures including a hotel, a sports complex, a casino, a multiplex cinema, a water park, and the tallest building in Slovenia, the crystal palace office park. With over 500 retail shops, BTC City’s website describes itself as “famous for being the largest and most popular European business, shopping, recreational/leisure and cultural center” in the country. A panoramic image of BTC City from the north. With the latest initiative is to convert BTC City into “a genuine Bitcoin City,” the company claims that the new entity is: The first of its kind in the world to provide its visitors, consumers and business partners with an ecosystem that will develop and integrate advanced technologies based on state-of-the-art approaches (blockchain, AI, VR [Virtual reality], AR [Augmented reality], ML [Machine Learning] and the world of cryptocurrencies). BTC company believes that “Bitcoin City will create an open society which will enable users to pursue their missions as well as develop their business environments in line with their wishes, needs, and operating policies.” According to the plan posted on BTC City’s website, Eligma’s Elipay is already installed in a number of stores within the city such as Atlantis water park, Al Capone, Babadu, Bijoux modni dodatki, Big Bang, istyle, Vodno mesto San Martino, Sneakers, Minicity, and Kibuba. There are also some one-way cryptocurrency ATMs on the premises, as well as a Blockchain Think Tank and the “biggest crypto mining rig in Slovenia.” BTC company emphasized: The development of BTC City into a Bitcoin City is an important step towards the realisation of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with freedom and choice regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.

Is just that many countries do not adopt yet bitcoin as a currency. But there countries who accept bitcoin as payment in different establishments just like in Japan and Germany.

In a recent interview with CNBC , the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.\n\"I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,\" he explained, \"not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.\"\nWozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked.\nHe also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become \"the new Apple.\"\n\"Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it's a platform,\" he affirmed.\nWozniak now refers to bitcoin as \"pure\" and says it's the true equivalent of digital gold.\n\"Bitcoin is mathematically defined,\" he explained, \"there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there's a way it's distributed … and it's pure and there's no human running it, there's no company running it, and it's just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.\"\nThis is not the first time Wozniak has been vocally positive about bitcoin. At a Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, the Apple co-founder lauded the cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology as stronger and more financially sound than both gold and USD. He stated that traditional currencies are \"kind of phony,\" as they are widely vulnerable to inflation, and that the problem with gold is that there is no fixed supply.\n\"There is a certain amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,\" he continued. \"Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there's a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated, and nobody can change mathematics.\"\nWozniak also called for further regulation efforts , saying they were crucial to bitcoin's survival.\n\"Regulation is an essential element to the fintech transformation happening today,\" he exclaimed. \"Fairness, equality and truth is the foundation for good regulation and that will lay the groundwork for good development.\" The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of

backed blockchain technology for the first time\nInvestors are looking for fundamentals to support the price of Bitcoin. The Consensus 2018 event evidently failed to bring the kind of rally which many in the industry were expecting. Yes, it did bring some Lamborghini’s in town, but if you are speaking of super and exotic cars, then NYC most definitely is the wrong place because Monaco’s crypto event was far better (given that the event was during the Festival de Cannes and car enthusiasts brought their classic and super cars to test them on the formula one track ahead of the F1 racing week). Perhaps, next year, when the event takes place again, hopefully, speculators will not count on this event as a bullish factor.\nFollowing today’s surprise move by Donald Trump to impose steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the EU, traders are bracing themselves for increased market volatility. This could provide the much-anticipated tailwind in the crypto-markets, as Bitcoin could once again become an ideal hedge opportunity. - advertisement -\nDuring the month of May, central bankers and governments have further praised the adoption of the blockchain technology. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has talked more positively about the importance of the Central Bank Digital Currency, CBDC, a complete U-turn compared to his speech back in February.\nXi Jinping, the Chinese President, also decided that it is about time to concur with the leading governments on the serious potential of the blockchain technology. This was the first time we have had anything positive from the Chinese President about blockchain. For investors, this is a welcoming initiative (adopted by the President) because it could be only a matter of time before the People’s Bank of China echoes the same stance. However, this does not necessarily mean that the ban on cryptocurrencies is going to vanish, but the leash may start to loosen up.\nIn terms of jurisdiction, Malta remains an attractive place for exchanges to conduct their business and given that some major exchanges such as Binance and OKEx are already operating in Malta, the Mediterranean island has started to attract exchanges from less crypto-friendly jurisdiction. Friendly jurisdiction only means that exchanges have more support from government and banks. For instance, the biggest exchange in Poland decided that they are no longer happy in Poland and picked up Malta as their new destination. While in Tallinn, Estonia, at the Tokeneconomic conference, I was moderating a panel on this particular topic; choosing a favourite jurisdiction. I suggested Malta has become more popular because the process of setting such business there is much less burdensome and more time efficient.\nTechnical Perspective\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, if we look at the monthly chart of the Bitcoin price, it’s good news for the bulls that the previous month’s low is holding. Also, Bitcoin’s highest price ($9795) for the month of May is higher than the previous month (April’s high $9755). In other words, a small bull signal. However, the closing price of Bitcoin at the end of the month is lower than the opening price of the month. This illustrates that the bears are still holding on to their ground. If the lowest price for the month of June is higher than the month of May (May low at $7051), we could say that things are looking good and it should boost the moral amidst traders.\nMost importantly, March, April and May, are all advocating the bull case in terms of uptrend. This is because all three months (March, April and May) have respected the February’s low.
