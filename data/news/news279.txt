The new custodial program aims to offer a multi-level suite for digital asset security in partnership with the firm Kingdom Trust.\nAlso read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend Bitgo Offers a Secure Custodial Platform for Institutional Investors\nThe Palo Alto-based firm Bitgo is now offering institutional investors custodial services due to a partnership with Kingdom Trust. The news follows the recent announcements from the Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs launching a cryptocurrency product , and companies like Coinbase offering services to institutional clientele . The latest institutional grade suite offered by Bitgo and Kingdom Trust provides custody services like treasury controls, advanced security solutions, and 24-7 monitoring.\nMulti-level services for the new custodial products include self-managed custody, institutional custody with multi-sig wallet, and the Bitgo offline vault. The vault stores keys offline and when tethered to a multi-signature wallet it can be programmed to require co-signers.\n“ Secure your digital assets in an offline multi-signature vault in minutes — An offline vault generates and stores private wallet keys on a clean air-gapped computer,” Bitgo’s offline storage white paper explains .\nTo spend funds from an offline wallet securely, you can sign transactions with your private keys offline using Bitgo Offline Vault — This means your private keys are never online or linked to a computer connected to the internet. Bitgo Will Face Competition from Others Providing Services to the Crypto-Wealthy\nThe company’s website which details the new custodial services says the products are more robust due to the partnership with Kingdom Trust. The services will be backed by individuals with digital asset solutions expertise, while also meeting the regulatory compliance requirements around custody of digital assets. The news follows the company’s implementation of seven new cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ether, Ripple and Royal Mint Gold. Further, the Bitgo revealed its enterprise-grade Ethereum wallet has seen a lot of growth and on April 17 Bitgo added support for ERC-20 tokens.\nThe latest Bitgo custodial services offering digital asset security for institutional clientele will also compete against a product offered by a former Bitgo employee Jameson Lopp . The former Bitgo engineer will also provide institutional grade security for cryptocurrency millionaires. The firm Casa also aims to serve the crypto-wealthy was launched six months ago raising $2.1Mn USD from groups like Boost VC, and Compound. Bitgo’s CEO Mike Belshe stated back in January when the firm first acquired Kingdom Trust that he believes Bitgo’s new services marry technology with security.\n“Bitgo and Kingdom are building products for the future – marrying the new technology with the safety and controls all investors require,” Belshe explained at the time.\nWhat do you think about Bitgo offering custodial solutions for institutional clientele?

Companies are looking for ways to divest themselves of the traditional blockchain mining ecosystem. While once a perfect fit, mining is now running head first into scalability issues.\nBetween advancing hardware and intense power consumption, the average miner can no longer turn a profit. The recent proliferation of ASIC mining rigs is even damaging the core concept of blockchain technology – decentralization. If a single entity can produce enough mining power, they can control a majority of newly minted coins.\nAs such, proof of work (PoW) is becoming less attractive. In its stead, established projects and ICOs alike are looking to proof of stake (PoS) to offer a new solution. Rather than require arbitrary computations and shifting difficulties to meter the release of new currency, PoS relies on an investment in the project itself. Users that hold a portion of the currency can serve as validators – rather than a series of mining rigs. The Shift to Proof of Stake\nEthereum is easily the largest project to plan a switch to a PoS algorithm. Their dominance of the smart contract environment put them in a poor position at the beginning of 2018. Transaction speed slowed to a crawl and mining fees started to grow. A proof of stake algorithm would free resources to focus on transaction validation rather than coin creation. Further, it would remove ASIC mining rigs from the equation – and the associated centralization that goes along with it.\nMany of the newer proof of stake coins use MasterNode systems. In these environments, users must possess a certain minimum amount to be considered vested in the project. At this point, they have proven their stake in the success of the coin and are considered trusted parties to validate transactions. However, this also ensures that only those with MasterNodes can collect transaction fees – leaving smaller investors out.\nUpcoming exchange DECOIN avoids this all together. Instead, every user that holds a minimum amount of their DECOIN currency is entitled to a return on their investment – proportional to the stored value and without the need for establishing a MasterNode. As such, they are using proof of stake as a means of sharing the value produced by their exchange – and to validate transactions on their blockchain.\nDECOIN’s PoS setup helps to create a community within their exchange. Users benefit from holding the native currency, while DECOIN rewards their loyalty to the platform. We’ve seen examples of native exchange coins in the past, but few have been so specifically integrated to provide digital dividends. Non-Financial Benefits of Proof of Stake\nWhile the internal benefits of a PoS system are considerable, there is also an environmental impact to the alternative. PoW algorithms and the associated mining ecosystem consumes an incredible amount of electricity. This electricity is created through a variety of means, but almost all require some sort of finite resource. Untethering cryptocurrency from mining will go a long way towards easing public fears about the industry. Considering at least one northern New York city has banned mining altogether, the shift may need to happen sooner, rather than later.\nMore information on the ICO and the company itself, including whitepapers and vision, can be found on https://www.decoin.io\nThe content of this article was provided by the company referenced.

Information from major cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp and Kraken will be used to determine the CME CF reference rate. This could be a hint of things to come for the second most popular crypto in the world, including possible US futures.\nAlso read: Zimbabwe Bans All Cryptocurrency Activity, Businesses Have 2 Month Grace Period CME Strikes Deal for Ether-Dollar Reference Rate\n“CME Group’s experience and knowledge in bringing the Bitcoin Reference Rate and Real-Time Index to market,” Chicago Merc’s website pithily stated, “has enabled us to launch an Ether-Dollar Reference Rate and Real-Time Index […] and the CME CF Ether-Dollar rates will provide a standardized reference rate and spot price index to bring confidence to any trading strategy. Major cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp and Kraken provide the pricing data to bring our dependable rate to the market.”\nIn the final quarter of last year, to much fanfare and hype, CME, along with crosstown rival Cboe, created a first of its kind: crypto futures. The experiment in running bitcoin core (BTC) in more mainstream financial contexts has been decidedly mixed. Some analysts even believe futures were a significant drag on digital asset prices due to allowing speculators to short BTC.\nCME’s Tim McCourt explained , “The Ether Reference Rate and Real Time Index are designed to meet the evolving needs of this marketplace. Providing price transparency and a credible price reference source is a key development for users of Ethereum.” Aiming for Institutional Investors\nCME is among the most trusted derivatives market makers in the world, as is a well-known player. Crypto Facilities Ltd is a crypto trading platform. The two have teamed to offer the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate (Ether Reference Rate) and Ether Real Time Index. Crypto Facilities will rely upon Kraken and Bitstamp order books as principal references. It hopes to add something like a daily benchmark in US fiat, real-time. Rollout is expected by CME Group and Crypto Facilities’ respective websites May 14, but formal CME market data platform distribution won’t begin until June 4th of this year.\nLondon-based Crypto Facilities’ Timo Schlaefer noted, “Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency, experienced incredible adoption and growth in 2017, evolving into the leading blockchain for smart contracts. We are excited to be contributing to the strong community that has developed around the Ethereum network by providing a reliable reference rate and real-time Ether-Dollar price.”\nEarlier this week, Crypto Facilities detailed its other partnership with Chicago-based Akuna Capital and London-based market maker B2C2 in an effort to make ethereum futures contracts. The triumvirate hopes it can bring liquidity to ethereum futures. Aimed at institutional investors, such futures would allow long and short positions without dirtying hands (having to hold the actual coin). Akuna’s Toby Allen insisted his company is “looking forward to seeing this much-needed product fill a gap in the market. The addition of a futures product enables crypto traders to take both long and short positions in ETH and is another giant leap in the development of the crypto asset class.”\nIs having ether futures a good overall move for the crypto community?

Whether actual Bitcoin millionaires or hired marketeers, the drivers added to the cacophony and stoked hype for what the city’s calling Blockchain Week.\nThe price of the digital token also got a boost. Bitcoin jumped as much as 3.95 percent to $8,713 in early trading, rebounding from a more than three-week low reached earlier Monday.\nConsensus is expected to draw more 8,500, or twice as many people as last year, when one Bitcoin would have cost you about $2,500. Now the top digital token is worth almost four times as much, though that still pales in comparison to the $20,000 price tag it flirted with late last year. The conference could cause Bitcoin to rally, Thomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicted last week.\nStill two blocks away and the lambos can be seen/heard revving all through Midtown pic.twitter.com/DPuZPV8kkI\n— Lily Katz (@LilyKatz) May 14, 2018 Consensus, hosted by media and research company CoinDesk Inc., has already featured Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard and FedEx Corp.

Well over 4,000 are expected to attend, up from 2,700 attendees last year. So at a minimum, the conference is likely bringing in $8 million.\nMore than 20 other events, some with similarly high entrance fees, are also scheduled during the days around Consensus. The bitcoin conference that began with 400 attendees three years ago is now the centerpiece of a full-blown \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation.\nLast year's conferences helped drive the surge of attention on cryptocurrencies.\nAround Consensus 2017 last May, Bitcoin accelerated its gains above $2,000, and was bolstered by the first TokenSummit and Ethereal Summit.\nPrices then skyrocketed over the rest of the year, drawing Wall Street's interest and topping $10,000 for the first time after the \"Consensus Invest\" conference in November. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since topping $19,000 in December, but it remains more than 4 times above where it was last May.\nThis year's speaker lineup also reflects significant inroads made by the cryptocurrency industry into the mainstream. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey , whose mobile payments company Square launched bitcoin trading this year, is set to speak at Consensus on Wednesday. Other conference panelists range from government officials to start-up leaders.\nConsensus \"does have a reputation of, if you speak at that event you're on the map,\" said Michael Oved, co-founder of a token exchange called AirSwap, and organizer of a blockchain conference called Fluidity, which took place Thursday.\nHe said he purposely under-priced his conference – tickets ran from $150 to $250 – because he saw it as \"an opportunity for us to talk about the things we've been working on.\" About 700 people attended the Brooklyn event, Oved said. That would bring ticket sales to about $140,000.\nOther events charge at least several hundred dollars for admission, including:\nThe two-day Ethereal Summit run by ConsenSys sells tickets for $1,300 each; TokenSummit on May 17 is sold out of regular $649 tickets, and a \"very late ticket\" costs $979; The \"Women on the Block\" conference held on Mother's Day charges $299 for general admission, and $599 for VIP access to a reception and a lounge. Childcare for children ages 5 to 11 costs $80; General admission to the May 18 NYC Blockchain Tech & Invest Summit is $899, while investors and VIP tickets are $1,299, according to Eventbrite. The ADI Cryptocurrency Mining Summit charges $499 to $699. \"Clearly there's a lot of money to be made in the enterprise IT world, and blockchain seems to be the flavor of month,\" said Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra, which runs a mobile-based cryptocurrency storage app.\n\"This represents an opportunity for companies that are trying to jump on that bandwagon to take advantage of that confluence of factors at the same time,\" he said. \"Obviously there's a lot of money moving around in terms of sponsorships. We're getting requests every day to sponsor.\"\nHowever, not everyone in the cryptocurrency world is happy about the massive conference industry.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted on April 26 that he is boycotting Consensus this year partly because of the high ticket price.\n\"The conference costs $2-$3k to attend. I refuse to personally contribute to that level of rent seeking,\" Buterin said. He added that CoinDesk \"is recklessly complicit in enabling giveaway scams,\" and called their coverage of an ethereum split \"highly sensationalist.\"\nTweet In a statement, CoinDesk responded that it was \"disappointed to learn of Vitalik's tweet today regarding a CoinDesk reporting error, for which we apologize. One of our reporters included an unverified link in an article; we quickly identified the error and fixed it. We strive to maintain the highest level of unbiased, ethical journalism in order to provide the best possible coverage of the blockchain industry.\"\nAmber Baldet, former head of blockchain at J.P. Morgan , also criticized the increasingly costly cryptocurrency events.\n\"The irony of high-priced conferences is they're the ones least likely to be paying speakers within the community, who care the most & need the platform to share new work,\" she tweeted on April 28. \"Corporate expense accounts subsidize people who rarely say anything novel, 'celeb keynotes' extract high fees.\"\nShe is a speaker at two of the primary events of the week, Ethereal Summit and Consensus. \"I'm not getting paid for either,\" she said in another tweet, adding that their livestreams \"are a great way to democratize access.\"\n'So many conferences...it's crazy' With all the hype and partying that conferences bring, it's also unclear whether they ultimately help start-ups progress along a planned production schedule — especially when many can struggle under inexperienced management.\n\"There are so many conferences now,\" Oved said. \"It's crazy. In the Bay Area alone, there's a conference every week on blockchain. It's easy to get distracted by conferences.\"\nHowever, some are betting that the conferences will be the catalyst for bitcoin prices eventual recovery.\n\"The rally post-Consensus has been strong and more supportive of our view that bitcoin has already bottomed for the year,\" Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Research said in a May 7 note. \"Bitcoin has rallied 10 to 70 percent during each of these conferences.\"\nLee added: \"We think alt-coins could similarly rally given the sizable increase in attendance.\"\nClarification: The Fluidity conference took place on Thursday, May 10.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/02/jpmorgans-top-blockchain-executive-amber-baldet-to-leave-for-her-own-startup.html", "https://www.cnbc.com/jack-dorsey/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/11/bitcoin-could-soar-after-blockchain-week-new-york-crypto-analyst-says.html", "https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/989525778424451072"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "new york economic development corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T01:24:46.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9aede2dff13cf1fb4ba9c37d7ed7af4205c9c1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2LyKJFvGIawvvE_bmF9h86uM7CZpMm2Gz87WkWA.GrogAFf8iNnkuutU.jMsLdKG.F1KkcdO6exlvZsgIM0IIyFZMDFCVAfM-", "site_full": "btcnewshub.com", "site": "btcnewshub.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "LG Subsidiary Declares In-Home Platform Monachain - Bitcoin News Hub", "title_full": "LG Subsidiary Declares In-Home Platform Monachain - Bitcoin News Hub", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://btcnewshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lg-subsidiary-announces-in-house-platform-monachain.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c9aede2dff13cf1fb4ba9c37d7ed7af4205c9c1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2LyKJFvGIawvvE_bmF9h86uM7CZpMm2Gz87WkWA.GrogAFf8iNnkuutU.jMsLdKG.F1KkcdO6exlvZsgIM0IIyFZMDFCVAfM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "LG Subsidiary Declares In-Home Platform Monachain - Bitcoin News Hub", "text": "Editor 0 Comments ETHNews\nLG CNS, the knowledge expertise arm of LG, has developed an in-house blockchain platform geared toward digital verification, digital forex, and digital provide chain administration.\nIn its newest try and money in on blockchain expertise, LG CNS, the knowledge expertise arm of South Korean electronics company LG, has developed its personal blockchain-as-a-service product, meant for use for digital verification, monitoring and securely dealing with digital forex transactions, and digital provide chain administration.\nThis new, in-house blockchain service, dubbed “Monachain,” is an “an enterprise blockchain platform that may be utilized to a wide range of industries, together with finance, public, communications and manufacturing. [Its] capabilities are: digital certification, digital group forex, [and] digital provide chain administration,” Yonhap News reported on Might 13.\nMonachain makes use of Distributed Identification Expertise (DID) to permit prospects to make use of a PIN or fingerprint for verification. As well as, the brand new platform will permit prospects to create their very own digital forex wallets, which LG CNS hopes will simply authenticate buyer identities and make sure the safety of transactions.\nMonachain will present banks and native governments with a digital “ currency community option “ that may theoretically permit native governments to rapidly and safely distribute welfare funds and different kinds of authorities help to the meant recipients. The corporate hopes digital distributed chain administration can be very best for “shortening manufacturing time, sustaining correct stock, and minimizing transportation errors.”\nThis isn’t the primary time LG CNS has developed a blockchain system in South Korea.

Residential Strong Arm Robbery\nThey say that crime never pays. For five men in Georgia, that was certainly the case.\nAs reported by 11 Alive , the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office arrested five men in connection with a conspiracy to invade a Forsyth County home in the hopes of making off with upwards of $1 million in Bitcoin, the world’s most popular and expensive cryptocurrency .\nThe arrests come after a 4-month-long investigation, following the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office Narcotics Unit’s response to what was initially believed to be a drug investigation at a local hotel. On January 29, narcotics authorities intervened on four males in possession of zip ties, latex gloves, duct tape, and bandanas. The men were released, however, due to a lack of sufficient evidence.\nThe subsequent investigation revealed that the men were not planning a drug-related crime. Rather, they were after someone’s Bitcoin fortune. The four men – Trivette Adams, Matthew Schwartz, Jacob South and Michael McDermont – were allegedly planning to rob a homeowner of his digital currency.\nAdams and McDermont were apprehended near the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta before they were able to flee by airplane. The former tried to make a run for it but failed to outrun the deputies.\nSouth and Schwartz, meanwhile, were able to fly out of Atlanta. However, two Major Crimes Unit detectives in Chicago caught up to the criminals and extradited both with help from the Chicago Police Department.\nFinally, a fifth suspect, Justin Ellison of Illinois, was arrested on May 11 following an interview conducted by Illinois detectives in connection to the investigation. As noted by 11 Alive :\nTrivette Adams, 20, of Pflugerville, Tex., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and criminal trespass; Robert South, 21, of Norcross has been charged with residential strong arm robbery; Matthew Schwartz, 18, of Hesperia, Calif., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery; Michael McDermott, 18, has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and criminal trespass; Justin Ellison, 20, of Worth, Ill., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and conspiracy to commit a felony.\nThe foiled conspiracy should serve as a reminder to keep not only your private keys hidden, but also keep the contents of said wallets on a need-to-know basis.\nWhat measures have you taken to prevent the criminal theft of your cryptocurrency holdings ?

If anything, the State Bank has barred commercial banks and financial firms from dealing in cryptocurrency which, of course, makes life harder for local exchanges. Individual traders, however, are finding alternative ways to acquire or sell cryptocurrencies, defying the warnings and the prohibitions.\nAlso read: India’s Supreme Court Keeps Ban on Banks’ Crypto Services, For Now Central Bank Can’t Ban Cryptocurrency in Pakistan\nPakistan’s experience with cryptocurrencies offers another example of how ineffective financial authorities can be when trying to fill a legal vacuum with prohibitive administrative measures. Central banks often forget they are neither parliaments, nor governments, and their regulatory overreach cannot legitimately substitute the normal legal process. The recent decision of the State Bank of Pakistan to ban crypto-related activities proves that observation.\nIn early April, the SBP issued a circular on the “prohibition of dealing in virtual currencies”, right after a similar measure by the Reserve Bank of India, the regional rival. Unlike their Indian colleagues, who gave banks and traders three months to comply, Pakistani central bankers imposed the ban with immediate effect. SBP said virtual currencies and tokens were not legal tender and reminded it had not authorized any individual or entity to issue, sell, purchase, or exchange any such coins in Pakistan. All banks, microfinance entities, payment system operators and service providers were “advised to refrain” from dealing in cryptocurrencies.\nThe local market is by no means comparable to India’s booming crypto sector. According to Danyal Manzar, CEO of Pakistan’s first bitcoin exchange Urdubit, about 100 different digital coins were being traded daily across all mediums before the ban. His trading platform decided to close down permanently following the prohibition. “The decision was made in haste. Ample time should always be provided for a proper shutdown. But we respect the SBP’s decision,” he told The Express Tribune .\nImmediately after the ban, Urdubit warned its clients to withdraw both their fiat and their crypto funds. A month later, however, some of its users still have bitcoins in their accounts on the platform. Manzar believes that those who want to trade will continue to do so because “alternative ways still exist that will continue to be tapped no matter how risky they are.” He thinks that cryptocurrencies would only disrupt the stock market, and not the entire monetary system. “About 80 to 85% of the traders from stock exchanges came to try their luck in virtual currency,” he said. Localbitcoins PKR Trade Spikes After Ban\nRecently, Pakistani crypto traders told Asia Times that the central bank’s move initially caused a dip in the crypto market but the volume of trading has gradually picked up after alternative trading methods were discovered. “Traders realized that the SBP hasn’t, and can’t ban cryptocurrency in Pakistan,” Lahore-based trader Majid Ali commented. “What the State Bank has done is ban banks from entertaining crypto, so if you’re not dealing via banks, you [still] can own and trade virtual currency in Pakistan, which comes under the IT ministry,” he explained.\nIndeed, as the chart of the weekly Localbitcoins volume from Coin Dance shows, trading has spiked after the release of the circular. It peaked in the week of April 28 to more than 163 million Pakistani Rupee (>1.4 million USD), almost reaching December-January all-time highs.\nThe price of Pakistan’s first and only cryptocurrency, Pakcoin, which was explicitly mentioned in the SBP’s prohibition, has also jumped – by over 60% since the ban. Pakcoin founder Abu Shaheer says that the central bank’s measure has actually worked in favor of his crypto by “serving to expose Pakcoin’s name [and] more people got interested in it.” The digital token is already used for mobile phone credit top-ups. Islamabad to Prohibit “All Forms of Virtual Currency” After All\nSources from Pakistan’s Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication have told Asia Times that the government in Islamabad does plan to formally declare cryptocurrencies illegal in the country. “We have forwarded our recommendation for a ban on all forms of virtual currency trading, and proper legislation is being worked on,” a government official said.\nAccording to crypto trader Majid Ali, however, while the legislation is likely to hit trading, there are alternatives for dealing with cryptocurrencies. “The government of Pakistan can’t stop the trade in an international commodity that is accepted in other countries,” he said. Majid also warned that the ban actually opens transfer channels that can be used for illegal purposes.\nDo you think that bans imposed by central banks can really stop cryptocurrency trade?

The government has also revised the country’s tax code to add crypto taxation. Sellers of digital tokens will face a fine or even jail time if they fail to register with the regulator within 90 days.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Crypto Law In Effect\nThe Thai government’s decree to regulate cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) goes into effect on Monday. The Digital Asset Management Act BE 2561 was approved by the Thai cabinet in March and has been amended since.\nThe revision of the Revenue Code No. 19 was also announced in order to tax crypto profits at 15%, according to local media. Finance Minister Apisak Tantivorawong previously said, as reported by the Bangkok Post:\nIt [the decree] was not meant to prohibit cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other digital asset-related transactions, but to protect investors. Power to the Thai SEC\nAccording to the decree, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the duty and the authority to regulate digital currencies and their operators, Matichon reported.\nThe publication outlines four areas the SEC will be responsible for. The first is to regulate the issuance and offering of cryptocurrencies and digital asset businesses. The second is to set the fees and requirements for the registration and approval of cryptocurrencies and their operators. The third is to establish a guideline for dealing with potential problems. The fourth concerns all other areas not previously mentioned.\n“All sellers are required to register with the SEC within 90 days of the law taking effect,” the Bangkok Post wrote, adding that:\nSellers of digital tokens unauthorized by the SEC will be fined no more than twice the value of the digital transaction or at least 500,000 baht [~US$15,703]. They could also face a jail term of up to two years.\nThe news outlet elaborated that “the [finance] ministry and SEC will now work on organic laws requiring all digital asset transactions, including those of digital asset exchanges, brokers, and dealers, to be registered with the relevant authorities according to the decree.”\nDespite the new rules and direction presented in the decree, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) says that it will wait for the SEC to announce other details of the regulations before it will make a stance on cryptocurrencies and ICOs, according to Matichon. The BOT has previously banned financial institutions from crypto activities.\nWhat do you think of the Thai crypto regulations?

Click here\nAccording to a recent report, cryptocurrency miners from China have been flocking to regions in Southeast Asia like Vietnam, Myanmar, and Cambodia. However, a relocated Chinese miner based in Cambodia says miners trying to find safe havens in other Southeast Asian countries are having difficulties, and losing money every month due to residents complaining and unreliable power.\nAlso read: Zimbabwe Bans All Cryptocurrency Activity, Businesses Have 2 Month Grace Period Chinese Miners Who Relocate Are Finding Other Regions Located in Southeast Asia More Difficult\nMining in China is still allowed but there have been rumors of government crackdowns, and because of this speculation many mining operations based in the country have begun to relocate. Some operations who still seek out cheaper Chinese electricity tariffs moved to the border towns in Yunnan, but lots of Chinese miners have relocated to other areas in Southeast Asia like South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar. Although government officials and residents living in these regions have been giving miners a hard time according to a relocated miner named Zhang Han. Zhang relocated to Cambodia from China and found that local rent is quite cheap, a 500 square-meter large shack only charges 500,000 riel ($100) per month, and you can hire two local young labors at the cost of only $100. But Cambodian mining operations have posed other problems for Chinese miners.\nZhang says that he had miner friends that already “occupied” the suburbs of Cambodia and Myanmar. He did the math and found areas in Southeast Asia still offer much cheaper electricity than other countries worldwide. However, the miner explains he is not too happy with the move and states “I really regret it.” At first, Zhang found that Cambodia was expensive in some areas of operations, but less expensive in other areas when compared to other regions.\n“Compared with other miners who choose Vietnam and Myanmar, the electricity in Cambodia is slightly more expensive, but it costs less in other expenses,” Zhang explains in his recent interview .\nIt costs almost the same in Cambodia as industrial electricity price in China, 1.3 yuan ($20 cents) per kilowatt-hour (kWh), but you can take advantage of electricity theft from streetlamp facility with the help of some insiders. Accessory costs and maintenance is much more expensive than China. Some things can be 3X the price says Zhang. Accessories Costs and Operations Maintenance is More Expensive Abroad for Relocated Chinese Miners\nThe accessories costs and operations maintenance is what gave his mining operation headaches, Zhang explains. “Maintenance and accessories are very big problems, and it can also be said that the cost of supplies is very high,” Zhang details. “But hardware maintenance is a challenge, it would cost you a great sum – at least 3 times higher than the cost back in China, especially in hot days when entering March. Buying parts here is really a big headache, we have no choice but to purchase them from China, which would take days or even weeks to have it available in operation here.”\nAt times we turn to local miners for help, while they would seize the opportunity to ask for unfairly high price for a tiny fitting. Many areas in Southeast Asia experience lots of power outages and Zhang’s operation deals with electrical outages frequently. However, Zhang says you can take advantage of electricity theft from streetlamp facility with the help of some “insiders.” Chinese Miners Also Face Unfriendly Local Competitors and Residents Who Might Report Electrical Theft\nZhang further realized that Cambodia suffered from significant power outages where there is no electricity for a whole day or even longer. The miner says in order to mitigate the problem, if an operation happens to have a connection with a power company “insider,” they can steal power from a nearby streetlight. However, local residents may report this method to the authorities, and Zhang says residents are not too friendly towards Chinese miners right now. Additionally, local miners and financial institutions backed by Western countries are also not pleased with Chinese miners relocating to these countries.\n“Apart from the local residents and miners, institutions funded by western countries are also unfriendly to us — They are all trying to squeeze us out of here — And I’m considering that,” Zhang concludes.\nWhat do you think about relocated Chinese miners having issues in other areas of Southeast Asia?

Until this year, there was only one way to celebrate this unofficial holiday: order a pizza, pay with Bitcoin, and enjoy. This year, however, we will also see Bitcoin Cash Pizza Day. It is a bit more difficult to find merchants accepting BCH, but that is where the BCHPizza website will prove to be a valuable resource. BCHPizza is an Interesting Project\nEven though people all over the world have celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day for many years now, it is not necessarily easy to find merchants that accept Bitcoin payments these days. The world’s leading cryptocurrency has lost a fair amount of appeal in this regard, but it is still possible to use websites such as Takeaway.com for this purpose.\nFor cryptocurrency enthusiasts who wish to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day with Bitcoin Cash, the situation becomes a bit more complicated. Thankfully, a dedicated directory has been created to keep track of places accepting Bitcoin Cash payments in exchange for pizza.\nThere is also an incentive offered by the platform . Anyone can post a Bitcoin Cash bounty to get a certain pizza shop in a particular city to accept BCH as payment. As soon as the location officially enables BCH payments, the individual responsible can claim the bounty. Getting such businesses to stick with Bitcoin Cash will be rather challenging, as Bitcoin has seen similar struggles in this regard. Even so, it is an interesting initiative which will certainly be appreciated by community members.\nSo far, the website lists various locations throughout the US, Canada, Europe, Central and South America, and elsewhere. It is evident that a lot of businesses are rather interested in supporting Bitcoin Cash payments, although those locations are rather spread out, especially in Europe. There is a surprising number of businesses in Venezuela, Mexico, and Israel which will sell you pizza in exchange for Bitcoin Cash.\nAll of this goes to show that acceptance of Bitcoin Cash is growing steadily. Although buying pizzas with BCH is not necessarily the use case that will make this altcoin go mainstream anytime soon, it indicates that things are evolving in the right direction. There is still a lot of work to be done before Bitcoin Cash can rival Bitcoin, but at least users will be able to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day with their preferred version of Bitcoin.\nWhile no one will deny that Bitcoin Cash is a very successful and popular altcoin, there is still plenty of work to be done. Celebrating Bitcoin Cash Pizza Day may become a trend in the near future, which can only be considered a good thing. Bringing cryptocurrency enthusiasts together during events like these is what crypto is all about.\nFull details at themerkle.com/how-to-celebrate-bitcoin-pizza-day-with-bitcoin-cash/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "network crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T01:53:15.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec51ff4767808e9fa02618865d3fcd10e6e71119", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9zpNrFFAOBHI5LQPIInmPE9p9OJxFdjO6P1GgeP1M2Lgd9UsTLPPalsgSBIYw0_adO0Je3vcZR4HfjTpMZDJf9jjxsWwX.feDVvFrvu6WWhxD7j5u7bjQCe9VmpOQNg7n2BU4C.fQN.peJ5.TGTPS8y4l3QqNcjchvRXm806mcg--", "site_full": "www.elitetrader.com", "site": "elitetrader.com", "site_section": "https://www.elitetrader.com/et/forums/wall-st-news.44/", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Wall St. News | Elite Trader", "title": "Buffett and Gates are becoming frightened of Bitcoin.

There was a break below a short-term contracting triangle pattern with support at $1,450 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may decline a few points towards the $1,400 and $1,380 support levels.\nBitcoin cash price is struggling to gain momentum above $1,500 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD could decline once again if buyers lose control in the short term.\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThere was a decent recovery over the weekend as bitcoin cash price moved above the $1,450 resistance against the US Dollar. However, the price struggled to break the $1,500 resistance, which was also a support earlier. Moreover, the 100 hourly simple moving average, which is currently at $1,490 also acted as a major hurdle for buyers. The price is currently moving down and it broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,266 low to $1,505 high.\nDuring the decline, there was a break below a short-term contracting triangle pattern with support at $1,450 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. It seems like the $1,500 barrier acted as a crucial resistance and prevented declines. It may decline further and trade towards the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,266 low to $1,505 high. Therefore, the next major support is around the $1,400 and $1,380 levels.\nLooking at the chart , the price is currently under a minor bearish pressure below $1,480 and the 100 hourly SMA. If buyers succeed in gaining momentum above $1,500 and 100 hourly SMA, there could be more gains. The next resistance in the mentioned case could be $1,620.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD has just moved below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,380", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "aayush jindal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "newsbtc bitcoin cash price technical analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash price technical analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T07:28:29.057+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c64c80ebb4ba145890805a0299ddb59a27857731", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54I3a1AzXjL5GUEugd.5CPYDpnk88p1Fq8eZK7ikP8NDECVCB_cu7fAQRkAwCntIms9uNzuY9tSyl1zXbg_MZQfE-", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Netherlands' Biggest Crypto Exchange Removes Bitcoin Cash Before Hard Fork - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "Netherlands' Biggest Crypto Exchange Removes Bitcoin Cash Before Hard Fork - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_519515896.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c64c80ebb4ba145890805a0299ddb59a27857731", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54I3a1AzXjL5GUEugd.5CPYDpnk88p1Fq8eZK7ikP8NDECVCB_cu7fAQRkAwCntIms9uNzuY9tSyl1zXbg_MZQfE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wilma Woo", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Netherlands' Biggest Crypto Exchange Removes Bitcoin Cash Before Hard Fork - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "The Netherlands’ largest cryptocurrency exchange BL3P has announced it will remove Bitcoin Cash by May 15. B3LP: Hard Fork Was ‘Reason’ To Boot BCH\nIn a blog post May 10, the exchange said that it had been “planning” to stop supporting the altcoin, but that its upcoming hard fork had provided “a reason” to complete the process.\n“Since there already was a planning for the removal of Bitcash the hardfork has become a reason and strict deadline for the removal of Bitcash from BL3P,” the blog post reads.\nBitcoin Cash had generated significant publicity, both positive and negative , when it announced its hard fork plans which are due to go ahead May 15.\nThe latest step in developers’ plans to increase network transaction handling capabilities, prices increased over recent weeks as holders appeared to prepare for an airdrop of coins on the new chain.\nNonetheless, volatility in BCH markets remains higher than that of Bitcoin, the fluctuating considerably as Bitcoin prices fell over the weekend. Failing To Meet Requirements\nReferring to Bitcoin Cash variously as “Bitcash” and “BCash,” BL3P appeared to have little remorse over shutting down its operations and requiring users to withdraw their holdings.\n“BL3P maintains a strict selection policy when it comes to support for altcoins, bitcash unfortunately does not meet these requirements,” the blog post continues.\nFor this reason we have not made it possible to trade bitcash on BL3P. In addition, we will disable the option to withdraw bitcash per 15 May, 2018.\nThe move follows Hong Kong exchange OKEx , which also confirmed it would halt Bitcoin Cash support in April ostensibly due to “inadequate liquidity.”\nBitcoin Cash originally came into being in August 2017 as a hard fork of the Bitcoin network. At the time, proponents claimed the altcoin’s bigger block size would allow for faster and cheaper transactions.\nWhat do you think about BL3P’s decision to remove Bitcoin Cash?

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013.

But while that acquisition is still awaiting regulatory approval, that isn't stopping BitGo from bolstering its offerings.\nBitGo head of product Tracy Olsen indicated that the launch - which finds BitGo stratifying its service into three offering tiers - is about framing the company as a full spectrum provider of security solutions, one that can now scale from consumer to institutional needs.\nOlsen told CoinDesk:\n\"We're definitely seeing a lot of bigger names interested in digital currencies. But there are other customers like smaller hedge funds, they just don't want to have to hold custody themselves. They're looking to have the security and compliance and storage solutions that they can outsource to, and that's what BitGo is really delivering.\"\nThe three services tiers include \"qualified custody,\" in which BitGo offers secure storage and custody through Kingdom Trust; \"institutional custody,\" a solution that enables clients to manage wallets connected and disconnected from the Internet; and self-managed custody.\nAs such, Olsen positioned the full offering as one that can appeal to the risk-tolerance of all types of clients, from those who want to set up and manage wallets themselves, to those that want others to manage the sensitive cryptographic keys required to access funds.\n\"These are really targeted at different market segments. The market is really demanding these three different solutions,\" Olsen continued.\nAs for customer details, Olsen indicated that BitGo would not reveal the total value of the assets it helps custody, though she said 15 percent of bitcoin transactions now occur through the company's wallet offerings. Multi-asset upgrade\nStill, that's not to say there isn't work to be done on BitGo's offering.\nOlsen indicated that BitGo now provides its custody solutions to over 20 cryptocurrencies, but that the company is \"absolutely\" looking to increase that number in 2018.\n\"We see a lot of demand of customers for a wide variety of coins. We evaluate each of them for viability in the market and then we prioritize them accordingly,\" he said.\nWhile BitGo primarily started as a bitcoin-only firm, it steadily increased the number of coins it supported over 2017 in line with a jump in the number of crypto hedge funds, as well as wallet and exchange providers that began moving to support multiple protocols.\nNotably, however, Olsen hinted that interest at larger institutional firms mirrors this trend, with many indicating an interest in the wide variety of crypto assets on the market today.\n\"They see it as a compelling asset class and want to diversify their portfolios with ethereum, ripple and other digital currencies,\" she said. Wall Street ambitions\nOverall, the announcement also serves to potentially recast BitGo as a rare cryptocurrency startup ready to appeal to those seeking to do business on Wall Street.\nPropelled by announcements such as Goldman Sachs' coming launch of a dedicated crypto trading desk, others are entering the market. Still, investment in security and custody has arguably lagged over the years, as evidenced by the fact that there are only a handful of such providers today.\nAmong them are Ledger and Coinbase , two companies that have also sought to raise big funding rounds to serve custody products to an institutional clientele.\nHowever, as Olsen indicated, the nascent state of the market today means that all entrants are competing against the sometimes negative perception of the technology.\nOlsen concluded:\n\"There's a reputation out there for digital currencies that they may be associated to the underworld, but I believe they are coming around and are seeing the value in investing in this asset class.\"\nBank deposit boxes via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Download the App to your phone, then click “Create new wallet.” Next you’ll be prompted to set a 6-digit PIN. Memorize it, or you won’t be able to access your Bitcoin! Next, Breadwallet will give you a 12-word “Paper Key” that you need to write down. Your paper key will be just a string of unrelated words, like “Carbon Bicycle Tower Carrot… etc.” If something happens to your phone, this key is the only thing that can help you access your Bitcoin. DO NOT save it somewhere on your computer. The best thing to do is either memorize it or store it somewhere hackers can’t access. Now that you’ve done that, you’re ready to start accepting Bitcoin payments. Way 1: Manually accept payments to your wallet Okay, doing anything “manually” is bound to take more time and energy, but in the case of cryptocurrency payments, there are some benefits. For one, using a third-party tool takes away a lot of the privacy that makes cryptocurrency so appealing to a lot of people. And while I personally am not too concerned about processing anonymous transactions, I do care about the potential fees that could come along with third-party processors. That said, if you run an ecommerce store that processes 10s or hundreds of transactions a day, it’ll be hard to keep track of them manually from your wallet. In that case, a third-party tool can help a lot. Manually accepting payments a great strategy if you only need to process payments periodically, such as with a freelance business like mine. So, after setting up Breadwallet or another option, you have access to a secure wallet where you can send and receive Bitcoin. Assuming your client has their own wallet already loaded up with Bitcoin, all you have to do now to accept payment is provide them with a receive address. Here’s where you find it on Breadwallet: Breadwallet then creates a text address your client can send payments to. You can set a price in Bitcoin or in equivalent USD. That jumble of letters and numbers you see is the receive address. Your customers can copy and paste it to send you Bitcoin, or use the QR code for mobile wallets. Breadwallet will convert USD into Bitcoin automatically when you send it out to an email address. Each time you receive payment on your public key, a new address will be automatically generated (but the old addresses still work). Breadwallet gives you options to text or email your public keys. If you want to be more professional, you can include them as a payment option in your invoices. I just checked my invoicing software, and it looks like they have Bitcoin as a billing currency option: If yours doesn’t, you can bill in Dollars (or Pounds, Euros, etc.), then give an equivalent Bitcoin payment option. Once your client has paid your invoice, the funds should appear right in your Breadwallet! Way 2: Use a Payment Processor Your other option here is to use a payment processor. This is an invaluable tool to have if you process a lot of transactions (e.g. you run an ecommerce store) and you need help keeping track of them all for bookkeeping purposes. Here’s a breakdown of a few popular payment processors to choose from: BitPay BitPay is probably the most popular tool business can use to accept Bitcoin. With it, you can set up direct bank deposits, automatically converting payments into fiat currency (Dollar, Euro, etc.) and sending it to your bank account. This helps merchants avoid risk with the volatility of Bitcoin. BitPay has a 1% transaction fee, unless you process less than 30 transactions a month or $10,000 worth of Bitcoin per year. So only the smallest of small businesses can use this tool for free. Although, if you’re only offering Bitcoin as one of many payment options, you very well may only get the occasional transaction as adoption of Bitcoin is still pretty low (for now). Coinbase Coinbase is probably a familiar platform for your crypto-wielding customers, as it’s the first place most Americans go when they start investing in crypto. It also offers merchant services, using a lot of the same features as BitPay. They have plugins for your ecommerce store and you can can set up automatic transfers to fiat. They also have a 1% transaction fee for merchant processing. GoCoin GoCoin is your third major option here, and like Coinbase and BitPay, has a 1% transaction fee. I took a hard look at their features and most are similar to Coinbase and BitPay, however their list of integrations was significantly shorter, and it was unclear whether they offered a native wallet to manage your crypto funds. PayPal PayPal remains the most well known payment service on the web. When encouraging customers to adopt a new payment option, it’s beneficial to do so through a well-trusted platform like PayPal. Luckily you can do this, as PayPal has integrations with BitPay, CoinBase, and GoCoin. Setting up BitPay as your payment processor For this walkthrough I’m going to set up BitPay as my payment processor, simply because small businesses (like mine) can avoid the 1% processing fee on transactions. You might prefer CoinBase because it’s familiar to you or your customers, or GoCoin with a PayPal integration, etc. If you head to BitPay.com and click “Get Started,” you’ll see you have 3 options to proceed: Set up a BitPay Card Account Set up a Business Account Create a wallet to store Bitcoin You’re going to choose Business Account: You may also want to set up a BitPay wallet, which you can do later on by downloading the mobile app. The setup process is similar to Breadwallet (described above). Once you fill out your information and sign up, you’ll see there are 3 steps to start accepting bitcoin: Start by checking your email and clicking the confirmation link. Then navigate to “Get Verified.” Here they ask basic information about your business like your address and URL, who owns the business, etc. It looks like they take some time to verify your business information, but that doesn’t stop you from moving forward with the process: Next navigate to “Add a Bank Account.” You’ll see there’s options to add your bank account or a bitcoin address to store money: If you only want to automatically transfer Bitcoin to fiat and put in your bank account, then you can add your bank account information and you’re done. If you want to keep some or all of your payments in crypto, then add a bitcoin address as well. I showed you above how to access your BreadWallet receive address. If you’re using BitPay wallet or another wallet, there should be a similar option to view and copy it. Paste it into BitPay and make sure it’s accurate. If it’s not, your payments will be lost. You’ll also see there’s an option called “% Settlement Percentage”: Here you can set how much of your transaction you want sent to your bank account, and how much you want to send to your wallet and keep in crypto. Advertise that you accept Bitcoin Despite a huge burst of interest at the end of 2017, cryptocurrency still isn’t that widely used yet. Since you and I are still among the early adopters, we need to make extra efforts to advertise it as an accepted form of payment. Most consumers, even those that love crypto, will assume it’s not a payment option unless you tell them it is. So, include notifications and calls-to-action on your website to encourage customers to try this payment method: If you use BitPay or Coinbase to accept Bitcoin, they also have Wordpress plugins that integrate right into your site. To get inspiration for different ways to highlight that you accept Bitcoin on your site, check out this list of companies that accept crypto . Newegg does a good job of it: If your business is like mine and you communicate with your clients mostly through email, consider including a notice as part of your email signature, e.g. “ We accept Bitcoin, ” or “ Ask me about paying in crypto! ” Someone sent you Bitcoin. Now what? If you’ve done a good job advertising that you accept Bitcoin and attract the right customers, you should get your first crypto payment before long. So what do you do next with this magic computer money? If you set up a payment processor like BitPay, then you don’t have to do anything — it will automatically convert your Bitcoin to dollars (or Pounds, Euros, etc.) and transfer it to your bank account as you specified. Your other option is to keep your Bitcoin stored in your secure wallet as an investment. We don’t have any hard numbers on how many people use Bitcoin to buy and sell services, but if Bitcoin’s value trends give us any indication, consumer confidence and adoption of crypto is on the rise: So holding (HODLing, etc.) your Bitcoin might make your earnings even more valuable over time (Or not, I’m just a person with no financial expertise. Do your own research before making any kind of investment decisions ). If you store your Bitcoin with Breadwallet or another tool, you can easily turn some of it into fiat currency and cash out to your bank account whenever you please. All you have to do is sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange that lets you sell to fiat, such as CoinBase . Sign up for CoinBase, get verified, add your bank account, etc. CoinBase will prompt you to set up two-factor authentication — do it. Your CoinBase account is vulnerable to hacking just like any other place you store your cryptocurrency. Then under “Accounts” find your BTC Wallet. Click “Receive”: Coinbase will then show you a Bitcoin address. Copy that into the “Send” section of your Bitcoin wallet, select how much Bitcoin you want to send, hit send, and you’re done. After a short wait, the BTC will appear in your Coinbase account. You can then go to the “Buy/Sell” tab and select to sell BTC to your bank account: There are fees and it will take a few days to process. But that’s how you cash out your Bitcoin to fiat currency whenever you want. Be prepared for crypto taxes… Just like with any other kind of money you earn, there are tax responsibilities when you earn Bitcoin. I know a lot of cryptocurrency fans shrug this off, since governments don’t have any way to track how much crypto they have if they keep it secured in their wallets. If you’re one of them, heed this warning: There is no statute of limitations on civil tax fraud. So don’t try to get sneaky with your crypto earnings. That said, the cryptocurrency tax waters are still largely unnavigated. Each country has or is developing their own standard for how to handle cryptocurrency taxes. Rather than dive into specifics, I advise you to do your own homework on what your obligations are, or better yet, seek advice from a professional. Wrapping up If you made it through this whole article, you officially know more about Bitcoin and how to use it than 99% of people. But that doesn’t mean accepting Bitcoin payments for your online business isn’t a worthwhile endeavour. People who work online tend to be early adopters of new and exciting technologies. And as cryptocurrency gains more traction in the digital world, there will be more potential to attract customers who prefer to pay with Bitcoin or another coin. And when you think about it, adding on another payment option is always a valuable strategy to encourage people to convert. Spikes and dips in Bitcoin value aside, what do you have to lose?

Price could be due for a pullback to the falling resistance, which lines up with the Fib levels. Technical indicators are suggesting that the selloff could carry on.\nBitcoin price is exhibiting some bearish momentum and could draw more selling pressure on a correction.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA on the 1-hour chart to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the downtrend is more likely to continue than to reverse.\nThe gap between the moving averages is also widening to reflect a pickup in selling momentum. The 100 SMA lines up with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level to add to its strength as resistance.\nA larger pullback to the higher Fibs or the 200 SMA could still be possible, but RSI looks ready to head south without hitting overbought levels. This signals that bears are eager to get back in on a shallow correction. BTCUSD 1-hour Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nCryptocurrency updates last week have been mixed, with a rough start on Buffet’s remarks and a bit of a pickup on news that ICE is getting ready to launch a bitcoin trading platform.\nApparently these haven’t been strong enough to spur a move past the $10,000 handle, so bears still have the upper hand and bulls are likely being cautious. It has also been reported that the launch of bitcoin futures led to the slump last December, which kept investors on edge that further bitcoin products could draw more selling action.\nNonetheless, more institutional money is projected to flow into the industry and this could mark the start of less dependence on speculative activity and higher volumes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah jenn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T06:01:34.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c028b5406896664f92814c0e2ded2cac6575cfcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE50eapSUTXU2bBiGupkw7z6PhFaEknthBadRftWKYpubZnrXxAxi3DPnta1LOsQxSl.8o622S6vg", "site_full": "themerkle.com", "site": "themerkle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Spikes to $8,800 – The Merkle", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Spikes to $8,800 – The Merkle", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.16, "main_image": "https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/daily-chart-51.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90224, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c028b5406896664f92814c0e2ded2cac6575cfcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE50eapSUTXU2bBiGupkw7z6PhFaEknthBadRftWKYpubZnrXxAxi3DPnta1LOsQxSl.8o622S6vg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Spikes to $8,800 – The Merkle", "text": "Pin Shares 0\nAt press time, bitcoin is trading for roughly $8,800. This is a $200 jump from where it stood just 24 hours ago, and investors are receiving a glimmer of hope for the future. The price bump suggests that bitcoin’s power is continuing to grow stronger, and despite a few ups and downs this week, the currency is finding it relatively easy to recover from negative hype.\nGranted bitcoin can keep up its momentum, we may witness the currency spiking into the $9,000 range again this week. The price had recently been marred by activity in both Japan (Mt. Gox) and South Korea (Upbit), but now it appears recovery is on its way, as the currency has incurred $200 to $300 spikes each day since its initial drop to $8,250 – the lowest it had been since early April.\nOne reason for the sudden price surge comes from an unlikely place – New York. Recently, the Big Apple has garnered a reputation for being unfriendly towards bitcoin and cryptocurrency businesses thanks to the BitLicense , which was implemented in 2015. Many digital currency companies ultimately left New York or refused to perform business in the state, saying that they were being subjected to unfair fees and taxes.\nToday offers a different story. New York is now hosting a three-day event known as Coindesk’s Consensus Conference. The event is slated to bring in over 8,000 attendees, and with tickets costing as much as $2,000 each, the Conference organizers are expecting to make nearly $20 million in sales this year. The event begins today – Monday morning – and is occurring at the New York Hilton, Midtown.\n“It’s a bit chaotic in here,” says Ronnie Moas, head of the independent market research firm Standpoint Research. “I think they sold too many tickets.”\nThe hoopla is a positive sign, to say the least. Over the last week, bitcoin has been subjected to newfound volatility, dropping from a new high of roughly $9,800 to less than $8,300 in just a matter of days. That’s a $1,500 drop in less than a week.\nThis, combined with New York’s relatively hostile attitude towards cryptocurrency ventures, could have easily marred the Conference’s success. Instead, the opposite result seems to have emerged. So many people are trying to get in that organizers are now offering last-minute tickets to individuals for approximately $3,000 each. It’s a hard bargain, but if you’re that passionate about crypto, maybe it’s $3,000 well spent…\nMany attending reporters have claimed that it took them anywhere from an hour to an hour-and-a-half to garner their reporter badges so they could properly proceed. The line for entry spread across the hotel lobby, and extended onto a second floor by way of an elevator and stairs.\n“I’ve never seen anything like this for registration,” said Consensus attendee Jeff Denton, senior director of global secure supply chain at AmerisourceBergen in Philadelphia. At that time, Denton had been waiting in line for approximately one hour.\n“It’s expensive, but it’s the largest conference in the U.S., so hopefully that brings the value for the cost,” he added, stating that he was predominantly interested in learning how blockchain technology could be applied to healthcare.

Eisman: “I Don’t Know What I’m Looking At”\nDuring his presentation, Eisman stated that the reasons why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had gained popularity were two fold. Firstly, they were a tool for people to speculate with. Secondly, that money launderers were using them to clean cash. For the Neuberger Berman managing director, these were the only reasons why anybody was even interested in the financial innovation.\nHe continued, questioning the rationale behind digital currencies existence in the first place:\n“I don’t see the purpose of it… What value does cryptocurrency actually add? No one’s been able to answer that question for me.”\nEisman was speaking at an annual conference for the CFA Institute – a global association of investment professionals. He addressed a crowd of around 1,500 on a panel discussion in which he stated clearly that his expertise lay outside of cryptocurrencies so he hadn’t ever invested in them:\n“I don’t touch it… I don’t know what I’m looking at…I have no interest”\nHe also stated that he had no desire to trade traditional currencies and questioned the lack of regulation in place governing cryptocurrency investors and traders:\n“I don’t understand why regulators haven’t regulated it more heavily.”\nEisman initially found fame after correctly predicting the 2008 financial crisis. He was subsequently immortalised in a bestselling book by author Michael Lewis, ‘The Big Short,’ which was then turned into a movie of the same title. Actor Steve Carell played the role of Eisman. According to the man himself, Carell’s portrayal was very accurate, despite him having little to do with the making of the film.\nDuring the panel discussion at the CFA Institute conference and an interview that followed, Eisman also addressed the current economy, the likelihood of a similar crash today, and how he knew that the U.S. housing market would tumble so spectacularly around a decade ago.\nWith Eisman’s outlook on cryptocurrencies, he joins a chorus of voices that includes Charlie Munger , Warren Buffet, Jamie Dimon , and various other names associated with traditional banking and financial institutions. Between the three mentioned, such insults as crypto being a ‘fraud,’ a ‘scum-ball activity,’ and ‘rat poison squared’ have been levied towards the potentially revolutionary financial innovation. Surely if there was nothing to fear from Bitcoin and the rest of the digital currencies, there would be no need for such attacks. Perhaps they doth protest too much, methinks?

This jump has BCH closing in on Ripple’s third-place spot on the coin rankings .\nHowever, the climb has not been without conflict – Bitcoin.com, owned by Roger Ver, was almost the target of a lawsuit. Bitcoin Cash is one of the strongest performing assets over the past 30 days, up over 80%. Lawsuit Troubles\nThe almost-lawsuit stems from the controversy between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\nIn the middle of 2017, some developers were not content with the implementation of the Segregated Witness (SegWit). SegWit was implemented to increase the number of transactions per second the network was capable of processing, but many developers believed that raising the block size limit was the superior solution.\nThese developers hard forked Bitcoin on August 1st, 2017. They created Bitcoin Cash, which was similar to Bitcoin but has a max block size of 8 MB, to increase transaction speeds. Since then, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have been locked in a war for supremacy. Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com\nRoger Ver, a major proponent of Bitcoin cash, is the owner of the website Bitcoin.com.\nHowever, his site has been continually hit with criticism for being misleading. Many viewers believe his website is designed to confuse cryptocurrency novices into buying Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin.\nRecently, Bitcoin.com changed their block explorer page to refer to Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as Bitcoin, and Bitcoin (BTC) as Bitcoin Core. This angered many users, some to the point of action. Believing this change constituted fraud, and could cause unwitting users to lose Bitcoin by sending it to Bitcoin Cash wallets, funding for a lawsuit commenced. Prior to the lawsuit funding, Bitcoin.com labeled Bitcoin Cash (BCH) misleadingly.\nLed by Twitter user @ moneytrigz , a website was created and began accepting Bitcoin donations for a lawsuit against Bitcoin.com. Following this, Bitcoin.com soon changed their block explorer page, referring to BCH as Bitcoin Cash, and BTC as Bitcoin Core. Under legal pressure, Bitcoin.com began referring to BCH as Bitcoin Cash once again.\nInitially decrying the lawsuit as stupid, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee quickly changed his tune, praising the change it effected on Bitcoin.com. I retract my statement calling the lawsuit stupid. I just found out that Roger has changed the website back to listing bcash as \"Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\" instead of just Bitcoin. So for that, the lawsuit has already done some good. So carry on!\n— Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite) May 1, 2018\nSoon after though, the lawsuit was canceled due to a lack of funding, and the donators were refunded. Many users still considered it a victory though, because Bitcoin.com was pressured to change their website. We appreciate the 31 people that donated to the initiativeBut $3700 wont be enough to do much, so we decided to cancel the initiative and refund the 31 transactions (total 0.39btc)im happy were able to atleast get bitcoincom make 90% changes on its fraude and dis-information pic.twitter.com/EixrrqffD5\nSometime during the lawsuit fundraising, the cryptocurrency price tracking website CoinMarketCap removed the website link to Bitcoin.com from its Bitcoin page. There was no official announcement, but the website was presumably removed due to the allegations of fraud. Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork\nWith the threat of a lawsuit quelled, Bitcoin Cash has been performing admirably. One of the reasons for the recent price growth may be Bitcoin Cash’s upcoming hard fork on May 15th. Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The fork occurred on August 1, 2017.\nWhile the BCH fork is a hard fork, it is not like most others where two new currencies are created. In this fork, the value of the old blockchain will be canceled. This will cause the fork to function similarly to a soft fork, which only involves a software upgrade.\nThe most significant change in this fork is the quadrupling of block sizes from 8 megabytes to 32 megabytes. This change will improve Bitcoin Cash’s viability as a currency by further increasing the number of transactions that can be fit on each block.\nThe fork will also reactivate some pieces of the original bitcoin code that have not been in use for many years. Among these pieces of code is an opcode known as ‘OP_GROUP.’ This code could be used to create tokens on the BCH network. Bitcoin Cash Smart Contracts\nAnother important opcode being added is ‘OP_RETURN’. This code allows users to store additional data on the blockchain. This code could lay the groundwork for Bitcoin Cash smart contracts.\nWhile these codes could expand the scope of Bitcoin Cash significantly, and grant it functions similar to Ethereum smart contracts and ERC20 tokens, it is not guaranteed.\nWith the hard fork only days away, Bitcoin Cash is performing well. If the hard-fork goes well, transaction speeds and usability will improve significantly. The additions of opcodes could also massively expand the functionality of the Bitcoin Cash network.

You can donate to this street artist directly.”– reported by artnet News .\nEven if you don’t quite understand cryptocurrencies, you’ve probably heard that Bitcoin and its many siblings are the way of the future. Now, one artist has come up with a new way to benefit directly from this still-nascent technology by inviting passersby to donate to him using a Bitcoin QR code, which he affixed to his murals.\nThe brainchild behind the idea is French street artist Pascal “PBOY” Boyart, and the artist’s embrace of the digital currency is already paying dividends. As of this writing, Boyar has made 0.11 Bitcoin (about $1,000) from 23 donors thanks to his clever embrace of cryptocurrency. The feat has even caught the attention of Reddit.\nBoyart was intrigued by the idea of being able to connect directly with the public and to receive money for his work without going through a middleman. So, he took six months off from painting to learn about this new technology. The donation process that resulted is decidedly simple: Anyone with a smartphone and a Bitcoin wallet can scan the QR code on the mural and make a digital payment that goes directly to the artist.\n“I think that the times we are living are difficult for free-minded artists,” the artist told artnet News in an email. “It looks like the Impressionist era, with an official art of academic artists and the others that you have not much chance to see in an international art fair.”\nOne of Boyart’s recent murals shows Rembrandt van Rijn reading through a large tax bill—the celebrated Dutch Gold Age master struggled to make money throughout his career, despite creating some of art history’s best-known works. The piece is titled Rembrandt dos au mur, or Rembrandt Back Against the Wall, a pun on the artist’s financial situation and the work’s wall mural nature. Pascal “PBOY” Boyart, Rembrandt dos au mur, a mural in Paris featuring a QR code that allows the public to donate to the artist using Bitcoin. / Photo: Pascal “PBOY” Boyart\nThe work can be found on the Rue Riquet, where an over 1,640-foot street art wall was created in December 2015, on a bridge going over the railroad tracks. The artist created his addition to the outdoor display without permission, having previously painted Vincent van Gogh on the same wall three years ago. He has described his style as blending the Pointillism of Georges Seurat with Jackson Pollock‘s drip paintings.

It shows a boy’s face with the caption “Papa, c’est quoi l’argent?” or “Dad, what is money?” Setting up the Bitcoin account was easy, so all he had to do was order a laser cut stencil for the QR code. Pascal “PBOY” Boyart, Papa, c’est quoi l’argent (detail), a mural in Paris featuring a QR code that allows the public to donate to the artist using Bitcoin. / Photo: Pascal “PBOY” Boyart\nBoyart isn’t sure whether other artists have tried this before, but he thought it could be a good way to offset the considerable costs for materials and supplies for his street art.\n“I diversify my sources of income,” he said. “Sometimes I do live painting performances on events, collaborations with brands and storyboarding… Occasionally, I sell some artworks and I organize my own art exhibitions. Most of the time, my street art pieces are made without remuneration, just for the pleasure to paint and share with the people.”\nWith Bitcoin, the artist has an easy way to set up direct financial transactions with the people.\n“I think it’s great news for the future and it will bring more sense, talent, freedom, and creativity from the artists,” Boyart said.\n“The most interesting aspect is decentralization—a peer-to-peer horizontal system,” he told the Next Web , which first wrote about the project. “Art and creation need that, I believe.”\nBoyart, who is now planning an exhibition of cryptocurrency art, is thankful for the donations he’s received so far. “I’ll use this money to purchase more art material and ‘hold’ another part because Bitcoin’s value will surely increase in coming years,” he said. Who knows—cryptocurrencies might not only revolutionize the world. If we’re lucky, they may also end once and for all the tired trope of the starving artist.\nYou can find Boyart’s Bitcoin address here . And below are more photos of Rembrandt dos au mur.

The BTC/USD pair broke an ascending channel with support at $8,450 on the hourly chart (data feed from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $8,300 support level to avoid any further declines in the short term. Bitcoin price recovered from $8,220 against the US Dollar. However, BTC/USD is finding it difficult to break the $8,800-9,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Analysis This past week, we saw a downside reaction from well above $9,000 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price broke many support levels such as $9,000, $8,500 and $8,400 to trade close to $8,200. A low was formed at $8,226 before the price started an upside correction. It moved above the $8,400 resistance and even cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,391 high to $9,225 swing low. However, the upside move was capped by the $8,800 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It was rejected from the 100 hourly SMA and declined back below $8,600. The BTC/USD pair broke an ascending channel with support at $8,450 on the hourly chart. The recent downside break indicates that the pair was rejected from the $8,800 resistance zone. It is currently trading below the $8,500 support with a bearish angle. However, there is a major support forming near $8,300. As long as the price is above the stated $8,300 support, it is likely to move higher in the near term. Looking at the chart, the price seems to be consolidating above $8,300. Once the current consolidation phase is over, BTC price may either move above $8,500 or break $8,200 for more losses. Looking at the technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is now back in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently well below the 50 level.

It's part of a promotion for the conference, and cryptocurrency exchange BitMex, he said.\n\"We do a lot of this for a lot of companies all the time,\" Nouri said. \"It's an attention grabber. It's for the people walking in. They all say once you make money in crypto, you buy a lambo.\"\n\"I never made money with crypto but I have ten lambos,\" Nouri said. His company rents Lamborghinis out for $1,000 a day.\nBitcoin multiplied 13 times in price last year, minting cryptocurrency millionaires. A Lamborghini can cost about $200,000 or more, and the luxury cars have become an internet symbol for volatile cryptocurrencies' massive potential for wealth creation.\n\"I see a parallel between young people that are really willing to become very rich with the very high-risk investment, and … the fact that our customers are very young,\" Lamborghini CEO Stefano Domenicali told CNBC in a recent interview.\nCase in point, coder Peter Saddington, 35, bought a Lamborghini three years ago for $200,000 with 45 bitcoins. He'd spent less than $115 on the coins when cryptocurrencies were at the very fringes of mainstream interest.\nBitcoin traded near $8,700 early Monday afternoon, less than half their worth in mid-December.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefano domenicali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate rooney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john nouri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "broadway supercars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey-based", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hilton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:29:08.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "399019809e9fe42ae86c5fe7e7abb25d5a407c9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRpyk_glxNrIcFquGwZFzwiNN5XHzlsdriB9KurueXHOaUN7d_pDS.mEnlPc39WkOFK6NDZfVFcdpV5w3s56V4RjSKsPX4CDnhYra2oAqk.7NoABu3uWHKL8E95C7iST2h5jmmiigbpu60kLm7r6Cvu1mUoBFl62qNDOf9WWK6r4A--", "site_full": "fr.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: Goldman Sachs offre un nouveau boost de crédibilité aux crypto-monnaies Par Investing.com", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Goldman Sachs offre un nouveau boost de crédibilité aux crypto-monnaies Par Investing.com", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB701AO_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 30, "comments": 0, "shares": 30}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "399019809e9fe42ae86c5fe7e7abb25d5a407c9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRpyk_glxNrIcFquGwZFzwiNN5XHzlsdriB9KurueXHOaUN7d_pDS.mEnlPc39WkOFK6NDZfVFcdpV5w3s56V4RjSKsPX4CDnhYra2oAqk.7NoABu3uWHKL8E95C7iST2h5jmmiigbpu60kLm7r6Cvu1mUoBFl62qNDOf9WWK6r4A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Goldman Sachs offre un nouveau boost de crédibilité aux crypto-monnaies Par Investing.com", "text": "0 0 <div id=\"comment\"> <div class=\"comment js-comment\" data-comment-id=\"{commentID}\" id=\"comment-{commentID}\" data-user-id=\"203079913\"> <div class=\"mainComment js-content\"> <div class=\"commentInnerWrapper\"> <a href=\"{userLink}\" class=\"js-user-link\"><img src=\"{userImage}\" width=\"33\" height=\"33\" alt=\"{usernameAlt}\" class=\"img\"></a><div class=\"commentBody\"> <span class=\"commentUsername\"> <a href=\"{userLink}\" class=\"js-user-link js-user-name\">{username}</a> </span> <span class=\"js-date\" comment-date=\"{dateFormat}\" comment-date-formatted=\"{dateFormatted}\" title=\"{dateTitle}\">À l'instant</span> <div class=\"commentDropDown js-commentDropDownWrapper \" data-user-id=\"203079913\"> <div class=\"flag js-flag\"> <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" id=\"commentFlag_{commentID}\"> <span class=\"commentFlagIcon \" title=\"Signaler\"></span> </a> </div> <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"threeDotsIconSmall js-thinDropdownArrow\"></a> <div class=\"tooltipPopup commentActionsPop noHeader js-commentDropDownOptions displayNone\"> <div class=\"addRow js-option share\"> <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"js-commentSharePopup\" data-cid=\"{commentID}\" data-curl=\"{commentLink}\"><span class=\"smallShareIcon middle\"></span>Partager</a> </div> <div class=\"addRow js-option save\"> <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" class=\"js-save-item-btn\" data-item-type=\"comments\" data-item-id=\"{commentID}\"> <i class=\"saveItemBigIcon middle\"></i> Enregistrer </a> </div> <div class=\"addRow saveItemsConfirmation noHover displayNone js-saveItemResult\"> <div class=\"content js-saveItemSuccess displayNone\"> <span class=\"mediumGreenSuccessIcon\"></span><span>Sauvegardé.

However, the ensuing corrective rally was also short-lived: BTC failed to beat the descending 5-day moving average (MA) hurdle, seen yesterday at $8,760 and fell to a low of $8,271 today.\nThe price action indicates BTC is clearly not out of the woods yet and, if anything, the bear grip seems to have strengthened over the last few days. Hourly chart\nThe bear flag breakdown indicated on the chart signals a continuation of the sell-off and has opened the doors to $7,300 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far fetched as of now. Nevertheless, the pattern does indicate scope for a drop below $8,000.\nThe relative strength index (RSI) is biased to the bears (below 50.00) and the 100-candle moving average (MA) and the 200-candle MA continue to slope downwards, also in favor of the bears. Monthly chart\nThe chart shows the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 ran out of steam near $10,026 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high) and the 5-month and 10-month MAs are beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears for the first time since September 2014.\nSo, the BTC bulls need progress soon, else the 5-month MA will cut the 10-month MA from above (bearish crossover), confirming a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. Daily chart\nThe short-term trend remains bearish as indicated by the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs.\nThis, coupled with the bearish development on the hourly and monthly charts, indicates that bitcoin will likely find acceptance below key support at $8,270 (50-day moving average) and $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to May 5 high). In such a case, bitcoin risks falling below $8,000. View\nBTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and could then drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).\nBullish scenario : Another rebound from $8,207 and a break above $8,760 would open doors for a move back above $9,000. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $9,038 would confirm the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has ended.\nBitcoin and U.S. dollars image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T15:42:07.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "553f38ef979b1f8bc23c4f3c0cc39e15defc5bf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_m8rSOaPE.Gupr_yf2bELL00iyWrk_hVERKmfY14nhaIgQpakCdSry1cNr5iQWxrJMkVfUoRKvbRr6TlecxPt28mPu6CEE99EmPIfAuBE2uOLAQPuvM7Vrc4ShCAho7_7uTTg.Xfeyww--", "site_full": "wibqam.com", "site": "wibqam.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Winklevosses' bitcoin exchange wins NY approval to expand services | News | WIBQ", "title_full": "Winklevosses' bitcoin exchange wins NY approval to expand services | News | WIBQ", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "553f38ef979b1f8bc23c4f3c0cc39e15defc5bf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_m8rSOaPE.Gupr_yf2bELL00iyWrk_hVERKmfY14nhaIgQpakCdSry1cNr5iQWxrJMkVfUoRKvbRr6TlecxPt28mPu6CEE99EmPIfAuBE2uOLAQPuvM7Vrc4ShCAho7_7uTTg.Xfeyww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Winklevosses' bitcoin exchange wins NY approval to expand services | News | WIBQ", "text": "Winklevosses' bitcoin exchange wins NY approval to expand services Monday, May 14, 2018 10:32 a.m. EDT\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state's top financial services regulator on Monday said it has authorized the Gemini Trust Co bitcoin exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to offer trading of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash, making it the world's first licensed Zcash exchange.\nThe state's Department of Financial Services said it also granted approval for Gemini to offer custody services and trading of Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash in the future.\n\"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement.\nGemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later.\n\"We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,\" Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo's office.\nZcash has a market value of about $1.2 billion, while the market values of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are about $24.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap.com .\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions, with trades conducted through a fragmented network of exchanges.\nCritics of the industry said the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering.\nThe Winklevosses, who are twins, are internet entrepreneurs who also competed in the rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n(This version of the story refiles to correct day of week in fourth paragraph to Saturday from Friday.)\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York;

However, knowing which bitcoin exchange to choose can be one of the most important first steps. Since you will be investing your funds into Bitcoin Core and the exchange from where you buy them, making sure you are choosing the right one becomes critical. (Update: Bitcoin Core is less usable as money due to much higher fees and delayed transaction times. The Core team has also expressed an interest in keeping these fees high since they view BTC as a “store-of-value” and not something to be transacted on a daily basis. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash’s transaction fees cost pennies and payments can be validated even with zero confirmations. These facts make BCH the ideal cryptocurrency for sending and receiving money anywhere in the world.) In this guide we will take you through the top items in our checklist we recommend reviewing before making the decision to select a Bitcoin exchange. Remember, these are just suggestions to help you make the right decision. In the end, things can always change based on the exchange and the market. But doing your homework first is highly encouraged. What country is the exchange located in? Knowing your country and where the exchange is based out of is important, as laws and regulations can vary country to country. Buying bitcoin in your home country is typically recommended. For a full list of exchange country locations, go to Buy Bitcoin at https://www.bitcoin.com/buy-bitcoin?utm_source=get-started&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=guides&utm_content=How-to-Choose-Best-Exchange and from the dropdown menu, select your country to start. Despite the exchange being based in your home country or not, the exchange may accept multiple currencies.\nMake sure to check the fine print; usually exchanges post in their terms of service what currencies they do and do not accept. How can bitcoins be purchased? Can you pay with wire transfer, cash, credit cards at https://buy.bitcoin.com/, at PayPal, and so on. Use what works best for you at your convenience. Please make sure to consider your privacy levels, for example credit cards may be the least private way versus a cash transaction. Exchange fees. You will want to make sure that the exchange fees are within reason and aren’t exorbitant compared to the rest of the market. Fees can change overtime and can vary from exchange to exchange. Some exchanges charge additional fees on top of bitcoin transaction fees at https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Transaction_fee. Order book volume. Most exchanges with a decent customer base will publish their order book. An order book is simply a list of buy and sell orders on the exchange that are being offered. A higher volume order book is an indicator that people are using the exchange and the exchange has liquidity. Although this is an important indicator, an exchange that doesn’t publish an order book doesn’t mean it’s not legit, it just might not have that function yet and/or has a smaller volume than other bigger exchanges. Is the exchange transparent? Exchanges that are fully transparent will publish cold storage addresses or audit information on how to verify their bitcoin reserves. Bitcoin audits are a good way for an exchange to prove to customers that they have liquidity and can cover all bitcoin exchange sales, and aren’t running a fractional exchange. How quickly will you get the bitcoins after purchasing them? This may vary person-to-person, but it’s good to know how long before the bitcoin will be sent to you after purchase.\nMake sure to also check if the exchange offers ‘locked in’ pricing; meaning that the price you buy at, is the price you will be charged for even if the bitcoins take a few days to arrive. Is anonymity important to you? Staying completely anonymous is difficult, unless you buy locally from someone in cash through a person-to-person marketplace. Make sure to check if the exchange follows Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in your country. If they do, then some identity information will have to be sent to them before buying. Security is paramount. Knowing the exchange is secure is very important and shouldn’t be overlooked. Is the exchange site HTTPS or HTTP? For it to have a secure protocol it must be HTTPS. Does the exchange offer secure logins along with two-factor authentication (2FA)? These are just a couple things to think about before selecting an exchange. Is the exchange reputable? This is an important question that can only be answered by discussing it with your peers. If you want to make sure the exchange has good customer reviews, search for feedback about the exchange on internet forums such as the Bitcoin Reddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/ or the Bitcoin Forum at https://forum.bitcoin.com/ . If you can’t find any feedback about it, ask in those forums if your peers have used it and what their experience was. Avoiding fraud. Not becoming a victim should be a high priority. This means avoiding any scam exchanges that are designed to steal from you.

The CME is set to announce a new $ETH product for traders to lust after. And given the scale and scope of the Ethereum network, this is big.\nThe Chicago-based exchange announced on Monday that it has partnered with a group of large cryptocurrency exchanges to create an Ether Reference Rate and Ether Real Time Index, which will provide standardized and audited pricing data for ETH/USD trading pairs, as well as a daily benchmark price.\n“The Ether Reference Rate and Real Time Index are designed to meet the evolving needs of this marketplace,” said Tim McCourt, managing director and global head of equity products and alternative investments at CME Group. “Providing price transparency and a credible price reference source is a key development for users of Ethereum.”\nBoth the Ether Reference Rate and Ether Real Time Index will be calculated by UK-based trading platform Crypto Facilities, which last week launched the first regulated ethereum futures product. Pricing data will be supplied from two cryptocurrency exchanges: San Francisco-based Kraken and Luxembourg-based Bitstamp.\n“Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency, experienced incredible adoption and growth in 2017, evolving into the leading blockchain for smart contracts,” said Dr. Timo Schlaefer, CEO of Crypto Facilities. “We are excited to be contributing to the strong community that has developed around the Ethereum network by providing a reliable reference rate and real-time Ether-Dollar price.”\nThe move paves the way for CME — which launched its first cryptocurrency futures product last December — to eventually list ethereum futures on its trading platform. This will provide institutional investors with more exposure to the nascent asset class, and it will give cryptocurrency miners with the ability to hedge their profits more effectively.\nThis is huge news for a set of Ethereum based hedge funds which have come to market in the last year, giving them another liquid option to hold or trade within their fund.\nThe CME has been a leader in crypto futures and we continue to hear and believe that more of these products are on the way. Think “Crypto ETF’s”– they are coming. We promise.

The app will allow users to pair their phones with goTenna’s portable antennas in order to broadcast transactions.\ngoTenna produces consumer-grade hardware to facilitate mesh networking — a concept that echoes much of the decentralization ethos that we see across the cryptocurrency domain — which operates by allowing peers to connect directly to one another for the purpose of routing packets, sidestepping the need to rely on an ISP or cell tower.\n“What will happen when these massive centralized networks fail due to natural disasters, as they did after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, or due to some kind of outside cybersecurity attack? What will happen when providers decide to crank up prices just because they can?” said Rich Myers, goTenna’s Decentralized Applications Engineer.\n“Mesh networks are the only legitimate alternative to these traditional centralized communication networks. They are completely decentralized and democratized, leaving the power of communication in the hands of the people. Beyond that, they are much more resilient to unforeseen disasters — the only thing these networks need to function is a mesh networking device paired with a smartphone.”\nFor its part, Samourai Wallet has been focusing on censorship resistance and privacy-oriented tools since it began in 2015. With features such as direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets, it has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions.\nSamourai has been curating Mule.tools , an R&D initiative to further reinforce the censorship-resistant properties of the Bitcoin blockchain and also published the code for Pony Direct , a proof-of-concept app for broadcasting transactions over SMS in January.\n“We believe one of the most fundamental value propositions that bitcoin provides is censorship resistance,” SW, the CEO of Samourai, told Bitcoin Magazine . “The freedom to transact freely and without permission is not a freedom to take lightly, or give up without a fight. We saw the open internet transform into a walled garden, captured by regulatory and corporate interest working together — and largely aided by red-herrings like ‘net-neutrality.’\n“The tools we are building arm the little guy — the individual — with the tools they need to level the playing field against the inevitable overstepping of bounds by hostile actors, oppressive regimes and overzealous governments,” said SW. “We’re making some material changes to Samourai Wallet to allow for a greater high latency and offline experience. In conjunction with the release of txTenna, Samourai Wallet users will be able to theoretically keep their phone offline at all times and still be able to send and receive payments with minimal hassle.”\nThe concept explored by txTenna follows in the path of alternate methods to access the blockchain, previously seen with both the Blockstream Satellite and in the works of Nick Szabo and Elaine Ou. Not only does it provide more versatility to those wishing to avoid using censored systems, but it opens up a slew of use cases for Bitcoin in regions with less-developed infrastructures and those affected by natural disasters.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Bitcoin's market value was about $150.1 billion.\n\"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement.\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions. Industry critics say the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering.\nLast month, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked Gemini and 12 other cryptocurrency trading platforms to provide details about their operations and safety measures.\nZcash incorporates the technology \"zk-snark,\" short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, which lets people trade with each other in anonymity.\nGemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later.\n\"We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,\" Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo's office.\nThe Winklevosses, who are 36-year-old twins, in 2008 reached a $65 million settlement with Facebook Inc and founder Mark Zuckerberg over who had the idea for the social media website.\nThey also competed in the men's rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan stempel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria vullo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zcash", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gemini trust co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of financial services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T21:18:10.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f113be19841fca7519cb36d36c47584b35a8050", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3xITBEDTfR8Rj_kZWiZS9Q-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f113be19841fca7519cb36d36c47584b35a8050", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS3xITBEDTfR8Rj_kZWiZS9Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite your friends now to grow your network rapidly.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

How can one deny access to an essential service when I am not doing anything illegal? You have not declared VCs (virtual currencies) illegal in the country,” said one of the petitioners requesting anonymity.\nA mail sent to RBI seeking comment remained unanswered.\nThe RBI on April 6 directed banks, e-wallets and payment gateway providers to withdraw support for cryptocurrency exchanges and other businesses dealing with virtual currencies in India.

Foremost among them is a plan to open a “Blockchain Center” that will both promote public awareness of the technology and facilitate conversations among industry stakeholders.\nA key topic of the center’s conversations will be making the regulatory environment more attractive to innovative businesses – which will inevitably mean examining New York State’s BitLicense regulations, widely blamed for driving away startups since they took effect in 2015.\nThe NYCEDC also announced a competition, expected to launch in late 2018, intended to generate ideas for improving municipal services with blockchain tech. As a first step, the agency will issue a request for proposals (RFP) from organizations that want to run the contest.\nKicking off its charm offensive, over the weekend the NYCEDC, along with the non-profit GrowNYC and CoinDesk, co-sponsored a hackathon in Times Square where developers worked to come up with blockchain-based solutions for tracking the food supply chain for farmers markets around the city.\nLast but not least, the agency is co-sponsoring Blockchain Week with CoinDesk. Underscoring the NYCEDC’s motivation, the series of events around town will include a free job fair Wednesday at the New York Hilton Midtown, the venue for Consensus 2018.\nKaren Bhatia, a vice president at the agency, said it sees the city’s major industries – finance, healthcare, media and real estate – as potential beneficiaries of blockchain.\n“We’ve been looking into blockchain for probably close to a year now. We’ve been monitoring it,” Bhatia told CoinDesk. And while New York already boasts more blockchain job openings than Silicon Valley , according to analytics firm Burning Glass, she added:\n“We saw an opportunity to be at the forefront of experimentation in blockchain as sustaining more of a foothold.” A strategic industry\nTaken together, these moves signal that the NYCEDC views fostering blockchain activity as a strategic play that can create thousands of jobs for New York. The NYCEDC is the city’s official economic development corporation, and its board members are appointed by the mayor and other senior leaders.\nFor the Blockchain Center, the NYCEDC will provide $100,000 in seed funding for the first year “as a pilot test, to see what the learnings are,” Bhatia said, though she expects additional funding to be available as needed from private sources, given the amount of investment in the sector overall.\n“Funding is not really the biggest issue when it comes to blockchain,” she said.\nThe plan is for the center to have a full-time staff, she said, though the NYCEDC is not yet sure how big it will be. The agency is looking at several potential locations, including a city-owned property at South Street Seaport.\nIdeally, the center will have street frontage and be open to passersby, Bhatia explained.\n“The goal of this is to be a community center where people can walk in and learn more about what blockchain is, both the public as well as people who are working on new ventures and want some sort of a roadmap for how they should proceed,” she said. Elephant in the room\nYet the center will also likely play host to some heated discussions since another of its express goals is to get entrepreneurs and regulators to – in Bhatia’s words –“sit down and have a real discussion about how these regulations are affecting innovation and entrepreneurship in New York City.”\nWhile federal regulators will be invited to take part, so will the New York State Department of Financial Services, which created the BitLicense.\nBhatia noted that the NYCEDC took part in a February roundtable hosted by two state senators on revisiting the controversial regulation .\nAnd though the NYCEDC recognizes the need for regulations to protect consumers, the center will look for ways to do that without squelching startups, Bhatia said, concluding:\n“We’re very well aware that the regulations are affecting blockchain companies here in New York.”\nFrom center: New York City Mayor Bill DiBlasio, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen and NYCEDC President James Patchett.

The study explains when users switch between these types of addresses anonymity is degraded. The team concludes that while Zcash transactions can be private, it’s also possible to diminish privacy if certain usage patterns are chosen by the Zcash user.\nAlso Read: Israel Tax Authority Hunts for Bitcoin Traders on Social Media Researchers from London Publish a Paper That Reveals It is Possible to Shrink the Zcash Anonymity Set\nA group of researchers have found Zcash anonymity can be degraded through certain usage patterns. Sarah Meiklejohn, Mary Maller, George Kappos, and Haaroon Yousaf from University College London published a paper called “ An Empirical Analysis of Anonymity in Zcash ” which finds certain patterns of Zcash use can “shrink” the cryptocurrency’s anonymity set. Essentially Zcash transactions can be used in a private manner (shielded) and a completely transparent (unshielded) manner. Users that move their Zcash back and forth between unshielded and shielded may be losing quite a bit of the anonymity they desire.\n“We investigate all facets of anonymity in Zcash’s transactions, ranging from its transparent transactions to the interactions with and within its main privacy feature, a shielded pool that acts as the anonymity set for users wishing to spend coins privately,” explains the researchers’ paper.\nWe conclude that while it is possible to use Zcash in a private way, it is also possible to shrink its anonymity set considerably by developing simple heuristics based on identifiable patterns of usage. Zcash Founder Responds Calling the Paper ‘Insightful’ and Recommends Users ‘Store Zcash in a Shielded Address’ Zooko Wilcox.\nThe researchers conclude that ultimately in order for Zcash to fully preserve its anonymity set is to “require all transactions to take place within the shielded pool.” Otherwise, the study emphasizes the Zcash network must significantly expand the usage of the shielded pool. On May 8 the founder of Zcash, Zooko Wilcox, and the team’s marketing director, Josh Swihart, responded to the research and called it an “insightful new paper.” Further, the Zcash team members explained another analysis was released a few months ago with similar findings.\n“This research demonstrates different ways to pierce the veil of your privacy if you, or the people that you transact with, move money from a transparent address to a shielded address and then move some of that money back to a different transparent address — Similar analysis was released several months ago — However, this research includes new techniques that can heuristically link patterns of ‘unshielded to shielded to unshielded’ transactions,” explains the response from Swihart and Wilcox.\nIt is valuable to understand how much privacy is lost when using shielded addresses as a pass-through mechanism, but using it in that way is not recommended — Instead, store your Zcash in a shielded address. When paying someone, send Zcash from your shielded address to their shielded address — If Zcash is transacted in this way, the results of this paper do not apply and transaction privacy is maintained.\nUsers of Zcash on social media and forums like r/ZEC didn’t seem too phased about the paper published by the University College London researchers. One Zcash user writes on May 11, “I have read the original paper, I don’t think it will make a difference when all transactions are shielded, which is where we are headed to anyway — Furthermore, nobody is stopping anyone from using multiple shielded addresses now.”\nWhat do you think about the paper released about Zcash from the researchers at the University College London?

May 14 Millennials find it easy to invest in Bitcoin than in stocks Millennials find it easy to invest in Bitcoin than in stocks In 2017, Bitcoin nearly reached a peak value of $20,000 but still remains extremely volatile. In recent days the value of Bitcoin fell below $6000 which scraped more than $100 billion in valuation since February. The overall cryptoasset market has not fared any better and plunged more than 50 percent since early January. However, even after the extreme volatility of cryptoassets, some millennials are more comfortable putting money in the cryptoasset market rather than the stock market. What is the reason behind that? Why do millennials regard the stock market with skepticism? The willingness to invest in the cryptoasset market even after knowledge of its volatility is linked with the 2008 financial crisis and the stock market crash. Studies show that people between the ages of 18 and 39 are more reluctant to investing in the stock market compared to other generations. Many of them saw 50% or more money getting wiped off from their parents or older siblings. According to a survey of U.S. adults conducted by Bankrate, millennials prefer real estate, cash, and even gold ahead of stocks. Only 33% of the millennials invest in the stock market compared to 51% of their older generation. Bitcoin and other cryptoassets were created after the 2008 financial crisis. Moreover, these cryptoassets don’t rely on big banks. Bitcoin’s decentralized system brings with it a new hope for a new economy. Millennials have a troublesome trend of spending big, even if they lack the financial support. The ever-increasing exposure to media, which encourages them to find fulfillment in clothes, entertainment and other luxuries is a primary reason. Millennials seem to have different goals — they value experiences more than their previous generations. That’s why, millennials are more likely to spend on a vacation than their parents. Considering the variety of items in their shopping list, they tend to look towards cryptoassets as an instrument of investment. Regardless of the reason for their interest in cryptoasset, millennials are indisputably crucial to the survival of blockchains. With bitcoin viewed as digital gold, it is far from the mainstream finance. No wonder millennials prefer cryptoassets which keeps them away from the Wall Street. The recklessness of some cryptoasset fans Some cryptoasset fans believe that bitcoin is the ideal investment choice just because it is hot right now. Andrea Coombes, retirement and investing specialist at personal finance resource Nerdwallet said , “This (trend) is pretty concerning,” she said. “If you want to spend money to play with cryptoasset, by all means, go ahead, but make sure it’s money you are willing to lose.” The tales of people getting rich quickly by investing in bitcoins has tempted many cryptoasset fans to invest in them. The trend Still, millennials are more than willing to invest in cryptoassets as account opening is easy and cheap. The barrier to entry is thus broken down. Apps like Acrons target millennials who are willing to invest in cryptoassets with small amounts of money. As the Dow has tumbled more than 1,000 points, many investors have been dealing in cryptoassets during the first week of February. Many millennials have never invested a single dollar in the stock market but are spending weeks researching cryptoassets. One such example is New York-based public relations associate Carissa Hilliard. She invested $100 in cryptoassets but never purchased even a single stock. “I’ve always wanted to invest but it seemed like you needed to have an extensive background in it to do well,” she said. “With crypto, I felt it evened the playing field more because it was new.” Also Read: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "blocked unblock follow following india's leading bitcoin company", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T23:32:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ed6c61355186bf94eb9a1069f0a261175db9b24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp4hoa_976C3MMMlc57iecc83aqAqSuWc6epTofACI4EDT2THrpFzzfTgvk8tPAJGS8FEr6QKzw--", "site_full": "www.xinhuanet.com", "site": "xinhuanet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe orders banks not to offer service to Bitcoin dealers - Xinhua | English.news.cn", "title_full": "Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe orders banks not to offer service to Bitcoin dealers - Xinhua | English.news.cn", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ed6c61355186bf94eb9a1069f0a261175db9b24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp4hoa_976C3MMMlc57iecc83aqAqSuWc6epTofACI4EDT2THrpFzzfTgvk8tPAJGS8FEr6QKzw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe orders banks not to offer service to Bitcoin dealers - Xinhua | English.news.cn", "text": "Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe orders banks not to offer service to Bitcoin dealers Source: Xinhua 2018-05-14 17:39:49\nHARARE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has directed all banking institutions not to provide banking services to facilitate anyone dealing with or settling virtual currencies and once again warned the public against trading in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin saying that they risked losing their investments.\nIn a statement, RBZ said the move was taken to safeguard the integrity and soundness of the country's financial system and to protect the public in general.\nIt said dealers and investors in any kind of cryptocurrency in Zimbabwe were not protected by law and that virtual currencies were traded in exchange platforms that were unregulated the world over.\n\"The opacity and pseudonymous nature of virtual currencies resents regulatory concerns due to the potential risks to the public and financial stability. The nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes them the currency of choice for money launderers and other criminals, seriously undermining global efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism,\" the central bank said.\nMany Zimbabweans are trading in cryptocurrencies which have given them quick yields, but RBZ also warned that anonymity surrounding deals made it difficult for law enforcement agencies to trace transactions.\nIt added that any instrument or platform that resulted in the flow of foreign currency or value into and out of the country or between residents and non-residents was subject to approval in terms of the law.\n\"The anonymity of transactions in respect of virtual currencies has the potential to result in exchange control circumvention as the transfer would not be effected and reported by an authorized dealer in foreign exchange,\" it said.\nA local company recently introduced an ATM in Harare which it said would be loaded with U.S. dollars and would be used to transact Bitcoins.\nThe central bank said it would continue monitoring regional and global cryptocurrency development in order to inform policy direction.\nBut in the mean time, the bank has urged the public to stay away from the virtual currencies.\n\"Any person who buys, sells or otherwise transacts in cryptocurrencies, whether online, or otherwise, does so at their own risk and will have no recourse to the Reserve Bank or to any regulatory authority in the country,\" it said.

By continuing to put in mid-term lower highs and lower lows. BTC officially sought out 8400 support, which it has in recent hours broken as well to seek 8k – the area given as a Rogue* Wave pivot point since last week.\nBTC hourly continues to sit in the overbought zone in which stochastic levels sit in the volatile less than 20 area. This usually brings bearish price movement along with it(or on any time scale). Considering the daily chart is in this zone as well, even with a cross to the upside, this is a bearish sign. However, all of this could be cancelled out with the close above 8400 for Bitcoin , which would hold as strong support. However, right now, it has yet to do so and struggles to maintain the climb.\nAs pressure mounts to test the 8k level, it must be noted that according to the current Rogue* Wave, there is a likely scenario in which BTC actually seeks to test the 7800 area. This was an area that was rigorously tested in mid-April.\nThe tech specs show how this could occur, especially when looking at the 4-hour scale.

On the one hand, the rapid growth of IT-technologies has made our life much easier and more convenient than even 10 years ago, on the other — has complicated it. Paradox? Not at all. Let’s look at the screen of your smartphone and say how many messengers are installed in it? Three, four, or all five? What about social media? Today, it is the order of the day to have several active accounts for the simple reason that one social network is more convenient to communicate with friends, the other one — with colleagues, the third one has a lot of interesting content and the fourth — free games and so on. As a result, we need to operate 15–20 applications several times a day. Some time ago smartphones made a rapid revolution in the mobile market due to the fact that they offered an innovative technology “All-in-one”. Conservative users, of course, said that the quality of the photos of the smartphone and of any digital camera didn’t go into any comparison, that the size of the screen of smartphones didn’t allow full use of the Internet and text editors, etc.We are all well aware of the finale of this story. Digital cameras are popular only among enthusiasts and professionals. Smartphone screens have reached such a size that no one remembers about tablets, and the power characteristics and functionality of mobile devices today are at such a level that they are able to solve a variety of problems, doing great even without desktop computers, and without laptops. The unique Russian IT-project BUZCOIN is preparing for exactly the same revolution. BUZCOIN project combines two the most popular destinations among users. The first is BUZAR p2p communication platform, where the holders of BUZCOIN tokens will be able to use both the messenger and the social network. Even at the stage of development the platform included a functionality that allowed to share photos, videos and audio files, use video hosting and music service, where it was possible not only to listen to music but download the songs of popular authors, post your own works on the platform on a reimbursable basis, receiving remuneration from BUZAR. The second part of the project BUZCOIN is a universal super-marketplace of goods and services. The developers say that users will have access to services for the purchase and sale of goods, Bulletin Board, services for rental and sale of real estate, job search, etc. Thus, BUZCOIN offers the market a functionality which is interesting both for ordinary users and for representatives of the business community.Within the framework of the P2P platform BUZAR will the unit more than 20 different functions, for the use of which nowadays it is necessary to download a separate application for each of the functions. The developers of BUZCOIN project suggest not to do this, and press just one button. It is interesting that now the creators of the project BUZCOIN declare that the stated functionality in any case will not be final. In the team’s plans is to create a completely new web site where everyone will be able to find everything, which means an infinite extension of the platform’s functionality. The decision on which next task to start working first of all will be taken on the basis of a special vote, in which anyone can offer the project new functions, express their views about the features of the project and contribute to the development of the global platform of the new generation.

Originally the program was launched just for BTC, but now GMO has gone further and added Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP) to the mix.\nGMO’s service enables users to rent out virtual currencies so that one can eventually receive a rental fee according to the quantity of lent virtual currency, according to the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. Interested customers can apply between May 9 and 23 and if there are more applicants than required, the company will use lots to determine whom to borrow from.\nCustomers can lend between 100 and 1,000 ETH, 50 and 500 BCH, 300 and 3,000 LTC, and between 100,000 and 1,000,000 XRP. Maturity time is 150 days with borrowed cryptocurrencies returned to customers in the original amounts and types at maturity. There is also a complex system of exchange rates for loan interest, which is quite attractive and rounds up to about 5%. Taxes will also be applied to loan fees.\nGMO Coin is a licensed cryptocurrency exchange in Japan . Recently, however, the exchange was slapped with a business improvement order from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA), which has been tightening its inspection of crypto exchanges following the much maligned Coincheck hack in January. The other exchange which received a similar order to tighten up its act was Tech Bureau, which operates the Zaif Exchange.\nSince the January incident, all cryptocurrencies received a terrible beating declining by 70% in some cases.Recent months have seen a slight recovery with around 30% recovered, although currencies are still way back from their all-time highs.\nGMO’s financials are not that rosy either with an operating loss of around $7 million in the first quarter of 2018. Operating costs rose by around $5.1 million when compared with the previous quarter. Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.

Goldman Sachs becomes the first regulated financial institution to offer such a service. Part of the reason the firm decided to go this route is due to the several inquiries they received from hedge funds, foundations, and endowments which had received donations from Bitcoin millionaires. Goldman Sachs cosign of Bitcoin according to many crypto experts will increase confidence in the digital currency.\nThe legitimacy bar for digital currencies has been raised now that Goldman Sachs is going to facilitate the institutional trading of Bitcoin. They’re proceeding cautiously and will not trade actual Bitcoin initially. Instead, the bank will use its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts for clients. It will also trade non-deliverable forward futures where trades will be settled in the regulated currency it is quoted in.\nBitcoin had been on a rebound the past couple of months. Interest in the currency increased over the course of 2017, which also caused volatility to skyrocket. The price of the digital currency topped to $20000 which was triple its value in the second half of last year before dropping to $8,000 in February of 2018.\nThe cryptocurrency traded as high as $9,300 before South Korean officials raided South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, sending prices as low as $8,200.\nWhile Goldman Sachs dips its toes in the cryptocurrency markets, CultureBanx found BitMEX is way ahead of the game. CEO Arthur Hayes helms this leading cryptocurrency derivative exchange. The company offers derivative products to retail investors and has a daily trading volume approaching $3 billion. BitMEX made $21 million in revenue during January of this year and posted a revenue of $83 million in 2017. The company is on track to exceed its 2018 performance.\nHayes said to Bloomberg:\n“This is the best thing you could ever have. We make more money when the market goes down. We love this volatility.”\nAs institutional investors engage in these derivatives, they’ll be looking to ease their cautiousness by having a reliable benchmark for their performance. Goldman Sachs alumnus and billionaire cryptocurrency advocate Mike Novogratz announced a partnership with Bloomberg to launch the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index. It will track the performance of the 10 most liquid cryptocurrencies.\nNovogratz told Business Insider:\n“This is just one more building block in the foundation which will get, at one point, pension funds and family offices and sovereign wealth funds all participating in the crypto economy.”\nBitcoin had a rough start to the year and suffered a major loss during the first quarter causing the price to plummet down 48%. Hayes noted we should be on the lookout for increased volatility in Bitcoin prices as more players enter the derivatives market for the cryptocurrency.\nHayes said on the Flux Podcast:\n“People have been lulled into complacency with a market that keeps going up every day.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:33:45.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "228f5202141976441dae07b41a3fa52993e32f32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA5eJrrkpcQUJmFbbQ8QjDAfEbrmSchHu1kFklpdTx3Cw9BhAAjmGFy3ZKyHEVooo7VM0.ZYOdRIiMwiYmI8nvGdtgGPF3vZ1IHfEA5bd39SFg--", "site_full": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Samourai and goTenna Enable Bitcoin Transactions Without Internet ...", "title_full": "Samourai and goTenna Enable Bitcoin Transactions Without Internet ...", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/extenna.max-800x800.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 78582, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "228f5202141976441dae07b41a3fa52993e32f32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA5eJrrkpcQUJmFbbQ8QjDAfEbrmSchHu1kFklpdTx3Cw9BhAAjmGFy3ZKyHEVooo7VM0.ZYOdRIiMwiYmI8nvGdtgGPF3vZ1IHfEA5bd39SFg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matthew Breen", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Samourai and goTenna Enable Bitcoin Transactions Without Internet ...", "text": "by Matthew Breen 05.14.18 3:53 PM\nSamourai Wallet is collaborating with goTenna , a Brooklyn-based company specializing in off-grid communications, to produce txTenna, an Android app that combines mesh networking with Bitcoin transactions. The app will allow users to pair their phones with goTenna’s portable antennas in order to broadcast transactions.\ngoTenna produces consumer-grade hardware to facilitate mesh networking — a concept that echoes much of the decentralization ethos that we see across the cryptocurrency domain — which operates by allowing peers to connect directly to one another for the purpose of routing packets, sidestepping the need to rely on an ISP or cell tower.\n“What will happen when these massive centralized networks fail due to natural disasters, as they did after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, or due to some kind of outside cybersecurity attack? What will happen when providers decide to crank up prices just because they can?” said Rich Myers, goTenna’s Decentralized Applications Engineer.\n“Mesh networks are the only legitimate alternative to these traditional centralized communication networks. They are completely decentralized and democratized, leaving the power of communication in the hands of the people. Beyond that, they are much more resilient to unforeseen disasters — the only thing these networks need to function is a mesh networking device paired with a smartphone.”\nFor its part, Samourai Wallet has been focusing on censorship resistance and privacy-oriented tools since it began in 2015. With features such as direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets, it has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions.\nSamourai has been curating Mule.tools , an R&D initiative to further reinforce the censorship-resistant properties of the Bitcoin blockchain and also published the code for Pony Direct , a proof-of-concept app for broadcasting transactions over SMS in January.\n“We believe one of the most fundamental value propositions that bitcoin provides is censorship resistance,” SW, the CEO of Samourai, told Bitcoin Magazine . “The freedom to transact freely and without permission is not a freedom to take lightly, or give up without a fight. We saw the open internet transform into a walled garden, captured by regulatory and corporate interest working together — and largely aided by red-herrings like ‘net-neutrality.’\n“The tools we are building arm the little guy — the individual — with the tools they need to level the playing field against the inevitable overstepping of bounds by hostile actors, oppressive regimes and overzealous governments,” said SW. “We're making some material changes to Samourai Wallet to allow for a greater high latency and offline experience. In conjunction with the release of txTenna, Samourai Wallet users will be able to theoretically keep their phone offline at all times and still be able to send and receive payments with minimal hassle.”\nThe concept explored by txTenna follows in the path of alternate methods to access the blockchain, previously seen with both the Blockstream Satellite and in the works of Nick Szabo and Elaine Ou. Not only does it provide more versatility to those wishing to avoid using censored systems, but it opens up a slew of use cases for Bitcoin in regions with less-developed infrastructures and those affected by natural disasters.

Nouri declined to disclose how much the crypto exchange had paid, but said a rental like that typically goes for around $1,000.\nThe flashy cars that symbolize conspicuous consumption among Bitcoin true-believers had caused a stir earlier as they roared through the streets near the hotel. Another stunt came from an upstart mining company called Genesis Mining. The firm hired actors to portray aggrieved bankers who will lose their financial services jobs when blockchain takes over the industry.\nThe gimmicks show that the hype that surrounded Bitcoin as it burst on the mainstream last year remains alive and well even after the biggest digital coin fell more than 50 percent from its December peak of almost $20,000.\nGenesis said the protest was a “fun way” to show how crytpo can upend banking “if they fail to adapt to the new world we live in,” according to a blog post on its website.\nA hundred feet away, MK Li stood in front of the revolving hotel doors with a sign that read “Help a fellow VC to pay for this expensive conference!” Sporting a pink button-down shirt with a purple bowtie, the conference goer was accepting donations in digital tokens -- a way to protest the hefty price he’d paid for a conference about a technology that was meant to eliminate the need for expensive middlemen.\nTicket prices ranged from from $1,499 to $2,999, suggesting that organizer CoinDesk Inc. raked in at least $12.8 million in revenue from admissions alone. There are also more than 100 sponsors such as IBM, SAP and Microsoft Corp.\nInside the hotel, several floors up, one peeved attendee said to another, “How is this not a fire-code violation?’’ The two stood in the doorway of a packed ballroom, straining their necks to get a glimpse of a presentation about Cryptogaphic Innovations.\nThe hype is real at Consensus, the biggest of about two dozen events that make up “Blockchain Week.’’ So far, the conference — which is expected to bring in more than 8,000 people this year — has featured flannels, business suits, cowboy hats and dreadlocks amid a standing-room only sea of crypto and blockchain enthusiasts.\nSima Baktas, who works for a blockchain startup in Istanbul, sported a T-shirt that said “Satoshi is Female,’’ -- a reference to the mysterious and still-unknown author of the original Bitcoin whitepaper.

This part of its design, which ensures that it will always be scarce, made it an attractive store of wealth, like gold, and so investors started buying it up which led to the price surge of 2017.\nNow that institutional money is demanding it’s piece of Bitcoin those same Wall Street stalwarts that were name calling only a few months ago are moving into the space. Starting in December 2017, the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets began trading in Bitcoin futures. JP Morgan Chase followed suit earlier this month opening the first Wall Street desk to deal in digital assets, and even the New York Stock Exchange has announced it will ‘setting up an online platform for buying and holding bitcoin.’\nHaving the same institutions that created the 2008 financial meltdown moving in and inevitably dominating the cryptocurrency space is as close to inviting a fox to guard the henhouse as possible. As the banks heavily influence the still developing regulatory aspects of crypto, such as anonymity and decentralization, which made it attractive to free thinkers in the first place they may well disappear. The Potential of Blockchain Technology\nWhat can’t be tampered with though is the potential of the blockchain to keep the egalitarian spirit, with which Bitcoin was conceived, alive. As it is described in Don and Alex Tapscott’s book, Blockchain Revolution , a blockchain ‘is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.’\nThe take away from that description is, ‘not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value .’ Naturally, that ability will be used by corporations to maximize profitability but it is also already being used in developing countries to establish land titles , create energy sharing banks, distribute potable water, and track working conditions of the most exploited laborers.\nBlockchain technology still has the potential of fulfilling the aspirations of Satochi and the early adaptors of Bitcoin to have a network of decentralized, trustworthy transactions, working outside of the reach of greed and ignorance to make people live better.
