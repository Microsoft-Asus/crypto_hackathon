BTC\\/USD may trade in a range above $8,200 before the next move. \\n Bitcoin Price Analysis \\n\nAfter forming a base around the $8,080 , bitcoin price started an upside recovery against the US Dollar. The BTC\\/USD pair managed to move above the $8,200 resistance level to post intraday gains. It also broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low. There were a few positive signs above the $8,200 level, but the price struggled to break a major barrier at $8,500. \\n\nThe 100 hourly simple moving average at $8,500 prevented gains . There were two attempts by buyers to break the stated $8,500 resistance, but they failed. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low also acted as a resistance. It seems like there is a breakout pattern forming with resistance near $8,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. The pair is currently declining and testing the triangle support at $8,200. Should it break the triangle support, there could be a downside move towards the $8,080 low. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly struggling near $8,500. A proper break above this is needed for a push towards the $8,750 level. On the flip side, the $8,080 low is a decent support followed by the $8,000 handle. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is moving back in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI has moved back below the 50 level. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $8,080 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $8,500 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC\\/USD Struggling Near $8,500 appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:57:45.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3455ec24d9f58434c7b29e0f236792e84a6edb2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYCCtQ8R07Pfo5f2WFiS51GeQ9UgeF4fdYqQm2awCARp1L6nnpz_mPQY", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "Bitcoin Nears Six-Day Low; OECD Explores Crypto", "title_full": "Bitcoin Nears Six-Day Low; OECD Explores Crypto", "published": "2018-05-17T23:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I.93hzSrEDEl_sGC2sX98A--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/investing_com_631/f575e27abe3d87f311a3b00ab56344fe", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e3455ec24d9f58434c7b29e0f236792e84a6edb2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYCCtQ8R07Pfo5f2WFiS51GeQ9UgeF4fdYqQm2awCARp1L6nnpz_mPQY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investing.com", "published": "2018-05-17T23:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Nears Six-Day Low; OECD Explores Crypto", "text": "Bitcoin fell on Thursday.

But if it's something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we'll certainly support that,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Iran’s central bank is working towards using digital coins in international trade as a way to circumvent the use of the American dollar. With pending U.S. sanctions against the country, Iran is looking for ways around using the international banking payment system, known as SWIFT.\nRelated Articles\nSirin Labs Token (SRN) Added to Cryptopia\nEOS Technical Analysis: (EOS/BTC) Pre-mainnet Launch Support Beginning To Arrive After Whale Market Manipulation\nEOS Added to Komodo Barter DEX", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/eos-technical-analysis-eosbtc-premainnet-launch-support-beginning-to-arrive-after-whale-market-manipulation-1451706?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/eos-technical-analysis-eosbtc-premainnet-launch-support-beginning-to-arrive-after-whale-market-manipulation-1451706?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo_finance&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Fx.D7SiszTPWItVhQmR4Jg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjUwO2g9NDEw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/investing_com_631/f575e27abe3d87f311a3b00ab56344fe", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/eos-added-to-komodo-barter-dex-1451554?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/eos-added-to-komodo-barter-dex-1451554?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo_finance&quot;", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/sirin-labs-token-srn-added-to-cryptopia-1451788?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/sirin-labs-token-srn-added-to-cryptopia-1451788?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo_finance&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john rainey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elina sidorenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "organization of economic development and cooperation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T07:28:04.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2aac940a1dcc27dbdba7ba7ed39d47082015f7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcKP4Pcv2nrPJPlWxZEzpuzsRDQmfDJNWlwkbMcKn4ENWOQ7oF70Aw1ygHI6Ov0s0sO4VZ1I_U9Q5IfSf6IYFmHo-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Could a 9MB POISON PILL transaction on Bcash / Bitcoin Cash network create havoc for miners & exchanges?", "title_full": "Could a 9MB POISON PILL transaction on Bcash / Bitcoin Cash network create havoc for miners & exchanges? : btc", "published": "2018-05-17T23:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.049, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2aac940a1dcc27dbdba7ba7ed39d47082015f7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcKP4Pcv2nrPJPlWxZEzpuzsRDQmfDJNWlwkbMcKn4ENWOQ7oF70Aw1ygHI6Ov0s0sO4VZ1I_U9Q5IfSf6IYFmHo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jimhash", "published": "2018-05-17T23:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Could a 9MB POISON PILL transaction on Bcash / Bitcoin Cash network create havoc for miners & exchanges?", "text": "The Bcash chain didn't physically fork yet as no blocks > 8MB exist yet.

Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, anarcho-capitalists hailed it as the decentralized future of commerce.But as prices soared and the biggest names on Wall Street bought in, Bitcoin became mostly known as a speculative, unregulated investment. Think Beanie Babies, but you can also use them to buy drugs and engage in human trafficking. Bitcoin - Storyline - Horsepower - Currency - Quintillion Perhaps the most remarkable Bitcoin storyline recently has been just how much computational horsepower it takes to create the virtual currency: some 26 quintillion calculations per second. That adds up to tremendous energy bills.But it’s been tough to put exact numbers on Bitcoin’s massive energy consumption. Most estimates have been “back-of-the-envelope” type calculations. A study published Wednesday in the journal Joule attempts to change that. Economist and digital currency expert Alex de Vries applied traditional economics to better understand Bitcoin’s current and future energy consumption. Results - Bitcoin - Electricity - Ireland - Bitcoin His results are staggering: Bitcoin uses roughly as much electricity annually as Ireland. And just one Bitcoin transaction requires as much electricity as an average household in his native Netherlands uses in a month.Projecting forward, the power drain becomes even more alarming. By year’s end, Bitcoin could consume as much electricity as Austria — or roughly one half of one percent of humanity’s total power needs. If the cryptocurrency’s price grows as some expect, it could eventually chew up 5 percent of global electricity. Electricity - Demand - Climate - Goals - De “This increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” says de Vries, who’s also the founder of Digiconomist, in a media release.Bitcoin’s intense energy consumption is baked into its design.

My confidence rises, as I believe they are very unlikely. – David Sep 1 '11 at 20:09 2 I agree. One piece of evidence is that they didn't do similar things to bitorrent and haven't been effective against Wikileaks or against encryption when it first came out. Of course, the conspiracy theory would be that Bitcoin could be different because it could threaten the federal reserve, the banking elites, and the financial world order. I would argue that while Bittorent never did that, PGP and Wikileaks were similar threats and efforts on those were ineffective and didn't involve mysterious disappearances. – David Schwartz Sep 1 '11 at 20:10 1 I don't see how your second claim follows from your first. Of course each situation is different, but all of these situations show us exactly how far the government is willing to go to respond to a threat. – David Schwartz Oct 15 '11 at 5:58 1 @DavidSchwartz I agree with eldentyrell that Bitcoin is somewhat unique. Shutting down bittorrent is very difficult and likely impossible (would still exist outside the US). Strong encryption can't be broken by governments not due to a lack of will (if CIA or NSA could break strong encryption and read any cipher text as plain text I am sure they would) but because it is strongly built and may also be impossible to break. Bitcoin could represent a larger target simply because it is achievable. A 51% attack may never be economically viable but that hasn't stated governments in the past. – DeathAndTaxes Oct 19 '11 at 13:36 2 Old post, but fascinating question nonetheless, and great answer (as usual) by David Schwartz. Out of curiosity, I did a 'back of the envelope' calculation to see how much it would cost to amass enough computational power to pull off a 51% attack like David Schwartz describes. Today's hash rates for the entire bitcoin network are around 600,000,000 GH/s. Mining hardware that can do 4700 GH/s can be had for ~$2500. So, $320M could purchase enough hardware to match the current hash rates for the entire network. Not much for most sovereign nations (or well-funded terrorist groups). – mti2935 Dec 10 '15 at 17:24 up vote 10 down vote\nMy predictions are they cannot close it down, but they can undermine confidence by: accepting anti-Bitcoin law, closing exchanges, closing Bitcoin businesses (according to law), infiltrating Bitcoin client developers, attacking the network (this is very extreme, low probability of happening).\nBy publicly attacking Bitcoin, they would feel the heat from people. Governments around the world are currently loosing support on every step they make and this would be no exception.\nEdit: they CAN close it down by shutting down the internet (most extreme, government would most probably fall as a result)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wikileaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bittorent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david schwartz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david sep", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pgp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:17:52.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26442bda0502bb218bc3608451a5016d2a7621c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNGuw8.RdcXJks6_1Y4zxnIvJZ8FWOQif7AVQTMwHRssjtTIJ_fwnaMAH_4YoGdrQJ3P8d7E7xUXwSavSvGMWkns-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin price found support above", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin price found support above", "published": "2018-05-17T23:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.185, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26442bda0502bb218bc3608451a5016d2a7621c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNGuw8.RdcXJks6_1Y4zxnIvJZ8FWOQif7AVQTMwHRssjtTIJ_fwnaMAH_4YoGdrQJ3P8d7E7xUXwSavSvGMWkns-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-17T23:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin price found support above", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin price found support above $8,000 and recovered nicely against the US Dollar. \\n There is a breakout pattern forming with resistance near $8,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair has to move above the $8,500 resistance the 100 hourly simple moving average to gain momentum. \\n \\n\nBitcoin price is struggling to break the $8,500 resistance against the US Dollar.

The BTC\\/USD pair managed to move above the $8,200 resistance level to post intraday gains. It also broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low. There were a few positive signs above the $8,200 level, but the price struggled to break a major barrier at $8,500. \\n\nThe 100 hourly simple moving average at $8,500 prevented gains . There were two attempts by buyers to break the stated $8,500 resistance, but they failed. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low also acted as a resistance. It seems like there is a breakout pattern forming with resistance near $8,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. The pair is currently declining and testing the triangle support at $8,200. Should it break the triangle support, there could be a downside move towards the $8,080 low. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly struggling near $8,500. A proper break above this is needed for a push towards the $8,750 level.

This means that the downtrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. In addition, the 200 SMA lines up with the pattern’s neckline to add to its strength as a ceiling. If it holds, another bottom could be formed. \\n\nRSI is on the move up to indicate that buyers have enough energy to push for more gains, but the oscillator is also nearing overbought levels to reflect exhaustion. Stochastic is also heading north but could be due to turn back down form overbought levels soon, so bitcoin price might follow suit. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nInvestors continue to hold out for positive updates in the industry but until those come out, caution has prevailed after bitcoin price was rejected at one resistance level after another. Traders are also keeping close tabs on the investigation into South Korea’s largest crypto exchange as this revives issues on regulation and security. \\n\nIn contrast, the dollar has been firmly supported by stronger rate hike hopes, particularly for the Fed meeting in June. Although some data points have fallen short of estimates, traders are paying closer attention to positive figures on inflation and shrugging off downbeat remarks from FOMC members. \\n\nLooking ahead, it could be all about market sentiment from here as a week without industry developments could draw more sellers in. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Eyes on This Classic Reversal Pattern ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:43:10.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40ccf81eae4ac8e3bc71c9d62246dbae30aec90b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNHPyoF_OSTUg0YshIiob_nUOFqbrYEGbVrgRaCKuQ5THlO8Pu2oMfUIV5uz9ytKVAilx3MdpbQJ6mLWq0322nPnnsjDduXy0sQ--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price found support", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price found support", "published": "2018-05-17T23:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.289, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40ccf81eae4ac8e3bc71c9d62246dbae30aec90b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNHPyoF_OSTUg0YshIiob_nUOFqbrYEGbVrgRaCKuQ5THlO8Pu2oMfUIV5uz9ytKVAilx3MdpbQJ6mLWq0322nPnnsjDduXy0sQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-17T23:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price found support", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price found support near the $1,220 level and recovered slightly against the US Dollar. \\n There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,340 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair is facing many hurdles on the upside near $1,340 and $1,350 resistance levels. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price is slowly recovering from $1,220 against the US Dollar.

Dorsey sat down with Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 conference in New York City to talk more broadly about his company’s goals for the digital currency.\n“I’m just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin,” said Dorsey said during Wednesday’s fireside chat, adding:\n“I hope it will be bitcoin. I’m a huge fan.”\nDorsey admits the idea that bitcoin will someday be the basis for all payments made on the Internet remains a topic of debate at Square.\n“We’ve led with that mindset. But there’s still a lot of skepticism and a lot of debate and a lot of fights. But that’s where the magic happens, where creativity happens,” he explained.\nDespite the controversy, Dorsey argues that the vision of open access that bitcoin inspires is fundamental to the role Square has always played in the payments industry. “Any payment that comes across our table, the seller should be able to accept,” he remarked.\nWhen Dorsey first began contemplating how to implement bitcoin payments into the Square platform with Mike Brock, an engineer at the company, the two initially settled on a goal that was grandiose in its simplicity.\nEither one of them, he reasoned, should be able to walk over to the Blue Bottle across the street and buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin without the transaction looking any different than a regular dollar-denominated payment, perhaps without the cashier even knowing that bitcoin was being used.\nAccording to Dorsey, the team had a working solution within a week.\n“It felt amazing. It felt electric. And it felt like something we needed to explore a lot more,” he said. More work to come\nSquare has yet to build a full bitcoin payments solution for merchants and consumers, as it quickly changed direction to work on a buying-and-selling service to be integrated into its Cash App. But Dorsey said that the goal is same as it has always been.\n“We want to go back to that original idea of being able to purchase a coffee with it. And that’s why we’re working with [Lightning Labs],” said Dorsey. “Whatever it takes to get there, we’re going to make sure it happens.”\nDorsey – who counts himself as a fan of the hacker ethos surrounding bitcoin’s rise to fame – claimed that whatever path Square takes to pushing mass adoption of bitcoin payments, it will do so without threatening the openness of the network.\n“There’s so much openness in the community, and I want to make sure nothing in the corporate world threatens that,” he stated, going on to say:\n“We cannot risk hurting what made this possible to begin with … We can’t do any of this without the technology being strong and available for everyone.”\nPhoto by David Floyd for CoinDesk\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Source: YouTube\nGlobal Transactions Made Easy Dorsey pointed out that the employment of digital currency – bitcoin or otherwise – would facilitate many things, among them his company's entrance into new markets. Dorsey wants Square to lead the pack in establishing cryptocurrency as a globally accepted means of payment.\nAdamant that the internet will one day have a \"native currency,\" Dorsey is active in legitimizing virtual currency payments heading into the future. He also said that while he couldn't predict whether bitcoin will fill the role of default internet currency, he hoped that it should become so. \"I don't know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be,\" Dorsey said.\nDorsey is eyeing the benefits to his business of a future realm in which digital currencies are the default payment methodology, especially when transacting online. He is on record as a \"huge fan\" of bitcoin and as enamored of the underlying technology as millions of others. Speaking on the possibilities, he said that \"If we were able to use it a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we're in.\"\nThe Twitter chief outlined the now unnecessary issues faced when a company approached any new market on the back of fiat currencies. Local currency issues have to be factored into the approach at the outset, even before a local banking partner, compliance with local regulatory dictates and other necessities are resolved. In spite of jeering from some quarters , Square began offering users cryptocurrency trading via its Cash app in January 2018.\nIn the first quarter post-launch, Dorsey's payments processing company sold $34.1 million in bitcoin. Such was Dorsey's enthusiasm that he initially bought $33.9 million on bitcoin so that users found a fluid marketplace of trading when Square opened. Hence, the real net of the first quarter was around $200,000. That said, according to Nomura Instinet , Square's mobile app is beating PayPal's Venmo offer, growing faster because of its acceptance of bitcoin.\nDorsey The Bitcoin Bull Dorsey said in March 2018 that he felt confident that bitcoin would become a single, global currency over the coming decade. Dorsey is a bitcoin investor, trader, and enthusiast, carrying the original ethos of the cryptocurrency paying for life on a daily basis. When making his prediction in March, he added that the advent of a global bitcoin as default payment \"could go faster\" than ten years.\nStanley Druckenmiller, the celebrity investor, has along with some other commentators expressed skepticism over bitcoin.\nSpeaking to CNBC in December 2017, he said that bitcoin was a failed project because \"you can't do transactions, particularly retail transactions, with this kind of volatility.\"\nTrue as that might be, Druckenmiller may also have vested interests at play in rubbishing bitcoin, which is trading at $8,280.60 at the time of writing.\nThe post Twitter CEO Hopes Bitcoin to be the Internet's Native Currency appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "easy dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "youtube global transactions made", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:23:33.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28d27feff39c66b3ce59a3b1db8cdc9d67a85f5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wDT7RLkP1IBnEUqn8ZdTa1qkolu99LItfkZOQUvVTwY061wY03skShLcbJsvzn8_hslX1Xsu0_a5PnPjaimWWvOdvNo7ltUw-", "site_full": "www.ipostcity.com", "site": "ipostcity.com", "site_section": "http://www.ipostcity.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "No 1 Tech and Educational Blog", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet Keys (Cold Storage) from Air-Gapped PCs", "title_full": "Bitcoin Wallet Keys (Cold Storage) from Air-Gapped PCs", "published": "2018-05-17T23:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "28d27feff39c66b3ce59a3b1db8cdc9d67a85f5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9wDT7RLkP1IBnEUqn8ZdTa1qkolu99LItfkZOQUvVTwY061wY03skShLcbJsvzn8_hslX1Xsu0_a5PnPjaimWWvOdvNo7ltUw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ukeme Reuben (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T23:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet Keys (Cold Storage) from Air-Gapped PCs", "text": "Dr. Mordechai Guri, the head of R&D team at Israel's Ben Gurion University, who previously demonstrated various methods to steal data from an air-gapped computer, has now published new research named \"BeatCoin.\"\nBeatCoin is not a new hacking technique; instead, it's an experiment wherein the researcher demonstrates how all previously discovered out-of-band communication methods can be used to steal private keys for a cryptocurrency wallet installed on cold storage, preferably an air-gapped computer or Raspberry Pi.\nFor those unaware, keeping your cryptocurrency protected in a wallet on a device which is entirely offline is called cold storage. Since online digital wallets carry different security risks, some people prefer keeping their private keys offline.\nAir-gapped computers are those that are isolated from the Internet, local networks, Bluetooth and therefore, are believed to be the most secure devices and are difficult to infiltrate or exfiltrate.\nIf you are new to this topic, we recommend reading our previous articles, detailing how highly-motivated attackers can use specially designed malware to exfiltrate data from an air-gapped computer via light ,\nsound, heat , electromagnetic , magnetic , infrared, and\nultrasonic waves .\nFor BeatCoin experiment, Dr. Guri deployed malware on an air-gapped computer that runs a Bitcoin wallet application and then performed each attack vector one-by-one to transmit the wallet keys to a nearby device over covert channels.\n\"In the adversarial attack model, the attacker infiltrates the offline wallet, infecting it with malicious code,\" the paper [ PDF ] reads. \"The malware can be pre-installed or pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet, or it can infect the system when removable media (e.g., USB flash drive) is inserted into the wallet’s computer in order to sign a transaction. These attack vectors have repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade.\"\nResults shown in the above chart suggests\nAirHopper , MOSQUITO, and Ultrasonic techniques are the fastest way to transmit a 256-bit private key to a remote receiver, whereas, Diskfiltration and\nFansmitter methods take minutes.\nGuri has also shared two videos. The first one demonstrates exfiltration of private keys from an air-gapped computer, which hardly took a few seconds to transmit data to a nearby smartphone using ultrasonic waves.\nIn the second video, the researcher transmitted private keys stored on a Raspberry Pi device to the nearby smartphone using the RadIoT attack—a technique to exfiltrate data from air-gapped internet-of-things (IoT) and embedded devices via radio signals.\n\"The radio signals - generated from various buses and general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins of the embedded devices - can be modulated with binary data. In this case, the transmissions can be received by an AM or FM receiver located nearby the device.\"\nIn the last research published earlier this month, Guri’s team also demonstrated how hackers could use power fluctuations in the current flow \"propagated through the power lines\" to covertly exfiltrate highly sensitive data out of an air gapped-computer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin wallet keys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mordechai guri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ben gurion university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T02:36:00.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6f72caa93ad0bf4291308298ff5d7f3eec55ef8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTW0Dnd1jAoy5FKQGLIj_LIDH6YL9IOcL2IE9Tk_Bxlh2qapF42EdBobV9oeOgSq49D5IlsPfnPXo3rYLtAfU.oS8yYcEWXiwhtIBy633fnimlmexNG5fgLyCCvdPdh.Kj1iGBN.en50w--", "site_full": "stocksntrade.com", "site": "stocksntrade.com", "site_section": "http://stocksntrade.com/feed", "site_categories": ["society"], "section_title": "Stocks Trade", "title": "SENZ transforms crypto by giving institutions the ability to hedge bitcoin", "title_full": "SENZ transforms crypto by giving institutions the ability to hedge bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-17T23:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://stocksntrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-17-at-4.10.22-PM.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6f72caa93ad0bf4291308298ff5d7f3eec55ef8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTW0Dnd1jAoy5FKQGLIj_LIDH6YL9IOcL2IE9Tk_Bxlh2qapF42EdBobV9oeOgSq49D5IlsPfnPXo3rYLtAfU.oS8yYcEWXiwhtIBy633fnimlmexNG5fgLyCCvdPdh.Kj1iGBN.en50w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sandy Sue", "published": "2018-05-17T23:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "SENZ transforms crypto by giving institutions the ability to hedge bitcoin", "text": "SENZ transforms crypto by giving institutions the ability to hedge bitcoin share on: BITCOIN HAS NO FUNDAMENTAL PRICE TO FALL BACK ON\nWith the vertigo-inducing swings in the crypto markets year-to-date, institutional investors with strict bylaws guiding their mandates are desperate for new tools to manage the risk of their crypto assets, ways they’re accustomed to using in the $2 trillion securities hedging industry.\nThrough its veteran, strategic partner, SENZ exclusively markets a platform that enables it to hedge bitcoin.\nThis capability is intended to unlock institutional investment in crypto on a massive scale and provide the same portfolio management tools available to stock traders.\nYield Endurance’s unique platform applies proven risk mitigation solutions used extensively throughout securities lending to help unlock institutional crypto investment.

ACCESS TO BITCOIN SEEKING YIELD DRIVES SENZ GROWTH\nBecause of the predictability of the Yield Endurance model, scale is the critical driver, so the success of the business depends on their ability to continually attracted new bitcoin to loan out at a profit.\nLast month SENZ announced the acquisition of $5 million worth of bitcoin which gets loaned out to institutional bitcoin traders for a predictable, recurring and scalable ROI. VALUE OF YIELD ENDURANCE TO BITCOIN HOLDERS AND “HODLERS”\nBitcoin “hodler” – a misspelling of “holders” which seems to have stuck – those who are just simply forever “long” bitcoin, could be a primary market segment SENZ targets due to their desire to receive yield from their bitcoin positions without losing the long-term appreciation potential. LOW OVERHEAD, RECURRING REV AND CASHFLOW\nBecause of the automation possibilities for origination, accounting, and reporting, overhead is expected to be low and profit margin continually optimized with new process implementations. SECURITIES LENDING AND TRADING EXPERTISE DELIVERING YIELD FOR BITCOIN\nThe securities hedging market grew to over $2 trillion in 2017 according to financial market data provider DataLend , with the value of securities made available is over $16 trillion.\nEquities are attractive to institutional investors partially due to the widespread availability of efficient risk management tools in the form of stock loans used to short stocks. This is largely unavailable in the highly volatile crypto market.\nSENZ has shifted its primary business focus to providing services that allow investors to capitalize on cryptocurrency opportunities while benefiting from a level of security similar to that of the stock market where they can obtain borrowed stock in a bet that the price will decline.\nYield Endurance provides an efficient and diversified lending program that allows institutional investors access to tools routinely applied in equities markets.\nSENZ seems to have a model that provides for predictable cashflow from the spread earned from borrowing and re-lending stock that is scalable and reproducible across coin types.\nSENZ BITCOIN LENDING BUSINESS\nYield Endurance ( SENZ ) announcement of $5 million in bitcoin, a move intended to seed its unique ability to lend to crypto investors for a profit.\nSENZ exclusive trading ops partner is Madison Partners, a registered Money Services Business and global market-leading liquidity provider for millions in trade execution of digital assets and cryptocurrency worldwide.\nThis strategic partnership and proprietary bitcoin lending program has been seeded with $5 million of bitcoin that is now available for lending to institutional investors to borrow, hedge, and arbitrage bitcoin on a range of cryptocurrency exchanges. DEMAND FOR BITCOIN BORROW TO SHORTING: VAST, UNTAPPED SENZ’S UNIQUE SOLUTION REMOVES A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO INSTITUTIONAL CRYPTO TRADING\nCryptocurrency is quickly becoming an asset class financial institutions can’t ignore but where trading services lag behind leaving them to feel their way around a new field some say has gotten ahead of itself.\nCrypto markets can be volatile, inefficient, and unstable. With their acquisition of loanable bitcoin, Yield Endurance is intent on being a “first mover” in the space and leading the field in delivering services to mitigate this extreme volatility and market inefficiency.\nWhile cryptocurrencies were once the sole domain of tech-savvy investors, mainstream institutions can now invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency products.\nSENZ operates in a way similar to the stock loan market – by combining the unprecedented growth of cryptocurrencies with the stability and efficiency of stock lending.\nConventional stock lending involves the temporary transfer of stock between investors, often large institutional investors such as mutual funds or pension funds. This common practice helps both borrowers and lenders generate additional income in their portfolios. VALUE OF YIELD ENDURANCE TO BITCOIN HOLDERS\nThe lending program and strategic partnership give investors a way to earn yield on these assets and maximize their return on investment.\nBy increasing liquidity and risk management practices in the cryptocurrency market, SENZ intends to open up institutional participation and correct many of the trading inefficiencies institutional investors currently face when trading cryptocurrency STRATEGIC SYMBIOSIS – MADISON PARTNERS\nThe roles established in the strategic partnership are undeniably complementary: SENZ provides its strategic, marketing and client origination expertise, while Madison Partners delivers its unique back office and fulfillment.\nOperational expertise and access to cryptocurrency inventory provided by SENZ is an ideal match to the proprietary trading, technology, and execution expertise of Madison Partners.\nSENZ has launched the strategic partnership with a loan for $5 million in bitcoin, with the inventory then used by Madison Partners for lending to institutional bitcoin traders and other entities. Terms of the partnership provide for SENZ to rev share in financing and interest fees generated by the partner.\nSENZ offers a new way to manage risk in crypto markets.

The BlockBox AC is the latest offering from BitFury, a hardware company that runs one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools in the world, but says it’s “ not a Bitcoin mining company .”\nThe BlockBox’s main selling point is that its a portable datacenter, although the reasons why anyone would want to move this much computer equipment on the fly is unclear. Perhaps its so Bitcoin miners can stay one step ahead of the regulatory crackdowns on cryptocurrency mining and relocate on a whim, if say, the city where they were mining bans it .\nBitfury is selling its BlockBox on a profit-sharing model with two options . One option is to buy the box for $1 million and once your initial million dollar investment is paid off through mining you split future profits with Bitfury 50/50. The other option is to have Bitfury host the box on its premises for $70,000 a month.\nBut is it worth it? Read More: You Could Mine One Bitcoin If You Harvested the Body Heat From 44,000 People\nEach BlockBox comes with 176 Bitcoin miners able to burn through about 8 quadrillion hashes per second. According to Bitfury, this requires about 1.2 megawatts of power, which is roughly enough to power about 500 average homes.\nIf you can find decently priced electricity (around 5 cents per kilowatt-hour), you’d be able to net about $5,000 per month in profit if you rented one of these bad boys. If you bought it outright for $1 million, you could pay it off in about 13 months at current Bitcoin prices and then make about $35,000 per month thereafter.\nAnd hey, if Bitcoin crashes, the shipping container can be retooled as a cheap apartment.

What is crypto-currency? It is everything confusing about money combined with everything confusing about computers. Some People hate it and see a bubble that will inevitably burst. Others are on the fence but are worried about the linking their bank info with exchange sites. There there are the people stacking piles of good tangible cash from their crypto armchair investments. In my own opinion, the bottom line is that as the crypto craze continues to build steam the people that don't hop on board the train before it gets too far out of the station will all be missing out. On beyond Bitcoin, This is the first feature-length documentary to put their focus on altcoins. Contrary to what the name implies, Bitcoin Is not the main focus. The documentary supposedly plans on focusing their attention on everything but Bitcoin. Two altcoins currently associated with the documentary prominently are DASH and LISK, sorry Tron hodlers.The people behind the project have signed a 7-figure deal at Cannes, the European cinema capital. The deal comes through the patronage of the Slate Entertainment Group. This company is also the firm behind the SLATE (SLX) blockchain network. The film is expected to debut on Binge, the first blockchain video-on-demand platform, on March 2019. The film is also reportedly tackling the ICO-fever, its role of regulators, and the separation of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The documentary follows the paths of three prominent figures in the crypto world. Ryan Radloff is a crypto financier, Perianne Boring is a blockchain diplomat, and Roger Ver is the controversial anarcho-capitalist. The film charts their unique paths for a year, as the push for decentralizing and redefining money and power continues.Mad Dashiells Space For Rant: OK, let's talk. Yes, I have been a fan of the Bitcoin and Dash coin for 5 years. But if you are looking to start investing today. I would consider an alternative coin that is cheaper, kind of like playing with penny stocks. Right now TRON/TRX is trading around six cents on the dollar even after taking a hit this week during a huge Bitcoin sell-off, while Bitcoin still jumps back up 7%. What is TRON? Its a classic film from 1982! Yes, I won't lie that is what initially attracted me to the coin, but let's talk about the altcoin TRX/TRON. First off just as in the film, Tron watchdogged the Master Control, today TRX/TRON is an ambitious project dedicated to building the infrastructure for a truly decentralized Internet. TRON was developed for the digital entertainment industry. Within this industry, there are online casinos, games, and social networks. This industry has a worldwide market value of 1 trillion dollars. The TRON protocol enables everyone to publish, store, and manage their data in a decentralized manner. TRON wants the makers of documents, music tracks, and games to be able to keep their management and distribution in their own hands. These days, this increasingly no longer the case. There seems to usually an intermediary involved who then requires a portion of the proceeds. By having everything in their own hands, creators can earn more and be in charge of regulation and distribution. This is a massive endgame for a coin vs most others coins endgame is just to be worth more money. I could go on forever but instead, I will say thanks for joining me and this is Mad Dashiell signing off. -END OF LINE.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maddashiell"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mad dashie", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lisk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T02:55:25.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2050168ed3c30e66725d7337788e554024e6970", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMtqyPJPatOPBBGg1pkElcpM3G1uhyuoUnC5K3ImgoCTaDOpRsrmJQI7WGhAjOj9TJEUL3BKUhJgKsVd9y4jXuuWiYoZlYJeu2NQEqpml8n.KqgK55P7MuMWCkOHmUey_hk-", "site_full": "virtualmining.com", "site": "virtualmining.com", "site_section": "http://virtualmining.com/feed/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Virtual Mining Bitcoin News", "title": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York", "title_full": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York", "published": "2018-05-17T23:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2050168ed3c30e66725d7337788e554024e6970", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMtqyPJPatOPBBGg1pkElcpM3G1uhyuoUnC5K3ImgoCTaDOpRsrmJQI7WGhAjOj9TJEUL3BKUhJgKsVd9y4jXuuWiYoZlYJeu2NQEqpml8n.KqgK55P7MuMWCkOHmUey_hk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-17T23:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York", "text": " Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York In the US , China , and South Korea , many individual cryptocurrency miners and large-scale mining centers were cracked down for conducting illicit operations. For example, in April 2018, cryptocurrency miners in South Korea were arrested for illicitly utilizing cheap electricity to produce cryptos. Chicken farm in South Korea\nIn South Korea, places such as chicken farms and factories in development restricted areas are provided with electricity at cheaper rates by the government to help struggling industries and support innovative technology-focused initiatives. The government is stricter with the usage of electricity in these areas and consistently monitors the inflow of energy into buildings, factories, farms, and houses near these specially approved districts.\nOn April 19, police in the Gyeong-ki province of South Korea, the second largest region behind Seoul, arrested operators of a mining center in Nam Yang city . An in-depth police investigation disclosed that five cryptocurrency miners, whose identities remain confidential as they are still in police custody, purposely rented out factories and chicken farms in the protected part of the city to receive electricity for substantially lower rates.\nBy disguising buildings as semi-conductor factories and several properties as chicken farms, the five individuals were able to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with virtually no cost apart from the ASIC miners they acquired and installed. Image source: Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency via Hani\nIn the Paju restricted development area, the five individuals rented out a 859 square meter building and applied to the government as a semi-conductor factory. For 8 months, the group utilized the space to mine cryptocurrencies with more than 1580 ASIC miners. In the later months of their illegal venture, the group recruited more than 40 individuals and rented out their ASIC miners to produce even more cryptocurrencies.\nThe group generated more than $300,000 by accepting ASIC miners from individuals within months but the actual sum of cryptocurrencies the group was able to produce throughout the 8-month period remains unclear.\nPreliminary investigations undertaken by the Gyeong-ki and Paju police has shown that the group produced at least 760 Ethereum, which is worth more than $500,000, and a large sum of Bitcoin. The local police is still investigating into the final sum of money the group generated throughout the past year. The police has also discovered that the group only paid 50 percent of the normal electricity rate and received significant discounts for renting out the farms and factories.\nCurrently South Korea has no laws or policies approved that can punish cryptocurrency miners in development restricted areas. Minor charges could be applied to the five individuals, for using the space intended to carry out other initiatives, but no major penalties can be imposed as of now. To prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, the local police has requested the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs to draft and approve laws that prohibit cryptocurrency miners from taking advantage of districts and areas with cheaper electricity rates. First mining ban in New York\nIn the US on March 18, local authorities in the state of New York requested a cryptocurrency mining facility to halt their mining initiative after residents of Plattsburg, a small lakeside town in upstate New York, filed an official complaint to the police for the excessive usage of low-cost electricity by local miners.\nThe city of Plattsburg did not impose a permanent ban on Bitcoin mining however. Instead, local authorities and residents released a moratorium which states that the city will not consider applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining for at least a year and a half. Bloomberg reported that the city can charge more than $1,000 per day if miners decide to use low-cost electricity of the city to mine. The authorities of Plattsburg said:\n“It is the purpose of this Local Law to facilitate the adoption of land use and zoning and/or municipal lighting department regulations to protect and enhance the City’s natural, historic, cultural and electrical resources.” Another cryptocurrency mining facility was confronted by local authorities and a telecommunication powerhouse T-Mobile on Feb. 15 after it was revealed that ASIC miners from a mining facility based in Brooklyn interfered with the 700 MHz band of T-Mobile. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said :\n“On November 30, 2017, in response to the complaint agents from the Enforcement Bureau’s New York Office confirmed by direction finding techniques that radio emissions in the 700 MHz band were emanating from your residence in Brooklyn, New York. When the interfering device was turned off the interference ceased. You identified the device as an Antminer s5 Bitcoin Miner. The device was generating spurious emissions on frequencies assigned to T-Mobile’s broadband network and causing harmful interference.”\nAt the time, the FCC gave the mining facility a 20-day notice to halt their operations and move elsewhere as the radio emissions released by the ASIC miners within the facility were negatively impacting local telecommunication networks. Not illegal\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency mining is legal in most countries, even in China which banned the trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in Sep. 2017.\nCryptocurrency mining is legal in most regions because it is beneficial for electricity grid operators to provide excess energy that they can no longer supply to households and businesses. As such, although local governments have tried to ban cryptocurrency mining in the past as demonstrated in CNLedger’s report below, cryptocurrency mining remains unbanned in most countries.\nIt is also not illegal to mine Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency using electricity that is low cost. However, it is illegal to disguise cryptocurrency mining initiatives as a protected business in a development restricted area to take advantage of cheap electricity that is only provided to approved organizations and institutions.

Bitcoin Mining To Use 0.5% Of World’s Energy By End Of 2018, Peer-Reviewed Research Shows Bitcoin Mining To Use 0.5% Of World’s Energy By End Of 2018, Peer-Reviewed Research Shows Bitcoin Mining To Use 0.5% Of World’s Energy By End Of 2018, Peer-Reviewed Research Shows Economist Alex de Vries, who published an article on “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem,” yesterday, May 16, in scientific journal Joule , told the Independent that Bitcoin (BTC) mining will use 0.5 percent of the world’s energy by 2018.\nDe Vries concludes that as the BTC network currently consumes about 2.55 GW of electricity and moves towards consuming 7.67 GW in the future (for reference, Ireland consumes 3.1 GW and Austria 8.2 GW), the network “has a big problem, and it is growing fast.” However, he does note that solutions like the Lightning Network “may alleviate the situation.” Bitcoin mining requires energy for performing the calculations – hashes – that give miners Bitcoin rewards. In mid-February, it was reported that crypto mining in the country of Iceland would consume more energy than households in 2018. The debate over whether Bitcoin mining is overly harmful for the environment is seen by some as a non-issue, due to the real need for Bitcoin in underbanked countries.\nDe Vries told the Independent, however, that “half a percent is already quite shocking:”\n“It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.” The scientific study goes into detail about the different types of Bitcoin miners and their individual energy usage, noting that “trying to measure the electricity consumed by the Bitcoin mining machines producing all those hash calculations remains a challenge to date.” De Vries uses Bitmain’s Antminers as his main example to show how much energy each machine uses in its lifetime. As De Vries’s study is the first time data on Bitcoin energy consumption has been peer-reviewed, he hopes his paper will “get the conversation started,” as he believes that the world needs “more scientific discussion on where this network is headed” as opposed to “back-of-the-envelope calculations,” he told the Independent.\nConversely, the technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain , is being used to alleviate environmental impact in some cases. This week, IBM announced a partnership with Veridium Labs with the aim of tokenizing carbon credits to allow companies to better track their carbon footprint through blockchain, potentially allowing them to reduce their carbon impact.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/lightning-network", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitmain", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435118301776", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/iceland-crypto-mining-companies-will-consume-more-energy-than-households-in-2018", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-costs-more-electricity-than-houses-but-its-a-non-issue", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ibm", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/antminer", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/ibm-partners-with-veridium-labs-to-let-companies-track-carbon-footprint-via-blockchain", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-mining-energy-use-electricity-cryptocurrency-a8353981.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-mining"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:46:24.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae51b480873c8a4666fcf070d7c2bc95435257ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMtqyPJPatOPBBGg1pkElcpMgNMHVDpSDJJk6x4uLGW51PM16BuLetqSM9cQPc9mt2jtSN4OKKTdB3hJW4.ezyzTLdtmFg1_Sl6.YEwJrvLUrKeIkJbYksg.BmmPXi0DC2g-", "site_full": "virtualmining.com", "site": "virtualmining.com", "site_section": "http://virtualmining.com/feed/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Virtual Mining Bitcoin News", "title": "E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not a Bubble, Bitcoin Is", "title_full": "E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not a Bubble, Bitcoin Is", "published": "2018-05-17T23:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae51b480873c8a4666fcf070d7c2bc95435257ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMtqyPJPatOPBBGg1pkElcpMgNMHVDpSDJJk6x4uLGW51PM16BuLetqSM9cQPc9mt2jtSN4OKKTdB3hJW4.ezyzTLdtmFg1_Sl6.YEwJrvLUrKeIkJbYksg.BmmPXi0DC2g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-17T23:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not a Bubble, Bitcoin Is", "text": " E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not a Bubble, Bitcoin Is E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not a Bubble, Bitcoin Is E-Commerce Giant Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Blockchain Is Not a Bubble, Bitcoin Is Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba , spoke out at the 2nd World Intelligence Conference in Tianjin, saying that blockchain technology is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is, Wednesday, May 16.\nMa said he has been researching blockchain for years, and believes strongly in its potential to address issues of data privacy and security for society at all levels – governments, corporations and individuals – in an “era of big data.” He stressed that security is a top priority for the e-commerce conglomerate, which reported $39.9 bln in yearly revenue in its latest fiscal Q4 earnings release, and has a trading volume of “trillions of transactions.”\nMa added that regrettably, much of the attention the emerging blockchain industry receives comes from speculators who view blockchain as a “huge gold mine.” Ma was wary of Bitcoin even during its peak in December 2017, reportedly telling CNBC Shanghai at the time:\n“I don’t know about Bitcoin at all. I’m particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed. I don’t think we are ready. So I’m still paying attention to Alipay … to the US dollar, and the euro. We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don’t care about Bitcoin.”\nLast year, Jack Ma became the richest man in Asia, according to Bloomberg, with his net worth surging to $41.8 bln. The overwhelmingly popular mobile payment app Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, reportedly has 450 mln users.\nAs early as summer 2016, Ant Financial, introduced blockchain technology to improve accountability in its work with the Chinese charity industry, going on to recruit blockchain experts in the company at large the following year.\nHowever, in line with Ma’s position, Alibaba Group has stopped short of embracing cryptocurrencies, with Alibaba Cloud recently denying rumours its newly launched ‘P2P Nodes’ network was a cryptocurrency mining platform.

Did you remembered when you are in school you always thought that you need to study hard to get a nice job in order to help your family and for you also to establish your own family. But at this generation you noticed that even though you are working with full time job it is not enough to make better way living. That's why you would try to look in another opportunities that helps you to earn more money for family.\nDo you think Investment in education is better or Investment in cryptocurrency especially in bitcoin is much better?\nBase of this articles which is better investment in future for you?\nShare your thoughts about this.\nBitcoin is viewed from an investment perspective, it is more often compared to gold than it is to other currencies. That is because bitcoin and gold have a lot in common as assets. Both are limited in supply, have functional use and are considered by many, despite their volatility, to be good stores of value. When gold and bitcoin were compared as investments over the last five years, bitcoin greatly outperformed the precious metal, generating an annualized return of 155 percent compared to golds annualized loss of 6 percent during the same period. These exuberant returns indicate that bitcoin is getting investors excited about the prospect of placing funds into a brand new asset class.\nBitcoins soaring value and its proven investor performance compared to the gold standard, are indicators that it is high time to weigh the opportunities and risks that come with investing in the worlds leading digital currency.\nOpportunities:\nMany argue that bitcoin, like other currencies, has value only because people perceive it to have value. It is for this reason that many critics view bitcoins price development as nothing more than a bubble. However, there are drivers behind bitcoins excellent returns that have nothing to do with hype or speculative opportunism.\nClickk Here to view source link https://www.google.com.ph/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/article/bitcoin-as-an-investment-opportunities-and-risks-cm740800/amp?espv=1\nWhy an Education is the Best Investment you can Make\nWhether you consider your education a right, a privilege or something you just need to do as part of life, you should always consider it an investment. If you think of your future professional life as a business, your education is an integral part in the overall structure and quality of that business.\nAnd it doesnt matter if you end up working for yourself or someone else, the education element is an investment that provides the tools necessary for you to move forward and become successful. Every expert, leader and big shot in every industry started by learning the basic skills they needed to get the ball rolling, and the same will be true for you.\nThe Time of Your Life\nBesides having a great time with new experiences, connections are the first reason your education is a worthwhile investment. Quite often, college years are networking disguised as fun. It may not seem like youre making professional connections for the future, but its not uncommon to reconnect with the people you shared this experience with later on, especially in the age of social networks.\nDecision-Making Leverage\nSmart decisions are crucial for a business to excel, and getting a good education puts you in a position to make the right professional decisions at the right time. Being educated in your field gives you a sense of accomplishment and confidence, which enable you to make decisions with confidence moving forward.\nCareer Boost\nIt goes without saying that an education is a great investment if you plan to work in a career for someone else. Depending on your career choice, a formal education might be a must-have to even get into the field. But even if it isnt, taking that extra step will get you started higher up the ladder and will help you move up at a faster pace.\nFuture Security\nSecurity is a word you see come up regularly when speaking about education and employment. Whether you want to go out on your own or work for someone else, that education will be there to break your fall if something goes wrong or doesnt work out.\nIf you lose your job or your entrepreneurial attempt falls flat, an education means you get a second chance and it wont take nearly as long to make it happen. If you think of your career and your financial life like a business, its easy to see why an education is the best investment you can make in yourself.\nClick here to view source link http://www.cestarcollege.com/blog/news-and-events/why-an-education-is-the-best-investment-you-can-make/ Thank you!\nInvesting in both bitcoin and education is a best thing but I think investing in the latter is the most needed. Education is a long term investment for me because exerting time, work, and efforts in here will paid it someday. We know that acquiring education now is a must in finding and applying for jobs because in that we are able to learn many aspects of subjects and life lessons that we need to apply in jobs and in real life. So I think investing in education is more approriate than in bitcoin although we get a chance to earn in here.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

and Blockchain Will Achieve Full Potential in A Decade, Steve Wozniak: Veronika Rinecker via CoinTelegraph.com, Thu, 05/17/2018–10:06 Apple’s co-founder Steve “Woz” Wozniak has commented positively about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in his opening speech at the WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 in Vienna, Austria. According to a report by Cointelegraph auf Deutsch Wednesday, May 16, Wozniak considers blockchain to be a “great idea.” He further said: “[Blockchain] is the next major IT revolution that is about to happen.” Wozniak explained his positive outlook on blockchain by the fact that there are many useful applications for the technology in a number of areas. The blockchain and cryptocurrencies will achieve their full potential in a decade, according to Wozniak. Apple’s co-founder quoted CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey, who had said in March that Bitcoin will become the world’s “single currency.” This is not the first time that Steve Wozniak has made positive comments about cryptocurrencies and blockchain. At the “Money 20/20” conference in Las Vegas, back in October last year, he said that Bitcoin is better than gold and the US dollar. According to Wozniak, Bitcoin’s big advantage is that there is only a limited amount of coins, while fiat money, like the US dollar or euro, can simply be printed by banks. Nonetheless, Wozniak sold all his bitcoins except one, as he said at the ‘We Are Developers Conference’ in Vienna, because “[he] does not want to be an investor and constantly watch the prices.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://creativecommons.org/ns#", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/money2020-wozniak-thinks-bitcoin-better-gold/", "https://www.wearedevelopers.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "veronika rinecker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph auf deutsch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T03:40:15.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a30d702c52fd5eac6e17e2c5ff1d190e643b6bb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHUmprfmuwCg7Q3q00UYPZ_BG5KnZn5XVYetGtBVVQHzW4Hbb968mqfGvDSeGpdc3fIXZveHD4R3yrrc4RgbDXZJMaLeoz6QS2MygwkkZ1sGddrOh64SbN", "site_full": "vpnwp.com", "site": "vpnwp.com", "site_section": "https://vpnwp.com/feed", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "tech"], "section_title": "VpnWP", "title": "Avabil – Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology)", "title_full": "Avabil – Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology)", "published": "2018-05-17T22:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "RO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/vpnwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/preview-1.png?resize=590%2C282&ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a30d702c52fd5eac6e17e2c5ff1d190e643b6bb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHUmprfmuwCg7Q3q00UYPZ_BG5KnZn5XVYetGtBVVQHzW4Hbb968mqfGvDSeGpdc3fIXZveHD4R3yrrc4RgbDXZJMaLeoz6QS2MygwkkZ1sGddrOh64SbN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "danroo", "published": "2018-05-17T22:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Avabil – Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology)", "text": "Home / Template / Avabil – Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology) Avabil – Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology) danroo 1 min ago Template Comments Off on Avabil – Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology) 3 Views\nThanks for buying our merchandise.

Morgan , is sinking its toes in a little deeper.\nJ.P. Morgan created a new position dubbed Head of Crypto-Assets Strategy, naming Oliver Harris, previously head of the banking giant’s in-residence program for fintech startups, to the role. With his new title, Harris will seek out cryptocurrency projects that can be taken to market, Fortune has learned.\nFinancial News first reported the news.\nHarris will work under the umbrella of J.P. Morgan’s blockchain initiative, headed by Umar Farooq. The bank has been experimenting with the blockchain — an immutable ledger of, oftentimes, transactions — over the past two years in a bid to solve banking-related inefficiencies. One experiment resulted in the creation of Quorum , an Ethereum-based blockchain for payments aimed at businesses. Notably, J.P. Morgan partnered with the team behind cryptocurrency Zcash to increase the privacy on that blockchain . The bank is now said to be considering a spinoff of that project .\nHarris is also set to lead the execution of that project, working closely with Christine Moy, program lead for J.P. Morgan’s Blockchain Center of Excellence.\nThat’s not to say the banking giant is suddenly hopping into Bitcoin trading in the way Goldman Sachs has done — at least not yet.\nWhen asked about the future of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and the bank potentially trading the asset, J.P. Morgan’s Head of Corporate and Investment Banking told CNBC: “We are looking into the space.”\n“I have no doubt that in one way or another, the technology will play a role,” he said Wednesday. “If we need to clear futures of Bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No.”\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/jpmorgan-crypto-strategy-20180517", "https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/blockchain", "https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-blockchain-jpmorgan/jpmorgan-mulls-spin-off-of-blockchain-project-quorum-sources-idUKKBN1GY36O?mod=article_inline"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lucinda shen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "oliver harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.p. morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umar farooq", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "j.p. morgan", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:50:23.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82c74c3e7ee259cd9c98d87a7887339edd79c0b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__355voeK9ywyzvKPuL8IBNMO3FyjBRSxzi0hPS0sitKcn18FJ28hwhK0-", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York", "title_full": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York", "published": "2018-05-17T22:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82c74c3e7ee259cd9c98d87a7887339edd79c0b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__355voeK9ywyzvKPuL8IBNMO3FyjBRSxzi0hPS0sitKcn18FJ28hwhK0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T22:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York", "text": "Home » bitcoin » crypto » crypto news » news » Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York bitcoin , crypto , crypto news , news #bitcoin #invest #money\nCryptocurrency miners in the US and South Korea disguised as protected businesses to mine bitcoin with unfairly cheap electricity rates. In the US , China , and South Korea , many individual cryptocurrency miners and large-scale mining centers were cracked down for conducting illicit operations. For example, in April 2018, cryptocurrency miners in South Korea were arrested for illicitly utilizing cheap electricity to produce cryptos. Chicken farm in South Korea\nIn South Korea, places such as chicken farms and factories in development restricted areas are provided with electricity at cheaper rates by the government to help struggling industries and support innovative technology-focused initiatives. The government is stricter with the usage of electricity in these areas and consistently monitors the inflow of energy into buildings, factories, farms, and houses near these specially approved districts.\nOn April 19, police in the Gyeong-ki province of South Korea, the second largest region behind Seoul, arrested operators of a mining center in Nam Yang city . An in-depth police investigation disclosed that five cryptocurrency miners, whose identities remain confidential as they are still in police custody, purposely rented out factories and chicken farms in the protected part of the city to receive electricity for substantially lower rates.\nBy disguising buildings as semi-conductor factories and several properties as chicken farms, the five individuals were able to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with virtually no cost apart from the ASIC miners they acquired and installed. Image source: Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency via Hani\nIn the Paju restricted development area, the five individuals rented out a 859 square meter building and applied to the government as a semi-conductor factory. For 8 months, the group utilized the space to mine cryptocurrencies with more than 1580 ASIC miners. In the later months of their illegal venture, the group recruited more than 40 individuals and rented out their ASIC miners to produce even more cryptocurrencies.\nThe group generated more than $300,000 by accepting ASIC miners from individuals within months but the actual sum of cryptocurrencies the group was able to produce throughout the 8-month period remains unclear.\nPreliminary investigations undertaken by the Gyeong-ki and Paju police has shown that the group produced at least 760 Ethereum, which is worth more than $500,000, and a large sum of Bitcoin. The local police is still investigating into the final sum of money the group generated throughout the past year. The police has also discovered that the group only paid 50 percent of the normal electricity rate and received significant discounts for renting out the farms and factories.\nCurrently South Korea has no laws or policies approved that can punish cryptocurrency miners in development restricted areas. Minor charges could be applied to the five individuals, for using the space intended to carry out other initiatives, but no major penalties can be imposed as of now. To prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, the local police has requested the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs to draft and approve laws that prohibit cryptocurrency miners from taking advantage of districts and areas with cheaper electricity rates. First mining ban in New York\nIn the US on March 18, local authorities in the state of New York requested a cryptocurrency mining facility to halt their mining initiative after residents of Plattsburg, a small lakeside town in upstate New York, filed an official complaint to the police for the excessive usage of low-cost electricity by local miners.\nThe city of Plattsburg did not impose a permanent ban on Bitcoin mining however. Instead, local authorities and residents released a moratorium which states that the city will not consider applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining for at least a year and a half. Bloomberg reported that the city can charge more than $1,000 per day if miners decide to use low-cost electricity of the city to mine. The authorities of Plattsburg said:\n“It is the purpose of this Local Law to facilitate the adoption of land use and zoning and/or municipal lighting department regulations to protect and enhance the City’s natural, historic, cultural and electrical resources.” Another cryptocurrency mining facility was confronted by local authorities and a telecommunication powerhouse T-Mobile on Feb. 15 after it was revealed that ASIC miners from a mining facility based in Brooklyn interfered with the 700 MHz band of T-Mobile. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said :\n“On November 30, 2017, in response to the complaint agents from the Enforcement Bureau’s New York Office confirmed by direction finding techniques that radio emissions in the 700 MHz band were emanating from your residence in Brooklyn, New York. When the interfering device was turned off the interference ceased. You identified the device as an Antminer s5 Bitcoin Miner. The device was generating spurious emissions on frequencies assigned to T-Mobile’s broadband network and causing harmful interference.”\nAt the time, the FCC gave the mining facility a 20-day notice to halt their operations and move elsewhere as the radio emissions released by the ASIC miners within the facility were negatively impacting local telecommunication networks. Not illegal\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency mining is legal in most countries, even in China which banned the trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in Sep. 2017.\nCryptocurrency mining is legal in most regions because it is beneficial for electricity grid operators to provide excess energy that they can no longer supply to households and businesses. As such, although local governments have tried to ban cryptocurrency mining in the past as demonstrated in CNLedger’s report below, cryptocurrency mining remains unbanned in most countries. YiCai: Regulators are asking local departments to report the current status of bitcoin mining companies under administration, and \"guide the mining firms to exit in an orderly manner\" by taking various measures from the aspects of electricity, land, tax, environmental protection — cnLedger (@cnLedger) January 6, 2018\nIt is also not illegal to mine Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency using electricity that is low cost. However, it is illegal to disguise cryptocurrency mining initiatives as a protected business in a development restricted area to take advantage of cheap electricity that is only provided to approved organizations and institutions. This is why South Korean authorities are currently drafting regulations to prevent mining facilities from taking advantage of cities with cheaper electricity. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/south-korea", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/ban-complete-china-blocks-foreign-crypto-exchanges-to-counter-financial-risks", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/revenues-down-hashrates-up-2018-mining-outlook-by-the-numbers", "http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/area/841224.html", "https://twitter.com/cnLedger/status/949468263800479744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2018/db0215/DOC-349258A1.pdf", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/us", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-16/bitcoin-mining-banned-for-first-time-in-upstate-new-york-town", "http://www.cityofplattsburgh.com/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=229"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hicken farms and new york cases of illegal bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:34:07.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "913b44871f580176d56d5d54d1c33941c2c66857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR38RgnDHkZrG7EyP6m1LxI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin ATMs", "title_full": "Bitcoin ATMs", "published": "2018-05-17T22:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.066, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "913b44871f580176d56d5d54d1c33941c2c66857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR38RgnDHkZrG7EyP6m1LxI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pan Troglodytes", "published": "2018-05-17T22:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin ATMs", "text": "Quote: from: jonloner011 on May 17, 2018, 01:04:23 PM There are no bitcoin ATM available in the world.

0 comments\nNEW YORK (Reuters) – Ethereum is the top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space, while that of bitcoin, the original virtual currency, is ranked 13th, according to the Chinese government’s first monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index released on Thursday. Representation of the Ethereum virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com.\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.

As more people become acquainted with the term and have developed a sense of its purport, the more it gets used loosely and deviates from it’s proper meaning. The result is that most Bitcoin maximalists are unfairly appointed as such. In superficial dialogues they point to Bitcoin as a superior protocol while they are not given the time to point out why they refer to it. Lately this indifferent use of the term led to people using the superlative to insult others, stigmatising them as small-minded. In many cases the accusations focus unjustly on the technology, Bitcoin. Hence the term ‘Bitcoin maximalist’. Often the blame originates from the feeling that the technology is chosen for what is does, not what it represents. The truth is more nuanced. Usually proclaimed ‘Bitcoin maximalists’ are not explicitly focused on the technology, but more so on the governance of the software and ecosystem. The people that prefer the oldest and first blockchain around value it for other things than a certain functionality. Oftentimes the people that are mistaken for ‘Bitcoin maximalists’ value something quite different than a specific kind of technology or feature. They appreciate one core value higher than all others and demand censorship-resistance above all else. They don’t mind the technology has no fancy turing complete smart-contracting language or scalable proof-of-stake algorithms that provide mass adoption. They just want to besure they’re not bothered with self-defined superior influencers. It seems accusations of Bitcoin maximalism are voiced to with the intention to create a division between groups of people within the blockchain space. This is remarkable because the foremost reason to use blockchain technology is to disintermediate and regain certainty without the influence of intermediaries. Often when the term ‘Bitcoin maximalist’ is used it reveals a misunderstanding of what blockchains essentially offer, from a — more fundamental — perspective of governance, caused by a excessive focus on technical aspects. The offended usually lack this disproporttionate focus on technology as they want a different single core value taken to heart; Sovereignty . They simply won’t accept any ‘more sovereign’ entity when it is about their wealth, identity, privacy or all the other things the blockchain space promises to bring us these days. Avoid calling them ‘Bitcoin maximalists’ but refer to them as ‘sovereignty-maximalists’ The maximalists deny the usability of most of the recent innovations regarding our beloved blockchain technology that claim to bring these promised solutions but at the same time ignore this core value of autonomy. The people that are accused of being ‘maximalist’ seem to be more patient as they demand that the innovations respect the core of their value system. I think it is best to restrain from condemning these unwavering individuals by all means, but if there’s no way around, avoid calling them ‘Bitcoin maximalists’ but refer to them as ‘ sovereignty-maximalists ’. In the end it is the coveted autonomy that drives them most. From this governance perspective it is not surprising the so called maximalists end up with Bitcoin; Every. Single.

top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space, while that of bitcoin, the original virtual currency, is ranked 13th, according to the Chinese government's first monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index released on Thursday.\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nAdvertisement Blockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4.

Thanks, Jordan! I enjoyed the read!\nDesign is free to anyone who wants to use it. This turns any water-heating endeavor into a profitable, or at least cost-reduced, enterprise. Imagine a crypto heated swimming pool, or anything else you could heat with the output from a small, medium, or large-scale mining operation. This design should scale very well if you make the individual parts \"bigger.\" Have fun!\nItems used are a water / air intercooler off Ebay fed by 3/4\" water hose and a Bosche 12v pump model #0392022002.\nAttained water temperatures of 50C / 122F for a week before I took it down.\nClosed loop. (Requires Underclock) https://i.imgur.com/l5goioK.jpg\nInside the box. https://i.imgur.com/QpG6dBe.jpg\nOpen loop (Can run 100%). https://i.imgur.com/kkgwDyr.jpg\nThe closed-loop is very quiet, the fans don't need to run anywhere near 100% with things underclocked. I ran mine around 30%, and while enclosed the sound is equivalent to a box fan on medium-ish.\nThe open-loop is good for winter, especially if you can duct it into your HVAC intake.\nBoth setups can be run in reverse to cool the intake air charge through the intercooler if a cold water source can be obtained. (Cold part of A/C unit dunked in coolant that is fed through the intercooler, for example.)\nEdit 180516t1518z: Here is an example of the cooling loop that I have planned. Using this in conjunction with either prototype it should be possible to house any mining operation in any environment, so long as the cost of the cooling loop does not overwhelm the profits produced by the mining equipment. This is best suited to the open-loop configuration in conjunction with intake filters.

One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.\nWell, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it’s not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking .\nA few of the crypto aficionados tell their followers that gold can’t be a monetary asset because there are millions of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away in the Grand Canyon. While this may sound like quite an interesting conspiracy, there is no sound evidence to back it up. To believe in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. However, with logic being in short supply currently, I am not surprised that many believe in these fairy tales.\nOne of these ex-precious metals, now a highly qualified cryptoanalyst, suggested in a recent video that the “Gold is owned by the Bankers” so why would you want to own gold? Unfortunately, this is a false statement . While the Central banks own a lot of gold, it’s a lot less than what the private investors and jewelry owners hold. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for the largest stocks of above ground gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), followed by 40,000 mt of private investment, 32,600 mt of Central bank holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial usage and other:\nOf the total 190,000 mt of the world above ground gold stocks, jewelry consists of 48%, private investment 21%, Central bank 17%, and Industrial and other at 14% (Source: World Gold Council – Total above-ground stocks 2017 ) So, if we realize that nearly half of all above-ground gold stocks are in the form of jewelry, and then another 21% is owned by private investors, Central banks DO NOT own most of the gold. Even if we compare private investment to Official holdings, private investors own more gold than Central banks.\nNow, to the incorrect theory that there are millions of tons of gold in the world, can someone please tell me where all this additional gold came from?? If we understand that the increase in gold mine production paralleled the rise in silver and copper production, how could there be 10-20 times more gold than copper and silver???\nFirst, most of the gold ever mined was produced after 1900:\nAccording to the best data, we can get our hands on, 91% of all gold mined since 1493 was produced after 1900. Limited records of gold produced before 1493 suggest that wasn’t more than 10,000-15,000 mt.\nSecondly, if we look at historical world silver production, we see the same pattern:\nOf the total 48.5 billion oz of silver mined in the world between 1493 and 2016, 81% of it was produced after 1900. Also, the amount of silver mined annually compared to gold has been about 10 to 1. Assuming that total historical silver production was approximately 55 billion oz compared to 5.7 billion oz of gold, it turns out to be nearly a 10/1 ratio.\nFor there to be just 1 million tons of gold in above-ground stocks in the world, that would equal 32 billion oz of gold. Considering a 10/1 ratio of silver to gold production, then we should have mined 300+ billion oz of silver, not the 55 billion oz stated by the world authorities.\nSo, if we understand the logic here, why on earth do people continue to believe in the LOUSY CONSPIRACY that there are millions of tons of gold in the world?? Why, because lousy conspiracies sell a hell of a lot more newsletters and subscriptions than those that put out the facts and fundamentals.\nRegardless, Central banks own less gold than above ground jewelry stocks or private investors. While Central banks are controlling the gold and silver prices by funneling 99%+ of investors into stocks, bonds, real estate and cryptos, they cannot manipulate the price of precious metals too far below their cost of production.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand energy or the cost of production as a FLOOR for the gold and silver prices. Which means, the Central banks cannot push the price of gold and silver anywhere they please. What the Central banks CAN DO, is that they can BAMBOOZLE the public in putting their funds into the biggest Ponzi Schemes in history. By funneling the public’s money into stocks, bonds, and real estate, this caps the gold and silver price. This is the manipulation.\nNow, the notion that Bitcoin will replace gold as the King Monetary Asset is patently false because Bitcoin fails several important tests. First, Bitcoin trading volatility is too high to be used as a currency. I have heard from several people that using Bitcoin as a payment method is very frustrating because the price can fluctuate $1,000 in a very short time, thus making it a very stressful transaction for both buyer and seller.\nIf we compare the volatility of Bitcoin versus gold and fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the clear loser:\nBitcoin’s 30-day volatility of 3.73% is nearly 9 times more gold and 10 times more than the USD/EUR (US Dollar-Euro). While Bitcoin’s volatility could continue to decline in the future, it still needs a very high-tech electronic system to allow trade and payment.\nSecondly, Bitcoin and cryptos will not function well as the EROI of energy continues to fall, destroying the ability to scale up or maintain high technology . I recently watched a documentary about the Dark Ages on the history channel. After the fall of the ancient western Roman Empire (5th century), people who lived around the once great city in the 6th and 7th century knew that life was better in the past because they saw all these massive buildings and structures, but were now living mostly a peasant’s life.\nIn just 3-4 generations, people no longer remembered what it was like to live in Rome during its heyday. The great culture, technology, food, and trade of the ancient Roman Empire were gone for good. Most Americans today have no idea what life is like after a collapse of society.\nNot only will Bitcoin and the cryptos not survive the coming Falling EROI energy collapse, either will most of the advanced technology. Sure, some technology will be around, but it will claim the same fate as the ancient Roman Empire.

blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Ethereum is the top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space, while that of bitcoin, the original virtual currency, is ranked 13th, according to the Chinese government's first monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index released on Thursday. The index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project. Blockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet. Ethereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects. Bitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13. Blockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5. The index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly. The sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62. China in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings. China was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters' Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.

The businessmen were promised 150% returns in lieu of their investment.\nBhardwaj, a resident of Shalimar Bagh, was arrested by Pune Police from IGI airport in April. He is estimated to having duped over 8,000 people of around Rs 2,000 crore. His name had earlier cropped up in the investigation conducted by Cyber Cell when they had busted a cryptocurrency gang run by two men, Kamal Singh and Vijay Kumar, who had duped around 2,500 people.\nIn a fresh complaint, a victim, who has an export firm at Barakhamba Road, said that Bhardwaj introduced himself as a trader who dealt in gold, diamonds and Bitcoin with expertise in getting good returns on investments. The victim then introduced his father and brother to him.\n“To win my confidence, Bhardwaj introduced me to one Rajesh, who he claimed had collaborated with him to acquire a gold mine in Guinea, Latin America. He also showed some papers in this regard. After a few meetings, he offered to transfer shares held by them in the mine,” the victim said.\nThe crooks also produced a forged share-purchase agreement. When the victim showed interest, the accused gave him a “better” offer. Claiming to be experts in Bitcoin mining, the crooks told the victim to invest in it. The victim had no knowledge about cryptocurrency and sought more information. He was told that the virtual currency gave 100-150% returns on investments.\nThe victim was made to speak to several “clients”, who supposedly got substantial returns. “It later came to the fore that these people were members of the Bhardwaj gang,” an officer said.\nWhen the victim got suspicious, the accused began avoiding his calls and meeting him. The victim then approached police. A case has been filed and cops will seek Bhardwaj’s custody for arresting him in cases pertaining to Delhi.\nBhardwaj ran firms and websites in the name of Variable PTE limited, GB Miners and gainbitcoin.com. Also, his family members and he were directors in firms like Bitex Services, Coinbank, Paybits, Mcap labs and Redox Infotech, which dealt in Bitcoin mining and trading.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amit bhardwaj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamal singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajesh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pune police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guinea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shalimar bagh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barakhamba road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T06:17:20.025+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 8909, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=23300", "requestsLeft": 429}
