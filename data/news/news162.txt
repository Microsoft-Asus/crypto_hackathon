BTG forums seem to have been tracking the hack, going as far back as last week, monitoring the controversial coin’s hashrate, ultimately determining a 51% attack was under way.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash Bitcoin Gold Gets $18 Million Haircut\n“An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use ‘51% attacks,’” Bitcoin Gold forum poster Mental Nomad announced a week ago, “to perform ‘double spend’ attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.”\nA founding economic principle of bitcoin was its alleviation of the double spend problem. It was a main stumbling block in the historical race to create a viable cryptographic monetary form – foiling a great many coders along the way. Satoshi Nakamoto solved it through a decentralized, distributed ledger confirmation process (blockchain). Going as far back as its genesis block from early 2009, users can be confident transactions aren’t rebroadcast. Like clockwork, 6 times an hour, blocks are added – copied to nodes within the universal network. The offending wallet, according to the BTG team.\nOne way to achieve double spending is known as a 51% attack. It’s accomplished by bogarting the network’s computing power. With a majority, bad actors can get between the Nakamoto solution and transaction confirmations. By stymieing block completion in the usual manner, all sorts of mischief can arise: blockchain mining rewards redirected, users’ transactions reversed, etc. Not too long after, a double spending attack can commence, acting as the fiat equivalent to counterfeiting. Needless to type, any crypto suffering from such a problem is certain to immediately lose user confidence. Such attacks are interesting for another reason, as Mental Nomad is careful to point out. “There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets,” he assured last week. “It appears that actions on the part of the exchanges have deterred the attacker, for now.” And hitting exchanges tends to elicit little sympathy, at least initially, due to users being insulated. Exchanges are particularly vulnerable because they generally covet large deposits, which only compounds the problem in cases like these. GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft\nOver period of days, batches of BTG were deposited into exchanges supporting the forked coin, only to be sent back to the depositor’s wallet. The lag between such a transaction and some exchanges’ discovery is sufficient enough to nab tokens, doubling the filthy lucre. Exchanges trading bitcoin gold have responded by upping transaction confirmation filters, but evidently to no avail as the attacker gains ever-more BTG network control.\nBitcoin Gold team members seem to have communicated with some exchanges. “Requiring more confirmations greatly increases safety,” the forum details. “Until now, some Exchanges were operating with less than five confirmations required. We have been urging higher limits to prevent such an attack, and urging manual review of large deposits of BTG before clearing the funds for trading.” Indeed, according to BTG, “One of the targeted Exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past. In their words, ‘we are 100% sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.’” The traditional way BTC has been able to thwart double spend attacks.\nEvidence put forward by the BTG team points to address GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft as the attacker’s wallet; mined coins, according to the forum post reside at GXXjRkdquAkyHeJ6ReW3v4FY3QbgPfugTx. More than 388,201.92404001 BTG were funneled through the wallet, totalling more than $18 million according to Bitcoin Gold Explorer . That a top thirty crypto by market cap can be so easily troubled is a giant of enough problem, but it could also take exchanges down in the process – something the ecosystem is very sensitive to since Mt. Gox. And though, for now, BTG is confident enough to suggest users are not at risk, history shows that can quickly be the case as an exchange freezes withdrawals in an effort to stop hemorrhaging.\nBitcoin Gold has been beset by controversies since its birth fork late last year, including a recent dust-up between BCH advocate Craig Wright and BTG founder Jack Liao . To be fair, however, it is not the only blockchain to suffer a 51% attack. Mere days ago, recently Chinese government highly rated coin verge (XVG) was made to heel, again. These pages reported XVG, “On the morning of May 22, Suprvona, one of the largest altcoin mining pools, informed its 19,000 Twitter followers that verge was suffering yet another 51% attack, causing all blocks to be rejected.”\nDo you think the BTG hack spells doom for the coin?

Some people believe that this is not so good, and that the market should grow freely. But some crypto supporters, like Mike Novogratz and Cameron Winklevoss are in favour of healthy regulations.\nMr. Novogratz said :\n“Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market. Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins.”\nAt the same time, Cameron Winklevoss explained that these regulations are welcomed by the market if they help deter bad actors.\n“We welcome any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors,” Mr. Winklevoss stated.\nAdditionally, Thomas Lee, Fundstrat Global co-founder, said in an email to Bloomberg, that these regulations and welcome news because that means that there is ‘adult supervision coming/here.’\nAt the moment of writing this article, Bitcoin is being traded around $7,500 dollars, after losing $2,500 dollars since the beginning of May.

The largest coin is trading at around $7,300 today and altcoins are also been dwindling at a fast pace. The broader market selloff has snatched $150 billion out of the cryptocurrency market in the last two weeks alone.\nTom Lee again blamed lack of regulatory clarity for the huge selloff. The market pundits, however, are thinking about how low bitcoin price value can go. How Low Can it Go?\nThe bounces were limited in the freefall of Bitcoin Price in the last two weeks. The largest coin has breached several key supports levels without facing any resistance from bulls.\n“Last week’s $9k support has turned into this week’s $8k support. And thus far it is giving every indication that $7k will become next week’s support. I hope you see the trend here,” Jani Ziedins said .\nTechnical analysts, on the other hand, are indicating the bearish trend to extend momentum in the days to come.\nThey claim a new bearish crossover pattern could kill Bitcoin price. Based on technical charts, the five-month moving average (MA) is set to cut the ten-month moving average from the top – which indicates a bearish pattern for bitcoin price.\nThe previous two bearish spells had pulled Bitcoin price in the range of $6,000 before bouncing back to $10K range. This time market pundits have set a support level at $7K. If price slid below that level, the next support level would be $6,000 for bitcoin price. Can it Crash to Zero?\nThe debate over the Bitcoin’s potential to work as a viable currency has been impacting the value of the entire cryptocurrency market. Although Fed’s officials and other investing experts claim a complete crash of the cryptocurrency market, some other reports are showing the only handful of cryptocurrencies will survive in the future.

Using gold’s post futures historical price pattern we can try to forecast Bitcoin’s next all time high. The gold model proposes that Bitcoin will climb to around $86K in December 2018. This is in line with my previous analysis which had Bitcoin near $70K in the second week of December 2018. Bitcoin futures were met with much fanfare in December 2017. Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) launched on December 10th and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) December 17th. Anticipation of the respective launches had spread through cryptosphere in advance of CME and CBOE filings with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on December 1st. Futures contracts give buyers the opportunity to bet with or against Bitcoin. Yet there is no direct exposure to the underlying asset as contracts are cash settled. However, many lauded the move and took this as a sign of institutional acceptance. Futures gave Bitcoin an air of legitimization and were one step closer to exchange traded funds (ETFs). More money would come in. Prices would go higher. During this period social discovery spiked. Google Trends chart shows the number of searches for “bitcoin” spiked at the end of 2017. This confluence of factors allowed euphoria to take hold and Bitcoin’s price rose precipitously in a parabolic fashion to a peak value of nearly $20,000 on December 17, 2017. Chart on the left shows Bitcoin’s price rapidly rising from April 2017 to the peak in December 2017. The chart on the right is a magnified view covering the November 2 to December 16, 2017 period. Price appreciated 2.9X in 47 days. As seen in the right chart, between November 1, 2017 and December 17, 2017 price rose from $6800 to $19500 — 2.9X price appreciation in 47 days. Bitcoin was in a bubble. The peak on December 17 coincided with CME’s first futures contracts and subsequently price began its collapse. Bitcoin fell to a low of $6700 on April 6, 2018. After launch of CME futures trading on December 17, 2017 Bitcoin’s price fell significantly reaching a low of about $6700 on April 6, 2018. Did futures kill Bitcoin? Bitcoin is likened to “digital gold.” There is a limited supply of approximately 21 million coins. Mining becomes more difficult, costly and rewards fall over time (block reward halving). The asset is hoarded. HODLers go to great lengths to protect their investment. An underground bunker reminiscent of Fort Knox has been built by Xapo to store coins (private keys). Satoshi Nakamoto referenced gold in his original Bitcoin white paper . The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. Some well known Bitcoin advocates such as Trace Mayer have drawn parallels to gold as well. Like gold, Bitcoin aims to become a store of value, unit of account and medium of exchange. And like Bitcoin, gold futures were launched at a time of great interest and ATH. Let’s look at the impact futures trading had on its price. In a Medium article posted on December 7, 2017 Crypto Quantic Ph.D analyzed gold’s price history and correlated it to Bitcoin’s. He came to the following conclusion using post futures price action as guidance: I wouldn’t expect the Bitcoin trend to follow the gold trend exactly, but if it did, we would see a large drop that would bottom out in about April 2018 (remember, Bitcoin is moving at 4.3X Speed). Followed by an eventual rise to $60k — $80k before another major pull back, with a final run up to $180k. This article will (in part) revisit his analysis, add contemporary data and correlate his longterm forecast with my own (previously shared here and here ). Using gold as our model we will see how introduction of futures did not kill Bitcoin but instead opened the door for further substantial price appreciation. First, let’s review the issues surrounding U.S gold ownership in the late 19th and 20th centuries for some historical context. A Brief History of the Gold Standard A few years after 1834, “gold became the principal coin of domestic commerce” in the U.S. The strict gold standard began in 1879 and when silver was confined to fractional currency usage ( Congressional Research Service, 2011 ). President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 on April 5, 1933 which made it illegal to hoard gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates in an effort to spur economic growth during the Great Depression. These had to be turned in to the Federal Reserve for $20.67/oz of gold. Hoarders faced a penalty of $10,000 USD (nearly $200,000 adjusted) and up to 10 years in prison. This nationalization effort marked the end of the true gold standard. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 required all gold and gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve to be sold to the U.S. Department of Treasury. It also adjusted gold’s price to $35/oz. U.S. Citizens were allowed to buy non-redeemable gold certificates beginning in 1964. On August 15, 1971 President Nixon suspended gold’s convertibility to U.S. dollars. This was spurred by stagflation and a potential global run on U.S. gold reserves. There were more U.S dollars held by foreign nations than gold backing those dollars. Nixon effectively deflated the dollar’s value. In 1973 the U.S. completely abandoned the gold standard and currencies began to float against one another (the beginning of the fiat era). Gold’s price was no longer fixed. President Ford signed Pub.L. 93–373 on August 14, 1974 which allowed U.S. citizens to own and hold gold effective January 1, 1975. December 31, 1974 the first gold futures contracts were traded. Gold Futures Gold maintained a relatively flat (manipulated) price in the years prior to the Nixon adminstration’s decision to adopt a fiat currency economic policy in 1973. Price began its move up well in advance of Ford’s announcement in 1974. Let’s take a look at gold’s price before the introduction of futures. Gold’s price between May 1971 and December 1974. Gold reached an all time high of nearly $200/oz on December 30, 1974. And as we can see it steadily climbed up. Gold prices began a bull run pushing from a baseline of $40 to $200 between May 1971 and December 1974. Then this happened: After the introduction of futures trading gold price fell and lost 50% value by August 31, 1976 Futures were introduced on December 31, 1974 coindentally a day after gold reached nearly $200/oz. Over the subsquent two years gold prices fell reaching a low of $102 on August 31, 1976 representing nearly 50% loss in value. Futures launch seemed to have a pround negative impact on the price of gold. But futures didn’t kill gold: Gold futures launch and subsequent correction preceded additional price appreciation. Gold’s ATH at futures launch is just a blip on the chart. After the initial correction price appreciated leading to two clear major sets of peaks. One cluster in early 1980 and a series of peaks in 2011-2012. We will use this price action as our guide. Bitcoin Futures Bitcoin began its bull run in late 2016. As discussed above price accelerated coinciding with the futures announcement. We know what happened after futures trading started. After futures trading Bitcoin’s price fell to a low of $6700 on April 6, 2018. In this Bitcoin chart we see a pattern similar to the post futures gold chart playing out over a shorter time period. Price peaked on the day the first CME futures contracts traded and over the next 117 days fell to a low of $6700 representing nearly 70% loss of value. Here are the charts side by side (gold on the left): Gold charts on the left and Bitcoin’s on the right. Pre futures are the top panels, post futures are the bottom panels. The patterns are quite similar. Now that we have a reference let’s use gold’s post futures price chart as a guide for Bitcoin’s next move. Although the charts look similar the periods are quite different which will require us to normalize the timeframe. Introduction of futures will be our common starting date: Gold futures launch — December 31, 1974. Subsequent low August 23, 1976 Bitcoin futures launch — December 17, 2017. Subsequent low April 6, 2018 Normalization factor: Gold futures launch, ATH to low = 601 days. Bitcoin futures launch, ATH to low = 117 days. Normalization factor = 601 days/117 days = 5.1 Bitcoin moves 5.1X faster than gold using these start and end dates. (N.B. Crypto Quantic calculated Bitcoin price moved 4.3X gold.) Now we will use this factor to calculate Bitcoin’s next ATH date: Gold post futures low to next ATH =1232 days Bitcoin post futures low to next ATH = 1232/5.1 = 242 days Bitcoin new ATH = April 6, 2018 + 242 days = December 3, 2018 How about price? Gold pre futures ATH = $200 Gold post futures next ATH = $850 Appreciation factor =4.3 Bitcoin pre futures ATH = $20,000 Bitcoin post futures next ATH = $20,000 x 4.3 = $86,000 My earlier analysis shared here pointed to a $70K peak on December 10, 2018. Comparing the earlier with the current analysis we get: Using my Bitcoin bubble analysis (unpublished), Bitcoin’s next peak price will be in early December 2018. Current analysis using the gold model proposes a similar date. These two analyses use different methods and have arrived at approximately the same dates and prices for Bitcoin’s next peak. There is variation in peak value but within the range delimited by the upper and lower boundaries of the bubble zone. As of this writing Bitcoin’s price is oscillating around $8K. Remember in 2017 price appreciated nearly 3X in less than 60 days. If Bitcoin’s price gradually rises and reaches $15K in the fall, year-end new ATH price will be within reach. This outcome though is predicated on April 6, 2018 price remaining the low in the current cycle. A Higher Calling Crypto Quantic’s analysis also included looking at future Bitcoin price peaks as correlated to gold’s. He estimated that Bitcoin’s maximum price would be around $180K. …an eventual rise to $60k — $80k before another major pull back, with a final run up to $180k. Bitcoin will exceed this value as network effects absent in gold will continue to power growth to orders of magnitude greater value. Secondary and tertiary layers will be additional catalysts. Social awareness, growing adoption of cryptocurrencies by Millennials and HODL philosophy will also play important roles in price appreciation. If Bitcoin follows Metcalfe’s law and mimics earlier cycles it can reach Tim Draper ’s $250K price point near the end of 2021. Multiple bubbles with intervening corrections. Tim Draper’s $250K estimate can be reached at the end of a future bubble in 2021. Of course all of this is speculative and based on loose math (mathemagics?). These are at best guestimates and at worst completely wrong. Bias plays a role as well (see disclosure below). But given the attention Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed I believe we are in the early stages of a fundamental and disruptive shift in financial technology akin to what the internet did to many industries. I remind myself that ecommerce has transformed how we shop yet only accounts for 8% of U.S. retail sales. There is still much room for growth. Cryptocurrency is a nascent industry. It’s just warming up. Acknowledgments This journey into Bitcoin and price analysis was inspired by many people. I wish to acknowledge a few. Crypto Quantic Ph.D  — this article owes much to his earlier analysis of gold and Bitcoin futures. Parabolic Trav  — his deep knowledge of markets has pushed me to learn about technical analysis and the psychology of equities and crypto trading. Chris Burniske , Willy Woo, and Dmitry Kalichkin earlier work on crypto valuation methods spurred my interest in this subject. My next articles will address Bitcoin Bubbles and Hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin has seen unprecedented price appreciation against a background of volatility. The “predictions” are academic exercises and should not misconstrued as investment advice.

Alongside adding the decentralized exchange (Dex), the firm has also revealed it is retiring the name GDAX and that platform will soon be known as ‘Coinbase Pro.’\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Stormy Weather Continues to Plague Cryptocurrency Traders Coinbase Exchange Acquires Decentralized Token-Relay Platform Paradex\nCoinbase has revealed some interesting decisions today as the cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage service purchased a peer-to-peer Dex that allows users to swap “hundreds of tokens” like ERC-20s. According to various reports, Coinbase plans to “enhance” the Paradex protocol and launch the service to international customers located outside of the U.S. Reuters details that Coinbase purchased the platform for an undisclosed sum.\nBasically, the Paradex development team of ten, explains the platform allows the peer-to-peer relay of ERC-20 tokens on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The system is entirely decentralized by utilizing the 0x protocol which provides “handling settlement without necessitating user accounts or taking custodianship of users’ funds,” explains the Paradex team.\nToday the Paradex website states:\nWe know we’ve been a little quiet, but we’ve been hard at work, and we’re incredibly excited to share that Paradex is joining Coinbase — While we work to integrate with Coinbase, the Paradex app will be temporarily unavailable, starting today, May 23, at 3pm ET. This doesn’t change our commitment to our users — We’re still working hard to build the best relayer, now with a larger team and more resources. GDAX Will be Overhauled Into ‘Coinbase Pro’\nCoinbase also told the press it would “eventually” provide Paradex services to U.S. customers but it needs to make compliance changes first. The firm headquartered in San Francisco also announced the same day that it was completely overhauling and rebranding the GDAX exchange. This summer GDAX will be known as ‘ Coinbase Pro’ the company explained on Wednesday. The Coinbase Pro Trading Interface.\nDavid Farmer, the General Manager of Coinbase Pro, detailed the trading platform will be more intuitive with a simplified deposit and withdrawal process. Further, the exchange will offer improved charts and access to historical data while also offering a new portfolio feature called ‘My Wallets.’\n“As the decentralized ecosystem advances, we expect there will be many more opportunities for customers to interact with digital assets in new and unique ways,” Farmer states .\nThe news follows the trading platform’s plan to offer institutional custody services , and purchasing the website Earn.com .\nWhat do you think about Coinbase purchasing Paradex?

In the meantime, Bitcoin continues to move lower towards the $7,000 line in an overall gloomy week for digital currencies. U.S. Justice Department Launches Criminal Investigation Into Cryptocurrency Price Manipulation\nU.S. federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a criminal probe that focuses on price manipulation schemes, including spoofing – a widely practiced form of price influence in which traders flood the market with fake orders in order to bait other players into taking the opposite side – and wash trading, in which the cheater trades with themself to create a false impression of market demand and trading volume.\nExtreme market volatility and lack of regulatory oversight over trading platforms have led the justice system and financial watchdogs in the U.S. to worry over the cryptocurrency market and potential criminal market plays. China has cracked down on its cryptocurrency ecosystem , particularly Bitcoin miners, trading platforms, and digital currency payments solutions providers, over similar concerns, but also in order to keep its centralized financial system unchallenged.\nNew regulatory actions promoted in Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, the Philippines, and other countries, may have helped drown the price of Bitcoin in 2018. Bitcoin came from its all-time highs in the $20,000 area only to be pulled down as the new year promised more government coordination regarding cryptocurrencies.\nGemini Trust , the New York-based digital asset exchange led by the Winklevoss twins, has recently hired Nasdaq Inc. to conduct surveillance of cryptocurrency trading on their platform. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have called for the creation of a self-regulatory body made up by trading platforms within the industry.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, many of which not even registered with the relevant financial watchdog. In the U.S., the CFTC is capable of imposing fines on spot market fraud even though the agency does not regulate it.\nJohn Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied cryptocurrency market manipulation told Bloomberg that limited oversight of digital currency trading makes it a target for crooks.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nPrice manipulation within the cryptocurrency market, whether it is spoofing or wash trading, could break investor confidence in such a young niche trading asset. Market capitalization has been in decline since early May, having lost nearly $150 billion from those highs.

Sarah Jenn | May 24, 2018 | 3:47 am\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price continues to trend lower but is currently testing short-term support. A bullish divergence can be seen on stochastic, signaling a possible bounce back to the top. The Fibonacci retracement tool shows the nearby upside targets.\nBitcoin price could be due for a bounce off the channel support back to the nearby Fibonacci retracement levels.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. The gap between the moving averages is also widening to reflect strengthening bearish pressure. This signals that a break of support is still plausible.\nHowever, RSI is already indicating oversold conditions and may be ready to pull up. In that case, bitcoin price could retreat to the 38.2% Fib near the mid-channel area of interest around $7,900 or the 50% level at the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point. The 200 SMA lines up with the highest Fib at the $8,200 level and the channel resistance.\nStochastic has formed slightly higher lows while price made lower lows, creating a bullish divergence. This is another strong signal for a possible bounce. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price continues to reel from profit-taking and the lack of positive industry updates. Even though the dollar lost some ground to its peers after the release of the FOMC meeting minutes for May, BTC/USD has carried on with the drop, presumably from negative remarks by Fed official Kashkari earlier on.\nIn addition, another report by the Fed signaled that bitcoin has a hypothetical value of just $1,800. Joost van der Burgt of the Federal Reserve of San Francisco wrote:\n“…the exchange rate between two currencies can be regarded as a broad measure of the prices of one country’s goods and services relative to another country. When looking at the Bitcoin ‘exchange rate,’ this category of determinants seems to be inapplicable – there is no current native Bitcoin economy with native Bitcoin prices for goods and services.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Short-Term Bullish Divergence Seen? was last modified: May 24th, 2018 by Sarah Jenn ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah jenn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T08:04:30.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec4726646a4f7b91110772a0217fa6862ce09fff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSI7.defLbdsj1aMHxFeuamD5peCtjiskpY9KJV8TxkklJvBfNqoADr5FyPH_Vrc._d07JHFrSXS6037zJeA60o57zkiguFET1M.AMtubVctEPS2AWsKLKkiBOcVBdPMCMPyYQ4GDe.yolPNHHrQtO4", "site_full": "forexandcryptocurrencynews.com", "site": "forexandcryptocurrencynews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "London Fintech Firm Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading - Forex and Cryptocurrency", "title_full": "London Fintech Firm Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading - Forex and Cryptocurrency", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec4726646a4f7b91110772a0217fa6862ce09fff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSI7.defLbdsj1aMHxFeuamD5peCtjiskpY9KJV8TxkklJvBfNqoADr5FyPH_Vrc._d07JHFrSXS6037zJeA60o57zkiguFET1M.AMtubVctEPS2AWsKLKkiBOcVBdPMCMPyYQ4GDe.yolPNHHrQtO4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "London Fintech Firm Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading - Forex and Cryptocurrency", "text": "London Fintech Firm Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading Posted on\nThe British based company that created the first app allowing customers to invest in Bitcoin has announced it will add Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as it completes series C fundraising of $250 million. Revolut to add Ripple and Bitcoin Cash to its App\nFour-year-old Revolut founded by former institutional trader Nikolay Storonsky began as an app only banking service allowing users to exchange money between currencies instantly at low fees through a debit card valid in 150 countries but is now continuing its push into the crypto space by adding the third and fourth most popular coins according to market value.\nRevolut became the first banking app to allow investment in Bitcoin last December. Saying that “ hundreds of thousands ” of its 1.8 million costumers have chosen to use that option it will now offer them the chance to buy Ripple and Bitcoin Cash as well.\nRipple exploded out of obscurity in 2017 as its price increased 37,000% during the height of the cryptocurrency craze and has maintained a top position since then despite the bear market atmosphere of 2018. Bitcoin Cash was hard forked from Bitcoin by supporters who claim that it’s faster transaction times makes it more usable for real-time purchases.\nChief technology officer, Vlad Yatsenko, said the demand for adding both currencies has been “ overwhelming “. Revolut allows people to invest in cryptocurrency with little to no know-how as the app buys and holds the coins on their behalf. Mr. Yatsenko explained in The Telegraph that it is “ a simple way for consumers to get exposure ”. $250 million in New Investment\nRevolut announced its addition of XRP and BCH on the heels of completing a series C round of investment which brought in $250 million and raised the companies overall valuation to $1.7 billion. This latest round of investment was headed by DST Investment based in Hong Kong which was an early supporter of both Facebook and Spotify.\nThe company blog reported that “Revolut is now backed by a portfolio of investors who helped nurture and grow the likes of Airbnb and Spotify.”\nSpurred on by the infusion of new money Revolut has plans to bulk up its engineering and design staff in order to expand into the United States, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand this year.\n“ By expanding overseas, we will be empowering millions of people to take control over their financial lives, and in the process, we will be reducing the cost of international transfers by partnering with the best players in the financial world ,” the company statement read.\nImage from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "revolut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikolay storonsky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency london fintech firm revolut", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T11:39:14.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15b36fa057efa22e506fc77fbad9e90b9615ec27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Ljox3BQa5wayscegyxKSAzZb6z8dWR12dbjTp8PRhO8kUQrVmaAlgDID_3zdLcL.MyUN3gHh9oOzvvJNGMyf21.tomgTTZ4fPz24.BejwDaw--", "site_full": "ethereum-infochain.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Ethereum Infochain: Revolut Users Make 100,000 Bitcoin, Litecoin And Ethereum ... - Forbes", "title_full": "Ethereum Infochain: Revolut Users Make 100,000 Bitcoin, Litecoin And Ethereum ... - Forbes", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IL", "spam_score": 0.292, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15b36fa057efa22e506fc77fbad9e90b9615ec27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Ljox3BQa5wayscegyxKSAzZb6z8dWR12dbjTp8PRhO8kUQrVmaAlgDID_3zdLcL.MyUN3gHh9oOzvvJNGMyf21.tomgTTZ4fPz24.BejwDaw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ethereum Infochain: Revolut Users Make 100,000 Bitcoin, Litecoin And Ethereum ... - Forbes", "text": "Revolut Users Make 100,000 Bitcoin, Litecoin And Ethereum ...

Well, US authorities have apparently heard your whining because they are now reportedly suspicious manipulation is indeed occurring.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street\nSpoofing and Wash Trading\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly launched a criminal investigation to determine if big money traders are manipulating the prices of Bitcoin, Ether and possibly other cryptocurrencies. The illicit trade tactics that the DOJ is looking into include spoofing and wash trading, and federal prosecutors are working in collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the investigation, this according to “four people familiar with the matter” cited by Bloomberg .\nSpoofing refers to creating false buy orders to attract other traders (usually bots) to get in, with the intention of manipulating the market price in order to make a profit by actually selling. The Dodd-Frank Act defines spoofing as “the illegal practice of bidding or offering with intent to cancel before execution.” Similarly, wash trading is when someone simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading activity, meant to make it appear as if an asset has more trade volume than it really does.\nWhy Now?\nUS authorities are reportedly concerned that cryptocurrency markets are prone to manipulation for a number of reasons including doubts that all trading venues are on the lookout for fraudsters, massive price swings that make it possible to steer valuations and a lack of strong regulations on crypto exchanges.\nWhile many will surely applaud the DOJ for its diligence in protecting crypto investors, skeptics might wonder if US authorities are not doing this also in an effort to further cool the market down by frightening investors. They are not generally known to be welcoming toward the field, and only recently it was revealed that American regulators also took part in a crackdown on what they call “fraudulent ICOs and crypto-asset investment products.”\nAre cryptocurrency prices manipulated and is it the US DOJ’s job to investigate these global markets at all?

In the US, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned of the risks associated with cryptocurrency investment and noted that they hold substantially less investor protection than traditional securities markets.\nThe Justice Department and CFTC didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nSource: CNET\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T07:14:12.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cbf2be16a8580a5967d5e137055a6d130b833dd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTTdMQIT1Uae83UjqK1Ib_iAkj1azuhg_e8gvhq3ngFKg--", "site_full": "europeunion.press", "site": "europeunion.press", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["politics", "financial_news", "law_government_and_politics", "finance", "media"], "section_title": "", "title": "US launches criminal probe into Bitcoin – EuropeUnion 🇪🇺 Breaking News 🌐", "title_full": "US launches criminal probe into Bitcoin – EuropeUnion 🇪🇺 Breaking News 🌐", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.565, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cbf2be16a8580a5967d5e137055a6d130b833dd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTTdMQIT1Uae83UjqK1Ib_iAkj1azuhg_e8gvhq3ngFKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US launches criminal probe into Bitcoin – EuropeUnion 🇪🇺 Breaking News 🌐", "text": "EuropeUnion Comments Off on NASA video shows amazing 3D flyover of Jupiter’s intense north pole ——- Have a look at this also ——- Latest News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jupiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:18:51.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a04e1f18b2e22870a4867ba5924fa6dbb1e43b38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyeRjYGVLJTCICekTbROep9CSzfbvoB1g4.rWQF.6VlyfzsU8FMvWyqWjQXwXXw.17KpmYCwmYoSocEe33l6GXBStFi082HBkNJnMeOc7tAc35JfERZ_XI79vKWQBPndk-", "site_full": "coinspectator.com", "site": "coinspectator.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports", "tech", "adult", "social", "climbing", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Suffered a Double Attack, $ 18.6 M BTG Were Stolen | Bitcoin Gold,miner,btg,cryptocurrency,attack,hacked,News - CoinSpectator", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gold Suffered a Double Attack, $ 18.6 M BTG Were Stolen | Bitcoin Gold,miner,btg,cryptocurrency,attack,hacked,News - CoinSpectator", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a04e1f18b2e22870a4867ba5924fa6dbb1e43b38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyeRjYGVLJTCICekTbROep9CSzfbvoB1g4.rWQF.6VlyfzsU8FMvWyqWjQXwXXw.17KpmYCwmYoSocEe33l6GXBStFi082HBkNJnMeOc7tAc35JfERZ_XI79vKWQBPndk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Gold Suffered A Double Attack", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Suffered a Double Attack, $ 18.6 M BTG Were Stolen | Bitcoin Gold,miner,btg,cryptocurrency,attack,hacked,News - CoinSpectator", "text": "Bitcoin Gold Suffered a Double Attack, $ 18.6 M BTG Were Stolen\nPublished 1 hour ago by Adriana Midrigan Bitcoin Gold miner btg cryptocurrency attack hacked News\nCoindoo via coindoo.com He then explained that a miner with illegal intentions attempted to extract the funds held by the crypto exchange. To gain access to platform data, the miner has managed to purchase more than 51% of the total hashpower, which gave the assured control of the blocks. Even though the Bitcoin Gold network can’t be compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum at block size, it’s costly to buy a large percentage of the hashpower.Once the miner succeeded in gaining control over the platform system, he tried to trade BTG directly to crypto exchanges and crypto wallets. A specific number of BTGs were deposited at exchanges, respectively withdrawn in the following moments. According to the reports, since 16 May the miner has sent over 388,200 BTG to a personal address.Bearing in mind that it was a double attack, the researchers of the attack assumed that the miner would have stolen more than $ 18.6 million worth in cryptocurrencies. The last transaction was recorded on 18 May, but there is no barrier that could prevent the attacker from resuming operations in case he has yet the necessary hashpower. According to Bitcoin Gold, the attacker has successfully managed to reverse the transfers from 22 blocks. Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service.

The online travel agency is now accepting bitcoin cash (BCH), dash (DASH), and litecoin (LTC) payments for its offerings. CheapAir Expands Cryptocurrency Support\nThe three additions will strengthen the travel agency’s cryptocurrency community support hold that has been growing over the years.\nIn 2013, CheapAir became the first travel agency to accept bitcoin (BTC) as a payment option for booking hotel rooms and Amtrak train seats. The company, later on, added support for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC), on bitcoin sales surging to $1.5 million .\nCheapAir ‘s support for cryptocurrencies payments has seen it cement its reputation when it comes to adoption of the new payment option. The addition of new cryptocurrencies was triggered by growing customer demand for such payment options. The travel agency also added the new digital currencies to address the shortcomings of current currencies and the challenges that have come to be, with the usage of bitcoin.\nAdding support for other cryptocurrencies will seek to address the shortcomings of bitcoin . Network congestion and higher transaction fees have seen most people shun the popular cryptocurrency, with the focus now shifting to the likes of bitcoin cash and litecoin.\n“Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much. Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested,” said CheapAir CEO Jeff Klee. Source: Twitter Cryptocurrencies Payments Proliferation\nCryptocurrencies bookings are also backed by the agency’s Price Drop Payback , a price guarantee that gives customers up to $100 in travel credit in case a flight fare drops.\nAccepting cryptocurrencies payments on behalf of hotel suppliers and airlines has had its fair share of challenges given the constant price fluctuations. However, CheapAir insists it has solved a good number of the problems and should continue offering support for the foreseeable future.\nWhile CheapAir was the first to accept cryptocurrencies payments for hotel and flight bookings, it is no longer the only one offering such services. Integration of such payments into the mainstream sector has gained momentum in the recent past. ABitSky, BTCTrip, and Destinia are examples of other travel sites that allow people to purchase flights using bitcoin .\nSince Madrid-based Destinia started accepting bitcoin payments, the agency claims to have registered a spike in such payments in contrast to credit card payments. Cryptocurrency Merchant Adoption\nThere needs to be real merchant adoption if cryptocurrencies are to compete with fiat currencies in future . Very few merchants accept such payments and those that do, do not account for a considerable chunk of market share in their respective fields of operation.\nCryptocurrency merchant adoption is still lagging even with bitcoin’s meteoric rise to become one of the most sought-after investment. Accelerated adoption has been stiffed by the fact that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile, something that affects their value, unlike fiat currencies that are relatively stable.\nMerchants have shied away from adopting such payment on concerns that they could affect their returns, given their constant value fluctuation. Regulatory concerns have also had a catastrophic impact on the adoption of cryptocurrencies as there are areas and countries where dealing in cryptocurrencies is banned. For instance, banks and other financial institutions in India are prohibited from providing support for cryptocurrencies payments.

Investors and traders of digital coins, businesses working with cryptocurrency and tax advisors, of course, can now find answers to many but not all of their questions. The notice has been issued at a time when tax authorities across Europe are trying to tap into crypto incomes and profits in the absence of dedicated regulations in most cases.\nAlso read: Poland Backpedals on “Irrational” Crypto Tax After Strong Backlash Cryptos to Be Treated Under ‘Normal’ Tax Rules\nThe “Tax and Duty Manual” issued by authorities in Ireland attempts to clarify matters related to crypto taxation and mostly confirms that the existing regulations apply to the crypto sector. The document provides guidelines on the tax treatment of various transactions involving cryptocurrencies. The Irish Revenue Commissioners, the government agency responsible for customs and taxation, emphasizes that the advisory published this month is to be used as a reference for tax purposes only, as it does not cover regulatory and other aspects.\nAccording to the instructions, direct taxes such as corporation tax, income tax and capital gains tax are applicable but each case should be reviewed separately, according to the individual facts and circumstances. In general, businesses accepting crypto payments for goods or services should keep records of crypto transactions. No special rules have been introduced so far and taxable profits should be calculated according to the current tax legislation.\nThe profits and losses of a company transacting in cryptocurrency must be reflected in accounts and are taxable under “normal CT rules,” the document states. Ireland’s Taxes Consolidation Act from 1997 recognizes that some businesses operate and prepare their accounts in a “functional currency” other than euro. The authors of the manual point out, however, that cryptocurrencies cannot be considered functional currencies as defined in Section 402(1) of the TCA. Therefore, accounts for tax purposes cannot be maintained in crypto. Instead, euro or other fiat currency should be used.\nIrish tax officials have explained crypto income taxation, as well. “Profits and losses of a non-incorporated business on cryptocurrency transactions must be reflected in their accounts and will be taxable on normal income tax rules,” the notice reads. They have also informed taxpayers that gains and losses incurred on cryptocurrencies are chargeable or allowable for capital gains tax if they accrue to an individual, or for corporate tax on chargeable gains for companies. Bitcoin Is Currency as Far as VAT is Concerned\nIn the absence of common European guidelines on how to treat cryptocurrencies for tax purposes, many member-states have decided to base their VAT (Value Added Tax) policies on a ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU from 2015. The Luxembourg-based institution has drawn a parallel between “virtual currencies” and fiat money, when they are used for payments. The Republic of Ireland is now joining these countries confirming that bitcoin constitutes a currency for VAT purposes.\nIn result, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are regarded as “negotiable instruments” and exempt from VAT in accordance with the Irish VAT Consolidation Act of 2010. The manual notes this applies to companies buying and selling cryptocurrencies and acting as owners of crypto holdings. On the other hand, value added tax is due from suppliers of goods or services sold for cryptocurrencies. The taxable amount, however, should again be calculated in euro and at the time of the supply.\nThe Irish Revenue Commissioners point out that the value of bitcoin and other cryptos may vary between trading platforms. In the absence of a single exchange rate, a “reasonable effort should be made to use an appropriate valuation for the transaction in question,” the manual says, without detailing what “reasonable” and “appropriate” may mean in practice.\nIncome received from mining operations will generally be outside the scope of the value added tax. Crypto mining is not considered an economic activity for VAT purposes yet. It’s worth noting that no instructions have been given on the taxation of incomes, profits and other flows related to initial coin offerings. The document issued by the Irish revenue service does not say anything about digital tokens and token sales.\nDo you think the Irish tax manual provides enough clarity in regards to crypto taxation?

BTG forums seem to have been tracking the hack, going as far back as last week, monitoring the controversial coin’s hashrate, ultimately determining a 51% attack was under way.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash Bitcoin Gold Gets $18 Million Haircut\n“An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use ‘51% attacks,’” Bitcoin Gold forum poster Mental Nomad announced a week ago, “to perform ‘double spend’ attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.”\nA founding economic principle of bitcoin was its alleviation of the double spend problem. It was a main stumbling block in the historical race to create a viable cryptographic monetary form – foiling a great many coders along the way. Satoshi Nakamoto solved it through a decentralized, distributed ledger confirmation process (blockchain). Going as far back as its genesis block from early 2009, users can be confident transactions aren’t rebroadcast. Like clockwork, 6 times an hour, blocks are added – copied to nodes within the universal network. The offending wallet, according to the BTG team.\nOne way to achieve double spending is known as a 51% attack. It’s accomplished by bogarting the network’s computing power. With a majority, bad actors can get between the Nakamoto solution and transaction confirmations. By stymieing block completion in the usual manner, all sorts of mischief can arise: blockchain mining rewards redirected, users’ transactions reversed, etc. Not too long after, a double spending attack can commence, acting as the fiat equivalent to counterfeiting. Needless to type, any crypto suffering from such a problem is certain to immediately lose user confidence. Such attacks are interesting for another reason, as Mental Nomad is careful to point out. “There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets,” he assured last week. “It appears that actions on the part of the exchanges have deterred the attacker, for now.” And hitting exchanges tends to elicit little sympathy, at least initially, due to users being insulated. Exchanges are particularly vulnerable because they generally covet large deposits, which only compounds the problem in cases like these. GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft\nOver period of days, batches of BTG were deposited into exchanges supporting the forked coin, only to be sent back to the depositor’s wallet. The lag between such a transaction and some exchanges’ discovery is sufficient enough to nab tokens, doubling the filthy lucre. Exchanges trading bitcoin gold have responded by upping transaction confirmation filters, but evidently to no avail as the attacker gains ever-more BTG network control.\nBitcoin Gold team members seem to have communicated with some exchanges. “Requiring more confirmations greatly increases safety,” the forum details. “Until now, some Exchanges were operating with less than five confirmations required. We have been urging higher limits to prevent such an attack, and urging manual review of large deposits of BTG before clearing the funds for trading.” Indeed, according to BTG, “One of the targeted Exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past. In their words, ‘we are 100% sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.’” The traditional way BTC has been able to thwart double spend attacks.\nEvidence put forward by the BTG team points to address GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft as the attacker’s wallet; mined coins, according to the forum post reside at GXXjRkdquAkyHeJ6ReW3v4FY3QbgPfugTx. More than 388,201.92404001 BTG were funneled through the wallet, totalling more than $18 million according to Bitcoin Gold Explorer . That a top thirty crypto by market cap can be so easily troubled is a giant of enough problem, but it could also take exchanges down in the process – something the ecosystem is very sensitive to since Mt. Gox. And though, for now, BTG is confident enough to suggest users are not at risk, history shows that can quickly be the case as an exchange freezes withdrawals in an effort to stop hemorrhaging.\nBitcoin Gold has been beset by controversies since its birth fork late last year, including a recent dust-up between BCH advocate Craig Wright and BTG founder Jack Liao . To be fair, however, it is not the only blockchain to suffer a 51% attack. Mere days ago, recently Chinese government highly rated coin verge (XVG) was made to heel, again. These pages reported XVG, “On the morning of May 22, Suprvona, one of the largest altcoin mining pools, informed its 19,000 Twitter followers that verge was suffering yet another 51% attack, causing all blocks to be rejected.”\nDo you think the BTG hack spells doom for the coin?

That is, except for bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD).\nA new Justice Department probe into cryptocurrency manipulation was reported today, and while we don't have all of the details, sources have indicated that bitcoin and Ethereum trading are specifically being targeted. Here's a rundown of the news, and what it could mean to cryptocurrencies from a longer-term perspective.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nToday's cryptocurrency prices Here's a look at the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and how much each has changed over the past 24 hours. As you can see, all of them are positive for the day, except for bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD).\nCryptocurrency Name (Code)\nPrice in U.S. Dollars\nDay's Change\nBitcoin (BTC)\n$7,514.30\n(2.4%)\nEthereum (ETH)\n$581.19\n(1.8%)\nRipple (XRP)\n$0.62\n4.3%\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n$1,026.70\n2.8%\nEOS (EOS)\n$11.87\n9.8%\nLitecoin (LTC)\n$122.02\n1.5%\nStellar (XLM)\n$0.28\n4.8%\nCardano (ADA)\n$0.20\n1.3%\nTRON (TRX)\n$0.07\n5.4%\nIOTA (MIOTA)\n$1.50\n5.8%\nData source: www.investing.com. Prices and daily changes as of May 24, 2018, at approximately 12:30 p.m. EDT, and prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate.\nA price-manipulation investigation specifically targets bitcoin and Ethereum A probe into price manipulation of cryptocurrencies has been opened by the U.S. Justice Department, according to a report by Bloomberg. And the report's sources specifically named bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) as two coins prosecutors are looking at. This comes on the heels of several other recent regulatory actions, such as a crackdown on cryptocurrency scams and a stern warning from the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe investigation is focusing on a tactic known as \"spoofing,\" where traders enter a wave of orders, which are subsequently cancelled once the orders cause the price of the targeted asset to move up or down. It also focuses on a tactic called \"wash trading,\" which is a term that refers to people trading with themselves in order to create the illusion of market demand for an asset. Lack of regulation and high volatility make cryptocurrencies far more susceptible to these types of fraud than stocks, bonds, and other heavily regulated assets.\nMake no mistake -- this is good news It's no wonder that news of the investigation is causing uneasiness among cryptocurrency investors. After all, there's no way to know at this point just how much price manipulation is going on or how the elimination of these types of manipulative activities could ultimately affect the prices of bitcoin and Ethereum.\nHowever, just like I've written about regulation in general , this is good news for the cryptocurrency industry from a long-term perspective. The potential for manipulation may be a major factor keeping institutional investors away, and most people (cryptocurrency investors or not) would agree that taking steps to eliminate price manipulation schemes is a worthy cause and an essential part of a healthy cryptocurrency market.\nHaving said that, as the investigation plays out, don't be surprised to see some continued volatility and pressure, especially on bitcoin and Ethereum.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:35:32.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e3230819c11f93ff427ba5ceccf4ef216833f89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWUnnBHyUA8h_KAmmP6gRU7lCTMC9vnsXTX.vf03TGkCmPkLp.m.SCn1qrfgcnSZI-", "site_full": "bitsonline.com", "site": "bitsonline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Coinbase Acquires Paradex Exchange, Shifts GDAX to Coinbase Pro | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Coinbase Acquires Paradex Exchange, Shifts GDAX to Coinbase Pro | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.231, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-wp-repository/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/23221031/Pro.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e3230819c11f93ff427ba5ceccf4ef216833f89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWUnnBHyUA8h_KAmmP6gRU7lCTMC9vnsXTX.vf03TGkCmPkLp.m.SCn1qrfgcnSZI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coinbase Acquires Paradex Exchange, Shifts GDAX to Coinbase Pro | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "Coinbase Acquires Paradex Exchange, Shifts GDAX to Coinbase Pro May 24, 2018 | Bitsonline | Shares: 2\nTwo major moves from top American fiat-to-crypto gateway Coinbase today, as the exchange acquired decentralized exchange Paradex and announced rebranding its trading arm GDAX to “Coinbase Pro.” The moves are just their latest among a flurry of activity in 2018.

sources familiar with the probe, Bloomberg is reporting that the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is working alongside the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the markets

Stock of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has surged 358 percent this year. While staggering, lesser-known competitors have seen even bigger gains, such as the more than 4,000 percent increase for ethereum. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg More The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter. The investigation is focused on illegal practices that can influence prices -- such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the review is private. Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said. More from Bloomberg.com: Pompeo Affirms, Reluctantly, That Russia Tried to Help Trump Win Authorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets. Bitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 percent to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. It’s down more than 20 percent since a May 4 peak. Such concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street. More from Bloomberg.com: Here’s How Much Money You Need for Bankers to Think You’re Rich Traders Colluding? The illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading -- forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Market manipulation has been an increasingly popular topic in crypto world - particularly since prices started their historic surge.\nLast summer, the SEC established the legal precedent that all digital tokens should be treated like legitimate securities and required them to be registered with the agency. Meanwhile, the CFTC, which is also working with the DOJ, declared bitcoin a commodity back in 2015, and is responsible for regulating bitcoin futures.\nInvestigators will likely look to bring charges against traders who engaged in spoofing - flooding the market with fake orders to push a price up or down depending on one's position. Another illicit tactic that the DOJ is looking into is called wash trading, which is also prevalent in equity and futures markets. Wash traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume in an otherwise illiquid market.\nThe probe is reportedly focusing on bitcoin and ether, according to Bloomberg's sources.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US's latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise - it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 - has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nGiven the pressure that the IRS has put on companies like Coinbase to turn over customer information, the DOJ investigation could also ensnare a few exchanges - particularly after the collapse of Mt Gox, the former Tokyo-based exchange has been liquidated after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its customers' bitcoin.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the limited oversight of the crypto market (the same reason given by the SEC for rejecting a proposed rule change that would've cleared the way for an ETF) makes it vulnerable to fraud. And exchanges are increasingly realizing that if manipulation isn't eliminated, or at least suppressed, that customers could start walking away from what they now believe to be a rigged market... then again, investors have stuck with stocks and bonds through every financial crisis in the history of modern, post-central bank \"capitalism.\"\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets. \"There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,\" Griffin said. \"It would be easy to spoof this market.\"\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThat said, good luck : determining who is manipulating prices and who has inside information would be next to impossible in the anonymous world of bitcoin, which is subject to different regulations in different markets. Japan and the Philippines have already developed their own legal framework for crypto markets.\nStudies have shown that 1,000 people own 40% of the bitcoin market. Given this naturally top-heavy concentration, it could be difficult for prosecutors to prove that there's anything illegal going on when the largest players step up to trade.\nIronically, most of the recent \"manipulation\" has been to the detriment of bulls: for example, when the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee who has earned the nickname \"the Tokyo Whale\" for his ability to crash prices while unloading massive quantities of bitcoin decides to sell tens of thousands of bitcoins in a single block - crashing the price - is he manipulating the market?\nBut that doesn't mean spoofing isn't happening. For years, the twitter user @bitfinexed (who has since switched his account to private) has documented the work of \"spoofy\" ( who was also profiled here ) - a nickname he used for a group of traders who would place, and then cancel, large orders on different exchanges. He has also highlighted other shady behavior, like the Bitfinexed tether token, which is supposed to allow crypto traders to go from cash to coin more quickly. But we imagine - particularly as more institutions become exposed to the bitcoin market - that the Feds will investigate every scrap of potentially nefarious activity in due time.\nMeanwhile, we imagine crypto enthusiasts will be less than delighted at this news, with accusations that the US is turning into China set to emerge as crypto doomsayers claim the US government is finally making its move against bitcoin.

And the report’s sources specifically named bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) as two coins prosecutors are looking at. This comes on the heels of several other recent regulatory actions, such as a crackdown on cryptocurrency scams and a stern warning from the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe investigation is focusing on a tactic known as “spoofing,” where traders enter a wave of orders, which are subsequently cancelled once the orders cause the price of the targeted asset to move up or down. It also focuses on a tactic called “wash trading,” which is a term that refers to people trading with themselves in order to create the illusion of market demand for an asset.

Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders Colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading -- forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nSpoofing Is a Silly Name for Serious Market Rigging: QuickTake\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise -- it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 -- has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nRead More: SEC Tries to Scam ICO Investors to Show Them How Easy It Is\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry.\nRead More: A Crypto Giant Fights Cheating.

Silvergate Chief Executive Alan Lane told to the Wall Street Journal that “At what point as a banker do you pull your head out of the sand?

Huobi further states that the main force index will be published by Bloomberg and other communication organizations later on, and users may view the index by logging in on their devices.\n“The goal here is to provide a complete and organized tool which will help enhance the overall knowledge of the blockchain industry. We are committed to bringing more insights and data so key stakeholders can make the most knowledgeable decisions when it comes to their investments,” said Leon Li, founder and CEO of Huobi Group. US Megabanks Less Safe Than Crypto?\nAmericans now have a new reason to consider moving their money away from big banks to cryptocurrencies – the expected decision by banking regulators to water down the Volcker Rule, which restricts the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading with depositor funds. This according to the latest analysis by Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings. They explain that due to the rule changes, banks will now be able to gamble more freely in a scheme that gives them the quick profits but gives depositors the ultimate risks. In contrast, holders of cryptocurrencies are not exposed to those kinds of risks as they can control their money directly with no custody by third parties and no need to trust a central authority.\n“With this rule change, the authorities will make it easier for megabanks to take big risks with other people’s money. But they are making the change precisely when global debt levels imply record risks,” the authors argue. “In the future, cryptocurrencies will do such a fundamentally better job as a safe depository of funds it’s difficult to envision a world in which this technology does not become a game-changer for money and banking.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

That in itself is not really surprising, given the ongoing declines in the Bitcoin world. Even so, it remains to be seen how long this dip will last. eToro UK Managing Director Iqbal Gandham certainly has some interesting opinions in this regard. Can the Bitcoin Cash Price Recover Quickly?\nWhen the going gets tough in the cryptocurrency world, panic selling becomes a very tangible trend. This has been a big problem for as long as people can remember, and it will not necessarily improve anytime soon. In the case of the Bitcoin Cash price , it is evident panic selling is helping to push the price below $1,000 and keeping it there. That situation may come to change in the near future, though.\nThe most recent 6.48% Bitcoin Cash price decline comes at a rather unfortunate time. Some interesting developments are taking place to fund the future development of this altcoin. Even so, it isn’t sufficient to keep the Bitcoin Cash price afloat around the $1,300 mark. It is possible this trend reserves at some point. eToro UK Managing Director Iqbal Gandham thinks otherwise. He explains the situation as follows:\n“Though it recently upgraded its blockchain protocol, it seems that Bitcoin Cash has yet to reassure the crypto community that it can provide a more stable framework for transactions and that it really is ‘Bitcoin’. For over a year Bitcoin Cash has been fighting the battle to become the ‘default’ Bitcoin, a battle which traditionalists are not keen to lose. This lack of clarity, has repeatedly called into question the authenticity of Bitcoin Cash, and until that is resolved the direction of price movement will always carry an air of uncertainty.”\nDespite the $805.31m in 24-hour trading volume over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash holders and buyers are fighting a losing battle, by the look of things. If this bearish pressure doesn’t relent sooner rather than later, it is not unlikely the Bitcoin Cash price will dip to $900 and perhaps even lower. While not catastrophic, it would certainly put things in a very different perspective altogether.\nThe majority of trading volume originates from OKEx, which has been an important trading platform for various altcoins. Bitfinex and Huobi are competing for second place, although GDAX isn’t too far behind in this regard. HitBTC is in fifth place, which may come as a big surprise to a lot of people. Even so, two fiat currency pairs in the five is pretty significant for Bitcoin Cash, although the USDT pairs are clearly in the lead right now.\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen how the Bitcoin Cash price will evolve in the near future. As of right now, things are not looking all that promising, but the volatility of cryptocurrency can easily work both ways. Sooner or later, things will improve for the different cryptocurrencies, but for now, it doesn’t appear that change will occur in the coming days or weeks.

Article originally published by Forbes.\nBitcoin Cash declined sharply, falling to its lowest value since April.\nThe price of Bitcoin Cash, which is a hard fork of the original Bitcoin, plunged to as little as $978.27 today, according to CoinMarketCap.\nAt this price, it had fallen more than 17% in 24 hours, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.\nFurther, it was down more than 25% since surpassing $1,300 on Sunday.\n[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\nAs for what fueled these sharp declines, analysts have provided mixed views.

The antagonism doesn’t play to BCH’s long-term adoption.” Broader Market Movements\nSome analysts focused more on the broader digital currency market, emphasizing that it has been encountering some headwinds lately.\nThe total value of this market fell to as little as $324.7 billion today, down 12.7% over the last 24 hours and 17% since roughly the same time that Bitcoin Cash reached an intraday high on Sunday.\nDavid Johnson, CEO of tasking platform Latium, weighed in on these trends, emphasizing that Bitcoin Cash was certainly not the only digital currency to lose value in the last few days.\n“I am less inclined to blame this move on any kind of certainty that Bitcoin Cash is losing its following due to network issues,” he stated.\n“I am more inclined to say there are normal market correlations between Bitcoin and all other coins.”\nThe broader market has been experiencing a “small pull back,” which has helped push Bitcoin Cash lower, said Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of digital currency data platform CryptoCompare.\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether.\nThis article was written by Charles Bovaird from Forbes and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

As it’s, the common volumes within the final three weeks have been round 80 million and that’s lower than what propelled week ending April 29 candlestick when costs moved above $20 within the course of printing EOS ATHs. Technically, I stay bullish contemplating this misalignment in market participation ranges and volumes. Concurrently, whereas there are possibilities that patrons may leap in and assist elevate value motion within the run as much as June 2 mainnet launch, odds are costs may pose and consolidate earlier than we see resumption of bullish pattern in step with that conspicuous ATHs printing candlestick.

IJ works to gradual the expansion of presidency within the US in all its types: financial freedom, schooling, non-public property, freedom of speech, to not point out amicus briefs to the Supreme Court. Now bitcoiners might help help IJ’s invaluable work, an actual world use case, by way of Bitpay and bitcoin money (BCH).\nAlso learn: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash Freedom, a Use Case for Bitcoin Cash\nThis yr began very nicely for The Institute for Justice, a nationwide legislation agency taking the terribly unsexy instances the place authorities encroachment upon common people goes largely unnoticed. The venerable Pineapple Fund donated to “only 58 charities so far selected to receive a grant,” together with the IJ. In response to the January discover of receiving a grant, the Institute famous it could use the cash to “help us defend and secure the rights of hundreds of thousands of people like those you will read about in this issue of Liberty & Law, protecting them from government abuse and enabling them to live as free and responsible individuals.”\nThe Pineapple Fund was a basis of types lasting lower than half a yr. Started by a bitcoin core (BTC) whale, it garnered widespread reward within the cryptocurrency ecosystem for selling the thought a minimum of a few of the latest years’ good points must be put aside for causes working for a brighter future. And it grew to become yet one more connection between crypto and the Institute for Justice. A Thirty Year History Meets Money’s Future\nIn truth, the IJ has come to phrases with crypto cost supplier Bitpay, permitting supporters to donate in bitcoin money (BCH) as nicely. The greater charges and lag instances of bitcoin core (BTC) made it much less hospitable towards microtransactions comparable to lower-level giving. 100 bucks value right here, twenty there, had been merely eaten alive by transaction prices. A significantly better match, in the intervening time, is BCH for these very causes. And all donations are tax deductible.\nSupporting work of the type IJ does is one thing crypto fans can be ok with. A cursory gloss over the cases throughout their close to 30 yr historical past is proof sufficient. Eminent area, whereby governments bully property homeowners into promoting, or worse, below the rubric of the ‘greater good’ are causes not often heard by different teams. IJ commonly fights them.\nCrypto followers are particularly delicate in regards to the topic of licensing and certification, as they’re usually frictions and boundaries to entry into the well mannered, correct financial system — one thing fans can empathize with. The IJ is a lone advocate on this regard, ensuring those that want to merely provide a pleasant meal or a haircut are shielded from petty bureaucrats. The IJ can be eager on offering help for landmark instances by way of amicus briefs, as within the case of Carpenter v. United States . The Carpenter case offers with the 4th Amendment violations and could also be instrumental in direction of the pending Ross Ulbricht Supreme Court petition as nicely.\nFor the BCH Gang, giving to essential causes is yet one more perk of decentralized money. Groups comparable to EatBCH are “collecting bitcoin cash donations for the past few months and have been using the funds to purchase food and feed Venezuelans who are in need of assistance. Nearly every single day for over three months the group’s Twitter handle shows pictures of children and adults getting all kinds of food — and it’s all paid for with bitcoin cash,” these pages reported.

But that doesn’t mean regulators can ignore the wave of scams, fraud and market manipulation designed to snare gullible punters.\nWith U.S. law enforcers now probing trading practices such as “spoofing” – illegal and aggressive order cancellations designed to move markets – this looks very much like the beginning of a sustained crypto cleanup. Drawing investors back in, even with the promise of a less Wild West-style market, will take longer than cheerleaders expect.\nProbing price manipulation in crypto market was a natural next step for the authorities., which have ramped up scrutiny of everything from new token sales to crypto-hedge funds in recent months. There's plenty of data evidence to dig into, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC have demanded information from a lot of companies.\nThere are the “pump-and-dump” chat-rooms where traders take advantage of thinly traded digital currencies. Elsewhere, exchanges have been accused of being open to spoofing or so-called “wash” trading, where one entity buys and sells the same order. The popular Coinbase exchange faces allegations from clients of insider trading .\nOf course, it’s natural to question the authorities’ track record of putting spoofers and manipulators behind bars , even those working in traditional financial markets. It’s a fairly recent phenomenon. The practice of spoofing was only made illegal in the U.S. in 2010, and the first conviction was in 2015. In January, the CFTC announced the creation of a new Spoofing Task Force to “root out” the practice. So there’s still no established model for building a successful anti-spoofing case – for example, what a jury would deem to be a suspicious level of order cancellations.\nBut the drive by law enforcers to dig into the crypto world and demand more transparency is here to stay. This can only dent the aura, and price, of Bitcoin. We don't know the true “worth” of a crypto-currency – although there are many wacky price targets – but there's evidence that the price is closely linked to the ecosystem where it is traded. One recent research paper found that a near-tenfold rise in Bitcoin’s price in 2013 was driven primarily by two bots engaging in suspicious activity in a thin market.\nThe market today is very different, with more traders, more coins and more exchanges, but greater transparency is bound to have an impact. Bitcoin fell to its lowest price in more than a month after Bloomberg's report on the U.S. criminal probe.\nWhat happens next? Crypto-evangelists will no doubt argue that a better maintained market is a healthy development, and one that will pave the way for the flood of institutional Wall Street money that always seems to be right around the corner. Plenty of market participants have been asking for more transparency. New crypto exchange Legolas, for instance, has criticized the incumbents as being opaque and vulnerable to manipulation.\nStill, the idea that big risk-averse institutional investors will jump in just as authorities start to trawl the depths of this murky market seems fanciful. Speculation has been Bitcoin’s chief appeal, of course, but the necessary cleanup operation will drag on its price for some time to come.\n(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of economictimes.com, Bloomberg LP and its owners)\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/will-us-big-crypto-cleanup-be-final-nail-in-coffin-for-bitcoin/articleshow/64307758.cms&title=Will", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Will"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lionel laurent bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:57:57.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b89decd840dff1a03f46df94ebaf4c8519d8f5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRsbLElmutpTGDRWaygghOs.K00y92Ih04Bp_sI_jrhe5SmRD1tCprE8pxdVUOSkmSaTMiPKivMdBmaEL1FRWxqlkQXsMj5UC4otkQEwsxsfw--", "site_full": "wccftech.com", "site": "wccftech.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "U.S. Justice Department Investigating Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "title_full": "U.S. Justice Department Investigating Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.869, "main_image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bitcoin-mt-gox-btc-e.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6087, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b89decd840dff1a03f46df94ebaf4c8519d8f5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRsbLElmutpTGDRWaygghOs.K00y92Ih04Bp_sI_jrhe5SmRD1tCprE8pxdVUOSkmSaTMiPKivMdBmaEL1FRWxqlkQXsMj5UC4otkQEwsxsfw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shaun Williams", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Justice Department Investigating Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "text": "8 Shares Share Tweet Submit If being wary of clicking on the wrong ad wasn't enough, now you need to worry about even visiting sites as hackers target popular websites injecting millions with mining scripts.\nNews broke today via Bloomberg that the United States Department of Justice is opening a criminal investigation into price manipulation of bitcoin on major trading platforms. The investigation centers around a few illegal trading practices – namely order spoofing and wash trading.\nIf you are interested in Bitcoin and aren’t quite sure where to start, Wccftech Finance has published a great series of articles on the subject named The Crypto Conundrum . If you are interested in cryptocurrencies then this is an excellent place to start.\nRelated The Crypto Conundrum – Regulatory Pressures for Cryptocurrencies\nBack to today’s news; what is the U.S. government so concerned about? The first scheme that regulators are placing a keen eye on is order-spoofing. This involves flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling because of perceived demand that doesn’t actually exist. A trader submits a number of orders and then cancels them once BTC (or any other coin) moves in the desired direction.\nWash trades are when a cheating trader executes trades with himself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Both schemes are illegal according to SEC regulators, it’s just that there has never been a formal investigation when it comes to Bitcoin before now. Bloomberg’s sources indicated that its actually Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives that are under scrutiny, not spot trades.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after the story broke earlier today.

His response: “Because that’s where the money is.” It’s been nearly 70 years since Sutton spoke these words, but the sentiment still rings true today, illustrating the perpetual conflict between centralized institutions and the rogue individuals looking to steal from them. So long as there is a profit to be made, someone, somewhere will try to take it.\nHowever, since the advent of the internet, these individuals have taken on more elusive roles; robbers have become hackers, banks have become servers, and money has become data.\nAs the threat of breaches becomes increasingly commonplace, and the means by which bad actors can successfully break into even the most secure infrastructures becomes more advanced, the need for strategies to ensure data protection is becoming more than a best practice; it’s a requirement. In fact, according to a report from the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), there were 1,339 publicly-reported data breaches with a staggering 174,402,528 exposed records in 2017 alone — all with no sign of slowing down in 2018.\nDoes the Blockchain Provide a Solution to Data Protection?\nFaced with this seemingly insurmountable problem, major multinationals are beginning to look to the blockchain, the technology behind major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, as a potential solution to strengthen their data protection practices. Unlike traditional models, which are centralized and therefore rife with exploitable vulnerabilities, blockchain technology exists on a decentralized platform, meaning that it is far more secure and efficient than its conventional counterparts.\nBut while the greater crypto community hails the blockchain as an impenetrable data protection practice with the potential to stop hackers dead in their tracks, there is still work to be done before the technology will ever be able to live up to this promise. As blockchain companies continue to attract mainstream audiences to their platforms, industry experts will need to be increasingly aware of how expanding spheres of influence will impact future data security.\nOne of the great promises of blockchain is its anonymity. Yes, transactions on the blockchain are viewable to the entire community, but they are only done so using a private key, which is a long, indecipherable collection of letters and numbers. The technology provides unparalleled transparency to the overall ecosystem, while still establishing an added privacy layer that encrypts each transaction from being identified in the event of a data breach.\nMind you, this protection is only effective so long as no one can connect you to your private key. Once that is information is revealed, a hacker will have access to your entire crypto history, complete with every transaction you’ve ever conducted, and on every exchange.\nAdvertisement\nadvertisement\nTo fortify the system, blockchain companies have an overlaying “node” network, where individuals known as node operators offer up high-powered computers to police transactions on the blockchain — ensuring that anonymous records do just that, remain anonymous.\nIn many ways, node operators are a blockchain’s first line of defense against bad actors in the space, serving as a system of checks and balances for each transaction in real time. However, as more participants enter the system, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for the community to depend on these node operators to ensure data protection.\nZenCash Introduces Super Nodes\nIt’s time we take this a step further. At ZenCash, we recently created the latest iteration in the advancement of node operations. Dubbed “super nodes,” these participants are some of the first in the industry to be incentivized with 3.5 percent cut of the overall mining reward. In exchange for the mining reward super node operators maintain TLS certificates and use higher levels of computing power in order to guarantee encryption and prevent attacks.\nThrough these incentives, we hope to encourage node operators to be more actively engaged in the ecosystem, ensuring non-clustered efficiency and allowing us to build out the network in the process. And this isn’t just a concept, it’s a tried and tested reality. In fact, in only five short months, ZenCash has already employed the power of 11,000+ super nodes to its system from around the world, all working diligently to keep the platform up and running.\nThis last sentence brings up an important point. A platform can perform with unprecedented data security, but if it can’t stay operational, what service does it provide to end users? If, hypothetically, we were to take node operators out of the equation entirely, how can we ensure that blockchain-backed platforms won’t just fall apart when faced with an impending data breach or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack? Without governance, there can be no order; this is why we should incentivize nodes for their participation. So that when a hack on one node operator occurs, there are thousands of other node operators that can triage the damage and keep the platform afloat.\nIt’s an undeniable truth that — in the very near future — the path to fully-realized data protection will be paved with blockchain technology. The value proposition is simply too strong to overlook. However, as blockchain organizations continue to create new and innovative security developments to protect their platforms, bad actors will continue to seek new and innovative ways to outsmart them; this stops here.\nThrough secure nodes, we can finally remain one step ahead of an ever-changing curve, and incentivize the greater blockchain community to serve as both the gatekeepers and the role models of an expanding worldwide exchange. Why shouldn’t good behavior be rewarded?\nDo you think Super Nodes can incentivize participants in a positive way? What are your thoughts on ZenCash’s approach?

However, he draws interesting points over properties that make bitcoin fit into one category better over others.\nBurgt also shows historical evidence that suggests bitcoin is in a bubble, without saying firmly whether it is or not. Bitcoin Price Chart\nThough the price volatility would be an obvious reason why bitcoin struggles as a real-world currency, Burgt looks more closely at the ways it is currently used in the market place alongside central banking structures.\nHis conclusion comes as no surprise: bitcoin is not traded for goods much at all. In additional to increasingly unfavorable global regulations , he says that bitcoin lacks a corresponding real value, which is a key part in exchange for goods.\nHe writes:\n“…the exchange rate between two currencies can be regarded as a broad measure of the prices of one country’s goods and services relative to another country. When looking at the Bitcoin ‘exchange rate,’ this category of determinants seems to be inapplicable – there is no current native Bitcoin economy with native Bitcoin prices for goods and services.”\nAs a security, bitcoin fares better in the current framework, though not great. Securities are either purchases of debt or stakes in a company. Bitcoin doesn’t fit into either of these categories since it does not generate interest, dividends or capital gains.\nAs a commodity and an oft-mentioned “ store of value “, however, bitcoin behaves much like entrenched commodities like gold and oil, at least according to Burgt. Though he argues that bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, he points to mining as the key form of placing value on the asset — a value, he says, that approximates to roughly $1,800 per coin.\nHe writes:\n“Although Bitcoins do not possess any real intrinsic value, from a commodity valuation perspective, we can estimate a hypothetical value based on its production costs. Recent estimates regarding the energy involved in mining a single Bitcoin by professional energy-efficient mining rigs put it at about $1,800 when mined in China (where 80% of the currently mined Bitcoins originate).\nThe hypothetical value of $1,800 is far lower than bitcoin’s current price.

Currently, the market’s customers and some vendors are freaking out as the online marketplace was gaining in popularity and enjoying solid ratings with decent uptime. However, Rapture Market hasn’t been around for very long and people are starting to believe another DNM has bitten the dust for a number of speculated reasons.\nAlso read: Darknet Markets: Learning How to Get There is Half the Battle Darknet Marketplace Rapture Becomes Unavailable for Over a Week—Users Begin to Worry\nIt has been over eight days since the Rapture Market and its associated forums have been online, and patrons are growing concerned. According to the Deep Dot Web publication, the market is suffering from downtime and its 98 percent uptime rating has dropped to 97 percent. The marketplace hasn’t been around for as long as elder markets like Dream, and Wall Street, as Rapture was created this past January. Since the inception of Rapture, the market has received very good reviews and had a ‘trusted vendors’ referral system and affiliate program, alongside over 500 narcotic listings and other materials. Rapture accepted both Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Monero (XMR) and incorporated a forum and messaging system which have also been non-operational for over a week. The Rapture darknet marketplace established in January 2018. Lots of Speculation, While Reliable DNM Information Is Harder to Gather These Days\nThese days it’s harder to find out information on the reputation and whereabouts of DNM vendors alongside down darknet markets since Reddit recently removed the most popular DNM forum. However, patrons searching for information about Rapture’s demise are still communicating through the r/darknetmarketnoobs subreddit and other areas on the clearnet.\n“Has anyone been in contact with any staff or is there a Rapture PGP signed message about downtime?” One Rapture patron writes on May 15 . “I’ve looked but couldn’t find anything. It’s been down a day and a half now, just wondering if anyone knows if its legit downtime or possible exit scam?”\nSome Rapture users said the site will return soon and also revealed that the webpage was suffering from DDoS attacks, among other issues. After a few months of decent reviews on the website Deep Dot Web , a bunch of new reviews appeared last week, with people asking why the DNM was not available. The Deep Dot Web’s DNM chart shows Rapture is down and unresponsive.\n“The market is under DDoS owners are trying to get it back up no need for panic,” a user writes four days ago. The very last reviewer explains they have ‘inside’ information on why the site is non-operational and states :\nFor security reasons I can not reveal how I have this information but I have very credible sources and the site is fixing some bugs and taking the market offline; bugs are minor but there are a few so it is better to take offline and take care of them all at once. So just chill out it could take a couple of weeks to fix according to sources but the market may be online before then but I do not have that information. The DNM ‘Exit Scam’ Is the Oldest and Most Lucrative Tricks in the Book\nNo one has any solid information about the exact reasoning Rapture is down and annoyed patrons are therefore speculating. As usual the ‘exit scam’ is always the most dominant theory. An exit scam is when the marketplace administrators suddenly ‘disappear’ after accumulating a lot of customers’ money that sits in escrow alongside a large collection of vendor bonds that have been collected. It’s uncertain if Rapture’s downtime means it is officially an ‘exit scam.’ However, the ‘exit scam’ is the oldest trick in the book.\nIt’s safe to assume that the Deep Dot Web and other DNM sites will remove Rapture if the market remains unavailable and classify it as an exit scam, but for some patrons, there’s still hope for a Rapture revival.\nWhat do you think about Rapture being down for so long?

However, he draws interesting points over properties that make bitcoin fit into one category better over others.\nBurgt also shows historical evidence that suggests bitcoin is in a bubble, without saying firmly whether it is or not. Bitcoin Price Chart\nThough the price volatility would be an obvious reason why bitcoin struggles as a real-world currency, Burgt looks more closely at the ways it is currently used in the market place alongside central banking structures.\nHis conclusion comes as no surprise: bitcoin is not traded for goods much at all. In additional to increasingly unfavorable global regulations , he says that bitcoin lacks a corresponding real value, which is a key part in exchange for goods.\nHe writes:\n“…the exchange rate between two currencies can be regarded as a broad measure of the prices of one country’s goods and services relative to another country. When looking at the Bitcoin ‘exchange rate,’ this category of determinants seems to be inapplicable – there is no current native Bitcoin economy with native Bitcoin prices for goods and services.”\nAs a security, bitcoin fares better in the current framework, though not great. Securities are either purchases of debt or stakes in a company. Bitcoin doesn’t fit into either of these categories since it does not generate interest, dividends or capital gains.\nAs a commodity and an oft-mentioned “ store of value “, however, bitcoin behaves much like entrenched commodities like gold and oil, at least according to Burgt. Though he argues that bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, he points to mining as the key form of placing value on the asset — a value, he says, that approximates to roughly $1,800 per coin.\nHe writes:\n“Although Bitcoins do not possess any real intrinsic value, from a commodity valuation perspective, we can estimate a hypothetical value based on its production costs. Recent estimates regarding the energy involved in mining a single Bitcoin by professional energy-efficient mining rigs put it at about $1,800 when mined in China (where 80% of the currently mined Bitcoins originate).\nThe hypothetical value of $1,800 is far lower than bitcoin’s current price. Burgt only strikes the bubble fear home with a look at the stages of bitcoin’s FOMO and euphoria cycles that pattern previous bubbles in the market place (such as the 2007 financial crisis). In a unique development, however, Burgt mentions John McAfee’s $1 million bitcoin price target as a counterpoint.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://www.frbsf.org/banking/publications/fintech-edge/2018/may/making-sense-of-bitcoin-price-levels/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burgt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T03:08:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd7f7df6f56c40200f949a186784d6a4263d860a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmV7zkSWlz8XtdCIoPCCeSYn9AdkLGFG6Sj8UdSYUA.eD7ycgPdQaTuv3bWauMsDzGulgKauv2EUwySC7sE6uVviQ--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Russian Duma Adopts Three Crypto Bills on First Reading - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Russian Duma Adopts Three Crypto Bills on First Reading - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_144134923_1600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd7f7df6f56c40200f949a186784d6a4263d860a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmV7zkSWlz8XtdCIoPCCeSYn9AdkLGFG6Sj8UdSYUA.eD7ycgPdQaTuv3bWauMsDzGulgKauv2EUwySC7sE6uVviQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lubomir Tassev", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russian Duma Adopts Three Crypto Bills on First Reading - Bitcoin News", "text": "This story was shared from this site\nRussian State Duma has approved its first reading of the long-awaited legislation package regulating crypto-related matters and activities. The legal texts, voted almost unanimously, will open the way for legalization of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation, including their exchange and circulation under certain conditions. Deputies now have about two weeks to propose amendments before they proceed to final adoption of the three bills.\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency is Property in Russia, Justice Minister Confirms\nThe Bills Regulate Crypto Assets, Crowdfunding and Digital Rights\nThe lower house of Russia’s parliament, the Duma, has accepted and approved on first reading three pieces of legislation tailored to regulate different aspects of the crypto ecosphere in the country. This week, the bills – “On Digital Financial Assets,” “On Attracting Investments Using Investment Platforms,” and “On Digital Rights” – hit the house floor. All of them were voted almost unanimously, the Russian Association of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain announced on social media. Some interesting ideas, like tax breaks, have been pitched already during parliamentary discussions.\nThe first two drafts were introduced on March 20 by a group of deputies led by the chairman of the Financial Market Committee, Anatoly Aksakov, while the third one, which amends the country’s Civil Code, was filed on March 26 by the speaker of the Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, and the head of the parliamentary Legislation Committee, Pavel Krasheninnikov.\nThe new legislation incorporates legal concepts like “digital right” and “smart contract” and defines cryptocurrencies and tokens as property, not as legal tender. It establish the sequence of actions in a token sale and the rules governing ICO projects . The texts form the basis for legalizing crypto mining but the legal definition of this economic activity will be expanded and refined between the two readings. Other amendments may be introduced in the next couple of weeks. Some proposals, including a moratorium on the taxation of miners, have been discussed in parliament already.\nCryptocurrency Is Electronic Property, Not Legal Tender\nThe bill “On Digital Financial Assets”, № 419059-7 , prepared by the Finance Ministry, was voted by Russian legislators with only one “nay”. It regulates the relations arising from the creation, issuance, storage, and circulation of digital financial assets. The draft also establishes the exact procedures for conducting crypto transactions and concluding smart contracts, including the exercise of rights and the performance of obligations.\nLast week, Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said that common words like “cryptocurrencies” and “tokens” will be replaced with the legal terms “digital money” and “digital rights” in the new legislation. The text of this particular draft, however, contains definitions of the original, colloquial terms. It reads: “Digital financial asset – property in electronic form, created using cryptographic tools.” It also says that property rights in this case are certified by making digital records in a register of digital transactions.\n“Digital financial assets include cryptocurrency, token,” the document states, emphasizing that these assets are not legal tender in the Russian Federation. According to the authors, tokens can have a single issuer, while cryptocurrencies can have multiple issuers, like the miners. Both can be exchanged with rubles and foreign currencies under rules determined by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). They will not be considered a mandatory means of payment, account and transfer like the ruble, but individuals and businesses will be able to use them for payments within the frame of the law.\nAccording to Russian media reports, the draft states that crypto purchases and sales should be performed only through providers of exchange services for digital financial assets – brokers, dealers, and corporate entities – acting as custodians.

After a subsequent recovery, Bitcoin was fractionally higher at $7,524 in late-morning trading.\nThe price swings came after Bloomberg News reported that the Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation of potential cryptocurrency market manipulation. Federal investigators are working with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates financial derivatives that have values linked to digital currencies, the report said.\nInvestigators are focusing on banned trading tactics that can trigger price swings. They include spoofing, a strategy in which traders submit fake transactions in an effort to fool others into buying or selling, the report said.\nThe investigation also focuses on so-called wash trades, a tactic that involves a trader simultaneously buying and selling the same financial instruments. Such transactions may give a false picture of market activity and lure others into trading.\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment. The CFTC said the regulator would \"neither confirm nor deny any investigative activity.\"\nIn general, federal investigators and regulators have been scrutinizing trading in Bitcoin and other digital currencies based on a history of erratic price swings in cryptocurrency values and fears that markets that host the trading may not have sufficient safeguards to detect and halt fraud.\nIn a February advisory to consumers and investors , the CFTC warned about trading schemes that can occur \"in thinly traded or new 'alternative' virtual currencies and digital coins or tokens.\"\n\"Customers should not purchase virtual currencies, digital coins or tokens based on social media tips or sudden price spikes,\" the regulator cautioned. \"Thoroughly research virtual currencies, digital coins, tokens, and the companies or entities behind them in order to separate hype from facts.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kevin mccoy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbs news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kfmb channel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ca news station", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kfmb channel 8", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T14:29:49.068+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3417104cf68dcd1b49a05b908fcb582454e33e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptcrAgGE.AW2EmN0g30ZSJY9PV0xekDQ9EZQGz9tBgFNUkliUsyVOJU5aVKDZXH3nTxmzlE41IQ6eiDqyjZRyUm.AeiDSa__rQuiHABxa2qqw--", "site_full": "mycryptodictionary.com", "site": "mycryptodictionary.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Stumbles to $7,500 - My Crypto Dictionary", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Stumbles to $7,500 - My Crypto Dictionary", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mycryptodictionary.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/daily-chart-61.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d3417104cf68dcd1b49a05b908fcb582454e33e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAptcrAgGE.AW2EmN0g30ZSJY9PV0xekDQ9EZQGz9tBgFNUkliUsyVOJU5aVKDZXH3nTxmzlE41IQ6eiDqyjZRyUm.AeiDSa__rQuiHABxa2qqw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Foskaaymycd App", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Stumbles to $7,500 - My Crypto Dictionary", "text": "PLACE YOUR ADS HERE- CLICK FOR DETAILS Views: 103\nAt press time, bitcoin is trading for about $7,500. This is approximately $100 less than where it stood 24 hours ago. While nothing huge, it’s a clear sign that the bears still have their hands on the reins, and it’s unclear when – or even if – the current trends can reverse themselves. The manipulation of cryptocurrency prices is a common concern amongst both traders and financial authorities alike. These concerns initially began after the fall of Mt. Gox in 2014, which ultimately caused bitcoin to drop from the $1,000+ range to $600, and then $500 soon after. The end of 2014 ultimately saw bitcoin trading at around $400. Since then, bitcoin has experienced solid price hikes, though every time a sell-off occurs or Mt. Gox trustees move their remaining stashes, the price of bitcoin seems to take a stumble. Executives have admitted that their behavior bears influence on how bitcoin will move, yet their actions remain unchanged. This has sparked questions regarding the intent behind moving the coins . Are the trustees trying to manipulate bitcoin’s price, or is it all a big coincidence? Those in charge aren’t waiting around for an answer anymore, and in what could be the most significant action on the part of financial regulators today, the United States Justice Department has announced that it will be opening an investigation into illicit trading and any possible price manipulations on the part of bitcoin and its crypto -cousins.

There are two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently moving higher, but it is likely to face a strong selling interest just below $8,000.\nBitcoin price nosedived towards $7,500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD is currently recovering ground towards a few key barriers like $7,800 and $8,000. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThe past 5-6 sessions were mostly bearish as bitcoin price tumbled below the $8,000 support against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair declined sharply and even broke the $7,600 support level. It traded towards the $7,400 level before finding buyers. A low was formed near $7,440 from where a fresh upward correction was initiated and the price moved above $7,600.\nThe price managed to move above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low. However, there are many hurdles for buyers around the $8,000 level. At the moment, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low is acting as a resistance near $7,700. There are also two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The second trend line is significant since it is formed via connecting the $8,300 swing high.\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing a few positive signs above $7,500. Having said that, a break above the $8,000 barrier is must for buyers to gain control. On the other, if buyers fail to push the price above $8,000, there is a risk of yet another slide back to $7,500.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is struggling to move back above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,500 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:36:30.050+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b2e783ef7cd32408948b7ec3b66610799ecc5d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNQAVKxBEPX1xzp7iFAvpegg8XRLqI6AfwUIpegsnoHKSC8dxM9ynA_CCnXm7IQHO23CBnr0gzjNQT1oc9BPrIqFynKK9dysJ66sLG_3dO28IQ--", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/05/03154157/Bitcoin-20000.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b2e783ef7cd32408948b7ec3b66610799ecc5d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNQAVKxBEPX1xzp7iFAvpegg8XRLqI6AfwUIpegsnoHKSC8dxM9ynA_CCnXm7IQHO23CBnr0gzjNQT1oc9BPrIqFynKK9dysJ66sLG_3dO28IQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thomas Delahunty", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation | NewsBTC", "text": "Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation Ricardo Esteves | May 24, 2018 | 11:00 am Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation Ricardo Esteves | May 24, 2018 | 11:00 am\nThe U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into cryptocurrency price manipulation purported by market participants. In the meantime, Bitcoin continues to move lower towards the $7,000 line in an overall gloomy week for digital currencies. U.S. Justice Department Launches Criminal Investigation Into Cryptocurrency Price Manipulation\nU.S. federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a criminal probe that focuses on price manipulation schemes, including spoofing – a widely practiced form of price influence in which traders flood the market with fake orders in order to bait other players into taking the opposite side – and wash trading, in which the cheater trades with themself to create a false impression of market demand and trading volume.\nExtreme market volatility and lack of regulatory oversight over trading platforms have led the justice system and financial watchdogs in the U.S. to worry over the cryptocurrency market and potential criminal market plays. China has cracked down on its cryptocurrency ecosystem , particularly Bitcoin miners, trading platforms, and digital currency payments solutions providers, over similar concerns, but also in order to keep its centralized financial system unchallenged.\nNew regulatory actions promoted in Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, the Philippines, and other countries, may have helped drown the price of Bitcoin in 2018. Bitcoin came from its all-time highs in the $20,000 area only to be pulled down as the new year promised more government coordination regarding cryptocurrencies.\nGemini Trust , the New York-based digital asset exchange led by the Winklevoss twins, has recently hired Nasdaq Inc. to conduct surveillance of cryptocurrency trading on their platform. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have called for the creation of a self-regulatory body made up by trading platforms within the industry.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, many of which not even registered with the relevant financial watchdog. In the U.S., the CFTC is capable of imposing fines on spot market fraud even though the agency does not regulate it.\nJohn Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied cryptocurrency market manipulation told Bloomberg that limited oversight of digital currency trading makes it a target for crooks.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nPrice manipulation within the cryptocurrency market, whether it is spoofing or wash trading, could break investor confidence in such a young niche trading asset. Market capitalization has been in decline since early May, having lost nearly $150 billion from those highs. Criminals engaging in such practices profit from market volatility and they may have a direct role in the current market sentiment.\nImage from Shutterstock Bitcoin Pressured as Federal Prosecutors Investigate Price Manipulation was last modified: May 24th, 2018 by Ricardo Esteves ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ricardo esteves", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department launches criminal investigation into cryptocurrency price manipulation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:06:15.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a17958ed68d2f93054133cebcaabe72fe592f508", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94velBpL6eCE9xFyRq4pWHbeZp", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "title_full": "U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation | Hacker News", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a17958ed68d2f93054133cebcaabe72fe592f508", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94velBpL6eCE9xFyRq4pWHbeZp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "fwdpropaganda", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "text": "For anyone who hasn't been following, the prevailing theory is that the largest Cryptocoin exchange \"Bitfinex\" also runs an altcoin called \"Teather\" which was marketed as being backed 1:1 by USD.

The American multinational technology company has recently shown off a salt-grain computer designed to spread blockchain to the masses. IBM to Add 1,800 Jobs In France for Tech Initiatives, Including Blockchain\nThe International Business Machine (IBM), a New York based technology giant who is leading the blockchain revolution, is setting up a number of tech-development projects in France, in coordination with the French government headed by President Emmanuel Macron. The company expects to add 1,800 jobs in the next two years for the development of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT), among other emerging technologies.\nIn April, IBM announced it is developing ‘permissioned but public’ blockchain networks in response to high demand for digital asset issuance. The demand comes from executives from commodities trading platforms, central banks, and large corporations, looking for securities tokens, utility tokens, and commodity tokens that represent physical assets.\nThe company is involved in more than 400 distributed ledger projects, mostly in the U.S., spanning many different industries, including supply chain, healthcare, and government services. Ginni Rometty, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of IBM, announced the plan at the Tech for Good Summit in Paris, which was hosted by the French President.\n“President Macron is making a big bet, and a smart one, that AI is going to transform every job, every profession and every industry. At IBM, we share this belief and see evidence of it every day with Watson driving exponential impact here in France and around the world. That is why we are bringing 1,800 new jobs to France to meet growing demand for AI from our clients.”\nThe 1,800 new jobs include 400 AI-related roles, and a number of business consultants, IT architects, developers and technical experts, for roles such as cybersecurity, data science, and artificial intelligence. The new employees will be trained at the IBM France Academy, which is about to be launched. Based in Paris, the Academy also trains clients and partners to learn advanced knowledge and skills for a new technology era highly dependent on AI, machine learning, and blockchain.\nA 2017 survey found that IBM is considered the no.1 blockchain leader in the world by company founders, executives, managers, and IT leaders. Jerry Cuomo, IBM Fellow and Vice President of Blockchain Technologies has recently called governments to embrace distributed ledgers and encourage global use of blockchain.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business machine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:05:29.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d51215bb2b85dbd2587ab56a65de14d4de16ce0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkckNDWHbifeM1xAR8ekuq2gQ--", "site_full": "www.thestudentroom.co.uk", "site": "thestudentroom.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=331", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Life and style - The Student Room", "title": "bitcoin working strategy", "title_full": "bitcoin working strategy - The Student Room", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7797, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d51215bb2b85dbd2587ab56a65de14d4de16ce0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkckNDWHbifeM1xAR8ekuq2gQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "verifiedmanager", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin working strategy", "text": "bitcoin working strategy\n Hello friends,I am here to help those who have faith and needs help.*\nAre you having problems in cryptocurrency trading ?\nAre you a newbie?\nAre you having issues in making profit with trading?*\nAre you lacking trading experience?\nWell if so, i am here to help whoever is interested on how to make it big in *trading binary option with our *new money management strategy which involve using a bitcoin mining software which gives 98 signals everyday which lifts trade to 78% and gives a win of $750 everyday with the minimum amount of money ($1250) invested in your cryptocurrency account you will make($5250)* every 7 days .

At the press time, top nine digital currencies are in the red, with the market capitalization down to less than $330 billion, compared to $390 billion just a couple of days back. Source image: Coinmarketcap Consolidations are usually volatile and can lead to unexplained rallies and declines. There seems to be no specific reason that has led to this fall; and overall, the fundamental news is positive and encouraging. Argentinian Banco Masventas (BMV), has tied up with Bitex to facilitate the use of Bitcoin for international payments . It is expected to reduce transfer time by a day. A similar pilot project by Ripple using xRapid platform had announced payment time of just 2 minutes and transaction savings of 40-70 percent. Various sectors are exploring ways to implement the blockchain technology to improve productivity and accountability. Similarly, the governments are also looking at ways to implement blockchain, whereas, many central banks are toying with the idea of their own cryptocurrency. With so much happening, the dips should be seen as a buying opportunity, but the traders should wait for the decline to end before taking long positions. BTC/USD We had recommended buying Bitcoin closer to the support of $7,941.68 if it held, but today it slumped below $7,700, which shows strong selling pressure. There are two possibilities at this level. One is that the bulls will pull back above $7,900 level after a quick break, catching the bears off-guard. Another possibility is that prices breakdown of $7,900 and slide to $7,000. It is difficult to predict which one of the two scenarios will play out. So, how to trade it? The best approach is to wait and watch for a couple of days. If the BTC/USD pair breaks down of the support and sustains below $7,900, you shouldn’t buy. If prices slide below $7,900 momentarily but recover and sustain above $8,000 levels, traders can buy about 50 percent of their usual position size and keep a close stop loss, preferably below the recent lows. Remaining 50 percent position can be added once the digital currency scales above both the moving averages. The target objective is a move back to $10,000 levels. This is a risky trade but can be taken due to the attractive risk to reward ratio. ETH/USD Ethereum broke below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern on May 22. Today, it has extended the decline, breaking below the 50-day SMA and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the latest rally. There is minor support at $544.45, at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels, below which a plunge to $418 is likely. The ETH/USD pair will become positive only above the $745 levels. We suggest waiting for the decline to end before attempting a buy. It is not advisable to catch a falling knife. XRP/USD Ripple is fast approaching the bottom of the large range. Though this support of $0.56270 had broken down in end-March of this year, it did not find sellers at lower levels, and prices again climbed back into the range on April 12. We believe that the bulls will again attempt to defend the $0.56 levels. If the lows hold, traders can expect the XRP/USD pair to rally to $0.93 and then to $1.22 levels in the medium term. We suggest waiting for a few days to confirm that the decline has ended before buying because a fall below $0.56 can extend the decline to $0.45, below which the digital currency can plunge to $0.24. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash broke below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern on May 16, and the retest of the breakdown levels held on May 20 and May 21. The BCH/USD pair subsequently broke below the 50-day SMA on May 22. It should now collapse to $650 levels with minor support at $750. The $558.3870 level has not been broken since November of last year. Hence, traders can buy once the digital currency stabilizes near the key support levels. EOS/USD EOS failed to break out of the descending channel on May 21 and turned down from there. It broke below the 50-day SMA on May 22 and has followed it up with a break of the May 16 lows of $11.8210 today. There is minor support at $10 and below that at the 78.6 percent retracement levels of $9.6136. If both these levels break, the EOS/USD pair can decline to the bottom trendline of the channel at $8. With prices breaking down of both the moving averages and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the latest rally, the virtual currency has become negative. We shall change our view once price breaks out of the descending channel and sustains above it. LTC/USD Litecoin has broken below the immediate support of $127.108. The next support on the downside is $115 and below that $107.102, which is the intraday low of February 02 of this year. We anticipate strong support in the zone between $107-$115 because if the low of $107 breaks, it will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern that will be very negative for the LTC/USD pair. If the support zone holds, we should see another attempt to break out of the downtrend line of the triangle. We suggest waiting until the digital currency takes support at levels mentioned above before initiating any long positions. ADA/USD Cardano has broken below the $0.23 levels, which had been acting as strong support for the past few days. It can now sink to the lows of $0.13 with minor support at $0.19. Repeated attempts to break below the $0.13 level in March and April of this year failed. Hence, we consider this to act as strong support again this time. However, we suggest waiting for a few days before establishing long positions because if the ADA/USD pair breaks down of $0.13, it can sink to $0.08, a level last seen in December 2017. XLM/USD Stellar has broken below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern, which is a bearish sign. Though the pattern targets are much lower, it should now decline to the strong support level of $0.184. This level had held for about a month from mid-March to mid-April of this year, hence, we can again expect some buying to emerge at $0.184. If the bulls succeed in defending the support, the XLM/USD pair will also confirm the formation of a range, which can be traded by buying on a rebound from the lows and selling close to the overhead resistance of the range. Traders can wait for the prices to stabilize and turn up before buying. TRX/USD TRX has been falling for the past two days and has broken below the 20-day EMA. It is currently trying to taking support at the trendline. If this breaks, it can fall to the 50-day SMA. The TRX/USD pair has not broken below the $0.059 levels since April 25. Hence, a fall to $0.06 levels should attract buying. Traders should wait for a day or two to confirm that the levels are holding and then buy on a rebound from $0.059. If the digital currency sinks below $0.056, long positions should be avoided because it opens the door for a further fall to $0.04 levels. The digital currency is the strongest among the top ones we cover because it is the only one still trading close to its 20-day EMA and well above its 50-day SMA. So, we shall look to buy it as soon as we find a bullish pattern on it.
