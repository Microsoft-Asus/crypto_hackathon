Daniel confirms that they will be using chainpoint.org as the decentralised layer 2 protocol previously talked about https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/995804954316206080?s=20 For those who do not know anything about Chainpoint. It is an open standard managed by a company Tierion (who are part of the decentralised identity foundation (DIF) along with Microsoft). Chainpoint currently runs a blockchain (the chainpoint calendar) with over 7000 nodes currently proved to be able to anchor hundreds of millions of hashes per month to BTC blockchain. The tierion network token (TNT) will be used as a method of settlement of value between network participants.

To do it, the county will work with BitPay, a cryptocurrency e-commerce payments company. It's BitPay's first contract with a government entity. It's believed that Seminole County will be the first government body to accept cryptocurrency as payment. This bitcoin payment project was put in place by Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg, a controversial and unconventional figure in Florida politics.\nResidents of Seminole County, Florida will soon be able to pay their taxes and drivers license fees using bitcoin and bitcoin cash â two of the hottest cryptocurrencies in the world.\nIn an announcement made on Monday, Florida tax collector Joel Greenberg said that the county will start using the payment processor BitPay to process cryptocurrency payments. The project, set to go into effect in June, will let county residents pay their property taxes, driver license and ID card fees, tags and titles.\n\"We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand...and we should expect the same from our government,\" Greenberg said in a statement. \"The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.\"\nGreenberg himself cuts a somewhat unconventional figure in Floridian politics .\nHe ousted a longtime incumbent in the 2016 election, ran on the campaign promise of bringing new technologies to Seminole County, which sits just outside of Orlando. He's since garnered attention by pushing for a controversial land deal, and pulling over a speeding motorist using white flashing lights on his personal SUV, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\nSeminole County is the first government agency to use BitPay to process services, and representatives for the company said they believe it is the first government agency in the US to accept cryptocurrencies.\nWhile bitcoin has garnered significant attention over the past year, it's widely believed to be too costly and impractical to use for small payments. The cost of individual bitcoin payments skyrocketed in December at the height of the cryptocurrency's price and popularity, and BitPay itself even temporarily banned bitcoin purchases under $100 as fees on the network hit a high of $37 per transaction.\nIt now costs around $1.30 per transaction with bitcoin. For citizens of Seminole County who opt to pay with bitcoin with cryptocurrencies, that fee will have to be accounted for, in addition to a 1% transaction fee paid to BitPay. The county said it expects BitPay to help it settled payments quicker and cheaper than is possible with traditional credit card processors.\nBitPay, which facilitates e-commerce payments in cryptocurrencies, raised $40 million in funding led by Menlo Ventures in April.\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/seminole/os-seminole-county-greenberg-officer-20171218-story.html", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/os-primary-seminole-races-20160829-story.html", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-tax-collector-joel-greenberg-seminole-scott-maxwell-20171220-story.html", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/seminole/os-seminole-tax-collector-joel-greenberg-real-estate-deal-20180105-story.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joel greenberg", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "seminole county florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seminole county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:19:34.054+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e128e84a04055ce9866081e6d9c121c25889ff2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaP4sNF.KY0yUe.mfF42Bidulc6_5QKh7TGy1ZEjItDYoNAtm9I87sWZJk4uaYnt2c0T5Mwpv51Z.9AWfo5c6HTw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Bill Gates said he \"would short bitcoin if he could\".

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices.

Non-Bitcoin market cap has grown from about $140 billion in early April to now $258 billion, an increase of about 84%.\n(Source: CoinMarketCap)\nIn comparison, Bitcoin has rallied from about $6,800 per Bitcoin in early April to now $8,700 for a rally of about 28%.\n(Source: CoinMarketCap)\nAll of these current trends are likely signs for the future of the cryptocurrency industry once all the private and government actions settle into a more stable and long-lasting framework.\nEssentially what seems to be coming together are the following increasingly prevalent trends:\nSuccessful cryptocurrencies will be backed by major private or government actors, likely will specific programming catering towards their own services and uses. Industry-specific use cryptocurrencies are rising rapidly as a variety of sectors begin to find very specific business applications for Blockchain technology. Bitcoin is continually losing and likely will lose even more relative importance as a cryptocurrency, even if its own price still fluctuates with occasional rallies. The regulatory framework that comes into place will restrict heavily retail customer interaction with cryptocurrencies into much more low-risk market functions. For cryptocurrency issuers, they will face far greater transparency, oversight, and regulation in all their activities. All this essentially means that, bit by bit, the \"New Crypto Economy/Market\" is coming into place. This cryptocurrency market will look radically different from the free-flowing Wild West of just last year and which crashed in such fiery fashion a few months ago.\nUndoubtedly, this will overall benefit cryptocurrency's development as both a business tool and a financial asset. Once rules and regulations are in place, as they seem to be incoming across many major countries over the next few months to year or two, cryptocurrency development can be much more coherently analyzed, tracked, projected, and invested in.\nIt's an exciting time for cryptocurrencies as Blockchain continues to see increasingly new and innovative uses in a wide range of industries.\nListen to my recent interview with Jack Cavigan, the COO of the cryptocurrency Zcash ( ZEC-USD ), as we discussed the cryptocurrency industry's upcoming future and the impact on the general public:\nYou can read the full article here .\nDisclosure: I am/we are long FDN.\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

best year for the crypto and all the investors in the market, firstly, the coin witnessed unpredicted increase in value this year more than any other year before.\nI know that the value is based on the principle of demand and supply but I'd like to know what else contributed to the price value and the popularity bitcoin has right now globally.\nWe know the system of bitcoin i guess the only reason why bitcoin is get popular because it is obviously a high technology we cannot find a transactions of money where easily be transmitted in just a second anywhere in the world easily using thing bitcoin easily we can do that and at the same time bitcoin is also a investment for all of us having a money in the market making the demand of bitcoin to pump its market cap. obviously, the real

An estimated 8,500 blockchain experts and cryptocurrency evangelists have come from around the globe to be here at the 2018 Consensus conference, and the line to pick up attendee badges shows no sign of moving. A security guard in a suit, talking into his sleeve, eventually gives a small group the go-ahead to ride up to the second floor where another line awaits. It feels like we're trying, and failing, to get into New York's hottest nightclub. \"This is like the Coachella of Bitcoin,â a passerby whispers to her companion as they breeze by. You can taste the excitement. Image: jack morse/mashable And indeed, while it lacks Beyonce and the questionable wardrobe choices of the Southern California music festival, the Coindesk organized Consensus more than makes up for it in its sheer opulence and buffoonery â a fact made obvious before you even walk through the conference doors. Parked outside the hotel were three Lamborghinis â an inside joke within the cryptocurrency community â and, opposite them, a man claiming that the developers of NEM screwed him out of over $1.5 million USD worth of cryptocurrency. Across the street was an entirely different type of show: specifically, a fake protest. Chanting \"hey hey, ho ho, Bitcoin has got to go,\" the group of self-described bankers and CEOs (one man told me he got his suit out of a dumpster) carried signs reading \"paper checks use less electricity\" and \"we thought this was a bubble.\" According to a rambling statement on the group's website, the Genesis Mining-backed demonstrators were actually protesting aspects of the financial industry, but either way, they generated enough of a scene to draw a crowd and put conference attendees in what can only be described as an appropriately absurdist frame of mind. Because as soon as those who came to hear the blockchain gospel made it past the aforementioned escalator bouncer and the formidable registration line, they were met with what can only be described as a hodler's paradise. Want 18-karat gold crypto-jewelry to commemorate your ride-or-die status as a Bitcoin maximalist? Consensus 2018 is the place for you. But can you verify ownership on the blockchain? Image: Jack Morse/mashable I'll take two, please. Image: Jack Morse/mashable And sure, you may know about beer, but have you heard of cryptobeer? If that's not your thing, don't fret, just make you way over to the cyptopuppy (yes, this dog was described to me as a \"cryptopuppy\") named after Margaret Thatcher chilling on the fourth floor. Still recovering from the Mt. Gox hack. Image: jack morse/mashable But just like the SEC trying to shit all over the decentralized parade, the real world did poke its annoying head into the immutable bubble of joy. That's right, someone ticketed the Lambos. Sad times. Image: jack morse/mashable What's more, in what definitely isn't a metaphor for the entire industry, it turned out that the fancy cars weren't even the fruit of early Bitcoin adoption. They were just a promotional stunt. But push that all to the back on your head, fellow believer. Because if there's one thing \"the Coachella of Bitcoin\" makes clear, it's that these are serious people with serious ideas â even if, as one major player in the cryptocurrency space told me on background, 80 percent of people in the scene are likely scammers. Because scammer or no, at the 2018 Consensus conference we're all heading to the moon. http://feeds.mashable.com/~r/mashable/tech/~3/eL3ZcJ3tdN8/ Â© 2015 Forgettable Feed ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nightma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack morse2018-05-14", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beyonce", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "coachella of bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midtown manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hilton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T01:28:56.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb3e8b1df4be5b700ad6e4e8dd7195fc7dfc1bbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUcXUD8Se0pucORkN0EYfVU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "The price of Bitcoin will soon reach $15k on April, 2018", "title_full": "The price of Bitcoin will soon reach $15k on April, 2018", "published": "2018-05-15T00:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.303, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb3e8b1df4be5b700ad6e4e8dd7195fc7dfc1bbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUcXUD8Se0pucORkN0EYfVU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "yadwoa69", "published": "2018-05-15T00:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "The price of Bitcoin will soon reach $15k on April, 2018", "text": "Quote: from: yadwoa69 on May 14, 2018, 04:28:30 PM Though all technical indicators shows that bitcoin is oversold and it need to start recovering,yet nothing positive is coming out.

However, its seems that we are back in track as bitcoin is fast approaching $9K again. As to the OP, it looks like his prediction was a missed, another sign that no one can really predict how the price will moved and no matter how good you are in TA, most of the time this market goes on the opposite direction.

Greenberg has announced that his office will begin accepting Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash through BitPay for payment for various services starting this summer. Until now, paying taxes by credit or debit card has meant using a third-party processor with heavy fees. The blockchain allows the Seminole County Tax Collector to eliminate much of those fees while improving payment accuracy, transparency and efficiency, which ultimately benefits Seminole County tax payers.\nGreenberg commented: âWe live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government. The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.â\nBitPay enables the Seminole County Tax Collector to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash for services including property tax, driver license and ID card fee, tags and titles. Using the global blockchain payments provider, the Seminole County Tax Collector receives settlement the next business day directly to its bank account in US. dollars. There is no price volatility or risk to the County. As a push transaction, the user sends the exact amount of bitcoin or bitcoin cash needed to pay the bill. This eliminates traditional credit card fraud and identity theft risks associated with credit cards. Unlike the high cost of credit cards, BitPay charges 1% to approve the bitcoin or bitcoin cash transaction and settlement. BitPay enables transactions from any computer or mobile device making it easy and convenient for Seminole County residents.\nHead of Compliance at BitPay, Jeremie Beaudry remarked: âBitPay was started because we recognized the potential for blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure, and less expensive on a global scale. With the Seminole County Tax Collectorâs office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them.â\nMajor advantages that blockchain provides for these kinds of uses is transactional transparency and the impossibility to use the blockchain for fraud as every transaction is verified, recorded and stored. One of the most critical elements about the blockchain technology is that when the transaction has been reported in the ledger, it cannot be changed. This process creates highly efficient services and an overall better experience for Seminole County residents.\nThe Seminole County Tax Collector is responsible for the collection of all ad valorem and non-ad valorem taxes, DMV services including tag, title and registration, driverâs license and identification cards, birth certificates, hunting and fishing license and concealed weapon permits.\nGreenberg was elected Tax Collector in November 2016 and took office in January 2017. Since taking office as Tax Collector, he has directed the office to introduce new technologies, including artificial intelligence, improved infrastructures, and streamlined and improved customer service. His new modernization plan includes the adoption of blockchain technology. loading...

Now, instead of capitalizing on the rising tide of digital coins, he strives to find \"goal\" or \"value\" on the market, saying in a Hong Kong convention that Bitcoin growth is fueled only by \"speculation\" according to the Wall Street Journal, he stated:\nI do not see the purpose. What value adds cryptocurrency? Nobody has been able to answer this question for me.\nHe joins the chorus of investor billionaire Warren Buffett , who also opposed the crypto course market. Meanwhile, Steve Eisman has a history of agreeing with Buffett on issues such as executive compensation.\nBerman, nevertheless, seems to take into account cryptocurrency regulation, saying he \"does not understand\" why the market is not regulated \"more.\" The answer is that policymakers, while willing to introduce market controls, do not want to implement laws that stifle innovation in any region.\nTo quote the former Fed president, Alan Greenspan , which Steve Eisman once said , was \"the worst president of the Fed in history,\" it is a \"conundrum\" that works with fever to solve.\nMaybe Eisman, whose career was a focal point of Michael Lewis's bestseller The Big Short and who was described as a hedge fund manager by Steve Carell on the big screen, looked in the wrong place for answers.\nFor example, he predicts the US housing crisis in anticipation of a 26 billion dollars calls on the mortgage credit market by Wachovia Corp several years before melting . He watched the signs, which led him to the famous \"big short.\" However, when it appears to cryptocurrencies, Steve Eisman admits he did not take the time to understand the mechanics of the market.\nThere is no Systemic Risk\nMeantime, if you ask him where the next \"big short\" is, Eisman would not show cryptocurrencies and how Mark Carney sees no systemic risk in the global economy.\nMoreover, unlike Jamie Dimon, a member of JPMorgan , who also has no interest in Bitcoin, Mark Carney does not support a new US recession.\nIf it is most concerned about is the Canadian housing market, if there is evidence of a balloon that is preparing to explode. As a result, he took short positions in more than half of related stocks.\nIt is not surprising that Steve Eisman does not have digital currencies.\nThe post Steve Eisman's inspiration says Bitcoin has no \"purpose.\" appeared first on Crypto News 24/7 - Bitcoin News .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neuberger berman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T00:19:34.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0407f784d898d68f59305ac356172ea60f0469fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaftt_3CGzWszZibIPJb4kU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Is banking still important in the bitcoin era?", "title_full": "Is banking still important in the bitcoin era?", "published": "2018-05-15T00:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0407f784d898d68f59305ac356172ea60f0469fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaftt_3CGzWszZibIPJb4kU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mkhadazz", "published": "2018-05-15T00:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is banking still important in the bitcoin era?", "text": "Quote: from: dwsgh on March 06, 2018, 04:37:39 AM Financial technologies such as bitcoin, P2P lending and crowdfunding are just beginning to take off, and businesses involved in the industry pose little immediate threat to traditional commercial banks.

This incisive overview explains the intricacies of the cryptocurrency in an engrossing and easily digestible manner. The film begins with an examination of popular currencies throughout history, including our long-time reliance on precious metals like gold and silver as well as the system of the U.S. dollar that is most commonly employed today. Bitcoin is viewed by many as the next logical evolution from these currencies, and a highly desirable one at that. Bitcoin, coupled with an interface known as blockchain, is a completely decentralized network that eliminates all intermediaries from the currency exchange process. This is one of the major factors that set it apart from dealings with traditional banks or credit card companies, and it's a significant reason why these firmly established institutions are threatened by the growing popularity of the cryptocurrency. The network is especially useful for those who are not active members of the banking system, but its benefits transcend the needs of the individual. As detailed in the film, currency insecure countries are using bitcoin to avoid dealing with corrupt governments and greed-infested central banking systems. Many of the world's wealthiest regions are hesitant to engage in financial transactions with third world countries due to rampant credit card fraud. Bitcoin eliminates this risk and thereby opens up a new realm of revitalization for these impoverished nations. Incredibly, it can also be used to enhance privacy standards, protect the integrity of national elections, and help struggling families across the globe in procuring property rights. The film dives headfirst into answering bitcoin's most ardent critics, including on issues related to the endurance of the technology if it should grow far beyond expectations in the near future, and the securities that are in place to prevent widespread fraud. Featuring insightful testimonies from prominent leaders and prognosticators on the global financial stage, \"Bitcoin: Beyond the Bubble\" paints an optimistic impression of an empowering future where everyone can be in charge of their own money.

Bitcoin's market value was about $150.1 billion.\n\"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement.\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions.

An early morning fall to an intraday low $8,318.3 saw Bitcoin cold above the dayâs first major support level at $8,247.83, with buying appetite building through Sunday morning to support a Bitcoin run through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628 and the dayâs first major resistance level at $8,675.13 to an intraday high $8,760 before easing back the dayâs end $8,682.6.\nHolding above the dayâs first major resistance level of $8,675.13 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628, was a positive for the Bitcoin bulls, though for Bitcoin to reverse the near-term bearish trend formed at 5th Mayâs swing hi $9,999, a move back through the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $8,890 to $9,000 levels would be needed. Until there is greater clarity on the regulatory road ahead, Bitcoin and the broader market is unlikely to see any material upside that could spur the talk of a return to the record highs of last year, with regulator classification of the respective cryptocurrencies expected to have a material impact on the broader market.\nWhile the broader market faces the wrath of South Korean regulators, Bitcoin investors are about to discover whether tomorrowâs Bitcoin Cash hard fork will eat into Bitcoinâs cryptomarket dominance. With Bitcoin Cash already being considered a better contender to replace fiat money, the hard fork enhancements, which are due to introduce capabilities such as smart contracts, while also improving transaction times to less than 3 minutes, will give Bitcoin a run for its money.\nThe market response may be muted near-term, however, regulatory risk continuing to be of far greater influence to investor appetite near-term. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Todayâ data-reactid=â17â³>Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 3.61% to $8,370 as the crypto news wires weighed on investor appetite at the start of the week.\nAn early move through to a morning high $8,701 fell short of the dayâs first major resistance level at $8,855.63, with negative sentiment across the broader market ultimately leading to a Bitcoin pullback to a morning low $8,271, Bitcoin sliding through the dayâs first major support level at $8,413.93 with ease as selling pressure weighed at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628. For the day ahead, a move back through to $8,700 to test the dayâs first major resistance level at $8,855.63 would need a shift in sentiment to ease selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,628, which may be too big an ask as investors return focus to the regulatory outlook that continues to remain bearish for the cryptomarket.

The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor.

Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices.

Now instead of capitalizing on the rising tide of digital currencies, heâs struggling to find âpurposeâ or âvalueâ in the market, saying at a convention in Hong Kong that the rise of bitcoin is being fueled only by âspeculationâ and fraud, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nHe said:\nâI donât see the purpose of it. What value does cryptocurrency actually add? No oneâs been able to answer that question for me.â\nHeâs joining the chorus of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has similarly railed against the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, Eisman has a history of agreeing with Buffett on topics like executive compensation.\nBerman, however, does appear to keep tabs on cryptocurrency regulation, saying he âdoesnât understandâ why the market isnât regulated âmore heavily.â The answer is that policymakers while eager to place controls on the market donât want to craft laws that will stifle innovation in any given region. To quote former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who Eisman once said was âthe worst Chairman of the Fed in historyâ, itâs a âconundrumâ that theyâre working feverishly to solve.\nSource: Shutterstock Perhaps Eisman, whose career was a focal point in Michael Lewisâ bestseller The Big Short and who was portrayed as a hedge fund manager by Steve Carell on the big screen, has been looking in the wrong place for the answers.\nFor instance, he presciently forecast the US housing crisis following a $26 billion call on the mortgage market by Wachovia Corp a couple of years prior to the meltdown. He followed the signs, which led him to the famous âbig shortâ. But when it comes to cryptocurrencies, Eisman admits he hasnât taken the time to understand the mechanics of the market.\nâI donât touch it. I donât know what Iâm looking atâ¦I have no interest,â said Eisman at the conference, adding that he avoids investing in any currencies, not just the crypto kind.\nâNo Systemic Riskâ Meanwhile, if you were to ask him where the next âbig shortâ, Eisman wouldnât point to cryptocurrencies and like the Bank of Englandâs Mark Carney sees no systemic risk in the global economy. And unlike JPMorganâs Jamie Dimon, who similarly has no interest in bitcoin, Carney is not bracing for another US recession.\nWhere is most concerned about is the Canadian housing market, where there is evidence of a bubble thatâs getting ready to burst. As a result, heâs taken short positions in more than half-a-dozen related stocks.\nNot surprisingly, Eisman owns no digital currencies.\nFeatured Image from YouTube\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve eisman bashes bitcoin eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neuberger berman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T23:43:35.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0f46880371c38a37c01704a168168ccf91e3d17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWcgmUog5kxb3HWSa0.wNDE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How long can Bitcoin survive due to the high transaction fees?", "title_full": "How long can Bitcoin survive due to the high transaction fees?", "published": "2018-05-14T23:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.646, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0f46880371c38a37c01704a168168ccf91e3d17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWcgmUog5kxb3HWSa0.wNDE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bjmpoker001", "published": "2018-05-14T23:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "How long can Bitcoin survive due to the high transaction fees?", "text": "Quote: from: schwarzone on May 10, 2018, 05:30:21 AM The transaction fees of bitcoin are relatively low for large transfers, but high for small transfers.
