Vullo has announced on Monday that Gemini Trust Company LLC has been authorized to offer the custody services and trading of Zcash, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash on its exchange based in NYC. She said: \"This action continues New York's longstanding commitment to innovation and leadership in the global marketplace. With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving.\"\nThe addition of Zcash especially seems to have taken the market by surprise, leading to its price jumping over 40% in the last twenty-four hours. Back in March, the founders of the trading venue revealed that adding new cryptocurrency options are high on the company's agenda this year, with BCH and LTC at the top of the list. Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini, commented on Monday: \"We are proud to be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash, an incredible new form of digital cash.\"\nSurprise CEO Resignation Chris Lee, Chief Executive Officer at Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange Okex , has reportedly left his position with the Hong Kong based company.

The five young men, Justin Ellison, Trivette Adams, Matthew Schwartz, Jacob South, and Michael McDermont, have been charged with residential strong arm robbery and are being held in a detention center without bond.\nAustralian Sexual Health Provider Held for Ransom Family Planning New South Wales, one of Australia's largest reproductive and sexual health service providers, has sent out an email to its clients on Monday notifying them that it reported a cyber attack on its website to Australian Federal Police.\n\"I want to stress to people that this has absolutely nothing to do with, and has no impact on our clinical medical records, they've always been secure,\" the organization's chief executive Ann Brassil said at a press conference on Monday. \"There's no evidence that this cyberattack was on Family Planning NSW itself;…and it appears it was an attack for ransom, so it was financial. The ransom said we are shutting down your website and you pay us $15,000 in Bitcoin for us to release the website, and it had a clock ticking down.\"\nPolish Propaganda Polish financial authorities have again been found to spend taxpayers' money on a smear campaign on social media against investing in cryptocurrencies. Poland's Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) has issued a new tender order to plan and conduct a campaign aimed at \"building awareness\" among the public for the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, pyramid schemes and forex activities unsupervised by the KNF.\nEarlier this year it was reveled that the Central Bank of Poland and KNF had paid over 90,000 PLN (złoty) to, among others, a Polish Youtube content network which represents many popular young local content creators to produce anti-crypto videos .\nWhat do you think about today's news updates?

That's what I saw,\" Song continued.\nThe entire crowd had been eating non-stop stories about how everything was going to change for the better because of the new tech, usually sponsored by a panelist.\n5/ What I said wasn't anything special.

Bitcoin ‘The Real Innovation’\nSpeaking during a panel at Consensus 2018 , which has since become infamous as a frank discussion of Bitcoin vs. Blockchain, Song made the bet with Ethereum cofounder Joseph Lubin.\n“I don’t really see much of this stuff gaining much traction,” he said referencing blockchain solutions for global enterprise arguing Bitcoin is “the real innovation here.”\n“I’ll bet you any amount of bitcoin that you’re wrong,” Lubin retorted, the pair adding the exact nature of the bet will be confirmed on social media.\nThe exchange had come about as an offshoot of a panel involving Song, Lubin and Amber Baldet, former blockchain program lead at JPMorgan, who had just presented her new blockchain project Clovyr.\nAsked what he thought of it, Song “shocked” the audience by saying:\nI don’t see anything other than buzzwords. JPMorgan’s Lack Of ‘Substance’\n“What I said wasn’t anything special,” he subsequently summarized on Twitter.\nI verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn’t get anything of substance from the presentation.\nThe mood appeared friendly, Song also thanking for Baldet and Lubin for being “good sports” but nonetheless underscoring the frustration shared by many technical experts in the cryptocurrency industry about blockchain – that commercial parties can present the technology and rely on a lack of understanding to give their solutions free passage.\n“Giving voice to something that you know is true often results in shock and laughter. That’s what I saw,” Song continued.\nThe entire crowd had been eating non-stop stories about how everything was going to change for the better because of the new tech, usually sponsored by a panelist. 5/ What I said wasn't anything special. I verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn't get anything of substance from the presentation.\n— Jimmy Song (송재준) (@jimmysong) May 15, 2018\nReacting to the episode, Saifedean Ammous, author of ‘The Bitcoin Standard,’ agreed with Song, using Lubin’s sarcastic forecast that “Bitcoin 1.0” will be the sole innovation by 2023 in his favor.\n“BITCOIN 1.0: STILL the only game in town,” he tweeted.\nWhat do you think about Jimmy Song’s comments and wager with Joseph Lubin?

Date:\nWhoever created it, Bitcoin was designed as an alternative electronic currency to allow for easy, anonymous financial transactions across borders, without government interference or regulation…\nBy TJ Costello and Bruce Wright\nT hroughout history, various alternative currencies have been used to pay for goods and services. Sometimes, as with the famous “tulip mania” of 17th-century Holland, a speculative commodity investment can serve as an alternative currency — if enough people want it.\nToday’s Bitcoin phenomenon, however, began as an alternative currency but has become a highly speculative investment in its own right.\nBitcoin’s origins are mysterious. Bitcoin and the database used in its implementation were launched in 2009, by a person or persons using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. That’s generally believed to be a pseudonym, however, and both press accounts and internet rumor have put forward several different candidates for the “real” Nakamoto.\nWhoever created it, Bitcoin was designed as an alternative electronic currency to allow for easy, anonymous financial transactions across borders, without government interference or regulation.\nBitcoin has slowly gained acceptance not just in online transactions, but by a small but growing number of brick-and-mortar businesses as well, including Subway, Microsoft, Reeds Jewelers and, beginning in fall 2018, Dallas Mavericks ticket sales.\nBitcoin has earned its greatest fame as an investment, however. Originally worth pennies, at this writing the value of a single bitcoin is nearly $6,700, although values can and do swing wildly in a single day.\nBitcoin Basics\nBuying and selling bitcoins is relatively easy. It’s as simple as downloading an app to one’s phone and creating an account that allows for the purchase or sale of bitcoins using a debit card or a bank account. One can also use a Bitcoin ATM; Texas has more than 100.\nEach bitcoin is stored in a personal “wallet,” basically an encrypted electronic file with a unique ID, which resides either on a personal computing device or within a Bitcoin exchange, a digital marketplace for buying and selling bitcoins using conventional currency.\nBitcoin transactions are recorded in an online, encrypted database called blockchain. The names of buyers and sellers are never revealed — only their wallet IDs.\nWhat’s a “Cryptocurrency?”\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, one of more than a thousand currently in use, but the most important by far in terms of valuation and acceptance.\nBitcoins, as with any other cryptocurrency, are actually strings of computer code that represent transferable units of value, each of which can be spent only once.\nEach unit is produced or “mined” by using special software to solve complex mathematical problems, a requirement deliberately analogous to the labor involved in mining gold or other precious metals. Only a relatively small number of bitcoins are produced each day.\nThis artificial scarcity controls the supply of bitcoins, a job central banks such as the Federal Reserve handle for conventional currency. Bitcoin was designed to have a fixed total circulation of 21 million.\nTo ensure this, the complex computer algorithms needed to create bitcoins are becoming more difficult over time. “Mining” that could once be accomplished on a personal computer now requires huge data centers.\nA Bitcoin Power Drain?\nIn the past year, the worldwide power demands of bitcoin mining have become astonishingly high ( Exhibit 1 ).\nAccording to Digiconomist, a web platform focused on digital currencies, in late March the electricity used in bitcoin mining equated to an annual rate of nearly 58 terawatts of electricity.\nThat’s 58 trillion watts — about the same annual energy consumption as 5.3 million U.S. households. EXHIBIT 1: ESTIMATED WORLDWIDE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF BITCOIN MINING\nBitcoin Demand Explodes\nBitcoin’s continued acceptance, as well as the scarcity engineered into the creation of bitcoins, is driving its rising popularity as a speculative investment. In response, futures markets have begun trading in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began to list Bitcoin futures in December 2017, while NASDAQ plans to do so in 2018.\nThe value of an individual bitcoin was relatively stable for the first few years of the medium’s existence, followed by some growth in speculation in 2014. In 2017, however, Bitcoin value began an unprecedented rise ( Exhibit 2 ). At the start of 2017, a single bitcoin was worth $998; by December, its value had peaked at $19,343. As of April 9, 2018, the value of a bitcoin had receded considerably, to about $6,742, though with many wild price swings along the way. Security Issues and Regulation\nTransactions made through a blockchain database are considered fairly secure.\nIndividual wallets and exchanges, however, are often hacked. Bloomberg Business News has documented “a long history of thefts at cryptocurrency exchanges and [digital] wallets, dating back to 2014.”\nIn January 2018, hackers broke into a Tokyo-based exchange and stole $534 million worth of a cryptocurrency called NEM coins.\nGiven that cryptocurrencies are designed to avoid government oversight, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton noted in December 2017 that cryptocurrency markets “feature substantially less investor protection than traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.”\nAs cryptocurrencies become mainstream, regulators such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are grappling with many issues related to them, expressing concerns about price manipulation and fraud as well as money laundering and tax evasion.\nIn January 2018, the SEC shot down proposals from two exchange-traded funds seeking to offer investors a way to trade in cryptocurrencies on traditional exchanges.\nIn February, inspectors from Japan’s Financial Services Agency increased its scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges and even raided the offices of the Tokyo exchange hacked for NEM coins.\nIn December 2017, the Texas State Securities Board halted investment offerings by a company soliciting cryptocurrency-based investments it promised would deliver annualized returns of 100 percent or more.\nThis administrative order made Texas the first state to challenge a risky crypto-investment.\nEXHIBIT 3: POPULAR CRYTOCURRENCIES AND RECENT TRADING VALUES\nTax Implications\nIn a 2014 guidance memo, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stated that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender but are property exchangeable for goods and services, and thus are subject to federal laws applicable to transactions such as those concerning artwork, stocks or bonds. The decision means all transactions typically subject to taxation are still taxable if bitcoins or any other cryptocurrencies are used.\nSales of bitcoins also are subject to capital gains taxes. The value of a Bitcoin transaction is calculated based on the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of payment. Mined bitcoins also are considered gross income for tax purposes.\nCryptocurrency exchanges and brokers are not required to report their transactions to the IRS as a stockbroker would, for instance. Recent court rulings, however, have made it clear that the IRS may seek supposedly anonymous transaction data.\nIn 2016, the IRS required Coinbase, the nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to hand over records on about 14,000 customers. The recently implemented federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also eliminated certain tax loopholes used by some cryptocurrency traders.\nIt should be noted that the state of Texas doesn’t accept Bitcoin (or any other currency other than U.S. dollars) in payment for its taxes. All sales of taxable items in Texas are still subject to sales tax, even if the transaction is valued in bitcoins or another cryptocurrency.\nA Bubble?\nIn economic terms, a bubble occurs whenever the price of a commodity or asset rises greatly beyond its fundamental value, due to extreme investor enthusiasm — what former Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan famously called “irrational exuberance.”\nWhen enthusiasm wanes, the bubble may pop, bringing prices crashing to earth, as it did with dot-com stocks in the early years of this century.\nAccording to CoinMarketCap.com, the value of bitcoins rose by about 1,318 percent in 2017 alone. Many believe Bitcoin could be the next economic bubble.\nBubbles, however, are clearly seen only in retrospect, and while cryptocurrency values have fallen considerably in 2018, no one can predict with any certainty whether this trend will continue.\nYet cryptocurrencies in general aren’t going away anytime soon.\nAs they become more accepted, governments will consider how to protect constituents, regulate trades and make transactions more transparent — and, perhaps, prepare for a future in which some form of cryptocurrency may be the transaction method of choice among both investors and consumers.\nThis story originally published by Texas Comptroller.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption", "https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2018/april/bitcoin.php#article", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-29/how-to-launder-500-million-in-digital-currency-quicktake-q-a"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tj costello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "holland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:50:45.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1500079602f8a0ce3734d947eced67cabda16452", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaeT3FJUpL0Rn4VWUhlwMDr7BHlsK8eIjK7nfPAy1mEHxQQrROmH_Tjt2n.9UBMz5SGcetuuS82pEmnVnO3YaIlS4wNpgszLux", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "draglet’s bitcoin exchange and ICO platform source code now for sale", "title_full": "draglet’s bitcoin exchange and ICO platform source code now for sale : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-15T14:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1500079602f8a0ce3734d947eced67cabda16452", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaeT3FJUpL0Rn4VWUhlwMDr7BHlsK8eIjK7nfPAy1mEHxQQrROmH_Tjt2n.9UBMz5SGcetuuS82pEmnVnO3YaIlS4wNpgszLux", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cryptoninjas", "published": "2018-05-15T14:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "draglet’s bitcoin exchange and ICO platform source code now for sale", "text": "submitted by /u/cryptoninjas\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/05/15/draglets-bitcoin-exchange-and-ico-platform-source-code-now-for-sale/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:05:06.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "edaedcd4bb5587dd754ba215896df6a819e62e11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNqYjzsa0MJF8S6J_6iHJPxxuSDp3uu4jdZe3IWvBeBD6EH3u4R00uouP3itpsoO1imbgeNk7ujvJ6q9AXBQaO0nNUVN_4MU0MQ--", "site_full": "bitcoin24hours.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoin24hours.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "I lived on bitcoin for 24 hours", "title": "Bitcoin Price Settles Above $8,600", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Settles Above $8,600", "published": "2018-05-15T14:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "edaedcd4bb5587dd754ba215896df6a819e62e11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNqYjzsa0MJF8S6J_6iHJPxxuSDp3uu4jdZe3IWvBeBD6EH3u4R00uouP3itpsoO1imbgeNk7ujvJ6q9AXBQaO0nNUVN_4MU0MQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mir khaleq ali (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T14:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Settles Above $8,600", "text": "Bitcoin Price Settles Above $8,600 BTC locked in a range with marginal gains during recent 24 hours.

The digital currency No.1 has been volatile lately influenced by a variety of factors from Mt.Gox selling Bitcoins rumors to the launch of NASDAQ-powered crypto exchange.\nObviously, that positive momentum was triggered by the news that NASDAQ is opening centralized cryptocurrency exchange next month, making Wall Street one more step closer to full adoption of new crypto reality.\nThe exchange will offer easy on-boarding process and zero trading fees for trading.

The third place brings their market’s companies like Northern Bitcoin AG more audience. It has a huge influence in the overall European commerce and global trade.\nGerman Stock Exchange The German Stock Exchange is composed of different stock exchanges that facilitate trade in different parts of Germany. These include the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the biggest component of the German Stock Exchange that oversees trading activities in Frankfurt; Stuttgart Stock Exchange, the second biggest component of the German Stock Exchange; Börse Berlin-Bremen, which has been overseeing trading activities in Berlin-Charlottenburg since the merger of the Berlin Stock Exchange and Börse Bremen; and BÖAG Börsen AG, which has been overseeing trading activities in Hamburg and Hanover since the merger of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and Hanover Stock Exchange. Trading activity spread on all their companies, including Northern Bitcoin AG.\nGerman Stock Index The benchmark index of the German equity market is the German Stock Index or the Deutsche Aktien Xchange (DAX) 30. As a capitalization-weighted index, it oversees the market performance of the 30 companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with the biggest market capitalizations.\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange alone represents 80% of the total German market capitalization. This is why the German Stock Index and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange alike are vital indicators of German economy.\nThe German blue chip stocks on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange are capped at 10% weight for two main reasons: 1) to meet the legal provisions of the German Stock Index; and 2) to prevent mergers and acquisitions (M&As) from resulting to index heavyweight.\nSince 1987, the German Stock Index has had a base value of 1,000. XETRA, an electronic trading system, has been calculating index prices since 1999. It was in 2006 when XETRA began computing index prices after every second.\nThe primary currency on the German Stock Index is euro. The minimum trade size requirement is one index while the margin requirement is 2% among most brokers. The German Stock Index has two versions— a performance index and a price index. Both indexes are vital for Northern Bitcoin AG.\nThe German Stock Index had its longest glory period for more than 1,500 consecutive days between 2003 and 2007. At the time, it had reached its peak at €8,105.69. However, the German Stock Index had fallen to its lowest €3,580 after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.\nBeing able to recover from the repercussions, the German Stock Exchange was able to register its new all-time high of €8,736 during one of its best-performing years in 2013.\nIts performance index, on the other hand, had posted its all-time high of 12,374.73 in April 2015 after first touching the 12,000 mark in the previous month. During that day in April, it had even hit a high of 12,390.75. Its lowest level of 372.30 was last seen in 1974.\nGiven this, investing in DAX 30 equities just makes sense. It is a guarantee that investors will benefit from the rich German economy. It also guarantee for Northern Bitcoin AG and others to catch more attention.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://quickadsense.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "henry gaston shares of northern bitcoin ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern bitcoin ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfurt stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuttgart stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "frankfurt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T09:40:02.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61228ea8dc5405ec6a4bb197e8ffc7e93cc83057", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhAiO97sIdmcez2JAEB3TszA-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T14:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61228ea8dc5405ec6a4bb197e8ffc7e93cc83057", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhAiO97sIdmcez2JAEB3TszA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T14:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 15, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin price analysis: BTC/USD settles above $8600; Wall Street slowly adopting crypto reality FXStreet Bitcoin catapulted to $8,717 on Monday, to trade at $8,670 at the time of writing.

Additionally covered are a surprise resignation, another ransomware attack, and much more.\nAlso Read: Steve Eisman of ‘The Big Short’ Fame: What Value Does Cryptocurrency Actually Add? NYDFS Approves Expanded Crypto Portfolio\nNew York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo has announced on Monday that Gemini Trust Company LLC has been authorized to offer the custody services and trading of Zcash, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash on its exchange based in NYC. She said: “This action continues New York’s longstanding commitment to innovation and leadership in the global marketplace. With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving.”\nThe addition of Zcash especially seems to have taken the market by surprise, leading to its price jumping over 40% in the last twenty-four hours. Back in March, the founders of the trading venue revealed that adding new cryptocurrency options are high on the company’s agenda this year, with BCH and LTC at the top of the list. Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini, commented on Monday: “We are proud to be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash, an incredible new form of digital cash.” Surprise CEO Resignation\nChris Lee, Chief Executive Officer at Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange Okex , has reportedly left his position with the Hong Kong based company. Lee cited personal reasons for his departure, seeking to “start a new life,” the exchange stated on Monday. According to his spokeswoman, Lee added it had been the “greatest pleasure and an honor” to work at Okex and that he will return to the blockchain community after a short break to spend time with his family. The surprising move raised some speculations online as for the reasons. $1 Million Bitcoin Heist Foiled\nAccording to media reports from the state of Georgia, the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office found that five young men had conspired to break into a local home and steal nearly $1 million in bitcoin. Their robbery investigation has reportedly been ongoing since January, following a drug bust. The five young men, Justin Ellison, Trivette Adams, Matthew Schwartz, Jacob South, and Michael McDermont, have been charged with residential strong arm robbery and are being held in a detention center without bond. Australian Sexual Health Provider Held for Ransom\nFamily Planning New South Wales, one of Australia’s largest reproductive and sexual health service providers, has sent out an email to its clients on Monday notifying them that it reported a cyber attack on its website to Australian Federal Police.\n“I want to stress to people that this has absolutely nothing to do with, and has no impact on our clinical medical records, they’ve always been secure,” the organization’s chief executive Ann Brassil said at a press conference on Monday. “There’s no evidence that this cyberattack was on Family Planning NSW itself;…and it appears it was an attack for ransom, so it was financial. The ransom said we are shutting down your website and you pay us $15,000 in Bitcoin for us to release the website, and it had a clock ticking down.” Polish Propaganda\nPolish financial authorities have again been found to spend taxpayers’ money on a smear campaign on social media against investing in cryptocurrencies. Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) has issued a new tender order to plan and conduct a campaign aimed at “building awareness” among the public for the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, pyramid schemes and forex activities unsupervised by the KNF.\nEarlier this year it was reveled that the Central Bank of Poland and KNF had paid over 90,000 PLN (złoty) to, among others, a Polish Youtube content network which represents many popular young local content creators to produce anti-crypto videos .\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Hence, it does not fit Warrens style.\nSo what is your opinion?\nIs this really about Warren or someone else because the bold part is sure not referring to him. Warren is already rich and he does not need even need to do any more investment in life for him live through life. The return of his percentage holding in cocacola is enough if he wants above a moderate life.

Bitcoin ‘The Real Innovation’\nSpeaking during a panel at Consensus 2018 , which has since become infamous as a frank discussion of Bitcoin vs. Blockchain, Song made the bet with Ethereum cofounder Joseph Lubin.\n“I don’t really see much of this stuff gaining much traction,” he said referencing blockchain solutions for global enterprise arguing Bitcoin is “the real innovation here.”\n“I’ll bet you any amount of bitcoin that you’re wrong,” Lubin retorted, the pair adding the exact nature of the bet will be confirmed on social media.\nThe exchange had come about as an offshoot of a panel involving Song, Lubin and Amber Baldet, former blockchain program lead at JPMorgan, who had just presented her new blockchain project Clovyr.\nAsked what he thought of it, Song “shocked” the audience by saying:\nI don’t see anything other than buzzwords. JPMorgan’s Lack Of ‘Substance’\n“What I said wasn’t anything special,” he subsequently summarized on Twitter.\nI verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn’t get anything of substance from the presentation.\nThe mood appeared friendly, Song also thanking for Baldet and Lubin for being “good sports” but nonetheless underscoring the frustration shared by many technical experts in the cryptocurrency industry about blockchain – that commercial parties can present the technology and rely on a lack of understanding to give their solutions free passage.\n“Giving voice to something that you know is true often results in shock and laughter. That’s what I saw,” Song continued.\nThe entire crowd had been eating non-stop stories about how everything was going to change for the better because of the new tech, usually sponsored by a panelist. 5/ What I said wasn’t anything special. I verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn’t get anything of substance from the presentation.\n— Jimmy Song (송재준) (@jimmysong) May 15, 2018\nReacting to the episode, Saifedean Ammous, author of ‘The Bitcoin Standard,’ agreed with Song, using Lubin’s sarcastic forecast that “Bitcoin 1.0” will be the sole innovation by 2023 in his favor.\n“BITCOIN 1.0: STILL the only game in town,” he tweeted.\nWhat do you think about Jimmy Song’s comments and wager with Joseph Lubin?

Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment.\nCanaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world's bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China's push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nEbang delisted from China's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nWhile many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly.\nIn Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software.\nAnother miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern.\nIn Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalisation of $333 million.\nCanaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, IFR added.\nCredit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm.\nThis week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation.\nTell us how you got started in this industry.\nI’ve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin–it progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it.\nHow would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It’s a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.\nThe conventional banking system really shows its limitations when we try to move money between developed and underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa. There are some serious inefficiencies that, frankly, many of the big banks just aren’t interested in fixing. But with bitcoin, you don’t have to worry about that. You can send money to, say, a coffee farmer in Africa, and he’ll receive it directly.\nMoney transfers are only one among a number of many other uses. Bitcoin is also a store of value. It’s one of the few assets that I would say are uncorrelated to the broader financial markets.\nAs for blockchain, it has innumerable world-changing applications across a wide range of industries. That’s why I believe it’s crucial that people have the right information about blockchain and understand it. If people don’t understand it, and it gets overhyped, I’m afraid it could start going in the wrong direction.\nWe recently mined the 17 millionth bitcoin, leaving only four million left. Explain why it becomes exponentially more difficult to mine coins the closer we get to that 21 million-coin ceiling.\nIt’s not that the mining itself becomes more difficult. To answer this, I think we have to look at two components.\nOne component is the daily supply of bitcoin. At the moment, only 1,800 bitcoins can be generated every day by the whole network, meaning all the miners worldwide. But it’s important to remember that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined, the rewards are halved. What this means is that after the next halving, which I believe is expected sometime in 2020, the number of bitcoins mined a day will fall from 1,800 to 900. And then after the next halving, it’ll be 450. This helps reduce the supply in a natural way. click to enlarge\nThe second component is a measure of how many miners and how much computing power is in the network. If more miners come online, then of course the competition becomes greater. Because the daily supply is already fixed, your market share shrinks. click to enlarge\nThink of it like the California Gold Rush. Mining gold at first was relatively easy because the metal was plentiful and there were few miners. By the end, it became more difficult because the easy gold had already been claimed, and you were competing with far more miners. We’re seeing the same thing happen with bitcoin and other mineable digital currencies.\nSpeaking of computing power, HIVE Blockchain just announced that it expanded to 24.2 megawatts (MW), up from 2.4 MW in August. What’s next in the pipeline for HIVE?\nYes, the last expansion was a massive build-out in Sweden. It was done in three phases. I think this was a remarkable achievement for HIVE, that it could add so much computing power so quickly.\nThis is only the beginning. The year is still long and you can expect to see some bigger expansions on the way. In September, for example, we’re going to ramp up another bitcoin mining facility worth 20 MW, which is very exciting. And from there it goes even further.\nG20 finance ministers are scheduled to share their plans for more uniform regulation of cryptocurrencies by July. What are your expectations?\nI personally think that this is very good and that it will bring more professionalism into the market. The momentum and adoption has grown so much and so rapidly that there really needs to be some kind of strategy–the world’s economic leaders can’t just leave this space untouched. Anyone who believes otherwise isn’t facing reality.\nHaving said that, regulating this market will not be easy because it’s in a whole other dimension than anything that has come before it. As an analogy, imagine someone trying to regulate flying cars using the same measures that have been written for cars driving on the street. It wouldn’t make any sense. So there will certainly need to be some innovation to get it right. I think it’s also important that the regulators talk to the right people, the industry leaders. They have good input, and I think it could be a very fruitful dialogue.\nAlong those same lines, South Korea’s central bank just announced that it was looking seriously into how the Korean economy might use blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, there’s talk of the country going cashless by 2020. Do you think that’s where the global financial systems are headed?\nI think there’s a natural incentive for governments to go in that direction because, of course, they want to have greater control over their economies. But as is the case with overregulation, too many controls–or going completely cashless–could be harmful to the economy. This is certainly part of a long and interesting debate, and I’m curious to see how it plays out, in South Korea and elsewhere.\nWhere do you see the best application of blockchain technology right now?\nBlockchain’s greatest contribution is its ability to erase boundaries. It completely removes the element of trust–or distrust, I should say–and adds a stabilizing effect to nearly every industry because of decentralization.\nTake the global banking industry, for example. You don’t need to look far to find some serious inefficiencies, as I mentioned earlier. We’re already seeing some very concrete instances where blockchain can be of help here. The banks recognize this and are getting together to make use of this technology to improve their services.\nWhat’s been the greatest challenge you’ve faced so far in your journey?\nFor me, the greatest challenge can usually be found in the moment that you’re currently in. I always compare this industry to the beginning of the internet–no one knew where it was headed or what it would eventually look like. Most people had a general idea that it was innovative and could benefit the world, but the full implications were unclear.\nSimilarly, no one knows where blockchain and cryptocurrencies might take us, and having to deal with this constant uncertainty is, I’ll admit, not trivial. You must always be prepared to act quickly in response to another bitcoin fork, a hack or some other unexpected event. These are things that keep you up at night.\nBut it’s exciting. I think what history has shown again and again is that it’s dangerous to be ignorant and to not have an open mind. Not everything was euphoric and wonderful when the internet first emerged. Problems still occur online, but I believe most people would agree that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nNo industry is without its challenges, and as long as you’re willing to address them, it can be very rewarding. As for blockchain technology, I’m very happy and thrilled to be a part of it this early on.\nInterested in learning more?

heads while parked outside a cryptocurrency conference taking place in New York this week were not owned by millionaire investors but instead were placed there by a digital currency exchange as part of an attention-grabbing promotion.\nIn the bitcoin world, the Lamborghini has long been seen as a symbol of status and wealth. But on Monday, the three luxury vehicles parked in front of Coindesk’s Consensus 2018 blockchain summit had been hired by the “BitMex” virtual currency exchange from a dealer called Broadway Supercars, led by a man called John Nouri who rents one car for around $1,000 a day, CNBC first reported.\n\"We do this for a lot of companies all the time,\" Nouri told the finance website , adding: \"It's an attention grabber. It's for the people walking in. They all say once you make money in crypto, you buy a lambo. I [have] never made money with crypto…but I have ten lambos.” It appeared to work, with several Twitter users posting images of the supercars, which typically have a starting price of around $200,000.\nAccording to Nouri, the three flashy cars were rented to be placed outside the venue for five hours on Monday. Boasting more than 8,000 attendees paying between $1,500 and $3,000 a ticket, Consensus 2018 is expected to make Coindesk at least $17 million this week. The conference comes after bitcoin, the world’s most widely-used cryptocurrency, spiked in value last year to be worth around $20,000 per virtual coin. It has since tanked in price and is now priced at approximately $8,700 per coin.\n 51 Royal Wedding: 50 Things to Know about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Upcoming Marriage\nA trio of Lamborghinis turned heads while parked outside a crypto conference taking place in New York this week. Neeraj K. Agrawal/Twitter/Used with permission It was not the only stunt that was pulled as the conference kicked off. A crypto venture called Genesis Mining held a fake protest on the streets of New York under the banner “Bankers Against Bitcoin” that also gained Twitter users’ attention. Footage showed men and women dancing and chanting while holding signs including, “Why hasn’t this bubble popped?” and “Leave Wells Fargo Alone.”\n“This joke today is going to be the reality in the very near future,” Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining claimed on a website this week while describing the mock demonstration.\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n“This protest is representative of what will happen to those industries and companies that fail to understand times have changed,” the chief executive continued. “Legacy industries that have gone unchallenged for decades will soon begin to see their monopoly slip away. The consumer abuse that’s been possible due to a lack of competition is over.” He added: “The biggest competitor big banks have ever faced has arrived and it’s not a company or organization, it’s a decentralized technology.”\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

are back in a bear market on the daily charts. One bitcoin is selling for $8,683 dollars right now while LTC is Quote: d at $147 dollars per coin.\nBitcoin Back in a Downtrend.\nBitcoin Back in a Downtrend\nAs noted in our previous article, BTC/USD is now back in a bear market. Last week we saw a drop of over $1,000 dollars during which a low of $8,202 was hit. From here we got somewhat of a dead-cat bounce, helped by the Consensus conference.\nBut with the event already underway and technicals turning bearish, speculators could start to ‘sell the news’. Weak support on the way down can be found at the $8,202 swing low, followed by the $8,000 round figure. Further down we have more support at $7,821, another notable swing low. A strong support area below can be found in the $6,420 to $6,600 dollars range. This is where we bottomed out during the last selloff. A decisive break below here could open the door for a break of this year’s low at $5,980 dollars.\nOn the upside there’s resistance at the $9,165 dollars, followed by a strong area of resistance around the $10,000 round figure. A clean breakout above here would both end the downtrend and start a new uptrend. On the longer-term weekly charts BTC/USD is in a range while the monthly chart is looking bullish.\nLitecoin Back in a Bear Market\nLitecoin continues to follow bitcoin down. The altcoin dropped $39 dollars last week, hitting a low of $130.77 at one point. We are currently Quote: d somewhat higher as the start of Consensus lifted crypto assets all around.\nBut similarly to BTC, this move will likely not last. The daily trend for LTC/USD remains bearish. To end it the bulls will have to push us above this month’s high at $184.74 dollars. Weak support below can be found at the $133.92 and $130.70 swing lows.\nFurther down we have more support at the $123.50 dollars followed by the the $108.44 swing low. The low for 2018 is close to here at $105.55 dollars, some traders may choose to wait until that milestone is taken out as well. Further down the $100 round figure may also act as weak support although this level is not as strong as the $105.55 – $108.44 support area. On the longer-term weekly and monthly charts LTC/USD is still looking bullish.\nFxOpen Blog Forum Rules | Support for New Traders | FxOPEN PAMM | FxOPEN NEWS | Crypto | FXOpen Affiliate Forum |", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://forum.fxopenaffiliate.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T19:11:49.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee379108ac69434e2ce350f48b965160cb5f0067", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LuV4iJmoIbLVoJOVgGEF1zg-", "site_full": "www.instaforex.com", "site": "instaforex.com", "site_section": "http://news.instaforex.com/en/analytics/rss/?x=BAED", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex analysis review", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 15, 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for May 15, 2018", "published": "2018-05-15T13:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee379108ac69434e2ce350f48b965160cb5f0067", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LuV4iJmoIbLVoJOVgGEF1zg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T13:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 15, 2018", "text": "15.05.2018 12:34 Bitcoin analysis for May 15, 2018\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading sideways at the price of $8.683.

He stated that crypto is “facilitating trade that would not otherwise occur. Some of that’s illegal, but some of that is avoiding costs that would otherwise be there.”\nAsked whether Bitcoin was a threat to the US dollar, Bullard voiced uncertainty about the potential competition the leading cryptocurrency could pose, saying, “I don’t think so at this point […]. We don’t know how the future’s going to unfold.”\n“My idea is that there’s a lot of currency competition going on right now,” Bullard meanwhile continued on the topic of dollar supremacy, adding:\n“The dollar has been the winner historically because it’s backed by the largest economy and a relatively stable policy in terms of low inflation and that’s going to be tough to beat. But a lot of people here want to beat it.”\nOn the topic of blockchain, Bullard was much more openly bullish, saying:\n“we think blockchain technology is very interesting [..] we want to be very engaged and thoughtful as this proceeds.”\nHe also responded to a question of whether or not the Fed was considering issuing its own cryptocurrency, saying noncommittally, “we can certainly look at that as a possibility. And there are different parts of the Fed that look at all kinds of applications of blockchain technology. But I wouldn’t say there’s any plan at this point.\nThe comments continue the trend of general crypto support from the St. Louis Fed. In January this year, the reserve bank published a dedicated paper titled “A Short Introduction to the World of Cryptocurrencies” in which researches forecast it was “likely” that Bitcoin and altcoins would “emerge as their own asset class.”\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cnbc", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/st-louis-fed-sees-future-in-crypto-as-important-asset-class-bitcoin-as-digital-gold", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/14/st-louis-feds-james-bullard-talks-bitcoin-and-the-economy.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bullard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james bullard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "suggests st. louis fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis fed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T15:45:08.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30edb8aec5f54178940c41eb8fb301a89b309979", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8TqO_GxBfLwZpeI71H7uB86npROINtmjWVPexaQWSPC6kg30QzuQpl7UPJDwwDy3Rzl.NwtrjyKW5aCrbDIuXLM-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "~Public Service Announcement~ Please be extra careful using Bitcoin Cash on the Trezor!

However, the cryptocurrency was able to fully recover in the afternoon, as it experienced a sharp increase, gaining nearly $400 in less than an hour. The digital coin finished the day at $8.716.79.\nToday, Bitcoin has largely traded sideways, hovering around the $8,750 mark. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency was priced at just above $8,740, according to Coinmarketcap’s price average.\nIn other news, Bitcoin derivatives firm LedgerX yesterday announced that it was launching a new service that would allow investors to earn interest on their holdings. LedgerX’s president and chief risk officer Juthica Chou yesterday told Coindesk that the new service operates similarly to the company’s Bitcoin call options with a streamlined interface for investors.\n\"We're seeing more and more demand for people who want to earn some sort of interest off their bitcoin and lending is not exactly natural to people - especially lending where they earn their interest back in bitcoin. So we're seeing participants come back to trading,\" Chou explained, as quoted by Coindesk.\nLast October, LedgerX became the first company to start offering Bitcoin derivatives in the US.

FILE PHOTO: A token of the virtual currency Bitcoin is seen placed on a monitor that displays binary digits in this illustration picture, December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic//File Photo\nCanaan Creative has applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for an IPO while Zhejiang Ebang Communication has started working with advisers on a Hong Kong float, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\nWhile the price of bitcoin BTC=BTSP has tumbled 35 percent this year and Beijing has tightened its grip on trade in the virtual currency, equipment makers are still hungry for capital to fund growth and to meet still robust demand for their machines.\nBoth are seeking as much as $1 billion, IFR said, which would dwarf other known listings for crytopcurrency firms.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment.\nCanaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China’s push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nEbang delisted from China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nWhile many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain – the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin – few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly.\nIn Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX ( DCC.AX ) and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software.\nAnother miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern.\nIn Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain ( HIVE.V ) last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalization of $333 million.\nCanaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan’s float, IFR added.\nCredit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBitcoin mining equipment makers make computers with special chips that mine the coins more efficiently than more mainstream chips made by companies such as Intel.

There, he focused on his three obsessions; gaming, tech and economics.\nAfter a four-year career supplementing his income as a top gamer on the esports circuit, he switched his attentions to trading bitcoin.\nNow 29, Jay is one of the country’s most respected and widely followed cryptocurrency traders.\nToday he starts a new, weekly column advising Evening Standard readers how to navigate the crypto minefield.\nEOS and Me\nThe City venue was big. Swish. All steel, glass and exposed brickwork.\nNot the kind of place I find myself often.\nUnlike the rest of the guys at the conference.\nThey were bankers, wearing suits worth more than I earned in a month before I started trading. They looked at home there, a tribe, all dressed in identical uniform.\nMe? I was in jeans and a hoody.\nI wasn’t the only one: there were a few other hoodies in the room, too, including our hosts. They were from my tribe – the tech guys. And we were the only ones in there who had a clue what we were talking about.\nIt was the convention at the Chiswell Street Brewery for big business and corporates, sponsored by the brains behind a new cryptocurrency called EOS. I’d been excited by their stuff for ages; EOS had barely even started trading back then, but I thought it had the potential to be massive.\nFrom the get-go, you could see the suits were out of their depth. They’d clearly been sent by their banks to get a handle on “this Blockchain thing.”\nThat said, the busiest talks were for EOS, which proved to me one thing; EOS had big money interest. Not necessarily clever money. But big.\nThe weird thing was, despite it being blindingly obvious that it was only my tribe who really got this stuff, of all the suits there - from JPMorgan, to Morgan Stanley, to Barclays - only one asked what we thought. He was a clever guy from a clever bank - Goldman Sachs. To this day, Goldman is still the only bank that really seems to understand crypto, and – as importantly - treats the industry and people within it with respect.\nThat was almost year ago. Since then I’ve been offered eyewatering amounts of cash to work for chunky hedge funds, but I’ve turned them all down.\nYou see, I don’t want to work for some “hedgie” who’s already a millionaire with huge property portfolios and fancy cars. Who thinks millennials should stop whingeing about house prices and spend less money on avocados if they want to get on the ladder.\nI’d rather share my knowledge with ordinary people. Folks who might really need the money it could make them.\nYou see, to me, cryptocurrencies and the blockchains they’re built on aren’t cool because they made me wealthy.\nThey’re awe-inspiring because of their potential to change our planet.\nThey’re amazing because they will allow people in dictatorships to talk and trade with the outside world.\nThey’re life enhancing because they’ll allow us to talk to each other for free, without Facebook or Twitter taking a cut, selling our data, or shovelling ads onto our feeds.\nThe knowledge behind cryptocurrencies shouldn’t just be for a small band of rich guys to keep for themselves. We need to share it with the world. Be transparent. Evangelise.\nThat’s kind of what this column is about.\nAnd that’s kind of what EOS is about.\nWhat’s so special about EOS?\nYou see, EOS wants to open its technology and ownership to anyone and everyone who’s interested.\nIt’s a cryptocurrency which is opening up the blockchain system behind it to any software developer wanting to build apps on it. You could think of it like Google allowing anyone and everyone to write apps for Android. Just as Google is now profiting from the ubiquity of Android on billions of people’s phones, so EOS wants to become the platform of choice for the new breed of apps, decentralised ones.\nWhy? Because in order to do anything on the EOS blockchain, you must first own a bit of EOS, and you own it through EOS tokens.\nI'll give you an example. Imagine Uber: it is extremely popular for a handful of reasons, the rides are cheaper than traditional taxis, the passengers and drivers are incentivised to be polite and amicable, the app is intuitive and easy to use.\nBut if I were to build an Uber on a blockchain like EOS’s, I could easily improve it. First off, because blockchain directly connects both sides of the transaction – driver and passenger – you can remove the company in the middle that’s taking a cut. That saves money for everybody. Fees would be priced in the local currency, but be paid with the “Uber” token.\nAs my app became more popular, the “Uber” token passengers would use for it would rise in value, so stakeholders are incentivised to develop it further and improve the service.\nThe payments could be instant, direct into the driver’s account. No fee to a middleman company, and no minimum requirements on payment amounts since there are no banks taking a cut either.\nIn the same way that the token for this app would rise in value as its popularity grows, so too would the value of EOS, whose blockchain powers the system behind the scenes. My investors, my customers’ drivers, and their passengers have aligned incentives to grow their network. Every time someone uses the token the economy grows, and since EOS is powering all transactions and computation, that too will grow.\nThe EOS Coin Offering (ICO)\nFor me to build this theoretical Uber alternative app, the guys behind EOS (a software company called Block.one) had to first create the infrastructure and tools for me to build it with, which they fund through what’s known as an Initial Coin Offering. An ICO is where a project sells tokens in its currency to raise funds for development. It works like a stock market flotation, and what you do is this:\nStep one: announce how great your tech is. Drum up interest among investors and programmers\nStep two: announce you’re going to raise x million dollars by issuing a limited number of tokens.\nStep three: put the tokens on the market and watch the money roll in\nThat process is fine, but while it may raise the money you want, it usually means that, if your crypto is any good, a group of maybe 20 very rich guys end up getting half of the coins. It’s complicated to explain how, but basically you can pay a fat fee to push to the front of the queue, ahead of ordinary investors.\nEOS didn’t want that. Quite the opposite; because they want to maximise the popularity of their platform, they wanted as many people as possible to own their tokens.\nInstead of putting them all on the market at once to be gobbled up by a few wealthy folks in a matter of minutes, the EOS folks have staggered their offering of 1 billion coins over a whole year, selling chunks of 2 million tokens a day, every day. Everyone who applies gets a percentage of that day’s issue according to how much they can afford. Like most cryptocurrencies, the tokens can be split into fractions like the old ha’penny piece, meaning there’s no high minimum entry level. You could buy $1 of EOS if you wanted to.\nAll that has served as a disincentive to rich investors hoping to corner the market, and meant far more ordinary people have got in on the action.\nHundreds of thousands of different people now own a piece of EOS. That’s very cool. It makes EOS the John Lewis of cryptos. Or even better; the crypto Co-op, more widely held than over 99% of other cryptos, rivaling the likes of Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin and Ethereum.\nThe thing is, the auction is finally coming to an end on 1 June. On the same day, the infrastructure will go live, so all those apps being developed by people like me (more about my EOS apps in future columns) will also begin launching, using EOS for transactions and data transfers.\nThat means there will be no more supply of EOS (apart from perhaps 1-4% inflation per year if the EOS community agrees to it) but potentially lots of demand. The question is: how much demand, and how much will the market price that demand at?\nWhy should I buy EOS?\nEOS tokens have shot up from $7 to as much as $21 in the past few weeks as the market tries to value how popular EOS will be after launching. If software developers go totally mad for it, the price should rise further. If not, it could collapse.\nMy guess is the former. Early versions of the EOS platform pre-launched in what we call Beta testing have been seriously exciting. It’s super fast, can cope with huge volumes of transactions, and is really easy to write code for. For techies out there, it uses the language called C++ for coding, which is really common among developers. Ethereum, by contrast, uses a specific, newly-created language called Solidity.\nThere’s another reason I reckon the price of EOS will rise.\nRemember how I was saying the value would depend on how many people spend it to use EOS-based apps? Well, EOS’s founders (a software company called Block.one) have given hundreds of millions of dollars from the funds raised during the ICO to venture capital funds investing in app start-ups. One condition: only apps using the Eos infrastructure can apply for funding. EOS VC funding currently totals $1.4 billion.\nIf that doesn’t encourage more people to launch start-ups, I don’t know what will.\nThere are literally thousands of developers working on blockchain based apps that do away with the middlemen of this world. Who knows, one of those on the EOS system could be the app that kills off the need for multi-billion dollar companies like Twitter, or Facebook, or even Barclays?\nSee why a share-the-love kind of guy like me is a fan?\nFor those just looking to turn a profit from speculating on the currency, you have to be aware EOS is extremely volatile, just like all cryptos. As recently as March, it was only $4. I’ve been slowly buying more since it was $1 and made myself some of the biggest returns I’ve ever had. It’s now my biggest crypto position in my portfolio.\nBut there’s no guarantee it won’t collapse. There are many risks to consider.\nThe Risks of buying EOS\nThe software might prove to be a disappointment (unlikely as we’ve already seen plenty of it in beta test-runs).\nIt might be overtaken by better innovations elsewhere. Etherium is developing great new technology for its platform to scale up, while IOTA and Cardano offer their own visions of the future and are both hot on the heels of EOS.\nYou can’t completely eliminate the fact that it might face attack from hackers, regulators or even rival projects.\nIf you’re thinking of speculating on EOS, then, those are the questions you must ask yourself.\nFor me, though, I’m all in – as a speculator and an enthusiast.\nTry the EOS blockchain for yourself!\nMeantime, if you’re up for a game of Space Invaders, head over to this link and play it on EOS.

The subsequent popularity in cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ether (which sits atop the Ethereum network) has sent the prices of these currencies surging through the roof. Bitcoin itself surpassed the $4000 mark this year while Ether has ballooned from around the $8 mark in January to over $300 this month. Then there s the Bitcoin fork, known as Bitcoin Cash , which came into existence just this month and which has surprisingly surged to $600 in recent days. There s a range of other cryptos and the market, generally speaking, is heating up. But caution is required as volatility in these markets is significant — investing in cryptos is not for the faint-hearted. Subsequently, at BizNews, we ve received a number of questions on the topic from readers and I ve answered some of those questions here. Of course, there s a lot of burning curiosity around cryptos. So, if you have a question, please feel free to email me on this link and I ll try to publish an answer in future posts. Gareth van Zyl\nHope you do not mind me picking your brain but I am new to Bitcoin and have recently purchased one share [one unit]. I would ultimately like four and will just keep plugging away every month. I think this is the way forward. I also would like to invest in Civic and Ether. How do I go about it? I would like the safest way to invest in these and do you think they are good to get into now? Beverley Vosloo.\nBeverly, it sounds like you’ve developed a plan on acquiring Bitcoin and it will be interesting to see how your strategy pans out. At today’s current Bitcoin price, one Bitcoin unit (BTC1) trades for about R56 000 on local exchanges, bringing your total planned Bitcoin investment to around the R224 000 mark. The beauty of a decentralised cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is that once you own it, you can transfer/exchange it for any other cryptocurrency (anywhere in the world) such as Ether (which forms part of the Ethereum network or blockchain.) If you’ve bought Bitcoin on a local South African Bitcoin exchange such as Luno or ICE3X, you can then transfer your Bitcoin to other global exchanges, like Kraken, which allow you to buy Ethereum and, in fact, a range of other cryptos such as Bitcoin Cash (BTC). Of course, you have to set up your account on Kraken, which can take a few days to verify as they capture data such as your address, name etc. But once you have an account open on one of these global exchanges, it is as simple as transferring your desired amount of Bitcoin to your exchange/wallet of choice (this can take less than an hour). Once you have a Kraken wallet and some Bitcoin in there, you can then purchase Ether. This method, though, does incur costs along the way. Now, you may also want to consider ICE3X, which is is the first exchange in South Africa to sell Ether, and this may be a more desirable route. (But again, you have look at the costs involved and weigh up your decision.) So, one option for you may be to rather just skip buying Bitcoin and go straight to Ether on ICE3X. A key note to remember is that Ethereum is similar to Bitcoin in that it is a cryptocurrency that operates on a blockchain. Vinny Lingham, the CEO and founder of blockchain identity business Civic.com.\nHowever, there are some differences. For example, Ethereum uses a more flexible technology when it comes to the average number of transactions per second. Ethereum is also a smart contract network, which means that ‘if and else’ conditions can be built into transactions themselves, opening up fascinating opportunities for commerce. One result of the smart contract approach in recent months has been the rapid rise of so-called ‘ICOs’ or ‘Initial Coin Offerings’ in the market. ICOs, like IPOs on a stock market, allow you to invest in startups by using cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin to buy ICO “coins”, which are akin to digital coupons or tokens. Buyers of these ‘tokens’ or cryptocoins hope that the startup will perform well, leading to an increase in value. Now, Civic headed up by South African born Vinny Lingham launched a token sale earlier this year in which it raised $33m. Civic called its move a ‘token sale’ rather than an ICO, because it wanted to create 1 billion tokens to allow for secure and low-cost access to identity verification through the blockchain’s online ledger. The tokens were sold for the equivalent of 10 US cents and they could be purchased using cryptos such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The value of these tokens now are around 49 US cents each. Now, the token sale is currently over, but if you want to buy Civic Coins (CVC), you can turn to sites such as www.bittrex.com and purchase these using Bitcoin. To then keep your coins safe in future on your own device, you can use an offfering like Trezor .\nSir, I m an ardent follower of your daily emails and the political instability in our country, South Africa. Please could you assist me on how can I join Bitcoin to earn a few rands? I m a pensioner and could start with R2000 only. Is this too little? Your valued advice will be needed to assist me. Janitha Singh\nHi Janitha, you can buy Bitcoin with any amount of money thanks to the beauty of Bitcoin s (and all cryptocurrencies ) deciminal nature. Obviously one Bitcoin currently trades at around R56 000 at the time of writing on Luno. But R2000 worth will get you approximately 0.03521096 BTC (Bitcoin). Ultimately, only you can decide whether this is too little for you. Just bear in mind, that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets are volatile in nature with wild swings. If you have the stomach for that, then good luck. Also, although there is no regulation around cryptocurrencies in South Africa, the best advice I can give is to treat Bitcoin as an asset class in South Africa. This means that you must declare any earnings you make to SARS as it could trigger a capital gains tax or personal income tax if you re a trader. Also, it s key to note that local Bitcoin exchanges like Luno typically capture your FICA information.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\nWhat is the best platform to use, to purchase (or mine ) Ether? Peter Bodill\nHi Peter, in terms of purchasing Ether, you have a range of choices (see my answer in the first question). However, to summarise, ICE3X is the first exchange in South Africa to sell Ether. Alternatively, you can buy Bitcoin through another SA exchange like Luno and then buy Ether from other international exchanges such as Kraken.\nMining crypto is a whole different ball game. If you want to do it yourself, you will need a mining kit at home that, on the basic end, involves a simple laptop and some mining software and on the higher end an actual server. But unless you’re willing to invest the time and effort (and money on the electricity costs, which are constantly rising in South Africa), the incentive to mine crypto yourself is pretty low. You would really, ideally need a server farm in a location such as China (which has low energy costs) to pull this off well. Alternatively, there is something called ‘cloud mining’ whereby you can mine bitcoin via a third party data centre. This topic is another article on its own, but it can involve you investing in a crypto mining outfit and receiving a small return for your investment (in crypto such as Bitcoin). However, the returns are widely reported to be small and you would need to establish if it’s worth your time and money. Also, there are various mining scams out there, so do your homework and be careful. Because of Bitcoin’s decentralised nature, always be wary. No regulator or law authority will step in to save you if you’ve invested in a scam that sounded too good to be true.

A common ground however in each of these many forms is the fact that your yield or profit as the case may be, has a greater potential return on investment if you invest early enough, at a point your profit or interest even becomes more than your capital.

Bitcoin's market value was about $150.1 billion (roughly Rs. 10 lakh crores).\n\"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement.\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions. Industry critics say the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering.\nLast month, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked Gemini and 12 other cryptocurrency trading platforms to provide details about their operations and safety measures.\nZcash incorporates the technology \"zk-snark,\" short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, which lets people trade with each other in anonymity.\nGemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later.\n\"We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,\" Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo's office.\nThe Winklevosses, who are 36-year-old twins, in 2008 reached a $65 million (roughly Rs. 440 crores) settlement with Facebook and founder Mark Zuckerberg over who had the idea for the social media website.\nThey also competed in the men's rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n©

11:11:13 AM The price of Bitcoin growing consistently from 2009 sum of people are very confuse to see the price of BTC that what is the right time to invest.\nAccording to my opinion at this time price of Bitcoin in low position so you can invest.\nWhat you think.\nIt could be argued that it is always the right time to buy bitcoin, because even those that bought close to the all time high are still going to get profits if they hold their coins, but if they do not have faith in bitcoin and then they sell their coins then they are going to get losses, so before buying bitcoin ask yourself if you're willing to hold no matter what.\nYeah you are right every time is the right time for investment. Two things needed for investment in cryptocurrency. One is courage and other is patience. Courage to bear the lose if the prices falls and patience to hold bitcoin for long time. Holding means silent business which give you profit with the passage of time. Dont waste your time and go ahead to buy bitcoin.\nThis is correct, you need a lot of courage to invest in something like bitcoin that you cannot even touch with your hands, I think that is one of the reasons of why people are not really investing in bitcoin as they should, because at least with other forms of investment like gold and real estate you can see what you are buying and you can touch it with your hands but that is not true for bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:53:06.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9452ed5ef9685725758811cef5d1e3f00779bfd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStazHI00VAAaXbG3XTJ8qM9qYjzU96wjnTL0joEWNuswzoXc89ZJp0o3b.5eI9cM3JNzdODv.lgDQiM2.7lvO.cdp99xZPFouZ8n15OhrSmJ4gvEXtk6alQBvnEPCRTInrdrcbpva0PQ--", "site_full": "forum.bits.media", "site": "bits.media", "site_section": "https://forum.bits.media/index.php?/forum/81-english/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "English - Bitcoin Forum", "title": "Bitcoin mining service with 150$ per 1TH/s and 2 years contract!", "title_full": "Bitcoin mining service with 150$ per 1TH/s and 2 years contract! - English - Bitcoin Forum", "published": "2018-05-15T13:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forum.bits.media/uploads/monthly_2017_10/logo_bits.media_s.png.63c66d89ed24f0087a5dc1a84a44af7d.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18487, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9452ed5ef9685725758811cef5d1e3f00779bfd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStazHI00VAAaXbG3XTJ8qM9qYjzU96wjnTL0joEWNuswzoXc89ZJp0o3b.5eI9cM3JNzdODv.lgDQiM2.7lvO.cdp99xZPFouZ8n15OhrSmJ4gvEXtk6alQBvnEPCRTInrdrcbpva0PQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gold Hiver", "published": "2018-05-15T13:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin mining service with 150$ per 1TH/s and 2 years contract!", "text": "Good day everyone,\nI would like to present you a new cloud mining service - minehive.eu\nMinehive is an ever-growing pool of miners, with a place for anyone who would like to join.\nWe offer Antminer S9 mining technology for a 2-year renting period priced at $150 for TH/s.\nOur unique service features:\nNo minimum withdrawal amounts.

Memo.cash also recently released their source code which might lead to new spin-offs to Memo.cash or otherwise.\nOther interesting news is that Bitcoin Cash now has its biggest competitor to twitter - Blockpress, which stores all data on-chain using the Bitcoin Cash blockchain and IFPS.\nChanges: Added Blockchair, Blockpress, Coins4Clothes, Cryptartica Design, FindBitcoin.Cash and Sporestack. My first plan was to make this a list that is updated monthly, but there is so much many new projects happening that I think that it will be updated bi-monthly to keep it up-to-date.\nRequirements for being on the list: Payment processors, merchants, block explorer, tipping services, charities and wallets are not on this list because there are too many to list. The requirements aren't set in stone but the key words behind this list is \"innovative\" or \"popular\" and the exceptions to these rules are along these lines. If you feel like your project fits into these criteria, please feel free to comment below and your project will be added to the next list!\nI have done an exception to these projects with these motivations, but this might change later on:\nName Type Motivation Blockchair Block explorer It has added an memo.cash search function and has a lot of functionality. EatBCH Charity It was the first charity after the hardfork and got a lot of attention. Cryptonize.it Merchant One of the first merchants that supported BCH payments and who is adding colored coins and an integrated spend & replace wallet connected to coinbase. Cryptarctica Design Merchant An initiative by one of the bigger Bitcoin Cash merchants to offer artists the chance to get paid by using their designs on apparel and other items. Coins 4 clothes Charity A charity that accepts clothes for BCH. It also has an open financial record available. Tippr Tipping service The first and most popular tipping service for BCH.

Canaan Creative has applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for an IPO while Zhejiang Ebang Communication has started working with advisers on a Hong Kong float, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. While the price of bitcoin has tumbled 35 percent this year and Beijing has tightened its grip on trade in the virtual currency, equipment makers are still hungry for capital to fund growth and to meet still robust demand for their machines. Both are seeking as much as $1 billion, IFR said, which would dwarf other known listings for crytopcurrency firms. Canaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. Canaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world's bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China's push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company. Ebang delisted from China's National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing. While many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software. Another miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern. In Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalisation of $333 million. Canaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying. Credit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, IFR added. Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bitcoin mining equipment makers make computers with special chips that mine the coins more efficiently than more mainstream chips made by companies such as Intel.

This week's ascending channel with current support at $8,480 is intact on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now trading nicely above the $8,500 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Bitcoin price is following a bullish path above $8,600 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD has to move above $9,000 to accelerate gains in the near term.\nBitcoin Price Analysis There was a slow and steady rise in bitcoin price above the $8,500 resistance against the US Dollar. The price traded higher and even broke the $8,600 resistance level to settle above the 100 hourly simple moving average. The upside move was positive, as the price traded close to the $8,900 resistance level. A high was formed at $8,899 before the price started a downside correction.\nIt moved down and traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,305 low to $8,899 high. However, the price remains well supported on the downside above the $8,500 level. An immediate key support is at $8,600, which is the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,305 low to $8,899 high. Furthermore, the 100 hourly SMA is positioned near $8,550 to prevent declines in the near term. Additionally, this week's ascending channel with current support at $8,480 is intact on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is placed nicely above $8,500 and the 100 hourly SMA. Therefore, as long as the price is above $8,500, it could continue to move higher towards $9,000. A break above $9,000 will most likely confirm a solid bullish bias towards $10,000.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently moving lower towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,500\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,900\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Primed for Gains appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:49:48.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc7dfbc1bfec8d2cdb37c048844b4f2fa0b28169", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2ht0CnWf6uoJIMnvWlwPINvdktTsqChM3nu1dvidTzeLrOKowSCSJyb3L7mawYVImgeEEdaMdRw--", "site_full": "feedproxy.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://gadgetrio.us/feed", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "GadgetRio.US", "title": "This app lets you trade Bitcoin without an internet connection", "title_full": "This app lets you trade Bitcoin without an internet connection", "published": "2018-05-15T12:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/gadgetrio.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/this-app-lets-you-trade-bitcoin-without-an-internet-connection.png?resize=660%2C330&ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc7dfbc1bfec8d2cdb37c048844b4f2fa0b28169", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2ht0CnWf6uoJIMnvWlwPINvdktTsqChM3nu1dvidTzeLrOKowSCSJyb3L7mawYVImgeEEdaMdRw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-15T12:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "This app lets you trade Bitcoin without an internet connection", "text": "Home / Tech News / This app lets you trade Bitcoin without an internet connection This app lets you trade Bitcoin without an internet connection admin 1 min ago Tech News Leave a comment 0 Views\nIf you’re a cryptocurrency trader and often find often find yourself dealing with a spotty internet connection or none at all, there’s now a way to make transactions offline.\ngoTenna , a decentralized communications startup based in New York, has partnered with Samourai Bitcoin Wallet to create an app that lets you trade Bitcoins even when your device isn’t connected to the web.\nBut, it won’t be all that simple though. For one, you will need to have a goTenna mesh device that costs $179. The device pairs with your phone to create a mesh network with other goTenna users, allowing you to transmit information over a long range without cellular data or Wi-Fi, using UHF frequencies.\nThe app, named TxTenna, works by creating a channel between the Samourai Wallet and the goTenna mesh device.\nThe users create a standard bitcoin transaction on their Samourai Wallet as usual, but without requiring internet access. The transaction information is passed to the TxTenna App, which broadcasts it to nearby mesh nodes via the paired goTenna mesh device.\nEach goTenna device will relay the transaction information to further devices, until it reaches one that’s connected to the internet and also running the TxTenna app. When that last device syncs with a phone, it’ll send your transaction info through to the Bitcoin network.\nThis setup can come in handy when you’re traveling or stationed in a remote area without stable internet connectivity or cellular coverage.\nIf you find yourself in a remote location, you’ll need intermediary mesh devices — one per three miles, at least – between you and another goTenna gizmo that’s connected to the internet.\ngoTenna also notes that its device will “obscure who you are and where you’re at when making these transactions,” which implies that you can make trades without compromising on privacy.\nThe exploration of alternative broadcasting methods for Bitcoin transaction is not new.\nBlockstream launched broadcast satellites in August last year to allow increased access to the Bitcoin’s Network, even for people who do not have access to the internet. Nick Sazbo also explored the possibility of sending Bitcoin over radio.\nSamourai Wallet says it was inspired by the predecessors to create an alternative Bitcoin broadcast method that further improves security features and tackle network outages and censorship.\nIt’s nice to know that cryptocurrency traders have an alternative to internet access when they need to make transactions from remote areas, but it will require mass adoption for the mesh network to be able to work effectively.
