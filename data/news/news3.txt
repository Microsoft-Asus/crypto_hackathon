(NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, announced today that it has used Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency its subsidiary Super Crypto Mining, Inc., or SCM, has mined through its operations, to reduce the Company’s debt, marking a milestone for the Company and possibly the use of Bitcoin on a commercial basis. SCM actively mines the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and, since late 2017 has held its inventory of Bitcoin as one of its long term operational and investment strategies. DPW incurred new debt recently to support the purchase of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (\"Enertec\"), a 22-year-old private company, by another of its subsidiaries, Coolisys Technologies, Inc. Enertec is Israel’s largest private developer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the aerospace and defense markets. Enertec generated over $8 million in annual revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. DPW has made a payment of $500,000 towards this new debt today thus leveraging the mined Bitcoin through a non-dilutive transaction to shareholders. The Company believes this transaction is significant for both its shareholders as well as the cryptocurrency community worldwide. “We believe this transaction of reducing the debt incurred from the purchase of Enertec with the cryptocurrency we have mined validates Bitcoin’s value as a commodity and the use of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency. DPW will expand its cryptocurrency mining operations as well as explore other paths to further advance the use of Bitcoin,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Mr. Ault emphasized, “Having a lender provide capital for our acquisitions while our company is able to mine and use cryptocurrency to reduce debt that is used to purchase an asset, marks an important moment in the transactional use of Bitcoin for both the Company as well as the crypto community.”\nABOUT DPW HOLDINGS, INC.\nHeadquartered in Newport Beach, CA, DPW Holdings, Inc.

After the mania at the end of last year when the price spiked to almost $20,000, the cryptocurrency took a tumble but more noticeably attention has drained away. You need no greater sign of that than figures showing bitcoin Google searches are down 90 per cent. That adds weight to the argument that much of the late 2017 big leg-up was driven by mainstream punters jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. So with bitcoin largely out of the headlines, is that it for the cryptocurrency or is it time to buy for the long-term when things are quiet? On this week’s podcast we take a look at who’s buying, who’s holding and who might be waiting for the price to rise again and greater fool theory to deliver someone who will take their bitcoin off their hands. Simon Lambert, Lee Boyce and Georgie Frost also take a look at gold – and why people aren’t buying this traditional form of investment portfolio insurance – and the most consistent investment trusts of the past decade. And finally, the Government’s policy currently appears to be to confuse motorists as much as possible, with new MOT rules recently joining the car tax muddle. Are drivers now being held to ransom by mechanics over ‘dangerous’ faults – surely no garage would do that?

In the last 36 hours the price has not changed to any great extent. Bitcoin (BTC) price could make strong move Since the 24th of May a recent CoinDesk article points out, bitcoin has been trading within the $7,000 to $7,800 range but within the last day and a half the range is even tighter indicating an indecisive market most likely. Daily volatility as measured by the daily spread between high and low fell to just $107.63 Thursday. This is the lowest level since way back on October 2, 2017. It is also down 86 percent from the 2018 average so far of $793 according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. As of the time of the article's posting at 10:48 UTC on Friday BTC price was $7,580 a drop of just $100 dollars over a 24 hour period. Perhaps this is the calm before the storm as an extended sideways motion is often followed by a strong move up or down. According to technical theory the wider the range and longer the consolidation period the more likely is there to be a violent move up or down. A move of $800 in either direction could be expected soon. Earlier this week bitcoin looked to be set up for a major upward move as there was an upside break of the falling channel. But the bulls failed to break through the $7,780 resistance level and has left it open for bearish tendencies to return. A downside break is the more likely of the two possible movements. The article notes that the price was dropping as it went to press. The CoinDesk outlook The CoinDesk analysis concludes: A move above $7,819 (50-week moving average) would signal a bullish breakout and would set the tone for a rally to pennant resistance located at $8,880. On the downside, a break below $7,090 (pennant support) would imply a bearish breakdown. In this case, BTC could potentially drop below $6,000 (Feb low).\" The present situation The price of BTC opened at $7,688 and rose to a high of $7,694 before dropping back to a low of $7,544. The price has now reached back up to $7, 645 at 16:30 UTC. So far there is no sign of a clear break in either direction as the drop was reversed. However there are still another 7 plus hours left in the day. The present price of BTC can be found here.

Unique addresses in the Bitcoin ecosystem are payment addresses that have a non-zero balance . This metric is one way of understanding the daily use of the Bitcoin network.\nUpward or downward modifiers\nAt times, the number of unique addresses tends to increase, and at other times it tends to decrease. This is affected by the following factors.\nThings that increase unique addresses.\nWhen fees are high, people leave their UTXOs in multiple addresses, because it costs too much to consolidate them . When the network is popular, more unique addresses are in use. As the Bitcoin network grows, in general there will be more unique addresses over time. Things that decrease unique addresses.\nWhen fees are low, people (or their wallets) will consolidate their funds into a single address. Batching reduces the number of unique addresses in use. More batching will decrease unique addresses and less batching will do the opposite. When the market tanks, less unique addresses are in use because people just aren't transacting as much (not as fun to speculate). Armed with this knowledge, I was suspicious that there might be a relationship between the number of unique addresses and Bitcoin's market cap. This is based on the assumption that Metcalfe's Law might apply. To test this we would need to map the user count (or even a proxy of this figure) the total value of the network. The number of unique addresses is not a perfect stand-in for the number of users, but it is true that in general the more users we have, the more unique addresses in use and vice versa.\nThe data set I downloaded the number of unique addresses from Blockchain.info as well as the total market cap for all time. Then I took the average values from each for every month going back to August 2010, when the market cap was first established.\nThis resulted in 94 data points going back eight years. Then, knowing that these values are each increasing exponentially, I decided to take the log of each and run linear regression to check for a correlation.\nData Source: Blockchain.info\nWhat I found would seem to confirm my suspicions. There is a correlation between the number of unique addresses and the Bitcoin market cap, and it's a very strong one. I believe this is because the number of unique addresses is one (but not the only or necessarily the best) proxy for the number of people actually using Bitcoin on a given day.\nRecall that the Bitcoin network issues new Bitcoin every ten minutes. Right now the amount it issues is 12.5 Bitcoin , which comes to about 1,800 new Bitcoin entering the system each day.\nAs more users pile in, the scarcity factor drives the price up. If something spooks the speculators, then a price correction could also sideline activity, which would mean the number of people in the ecosystem would drop, and the price would correspondingly be pushed down, basic supply and demand.\nPredictive values based off our regression analysis Using the regression equation, we can feed in the number of unique addresses and chart the predicted Bitcoin market cap against reality.\nData Source: Blockchain.info\nI also took Bitcoin's market cap and divided it by the regression predicted value. Then I standardized this ratio and created this chart below.\nData Source: Blockchain.info\nYou can see that based on this metric, there have been three great peaks, when the market cap of Bitcoin was massively higher than the model would have predicted. Also there have been two long periods of time in which the values were below average and stayed that way for some time.\nAnother observation is that the spikes are getting more dramatic over time but the dips do not seem to be increasing in magnitude. Using this metric, the last peak in Bitcoin's market cap dwarfed all other previous bubbles.\nKeep in mind, this is just one metric, just one way of looking at it.\nSo, what does the number of unique addresses suggest that the Bitcoin market cap should be right now?\nWe've already discussed the ways in which the unique addresses could be temporarily shifted up or down and we've talked about what some of the long term trends are. But it may surprise you that using this measurement of the Bitcoin network as a yardstick, the predicted market cap of Bitcoin on June 1st of 2018 is $21,993,572,103.22, compared with the actual Bitcoin market cap of $131,769,788,441, six and a half times higher than expected .\nThese figures might seem incorrect from looking at the chart, but remember that the axis on the left is in log scale which can be visually deceptive if you're used to looking at linear scale charts. Below is the same chart but with tick marks added to the Y-axis to illustrate this point.\nData Source: Blockchain.info\nThe way I look at this metric is just as one piece of the puzzle. I don't know if the value that it expects is appropriate, so I combine this with other formulas, other frameworks and look at them as a group before making a judgement call.\nThere might be ten, twenty, or even hundreds of analysts setting price targets for a large company. In the same way that it has become popular to look at average analyst rating, I consider this input as not the whole story, but just as one possibility of the boundaries . Some of the metrics we are going to discuss are as predictive as this one and yet they produce wildly different estimations of the price or market cap.\nNotice also that there were two long periods of time when the Bitcoin market cap was significantly lower than expected (the green arrows). Those times were around June of 2012 and January of 2016. See Below.\nData Source: Blockchain.info\nThese indicators would seem to suggest the area surrounding the green arrows are where the most upward pressure was being placed on the Bitcoin market cap. Conversely, the red arrows put downward pressure on the market cap (kind of like two object wrapped by a rubber band that move apart and then snap back in the opposite direction towards each other). Remember a large gap between the predicted and actual values could indicate that:\nThe market cap of Bitcoin is much higher than we would expect for the number of current unique addresses. The market cap of Bitcoin is much lower than we would expect for the number of current unique addresses. Even though the model rarely predicts the exact value of the Bitcoin market cap, when there is a large disparity, it always seems to predict an eminent change of direction.\nThe two largest deviations from this formula to the high side come from January 2014, and February 2018. In the period following January 2014, Bitcoin's market cap fell from 10 billion to 3.3 billion over the next 15 months. The period following February 2018 is where we currently are now, so we don't know exactly how far down the market cap will go yet. It's worth noting that the high point in the Bitcoin market cap came in December, not February, whereas the signal from January 2014 did seem to coincide with the change of market direction more closely.\nThe two largest deviations from the regression formula to the low side were in June of 2012 and January of 2016. In the period following June of 2012, the Bitcoin market cap would surge from 48 million to 10 billion in 2013. In the period following January 2016, the Bitcoin market cap would go from a measly 6 billion up to 297 billion in December of 2017.\nThis is not investment advice Have I mentioned that this is not investment advice? Use this information with great care.\nWhat are your thoughts? Let me know in the comment box below.\nA final comment on the abuse of regression analysis Some of you with a PhD in statistics might be about to point out that linear regression is not to be used on data that is not normal, and the Bitcoin market cap is hardly normal. Therefore I should be burned at the stake.\nThis is a valid concern. My use of regression in this unconventional way was to demonstrate that a relationship of some kind exists between unique addresses on the Bitcoin network and the Bitcoin market cap. Using this model might actually help someone in the real world, so you'll have to forgive me of this sin (and in actuality this practice is very common because every time you draw a trend line in excel on time series data you are doing the same thing).\nDisclosure: I am/we are long BTC-USD.\n it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

After the mania at the end of last year when the price spiked to almost $20,000, the cryptocurrency took a tumble but more noticeably attention has drained away.\nYou need no greater sign of that than figures showing bitcoin Google searches are down 90 per cent.\nThat adds weight to the argument that much of the late 2017 big leg-up was driven by mainstream punters jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon.\nSo with bitcoin largely out of the headlines, is that it for the cryptocurrency or is it time to buy for the long-term when things are quiet.\nOn this week’s podcast we take a look at who’s buying, who’s holding and who might be waiting for the price to rise again and greater fool theory to deliver someone who will take their bitcoin off their hands.\nSimon Lambert, Lee Boyce and Georgie Frost also take a look at gold – and why people aren’t buying this traditional form of investment portfolio insurance – and the most consistent investment trusts of the past decade.\nAnd finally, the Government’s policy currently appears to be to confuse motorists as much as possible, with new MOT rules recently joining the car tax muddle. Are drivers now being held to ransom by mechanics over ‘dangerous’ faults – surely no garage would do that?\nEnjoy. Next What on earth has been going on in Italy and what does it mean for your money?

Click here to learn how to make money online\nOn the final day in his insurance job last week after 14 years in the sector, Donnie wore a T-shirt emblazoned with a rocket logo, the symbol for bitcoin, and the slogan “to the moon”.\nThe phrase, one that characterises the fervour espoused by bitcoin enthusiasts who say its price knows no bounds, was fitting.\nOver five years, the 39-year-old has made enough money from trading digital currencies to pay off his mortgage, buy a Mercedes, and now swap office life for managing his remaining crypto investments full-time.\n“It was very euphoric . . . It’s been life-changing for me at this point,” says the California-based father of two, who has a cult-like Twitter following under the pen name bitcoin Dad.\nDonnie is just one member of a clubby community of early investors in bitcoin who have been able to reap the benefits of its dramatic bull run, cashing out some holdings as its value more than doubled in the space of a month to peak at around $20,000 in mid-December.\nHe will not reveal his exact returns because his new-found wealth has already left him the victim of hacking and extortion — part and parcel of the freewheeling digital currency marketplace.\nSix months after its peak, bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, though its price has sunk to about $7,500 at the time of publication. It follows that for each of the bitcoin millionaires, there have been numerous casualties; the “get rich quick” punters who entered the market a little too late.\n“These are people that see something moving up and start buying — they jump on the bandwagon,” says Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University and an investment strategy adviser for Man Group.\n“Initially in the crypto space, you had people who really understood the technology. Then there was a typical bandwagon investor situation and you know how it ends — and it did.”\nBut how many have gained — and lost — from the bitcoin bubble? Exclusive data from blockchain research company Chainalysis seen by the FT provides some tantalising answers.\nThe Chainalysis data quantifies this distinct shift in the make-up of bitcoin owners from longer-term investors — those who held the asset for more than a year — to short-term investors who have traded more recently, by analysing how regularly coins have changed hands.\nLast November — before December’s pricing peak — the amount of bitcoin held for investment was roughly three times that held by traders.\nHowever, by April 2018, the data show the amount held by investors — about 6m bitcoin — was much closer to the amount held by short-term speculators, with 5.1m bitcoin.\nIndeed, Chainalysis estimates that longer-term holders sold at least $30bn worth of bitcoin to new speculators over the December to April period, with half of this movement taking place in December alone.\n“This was an exceptional transfer of wealth,” says Philip Gradwell, Chainalysis’ chief economist, who dubs the past six months as bitcoin’s “liquidity event”.\nMr Gradwell argues that this sudden injection of liquidity — the amount of bitcoin available for trading rose by close to 60 per cent over that period — has been a “fundamental driver” behind the recent price decline. At the same time, bitcoin trading volumes have now fallen in tandem with the prices, from close to $4bn daily in December to $1bn today.\nSo will the price of bitcoin ever surpass December’s peak? Part of the answer lies in who holds bitcoin now that the hype has died down.\nBorn in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, bitcoin is rooted in a libertarian quest for a means of exchange that is unshackled from the central banking system. Proponents — among them, computer experts and political activists — heralded the arrival of an alternative monetary system that could replace fiat currency.\nBut despite the recent crypto boom, there are few signs that this is happening. According to research published this month by Morgan Stanley, only four of the top 500 US e-commerce merchants accepted cryptocurrencies in the first quarter of 2018, compared with three at the beginning of 2017.\nChainalysis notes that the “vast majority” of transactions it analysed showed bitcoin being received from exchanges and rarely sent to merchant services to pay for goods or services.\nOnly a finite number of coin — 21m — can be created. Of this, about 4m are yet to be mined. Just as physical coins can be lost down the back of a sofa, so can bitcoins if users lose or forget the passwords needed to access their online wallets. The Chainalysis data separates out coins it deems to be lost or unused for years — which total 3.7m bitcoin, worth about $28bn.\nThe proportion of bitcoin it estimates to be held by groups such as exchanges or merchant services held steady between December and April at about 2.2m bitcoin.\nCritics argue that bitcoin’s volatility and a lack of fundamental underpinnings disqualifies it as a reliable store of value, and that this is unlikely to change. This leaves droves of new opportunists dabbling in what has been dubbed a “Wild West” marketplace, with regulators still weighing up how best to tackle the space.\n“Speculation remains the primary use case for these digital assets; merchant or institutional adoption does not appear to be a primary driver of price,” says Preston Byrne, an English structured finance lawyer and cryptocurrency observer.\nGiven this breakdown in bitcoin owners, most market watchers do not rule out another rapid price run-up. However, they say this would likely be the random movement of pure speculation or market manipulation rather than anything else.\n“It’s very important to stress, this is not in any sense a rational market,” says David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain.\n“It’s very thinly traded, very badly structured . . . and it’s stupendously manipulated,” he adds. “Anyone who goes in not realising just how manipulated the crypto markets are will get skinned.”\nSome argue there is an art to trading bitcoin regardless — but it is a stressful business that takes nerves and can be addictive. Donnie, a.k.a bitcoin Dad, puts his successes down to careful research, “patience” and avoiding the trap of obsessive, leveraged day trading.\nBut others are unconvinced that bitcoin millionaires actually show investment nous, drawing parallels with gambling.\n“It’s the luck of the draw, where everyone who won the draw seems to feel like they deserved it for being smarter,” Vitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian programmer who invented the smart-contract blockchain Ethereum, told the Financial Times recently.\nThe Chainalysis data also show that the bitcoin marketplace is skewed in terms of wealth distribution. A small cluster of investors — known colloquially as “whales” — capture a hefty proportion of the market, which stands at odds with bitcoin’s mission to democratise finance. This brings its own risks.\nOverall, some 1,600 bitcoin wallets — managed by both speculators and investors — contained at least 1,000 bitcoin each in April, according to Chainalysis, collectively holding nearly 5m bitcoin, or close to a third of the available total.\nOf those, just under 100 wallets owned by longer-term investors contained between 10,000 and 100,000 bitcoin — so between $75m and $750m at today’s prices.\n“This concentration of wealth means that bitcoin is at risk of volatility, as the moves of a small number of people will have a large effect,” says Chainalysis’ Mr Gradwell.\nHowever, the situation suggests bitcoin’s volatility is “of low risk to the wider financial system”, he adds, as “only a small number of people will face large changes in crypto wealth”.\nStill, there are opportunities particularly for the larger players to engage in market manipulation, due to the dearth of regulation and existence of informal over-the-counter markets — and this leaves smaller players at a disadvantage.\n“When you build up a big enough position in any asset you can move the price,” says Dr Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain and co-founder of Mosaic.io, a platform for market intelligence on crypto. “A number of these larger holders do communicate with each other, they know [each other], they take stock of market activity.”\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley echoed this concern in a note this month, saying that it was “noteworthy” that the more sophisticated investors were “willing to give up traditional investor rights for potentially faster liquidity”.\nNevertheless, some point out that the excitement and influx of fresh funds into the market has allowed its infrastructure to mature — albeit gradually — which could be a boon for those looking to trade bitcoin more safely in future. Trading places\nBuying and selling bitcoin had traditionally been challenging for all but the most tech-savvy. As last year’s cryptocurrency frenzy heated up however, some consumer finance businesses rushed to capitalise on the zeitgeist and offer their customers access to digital coins through apps they were already familiar with using.\nMany exchanges have strengthened their due diligence processes in response to customer concerns and invested in bigger customer services teams. Transaction fees have come down as technology has improved — but hacks are still commonplace.\nInstitutions have also been making inroads. These include prominent US futures exchanges, such as the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets, which now offer bitcoin futures. Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s chief executive, Adena Friedman, said this year that the group would consider offering cryptocurrency exchange services in future.\nAlternative funds are also muscling in. Morgan Stanley data show there is now more than $3.5bn in estimated assets under management across 250 dedicated crypto-funds, although the pace of the creation of new funds has slowed recently.\nA more formalised over-the-counter market has started to develop, with players such as Cumberland, an arm of Chicago-based DRW, and Goldman Sachs-backed Circle growing rapidly.\nMuch of the future of bitcoin trading will depend on the approach that regulators take, experts say. There are stirrings across the world, though to date, little coherence. Asian financial centres such as Tokyo are now regulating crypto exchanges, while China has banned them outright. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission last month announced a criminal probe into potential bitcoin price manipulation.\nBanks in particular have been reticent to engage with cryptocurrencies and the companies that handle them, partly due to the difficulty of conducting anti-money laundering checks on transactions.\n“Bank compliance officers really, really hate cryptos . . . be prepared to demonstrate the provenance of every penny from every crypto,” says Mr Gerard.\nMr Hileman predicts that one day there will be a “legitimate regulated retail investment market” in bitcoin, although not anytime soon. “We’re talking years,” he predicts.\nAny more widespread adoption of bitcoin would need regulators, central banks and tax regulators to allow the transfer of wealth movement from the current financial system into the new one, says Gavin Brown, senior lecturer in financial economics at Manchester Metropolitan University and director of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital.\nNevertheless, there are those who still hold unwavering faith in bitcoin.\nSunnie, who has been investing in bitcoin since she started working for a crypto exchange back in 2014, did not cash out in December, burnt by a previous experience in 2016 when she sold thinking the price was high.\nWith 50 per cent of her assets currently in 10 bitcoin — bought initially at $3,000 a piece — she believes in its potential as the first project that uses burgeoning blockchain technology.\n“If bitcoin can survive under such a high rollercoaster period, I have faith in it,” she adds. “When I reach six figures I’m probably going to cash out what I have and completely retire. The price will go to the moon again — maybe higher.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "don", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donnie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T20:01:15.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efcafc9684c138b74ecb5f41256a17690d6754d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft168v80lAAaBD7c8C8Dk2fp1zuQPg5bxvr22C0G0QAnOLBlaOaTJup07O9k0.LwtP7vOiJ2oPx2b1KNx01ci.Q1RmKmCK8683Xcsjablbl.jpwqokl1Lf1hw--", "site_full": "cointelegraph.com", "site": "cointelegraph.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoinschannel.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoins Channel", "title": "Data Shows Switch From ‘Hodlers’ to Speculators in Bitcoin in Last 6 Months", "title_full": "Data Shows Switch From ‘Hodlers’ to Speculators in Bitcoin in Last 6 Months", "published": "2018-06-08T19:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoinschannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9jMTUzZGZiYmI4OGFiZjNjZDhkODA4Yjk5YzRiYzU2Ni5qcGc=-300x200.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45237, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efcafc9684c138b74ecb5f41256a17690d6754d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft168v80lAAaBD7c8C8Dk2fp1zuQPg5bxvr22C0G0QAnOLBlaOaTJup07O9k0.LwtP7vOiJ2oPx2b1KNx01ci.Q1RmKmCK8683Xcsjablbl.jpwqokl1Lf1hw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "writer", "published": "2018-06-08T19:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Data Shows Switch From ‘Hodlers’ to Speculators in Bitcoin in Last 6 Months", "text": "Data Shows Switch From ‘Hodlers’ to Speculators in Bitcoin in Last 6 Months Date: in: Bitcoin 4 Views Data from Chainalysis shows that the amount of Bitcoin owned by long-term investors is now almost equalled by short-term speculators, according to Financial Times report June 8.\nChainalysis is a blockchain research company that analyzes “connections between entities on the Bitcoin blockchain.” Sponsored Links\nSince December 2017, the amount of Bitcoin held by day traders has risen to 5.1 mln BTC, almost equaling the amount held by long-term investors — those who have held the coins for more than a year — which equals about 6 mln BTC, in what has been called Bitcoin’s “liquidity event.”\nThe Chainalysis data, which was shared with the Financial Times, also shows that “[Bitcoin] trading volumes have now fallen in tandem with the prices, from close to [$4 bln] daily in December to [$1 bln] today.” Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, believes this sudden rise in liquidity has been a “fundamental driver” behind Bitcoin’s recent decline in price.\nIn addition to this finding, the data from Chainalysis also shows an imbalance in the wealth distribution of Bitcoin, with a small number of investors — colloquially termed “whales” — holding a disproportionate amount of the cryptocurrency.\nOf the roughly 17 mln Bitcoin available, the data shows that, as of April 2018, around 1,600 Bitcoin wallets hold 1,000 Bitcoins each, equalling almost 5 mln BTC and accounting for almost a third of all Bitcoin in circulation.\nThe data from Chainalysis raises questions concerning manipulation of crypto markets by a small number of investors.

The Pew study shows that 35% of the US labor force are millennials.\nThe Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan American think tank based in Washington DC that provides information on social issues, public opinion, and demographic trends shaping the United States and the world.\nThe report shows that as Baby Boomers numbers recede so will their influence and their opinions about lifestyle, principally money, and how it’s earnt.\nDisruptive technologies will continue to show that many of the conventions that have been held up as untouchable – designed to persist for all eternity – are social constructs that can be diminished, rewritten and completely extinguished , writes the Daily Hodl, citing US theorist, author, and more significantly, “futurist” R Buckminster Fuller, as a portent for the future of youth employment:\n“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist.”\nIt is clear that millennials are completely at the forefront of the crypto space, and without them it is hard to imagine that Bitcoin would have even got off the ground. “Over 82% of millennials say their investment decisions were influenced by the Great Recession when $14 trillion in wealth was lost,” writes Kari Paul of Market Watch, adding, “Millennials regard the stock market with skepticism. People between the ages of 18 and 39 are less likely to invest money in the stock market than are other generations, studies show.”\nFuller’s recommendations ring truer than ever in 2018, the inventor of the Geodesic Dome may have been right when he talked about “this nonsense of a living” as conventions are being broken daily by society’s younger, adventurous, and certainly more mobile members.\nAccording to a survey by WeLance, the millennial digital nomads are mostly male (64%) and work in a range of professions from programmers (22%) to online marketers and designers (17%). About 9% visit ten different countries in a 12-month period, with 32% visiting five to ten countries and 29% visiting three to five countries.\nMillennials are exploring their options in the face of commutes and 9-to-5 jobs, the drudgery which Fuller warned of. Despite recent records showing 85% of them say they’re happy with their lives, it remains to be seen if this group will heed his other proposition that “One in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest”.\nThe breakthrough may have arrived.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Millennials, Bitcoin and a Tech Breakthrough to Support the Rest: An End to Drudgery? appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

Data from Chainalysis shows that the amount of Bitcoin owned by long-term investors is now almost equalled by short-term speculators, according to Financial Times report June 8.\nChainalysis is a blockchain research company that analyzes “connections between entities on the Bitcoin blockchain.”\nSince December 2017, the amount of Bitcoin held by day traders has risen to 5.1 mln BTC, almost equaling the amount held by long-term investors — those who have held the coins for more than a year — which equals about 6 mln BTC, in what has been called Bitcoin’s “liquidity event.”\nThe Chainalysis data, which was shared with the Financial Times, also shows that “[Bitcoin] trading volumes have now fallen in tandem with the prices, from close to [$4 bln] daily in December to [$1 bln] today.” Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, believes this sudden rise in liquidity has been a “fundamental driver” behind Bitcoin’s recent decline in price.\nIn addition to this finding, the data from Chainalysis also shows an imbalance in the wealth distribution of Bitcoin, with a small number of investors — colloquially termed “ whales ”— holding a disproportionate amount of the cryptocurrency.\nOf the roughly 17 mln Bitcoin available, the data shows that, as of April 2018, around 1,600 Bitcoin wallets hold 1,000 Bitcoins each, equalling almost 5 mln BTC and accounting for almost a third of all Bitcoin in circulation.\nThe data from Chainalysis raises questions concerning manipulation of crypto markets by a small number of investors. While institutions have begun carving out a share of the market, many believe that the future of Bitcoin will depend on which approach regulators take. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/financial-institutions-in-a-race-who-will-bring-crypto-trading-to-the-fiat-masses-first", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/whales-and-killer-whales-bitcoins-big-money-movers", "https://www.ft.com/content/29259448-69b3-11e8-b6eb-4acfcfb08c11", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/irs-uses-chainalysis-to-track-down-bitcoin-tax-cheats", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/single-trader-with-enormous-bankroll-is-manipulating-bitcoin-price-but-to-what-end"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "financial times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chainalysis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T22:06:38.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eafa9351b3ca287526284ae67f9b2a5f01dced2a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfOlpQdfLty5HmhO9GtYJlDM8DWOlfFQFSY1CSC10abik-", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin coffee machine.", "title_full": "Bitcoin coffee machine.", "published": "2018-06-08T18:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eafa9351b3ca287526284ae67f9b2a5f01dced2a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfOlpQdfLty5HmhO9GtYJlDM8DWOlfFQFSY1CSC10abik-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T18:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin coffee machine.", "text": "Bitcoin coffee machine.\n/u/ayanamirs\nsubmitted by /u/ayanamirs\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:50:43.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1231c78fc01dbca2ae1dec4cab740fb180a3fb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.slU54msvIVc8y0leXU7i6_03_alKVPpB4FZ9Q41uDnGf", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin coffee machine.", "title_full": "Bitcoin coffee machine.", "published": "2018-06-08T18:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1231c78fc01dbca2ae1dec4cab740fb180a3fb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.slU54msvIVc8y0leXU7i6_03_alKVPpB4FZ9Q41uDnGf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T18:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin coffee machine.", "text": "Bitcoin coffee machine.\n/u/ayanamirs\nsubmitted by /u/ayanamirs\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:47:08.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eed0d433e71a2b23a45d8ee3c2ca494dd293babd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREhwEc5SXnQVdkZHjE5xjnLWZQtfJ_qDpKQYj.wa_pTh7baHat0sRJkWxTcPW6q0MK1Ro_Rr_YQ5jsXfXHynw0kiBP6c8PO6O9.ibrA_n17A--", "site_full": "ajedgington.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://ajedgington.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Is Bitcoin about to break out of a wedge?

This chart pattern usually indicates that a sharp move is likely as the point of the wedge gets nearer, though, at the moment, I am not confident which way it is going to move. Although I said in my last post that I thought the rout might be over, and the price did bounce about 50% from that point, it has come most of the way back down now and the current uptrend is looking very feeble, so I am inclined to think that the move may be downward. The institutional money may still be trying to destroy bitcoin (and other crypto-currencies) because it is a threat to the traditional banking system, due to it removing the need for central banks and intermediaries in financial transactions, and so I wouldn’t be surprised now to see a new low of around $3,000 come into play from here. This is the support level from the bottom of the 40% drop last September. Ultimately, I believe that the establishment will fail to kill off bitcoin, but I expect the battle to continue for a while yet. I have even seem some commentators saying that it could become the global currency of the internet, which would really threaten the banks, but there are technical issues over low transaction rates to be solved before that could happen.\nTurning to the FTSE, we have seen a strong bounce as I predicted in my last post, though we didn’t get the last dip I forecast. There is much hoohah about Italy at the moment, with a euro-sceptic government now in power, but I suspect that they will make no significant moves for a while yet. Italy has very high debt levels and low economic growth which means that its population is restive and want their government to “do something”. This malaise is blamed on the EU, so the “something” is likely to be breaching EU spending limits, or pulling out of the euro altogether, and either of these would be a serious concern for the markets across Europe, including the UK. There is even potential for a debt default if Italy exits the euro, which would cause chaos in the banking system due to the large amount of that debt widely held by many institutions.

ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images)\nInvestment manager VanEck is trying its hand at launching a bitcoin-linked investment product for the third time. But one market structure expert says its 25-page risk-disclosure section is \"laughable.\" The risk disclosures for VanEck's product are about double the normal length of typical ETFs, market structure experts told Business Insider. The filing notes manipulation as a risk factor: \"The price of bitcoin may be influenced by fraud and manipulation for a number of reasons.\" If at first you don't succeed, try, try, and try again. That appears to be VanEck's strategy when it comes to bitcoin-linked investments.\nThe asset manager has, for the third time, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a bitcoin exchange-traded fund , the company announced earlier this week. It is partnering with blockchain firm SolidX on the fund.\nBut one market structure expert is calling the fund's filing \"laughable.\"\nJoe Saluzzi, the cofounder of Themis Trading, said he's skeptical of bitcoin ETFs generally, but thought the one filed by VanEck was especially striking considering its risk disclosure section is 19 pages.\nAdvertisement \"Listen, I got a problem in general with the ETFs in bitcoin,\" Saluzzi said in a phone interview. \"They have market structure problems they haven't begun to address, but this one is a stand out.\"\n\"It is laughable,\" he said.\nMarket observers told Business Insider that the number of pages of risk disclosures for VanEck's newest product are about double the length of typical ETFs. To be sure, many riskier investment products, such as those tied to oil and the volatility index VIX, have long disclosures, said Eric Evin, the CEO of fund manager Reality Shares.\nStill, none are as long. VXX, one of the original exchange traded notes tied to VIX, has about 9 pages of disclosures. VanEck's filing for an actively managed ETF linked to bitcoin derivatives has about 13 pages of risk disclosures.\nA bitcoin ETF has been viewed as a natural next step in bitcoin's maturation as an asset and could precipitate the entrance of more retail investors into the crypto market. But the concept has received pushback from regulators who want to closely monitor the potential risks they could present to investors.

From the filing:\n\"The price of bitcoin may be influenced by fraud and manipulation for a number of reasons, including the following: most bitcoin spot markets are not regulated or supervised by a government agency; platforms may lack critical system safeguards, including customer protections; volatile market price swings or flash crashes; cyber risks, such as hacking customer wallets; and/or platforms selling from their own accounts and putting customers at an unfair disadvantage.\"\nA spokesperson for VanEck did not respond to requests for comment on the filing.\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1668039/000110465918038369/a18-2298_1s1a.htm#THERISKSYOUFACE_081534"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vaneck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe saluzzi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:32:54.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9354d35d02893b226d33e297671402db2b8d3d01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQGUEC6WYSWvCdgUZE1QpXHVEUBNcIBYXj1oYktaMJ9I3HKlc1dKN0kNHAdb3SUXnRQxXBDA2FTnzxwEYAQocJc5i36OKHMGgZYe1M5AqaLUCK5Bc9qNOnBLhV_fhx1uxgePCH.Ha93eA--", "site_full": "www.moroccoworldnews.com", "site": "moroccoworldnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.moroccoworldnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Morocco World News", "title": "Where To Buy Bitcoin Cash?

The Top 3 Cryptocurrency Exchanges", "text": "Home Economy Where To Buy Bitcoin Cash? The Top 3 Cryptocurrency Exchanges Where To Buy Bitcoin Cash? The Top 3 Cryptocurrency Exchanges By June 8, 2018 By Mary Ann Callahan New York – Since its inception in August 2017 in the wake of the fork, Bitcoin Cash has gained momentum in popularity. With a market cap of nearly USD 17.3 billion, the cryptocurrency is rising steadily. The BCH price reached an all-time high of around USD 4,000 in December 2017 but has come down to USD 1,000 as of May 30. There are many triggers for such meteoric rises and falls of BCH. Market predictions indicate Bitcoin Cash has decent investment potential. Why, where and h ow can investors buy BCH safely? Bitcoin Cash Formed as a spin off from the original Bitcoin (BTC) in 2017, Bitcoin Cash eliminated the drawbacks in BTC, like its scalability, which resulted in slower and more expensive transactions. Because of the decentralized format of the BTC network, the cryptocurrency faced several barriers to increasing its block size. This resulted in a historical fork in the road, leading to the launch of BCH. BCH sped up transactions by increasing the size of the blocks to 8 MB initially and 32 MB in 2018. Key differences between BCH and BTC The key difference between BTC and BCH is the size of individual blocks. While BTC has a block size limit of 1 MB, it first increased to 8 MB and was further extended to 32MB. The larger block leads to easier mining capability for BCH. BCH t ransactions are faster, cheaper, and smoother than those of BTC. Thus Bitcoin Cash is a more efficient cryptocurrency for customers who want to move, sell, or buy funds. In short, it is functional while Bitcoin is more collectible. Another important difference between the two is that the mining difficulty varies based on the number of miners mining the cryptocurrency. A large number of miners mining Bitcoin Cash will be paid a lower amount as opposed to fewer miners doing the same work who will be paid higher. This mechanism keeps inflationary forces in check and lowers transaction fees while the processing times are faster. Thus BCH has potential for scalability and adaptability, fueling interest in Bitcoin Cash and increasing its prices. Because the Bitcoin Cash community aims to make it reliable, scalable, and with minimal transaction fees through protocol upgrades, its future prospects as an investment seem bright. How to buy BCH Now that you have seen the inherent value of BCH and may wish to purchase it , below are some of the ways you can do so: Other cryptocurrencies If you own other cryptocurrencies or even Bitcoin, there are many services which allow you to trade BCH instantly with cryptocurrencies. Purchasing the cryptocurrencies supported by these services in fiat currency, such as USD, is also possible. Credit and debit cards With BCH, several exchanges permit payments via credit cards, PayPal, or debit cards. These options are possible only with a few platforms, but the entire process takes minutes. Cash You can buy Bitcoin Cash with cash via peer-to-peer marketplaces. You place an order and can even make use of escrow services. Ensure that you deal with a reputable platform and steer clear of fraudulent or scam sites. You should check certain factors before you choose this option: Make sure the rate of exchange is similar to market value Ensure the address of the wallet is correct Never disclose the private key address you own Wire transfers or bank deposits Some exchanges allow wire transfers for depositing money to purchase Bitcoin Cash. This system is slower than the rest and might sometimes take up to several days. Top 3 Cryptocurrency Exchanges for purchasing BCH While deciding on cryptocurrency exchanges, make sure you use reliable sites. Below are the top 3 exchanges you should consider: CEX.IO This reputable exchange has several years of experience in cryptocurrency and was among the first to introduce BCH. CEX.IO accepts multiple payment methods for purchasing Bitcoin Cash: cryptocurrencies, wire transfers ( SEPA / SWIFT allowed ), credit cards , or debit cards . The exchange supports GBP , USD , and EUR . Pros Accepts multiple modes of payment Transparent fees No security breaches reported yet Cons Payments via credit cards and wire transfers restricted for some countries Coinbase Coinbase has over 13 million customers , so it can rightly be called one of the largest exchanges . Coinbase was not the pioneer exchange listing Bitcoin Cash after the fork, but it was added to the platform in December 2017. Users can benefit from the following payment methods: bank account, credit card, or debit card. Pros Quick transfer process via bank Multiple payment modes accepted", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cex.io/bch-usd", "https://cex.io/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-proponents-prepare-for-the-largest-block-size-increase-ever/", "https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-for-beginners/how-to-buy-bitcoin-cash#how-to-claim-bitcoin-cash", "https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/907536/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-market-leader-cash-ripple-ethereum", "https://futurism.com/coinbase-users-surpasses-charles-schwab-brokerage-accounts/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mary ann callahan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T19:01:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1fdea83ce51aab42b09cfff4f1bb390530e11d1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdhsVxLUze9DXv0wkNuNuLM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=85.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Service Discussion", "title": "Overview of all airline & flight ticket sites that accept bitcoin", "title_full": "Overview of all airline & flight ticket sites that accept bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-08T18:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1fdea83ce51aab42b09cfff4f1bb390530e11d1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdhsVxLUze9DXv0wkNuNuLM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NLNico", "published": "2018-06-08T18:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Overview of all airline & flight ticket sites that accept bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: NLNico on April 21, 2018, 09:40:00 AM Quote: from: DigitalFox on April 21, 2018, 07:25:47 AM NLNico, are you adding flights only or other travel related info as well?

So we have step one in place.”\nSluymer did note that there are “plenty of technical bears out there” that are predicting price bottoms as low as $5,000 or $3,000, but Sluymer believes that Bitcoin will rally if it just gets through the $7,800 level.\nIn spite of the failed rally, Tom Lee stated in May that he still maintains his prediction of Bitcoin hitting $25,000 by the end of the year.\nBitcoin is currently trading at around $7,592 , down almost 1.5 percent over a 24 hour period to press time. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tom-lee", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/fundstrats-lee-admits-poor-prediction-of-bitcoin-rally-still-expects-25k-price-by-year-end", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/06/07/bitcoin-is-bottoming-and-it-could-be-poised-for-a-breakout-ahead-according-to-a-top-technician.html?play=1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T18:34:41.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0027141b656df55ddb7414bee9118dffa47c6610", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcDXTc7RaCvr1qjbSuqV3P5tH57MFrk138HdeYMScUNrHxV8tbxQWxJxb28wg8yMrpi3m.gYpqxmGOBoiwxtzEg2X9Rp_Si7jzS1nsn3cPHg--", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "http://seekingalpha.com/atom.xml", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "All Articles on Seeking Alpha", "title": "Bitcoin Has Become Legacy Tech And Is Getting Replaced - Bitcoin USD (Cryptocurrency:BTC-USD)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Has Become Legacy Tech And Is Getting Replaced - Bitcoin USD (Cryptocurrency:BTC-USD) | Seeking Alpha", "published": "2018-06-08T18:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/6/8/32679815-1528434793846495.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1432, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0027141b656df55ddb7414bee9118dffa47c6610", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcDXTc7RaCvr1qjbSuqV3P5tH57MFrk138HdeYMScUNrHxV8tbxQWxJxb28wg8yMrpi3m.gYpqxmGOBoiwxtzEg2X9Rp_Si7jzS1nsn3cPHg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Erich Reimer", "published": "2018-06-08T18:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Has Become Legacy Tech And Is Getting Replaced - Bitcoin USD (Cryptocurrency:BTC-USD)", "text": "I'm very optimistic on the cryptocurrency industry, but not so optimistic on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Even in the short term, Bitcoin's market share since the crypto boom of last year has struggled to remain on the higher end rather than lower. It seems gravity has been holding Bitcoin back, a forecast of what I believe will be its longer-term trend.\nBitcoin still remains the world's largest cryptocurrency, with currently 38.1% market share and $130.395 billion in market capitalization. In comparison, the total world market capitalization for the now 1,650+ cryptocurrencies out there stands at $342.214 billion.\nIn the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin truly is legacy technology. Released over 9 years ago in January 2009, it remains technologically limited in potential by its design amid the technology available at its creation.\nAs other cryptocurrencies advance and develop without those fundamental inhibitors, they will likely in the end see higher growth rates than Bitcoin and Bitcoin itself will begin to fade.\n(Source: CoinMarketCap )\nBitcoin's Slew Of Design Problems Seem Unsolvable And Are Only Becoming Worse Bitcoin was created with a limited supply and increasing difficulty to mine as it reached that point. Years ago, this exponential stage seemed far off. Yet now it is approaching, as Bitcoin has hit 17.081 million Bitcoin mined of a total of 21 million.\nOn a fiat money analysis, this greatly limits the currency's usage as a general use currency in the same way Gold ( GLD ) is limited. Due to Gold's limitations in supply and therefore the multiplication of Gold-backed money and the money multiplier , that was a key reason behind the abandoning of it as a standard by the nations of the world.\nOn a technological supply basis, this has already resulted in a steady collapse of Bitcoin mining operations across the world as the cost to mine a Bitcoin has surpassed Bitcoin's general price level.\nIt is estimated that the last Bitcoin won't be mined until around 2140 due to the exponentially increasing difficulty. Yet it is almost certain Bitcoin will become grossly unprofitable for any business long before then, as the hardware and costs simply can't keep up with the energy demand written into the network software.\nOn a technological demand and user basis, at current levels of maturity for the Blockchain Bitcoin is now experiencing increasingly severe congestion, resulting in seemingly permanently heightened transactions and slower processing times.\nDue to the Blockchain network inherently being designed to only handle so many transactions, despite long being known as inevitable, it never made an impact until recent months.\nNew Cryptos Are Rising In Bitcoin's Place In comparison, other newer both general use and sector-specific cryptos are bypassing these problems entirely that seem to remain unsolvable with Bitcoin.\nIf Bitcoin makes only 7 transactions per second , Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) makes 20 transactions per second, Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) makes 56, and Ripple ( XRP-USD ) makes 1,500, then what point is there to stick with Bitcoin besides the scale benefits from it being the legacy product?\nAs we see with all legacy products and companies, eventually, the more innovative product takes over. It may not happen immediately, but it's a law of economic nature, akin to gravity, that eventually takes hold.\nSince the great \"crypto-bust\" of the turn of the year that is undoubtedly a major reason why Bitcoin has seen greater stagnation than the crypto-currency industry as a whole. Compare the charts below from CoinMarketCap.\nBitcoin is actually at about the same level, or even less, than its price at the beginning of December 2017's big crypto bubble. It was $10,354 a coin or so on December 1, 2017 and is $7,635 now.\nIn contrast, the market cap of non-Bitcoin cryptos has kept its rise even amid recent volatility. On December 1, 2017 they were worth about $135 billion and now are worth still $211 billion.\nConclusion In the future, I think we will continue to see what we are seeing now with the divergence between Bitcoin and other both general use and sector/use-specific cryptocurrencies. There is immense innovation happening in the cryptocurrency sector, but Bitcoin's design limitations simply prevent it from possibly having a long-term future.\nBitcoin jumpstarted cryptocurrency, but because of the sheer impossibility of fixing its code at this late stage in its life cycle and its current scale, it likely is doomed to continued and increasing stagnation.\nIn contrast, there are many other cryptocurrencies out there that are being developed with exciting potential, both in terms of actual usability for currency or technology and as investments too.\nI recently discussed with the members of Tech Investment Insights some fascinating cryptocurrencies I think are poised to potentially grow, as well as how to value cryptocurrencies themselves .\nBy subscribing to Tech Investment Insights you will get my best company and portfolio strategy recommendations, ranging from in-depth research to a comprehensive ratings system to help you build your basket of investments - see if you like it.\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Local citizens may be taking a different approach: As price increases run rampant, bitcoin transactions denominated in the nation’s currency have skyrocketed, according to Localbitcoins data .\nThe government’s currency overhaul has been postponed by two months to Aug. 4, according to Reuters , to give the banking industry more time to prepare for new bank notes and transaction systems. But president Nicolas Maduro’s response to hyperinflation, which has devastated the economy, will do little to curtail the crisis. The International Monetary Fund (pdf) expects consumer prices to soar nearly 14,000% this year, a currency collapse that has left millions scrambling to pay for basic necessities such as food\nIn advanced economies, crypto assets like bitcoin have so far had little purpose apart from speculation and gambling. In countries where the monetary system and financial structures are crumbing, bitcoin may provide an alternative store of value (paywall) relative to the local currency.\nThe Venezuelan government, meanwhile, having just about destroyed the bolivar, is trying to get in on the action by launching its own cryptocurrency .

Bitcoin was only 13th.\nGlobal Public Chain Assessment The new index is the creation of the China Center for Information Industry Development that is part of the Minister of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. The Center evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovative qualities of each blockchain project. Blockchain is the system powering different cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and is a shared database maintained by a network of computers that are linked on the Internet. Ranking of different projects Ethereum, with its currency called ether, won a score of 129.4 for number one ranking. It has become the foundation for many other coin offerings generating their own digital currencies which are sold to investors to generate income to finance projects. Bitcoin the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, founded ten years ago, garnered only a score of 88 making it number 13 in the ranking. Many projects that are not well known filled the other top five places. Steem was second with 115.9,. Lisk third with 104.8. NEO was fourth with 103.0 and Komodo fifth with 101.5. The index rates 28 blockchain projects along with their respective cryptocurrencies. It will be updated monthly. There are currently about 1,500 cryptocurrencies in all. According to CoinMarketCap their collective market capitalization is almost $380 billion. Although in the second half of last year, the Chinese government began to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings (ICOs), it also expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to contribute significantly to the economy in the future. China was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year according to data collated by Thomson Reuters' Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization. Ethereum Ethereum is an open-source public blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system. It features smart contract functionality. The currency generated by the platform is called Ether. Ether can be transferred between accounts. It is also used to compensate miners for computations performed. Ethereum provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) it can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. This article explains Turing-completeness. This article explains ethereum scripting and the Virtual Machine in more detail. Ethereum was originally proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin both a programmer and a cryptocurrency researcher. The system went live at the end of July 2015. Ethereum split into two blockchains in 2016 with the original blockchain continuing as Ethereum Classic (ETC) as contrasted with Ethereum (ETH). In 2017 the value of Ethereum soared by over 13,000 percent. Ethereum's block time is much quicker than that of bitcoin at 14 to 15 seconds compared to 10 minutes for bitcoin. Transaction fees are in general much lower for ether than bitcoin. In December 2017, the median transaction free for ether was just $0.33 while that for bitcoin was 23. The price of ethereum just before closing on May 19th was about $695. Ethereum is the largest cryptocoin by market cap after bitcoin.\nPreviously published in Digital Journal\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "information technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T19:04:27.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91c6cacf549495064b0d929eab907c8d866f5da4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUWW91fws4bRiDG2VMiYbLovu2LfzbNLUXdXLoyUqtgab3F_yiAOGtI0vDmWqmhafxluqfI87cIL_H4aXNWpNdgSR3A7oTQ.PUsZVpEnZAcICjDwZaVccTaGseS8cJ6x89w--", "site_full": "alterminds.xyz", "site": "alterminds.xyz", "site_section": "http://alterminds.xyz/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Alter Minds", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Bitpanda Offers New Coins, Microsoft Dips Data Center in the Sea", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Bitpanda Offers New Coins, Microsoft Dips Data Center in the Sea", "published": "2018-06-08T18:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/alterminds.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_712968601_1600-768x768.jpg?fit=768%2C768&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91c6cacf549495064b0d929eab907c8d866f5da4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUWW91fws4bRiDG2VMiYbLovu2LfzbNLUXdXLoyUqtgab3F_yiAOGtI0vDmWqmhafxluqfI87cIL_H4aXNWpNdgSR3A7oTQ.PUsZVpEnZAcICjDwZaVccTaGseS8cJ6x89w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alter Minds", "published": "2018-06-08T18:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Bitpanda Offers New Coins, Microsoft Dips Data Center in the Sea", "text": "Jun 8, Advertisements\nIn today’s Bitcoin in Brief we cover a recent announcement by a leading European crypto exchange – Bitpanda is adding two new coins, IOTA and Komodo. While on the Old Continent, Microsoft has immersed a whole data center off the coast of Scotland. And in Japan, a startup uses artificial intelligence, augmented reality and blockchain technology to create a “virtual human agent.” Advertisements\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto Bitpanda Lists IOTA and Komodo\nBitpanda, one of Europe’s established cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding two new coins – IOTA (MIOTA) and Komodo (KMD). The announcement comes after the successful launch of Bitpanda 2.0 and the team is promising new listings on a regular basis. Initially, both cryptocurrencies will be offered through a trade only, buy and sell option.\n“Our Integration Team has been working hard the past few months and we are now happy to announce that Komodo will be added on June 12, 2018 to the Bitpanda platform, and IOTA will follow on June 14, 2018. To speed things further up, we will offer new cryptocurrencies on a regular basis to our users,” Bitpanda said.\nThe trading platform noted that the integration of IOTA comes in response to popular demand within the Bitpanda community. The listing has been confirmed by the IOTA team, too. Bitpanda and the IOTA Foundation are working closely to set up an IOTA wallet on the exchange, which will be supporting withdrawal and send functions.\nKomodo, which is also among Bitpanda’s partners, will be one of the platforms for the Pantos meta token (PAN). The project aims to provide instant transfers between supported blockchains. The exchange plans to offer KMD wallet in the near future. Microsoft Experiments with an Underwater Data Center\nOne of Microsoft’s data centers is now operating at about 100 ft (~30 m) below the surface of the North Sea, not far from the British Orkney Islands. Project Natick is powered by renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and tidal installations which meet completely the energy needs of the archipelago situated close to the Scottish shore.\nThe data center is made up of 864 servers in a container that sits on the sea bottom about 14 miles (~22 km) from the coast. Its electricity is supplied through an undersea cable using the green energy produced on the islands. The data center is designed to fit into a standard shipping container and can be easily relocated. May be that’s an idea crypto miners should consider.\nNatick is a pilot project and Microsoft will operate the data center for a period of 12 months, Quartz reported. The company says bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. The software giant points out that nearly half the world’s population lives within 120 miles (~150 km) of the ocean.\nAnother strong argument in favor of the project is the opportunity to bring cooling costs down, as deep sea waters maintain lower temperatures which help the cooling of the hardware. “It’s our belief that this type of data center could lead to reduced costs and simpler structures that incorporate fewer materials, requiring less maintenance and electricity,” a Microsoft representative commented.\nInitially, the servers will be put through a series of tests aimed at evaluating power consumption, humidity, noise creation, and temperature levels. On the second stage, customers will be allowed to use the data center. If the project is successful, Microsoft plans to keep operating the servers and continue to provide access to users. Tokyo Company Creates Virtual Human Using AI, AR and Blockchain\nA Japanese startup called Cougar is working on a project to create a “Virtual Human Agent” (VHA). The company is using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and blockchain technology to realize the project. According to CEO Atsushi Ishii, this is the first tech combination of this kind.\nA video released by Cougar shows how the VHA can momentarily jump from one device to another, from a PC to a smartphone in this case, when asked to do so. “That’s a nice chair,” the female character also says, demonstrating her abilities to use AI-driven image recognition to assess the surroundings.\nCouger is a small business, with fewer than 15 employees, according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review . Its team of engineers is involved in game consoles development. The company, however, has pans in many other fields, including robotics and the internet of things. Its management dreams of creating “a world where devices act autonomously,” an ambition which requires the confluence of multiple technologies.\nThe Tokyo-based startup has been working on a gateway called Connectome, promising to design a “smart space” by seamlessly linking different devices and technologies. The project should pave the way for more innovations. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as part of the effort to develop Connectome.\nCouger stresses the importance of linking two technologies in particular – artificial intelligence and blockchain, the distributed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by combing through huge volumes of data, identifying patterns and assessing new information. Couger wants to store the learning records on a blockchain.

Recall, within the mining weblog how miners are the folks working computer systems constructing Bitcoin ’s blockchain . Primarily, miners could possibly be seen as individuals who use computer systems to unravel advanced issues to confirm transactions. The important thing level is that these miners are paid every time they append a block of transactions. These miners are rewarded in new bitcoin created by a coinbase transaction that’s included in every block. For the primary 4 years of Bitcoin’s life, a coinbase transaction would difficulty 50 bitcoin to the fortunate miner. The problem of this proof-of-work course of was re-calibrated routinely each two weeks with the aim of preserving the identical period of time between blocks at a mean of 10 minutes… So what does that imply precisely: In different phrases, 50 new bitcoin had been launched each 10 minutes, and the diploma of issue elevated or decreased by the Bitcoin software program to maintain that output time-frame intact. Within the first yr of bitcoin working, 300 bitcoin had been launched per hour (60 minutes, 10 minutes per block, 50 bitcoin launch per block) 7,200 bitcoin per day, and a pair of.6 million bitcoin per yr. So the place does Bitcoin get its worth? Once we consider worth we usually consider an objects shortage, or the quantity there’s of that merchandise. Satoshi, whomever he, she, or they’re, knew that he couldn’t difficulty bitcoin at a price of two.6 million per yr endlessly. If that occurred, it might find yourself with no shortage worth. As an alternative, Satoshi determined that each 210,00zero blocks — which at one block per 10 minutes takes 4 years — his program would lower the quantity of Bitcoin issued in coinbase transactions in half. This process is named “block reward halving,” or “halving.” On November 28th, 2012, the primary halving of the block reward from 50 bitcoin to 25 bitcoin occurred, and the second halving from 25 bitcoin to 12.5 bitcoin occurred on July ninth, 2016. The third will occur 4 years from that date, in July 2020. The genius of Satoshi’s logic: Satoshi rewarded early adopters with essentially the most new Bitcoin to get adequate assist, and in so doing created a sufficiently big base of financial liquidity for the community to make use of. He understood that if bitcoin was a hit over time its greenback worth would enhance, and subsequently he might lower the speed of issuance whereas nonetheless rewarding supporters!

Warren Buffett has not pulled any punches either, in the past. In May, at Berkshire’s annual shareholder’s meet, Buffett said that Bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.”\nThe anchor, Becky Quick, drew attention to their past scruffs with Bitcoin and asked, “Which of you hates Bitcoin more?”\nBuffett wittily replied:\n“I set a high standard, I don’t know if Jamie can top me or not.”\nJamie refused to be drawn into the quagmire and simply said, “Just beware.”\nThe morning talk program was primarily Buffett and Dimon’s joint effort to convince CEOs to end quarterly profit forecasts.\nBuffett has been the Chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970 and is referred to by the media as ‘Sage’ or ‘Oracle’ of Omaha. He is known for his personal frugality despite his immense wealth. Among his many noteworthy practices, one heartwarming story is his founding of ‘The Giving Pledge’, where billionaires pledge to give away at least half their wealth.\nHe actively contributes to political causes and had also endorsed the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the 2016 US Presidential Elections. He has also publicly opposed the policies, actions, and statements of the current U.S. president, Donald Trump.\nJamie Dimon, JP Morgan Chase’s CEO, is listed in Time magazine’s 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2011 lists of the world’s 100 most influential people.

Especially that it’s in Czech…. And you want to buy less than 3,000 [Czech crowns worth]. Usually.”\nI do, yeah. I don’t drink that much coffee in one day.\n“(laughs) Now, you have to put this – the public key, you put that here, and the machine will read it automatically. And now you need the cash, which you will insert here.”\nAh... Cash.\nThat’s a problem. This is a cashless society – I have a card.\n“Then…If you will wait a bit, I will help you with it, yeah?”\nSo, my first attempt to get my hands on some cryptocurrency – not to mention some coffee – has hit a minor snag. It turns out that it takes real hard currency to purchase some of the virtual stuff – at least through a Bitcoin ATM. To use a payment card means giving up your anonymity, which somewhat defeats the purpose. To use Bitcoin and Litecoin on a regular basis, you need to have a virtual wallet, which you can get in the form of a smartphone app, such as Blockchain or Coinomi.\nIn the meantime, I sat down with Jakub Souček, the manager of Bitcoin Coffee, here at Paralení Polis, an ethical hackers’ collective founded by a group of guerrilla artists and activists called Ztohoven. I began by asking Jakub the concept behind Paralelní Polis and the DIY market.\n“Actually, Paralení Polis itself is kind of a ‘do-it-yourself’ project because the artistic group Ztohoven simply started with creating it by themselves without any company or anyone else behind it, and we were doing a flea market for a while. So, we were thinking, ‘Okay, what to do next?’ And from our point of view, a Do-it-Yourself market is more connected with our topics, with what we’re doing here – especially if it’s something like electronic stuff.”\n“Like you could see cryptocurrency tickers, which are made by guys from Octopus Engine, or the guys from Makers Lab who are printing things on 3D printers… So, these are things more connected to us than say second-hand fashion.”\nAnd these entrepreneurs who you’ve mentioned, do they sell only in cryptocurrency or do they also accept normal cash?\n“Only in crypto because this whole project is based on the fact that we don’t accept any kind of state currency here. So, you simply cannot use it here. Everything sold inside is always based on cryptocurrencies.”\nSome of the very first Bitcoin ATMs were in this country, isn’t that right?\n“I’m not sure if it was the totally first place, but we were the first project of its kind which is based only on crypto, and it seems like we are still the only one in the whole world. This ATM is a product of General Bytes, a Czech company. I think there are the like the second-biggest one in the whole world.”\nHas the government taken an interest, good or bad, in your project?\n“Ah, well… They started almost a year ago when there was a new law, it’s called EET, and we totally disagree with this law, so we haven’t accepted it. And what happened is they just came, checked it, saw that we are not connected to this network. We gave them our statement why we will never connect to it, and that’s it – for now (laughs).”\nAnd there was absolutely no follow-up after that?\n“Really none. I think it’s because we are not accepting state currency. So, they actually don’t know what to do with us, I believe (laughs).”\nAt the DIY market, I meet one of crypto vendors who Jakub mentioned, Honza founder of Octopus Engine. A self-described “visionary and creative geek”, he was quick to show me the level of his commitment to new technologies – in the form of a chip he has embedded in his hand – which serves as his virtual wallet.\nI began by asking Honza and a colleague, Petr, about the name of the start-up company, which among other things is working on virtual reality projects and developing a simplified Bitcoin/Litecoin terminal, and some of the products they are selling here at Paralení Polis.\nHonza: “I’m a diver, and I’m fascinated by this animal, the octopus – it’s fascinating. So, I put together the word ‘octopus’ and ‘engine’. And ‘engine’ is especially for engineers…”\nSo, this is something that a cryptocurrency enthusiast might want on their desk, for example?\nPetr: “Yeah.”\nI’m looking at a rocket – that one is clear – but what is this one? What’s the concept?\nPetr: “It’s the same as the rocket only just a simple wooden box. It’s called a Tickernator.”\nIt says ‘crypto-ticker’ here. So, this will tell me how much my Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are worth, yeah?\nPetr: “Exactly. Most of these things are used for showing the price of the Bitcoin. And we support a lot of cryptocurrencies from CoinMarketCap, for example. So, it can be customised to the needs of the customer.”\nWhat is your preferred cryptocurrency, personally?\nHonza: “Bitcoin, Litecoin… and maybe RedCoin.”\nAnd how can you use them in daily life, here in the Czech Republic?\nHonza: “This place – Paralelní Polis – is one possibility, so we use it here. I’m here one or two times a week.”\nAt another stand, I meet Denis, from D63, which among other things, designs and sells unconventional stereo speakers.\n“I’m Denis. I’m presenting D63, this is a concept room where we have our wooden speakers, which we make by ourselves. Also, D63 is a place for any kind of art. It can be interior design, an ecological theme, I mean some recyclable things. Our speakers are made of wood, and it’s somehow recyclable, because nowadays is important.”\nAnd D63 is a kind of collective?\n“We call it a concept room. Mostly, it’s a showroom for our speakers. We also do some events, DJ selections, flea markets, pop-up vinyl stores, some exhibitions of paintings… Things like that.”\nAre you a cryptocurrency enthusiast?\n“Yes, of course. We also accept cryptocurrencies, and we are into this thing.”\nWhat was the first cryptocurrency that you personally had?\n“Well, it was Litecoin. It was in Paralelní Polis, because there was a flea market where he had some stuff and needed just to pay for this event, you know. And in this way, it started… and we’ll continue to use it.”\nBut if someone comes in off the street, knows nothing about cryptocurrency, and so obviously doesn’t own any, how do they buy a cup of coffee here? Bitcoin Coffee manager Jakub Souček explains.\n“That’s really easy. That’s actually why we exist. We have a special ATM right behind the doors and here you can buy – and even sell – cryptocurrencies. There are four of them right now: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero and Dash. So, you simply come with your state currency – here it’s Czech crowns and euros – put the cash into the ATM and it will give you the cryptocurrency.”\nAnd it gives you the cryptocurrency in what form, actually? Do you have to create an account?\n“With crypto, it works as if you have a wallet. And there are various types of wallets. The easiest one is a paper wallet. The ATM is able to print it for you. Also, we have special cards; it’s also like a paper wallet but looks… nicer. Or you can download the application. We are basically an education centre, so we will help you with all this stuff. So even someone who is totally new to this can simply come inside and we’ll really help you from the very beginning to the end when you’re paying for the coffee and leaving.”\nIn my case, that someone, once again, is Alina, herself an engineer and Paralelní Polis regular, who has graciously lent me some Czech crowns until I can get to an ATM.\n“So, I can help you with 200 crowns. You just have to insert the money here and automatically it’s taken. Then you have to press ‘buy alt coins’. And usually it’s good to print the receipt.”\nAnd that’s it.\n“Yes. You just go to the barista and request what you want. And I will also walk you through the payment process. You press ‘checkout’. You need to choose – here we have only three cryptocurrencies to choose from.”\n‘Only’ three? Oh, well.\n“And if you want to pay a tip…”\nI do.\n“Yeah? Okay, so you can press it – I’m not looking.”\nAlright. I pressed the highest one.\n“For the record! (laughs) And then you touch the QR code. And then you put this here. [beep] And it is paid.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jakub souček", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin coffee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paralelní polis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-09T00:32:27.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d838690b206b84c7daf9544541ad68723f9e3a21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTA8_uO46SEPG9oENxPifs_iqJmnnVli_2PLYKNFVo_UM4l8ZR79hc61spgEjQQ_h4Ymszh1GSpYf_bEt9RI2Tu", "site_full": "www.earnforex.com", "site": "earnforex.com", "site_section": "https://www.earnforex.com/videos", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex Videos", "title": "Bitcoin Forecast — June 8th 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin Forecast — June 8th 2018", "published": "2018-06-08T17:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 35073, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d838690b206b84c7daf9544541ad68723f9e3a21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTA8_uO46SEPG9oENxPifs_iqJmnnVli_2PLYKNFVo_UM4l8ZR79hc61spgEjQQ_h4Ymszh1GSpYf_bEt9RI2Tu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "K.

Its genesis date was January 3rd, 2009. Bitcoin’s total supply is 17,081,825 coins. Bitcoin’s official Twitter account is @bitcoin and its Facebook page is accessible here . The official website for Bitcoin is bitcoin.org . The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoin and the currency’s Github account can be viewed here . Bitcoin’s official message board is bitcointalk.org .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBuying and Selling Bitcoin\nBitcoin can be traded on the following cryptocurrency exchanges: Cobinhood, itBit, Fisco, RightBTC, fex, Bittrex, Bitstamp, CoinTiger, Tidex, Coinsuper, DragonEX, CEX.IO, C2CX, Negocie Coins, bitFlyer, BtcTrade.im, BitMEX, Trade By Trade, OKEx, BitForex, Coinone, Quoine, OOOBTC, Bitinka, OEX, CoinEgg, Kucoin, BTCC, Gate.io, GOPAX, CoinEx Market, xBTCe, Bithumb, Poloniex, Lbank, Bit-Z, Coinroom, Fatbtc, Octaex, Bitfinex, ZB.COM, Exrates, Bitbank, WEX, Zaif, Coinhub, Iquant, Simex, LakeBTC, IDAX, Neraex, CoinsBank, Coinrail, Omicrex, BCEX, HitBTC, B2BX, Korbit, OTCBTC, BitBay, EXX, Huobi, YoBit, Hotbit, Sistemkoin, Ethfinex, Gemini, Bibox, TOPBTC, BTCBOX, Kraken, Binance, Upbit, Exmo, Paribu, GDAX, Luno, Livecoin and CoinBene.

This situation persists for more than two weeks as of Friday, June 8, and the level of volatility is at the minimum values for 8 months.\nIn traditional markets, this situation is resolved sooner or later by a strong volatility outburst and market impulse. Throughout the week, we expected the situation on the bitcoin market to be very close to this, given all the technical indicators. However, at the beginning of the US trading session on Friday, bitcoin again pulls lower from the already strategic resistance 7700 - the only mark in these days, a breakthrough of which can bring life back to the market in the form of volatility and trading volume. According to the website coinmarketcap.com, the market capitalization for today is 338 billion dollars.\nSince May 24, the main cryptocurrency has been traded within the tight range of 7020 - 7700 dollars. During all these, trading sessions, volatility fell and the range narrowed. Over the past 36 hours, the price has barely moved, sales and market movements intensified only today with the arrival of European traders.\nThe daily volatility, which is calculated as the spread between the daily highs and the daily low, fell to $107 on Thursday, the lowest level since October 2, 2017, which is 86 percent lower compared to 2018, when the average volatility was $795.\nAt the time of writing, shortly before the start of the American main trading session, the bitcoin prices were $7552, the maximum if the day is at 7672.\nAll week long bitcoin looked set up for a major upward move. Now the inability of the bulls to overcome the resistance at 7700 dollars left the doors open for the bears. At the same time, an upward support trend line supports buyers and does not let the price lower.\nA move above $7700 will signal a bullish breakout and set the tone for the next resistance test at 8040. On the other hand, a break below $7020 would mean a bearish local victory. In this case, bitcoin may fall below $6000 (the February minimum).\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [],

By Gary McFarlane | Fri, 8th June 2018 - 15:19\nBitcoin continues to be rangebound, although the price has nudged up 2% on a week ago, trading at $7,576 on Coinbase. Ethereum is up 4.5% over that period.\nThe relative calm in crypto markets comes at a time of stirrings in the well-worn themes concerning mainstream adoption and regulation, while the stalled launch of EOS continues to occupy crypto watchers. Cryptocurrency total market cap now stands at $338 billion, down from $433 billion a month ago, a drop of 21%. US SEC says bitcoin not a security\nJay Clayton the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed in an interview with CNBC that initial coin offerings (ICOs) used by blockchain projects to raise funds by selling tokens are in fact sales of securities.\nThe attempt by industry leaders to differentiate \" utility tokens \" that provide access to goods or a service as something distinct from securities tokens doesn ' t seem to have impressed the SEC. Clayton stated in no uncertain terms: \" If you have an ICO or a stock, and you want to sell it in a private placement, follow the private placement rules. If you want to do any IPO with a token, come see us. \"\nHowever, the SEC does accept that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, whose primary use case is as \" digital cash \" , are not securities. \" Cryptocurrencies are replacements for sovereign currencies…[they] replace the yen, the dollar, the euro with bitcoin. That type of currency is not a security. \"\nClayton explained.\nThe SEC is not outlawing ICOs but instead seeking to regulate them, which should be seen as a positive development, especially when taken alongside the statement about fiat replacement coins. The SEC's stance has meant that those ICOs that do not abide by US securities law, such as complying with strict accredited investor rules and reporting requirements, are increasingly forced to bar US investors, as was the case with the largest ICO to date from EOS.\nThe SEC uses the Howey Test from 1946 to decide whether a financial product is a security, where \"a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party\".\nClayton continued: \"We are not going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security that has worked for a long time. There's no need to change the definition. A token, a digital asset, where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, and in return for giving you my money I say 'you can get a return'… that is a security and we can regulate that. We regulate the offering of that security and regulate the trading of that security.\"\nThe chairman's remarks came on the heels of the announcement by the SEC that Valerie Szczepanik has been appointed associate director of the Division of Corporation Finance and the senior advisor for digital assets and innovation.\nShe is charged with responsibility for advising on the very subject of Clayton's remarks, namely whether crypto assets are securities. Szczepanik has been employed at the SEC since 1997. Exchange traded fund hopes rekindled\nHopes that an exchange traded fund (ETF) may be approved by the authorities in the US rose this week on news that a new product has been submitted for consideration. Unlike previous applications to the SEC, this product is not aimed at retail investors given that the effective minimum investment in the proposed VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is set by a single being composed of 25 bitcoins, which is roughly $200,000.\nThe proposed ETF will use physical replication which means it will hold bitcoin directly and not synthetically through, for example, futures exposure, as the VanEck's previous bitcoin ETF listings did. VanEck has funds undermanagement of $45 billion and 70 listed exchange traded products. The firm has teamed up with SolidX, a crypto services company, to issue the ETF. SolidX will be providing the custody services for storing bitcoin.\nSolidX chief executive Daniel Gallancy is optimistic about the prospects for the filing's success: \"Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors… We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.\"\nThe ETF market is valued at $3.4 trillion and a crypto ETF is seen as an essential element for attracting mainstream funds.\nLeading crypto exchange Huobi has launched a fund investing in a basket of crypto, which it describes, confusingly, as an exchange traded fund. The fund, called the Huobi 10 (HB10), opened for investor subscriptions on 1 June.\nAs its name suggests, it invests in the top 10 traded coins on the Huobi exchange. The exchange created an index a week before the launch that tracks the 10 most-traded assets against Tether, the \"stablecoin\"crypto pegged to the dollar. The Huobi fund is not listed or tradeable on a public exchange and as such is not an ETF as commonly understood. Investment in the fund is by crypto-only deposits for now. Huobi and Binance venture funds\nHuobi has also announced that it has launched a venture fund to invest in blockchain start-ups in partnership with NewMargin Capital of China, and South Korean institution Kiwoom Securities, with the Korea Development Bank and Industrial Bank of Korea lined up as early investors in their capacity as limited partners. The fund has $93 million to disburse.\nHuobi's move seems to be part of a developing trend among exchanges and other well-endowed players in the crypto ecosystem, as they seek to kickstart development of blockchain applications.\nBinance has also set up a fund to funnel capital into blockchain start-ups but on a much larger scale by allocating $1 billion to its fund, led by Ella Zhang who heads up Binance Labs, the exchange's incubator.\nThe first investment is thought to be in a blockchain-based taxi service being planned by Chen Weixing, the founder of Kuaidi Dache which went on to merge with Didi Chuxing and today dominates Uber-like ride-hailing services in China. Fund management giant Fidelity hiring for crypto products and services?\nFund management behemoth Fidelity, the first among its peers to allow its US clients to link their crypto holdings to their portfolio account and with a famously pro-crypto chief executive Abigail Johnson, is hiring crypto developers.\nInternal documents revealed by Business Insider suggests Fidelity may have decided to start building out crypto infrastructure to support as yet unknown products and services.\nA post to recruit software developers is seeking staff who could \"engineer, create, and deploy a Digital Asset exchange to both a public and private cloud\". Other snippets from the Fidelity recruitment efforts show that the company is seeking to fill positions for \"first-in-class custodian services for Bitcoin and other digital currencies\".\nJohnson has been a long-term advocate for the efficiencies and costs savings she believes blockchain can deliver, and the company has been running trials and pilots with the technology at its Fidelity Labs for several years. \"Blockchain technology isn't just a more efficient way to settle securities. It will fundamentally change market structures, and maybe even the architecture of the Internet itself.\"\nShe said last year when extolling the virtues of blockchain.\nA company spokesperson asked by financial news outlet Barron's for comment said: \"It's no secret that we are actively exploring cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and other digital assets in our Blockchain Incubator at Fidelity. We see the future of financial services taking place on open and permissionless ledgers, with technologies like digital assets, currencies and Blockchains and we are very actively exploring what this may mean for Fidelity. We are hiring to meet the demand for this exploration, but we have nothing to announce today.\"\nFidelity is among the largest fund management firms in the world with $2.4 trillion of assets under management. EOS to launch in next 24 hours… maybe\nThe end of the EOS's year-long token sale we reported on last week, which has raised a mammoth $4 billion, has not seen the network go live yet. Infighting among the \"block producers\", made up of the largest token holders and who will be in charge of block verification on the network, has delayed the launch.\nBecause the network is not live yet, the two block producer votes that have taken place so far were organised on the Telegram messaging app in a process that some in the community say lacks transparency.\nHowever, the EOS block producers are in the Catch-22 position of not being able to vote on the blockchain until the mainnet goes live. The votes had majority support for launching but not the two thirds + 1 apparently required to flick the switch. The delays in the launch has been grist to the rumour mill that is swirling about the different interests behind the competing block producer groups.\nOne group which goes by the handle EOS Mainnet Launch Group (EMLG) is thought to represent the majority of block producers but has a competitor in the EOS Core group.\nThere are 21 block producers in total and when the network goes live voting will take place on the blockchain in a continuous process updated every two minutes.\nHowever, it is highly likely there will be more than one blockchain as the different groups and developers compete to build the most popular chain. The network is expected to finally go live in the next 24 hours, but we've heard that before.\nThe EOS code is now public and there are 593 issues outstanding on the Github software repository (Github was acquired by Mircosoft this week) where it is hosted.\nThere have been two major updates to the code, which is now at version 1.0.2. One security consultant has been busy this week bug hunting to earn the $10,000 bounty for each bug found. Guido Vranken has earned $120,000 in the space of a week and was offered a job by the developers of EOS, Block.one, although has turned them down, for now. Exchange and mining news and who owns bitcoin\nIn exchange news this week, Bitfinex was forced offline by a distributed denial of service attack a couple of days ago but is up and running again now.\nElsewhere, US exchange Coinbase announced that it was planning to open up shop in Japan, the world's largest market for crypto. The exchange is also seeking to obtain various broking and trading licences as it continues its push into the mainstream. As part of that mission it has bought Keystone Capital, Venovate Marketplace and Digital Wealth.\nMining giant Bitmain is talking about doing an initial public offering (IPO not ICO) in the near future, according to a Bloomberg report. Chief executive Jihan Wu had previously told the financial news service that Bitmain revenues last year totalled $2.5 billion. Canaan, a mining competitor, recently filed for an IPO in Hong Kong.\nBitmain is the largest manufacturer of application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), which are specialised chips for the processor-intensive proof of work consensus system required to mine bitcoin. The supposed waste associated with bitcoin mining has been subjected to withering criticism and so too has the centralisation of mining in the hands of big players such as Bitmain.\nA major report by the Financial Times, based on research by Chainalysis, says that longer-term holders of bitcoin offloaded $30 billion worth of the cryptocurrency on shorter-term speculative traders entering the market at the end of last year. Other findings were decidedly bearish for future bitcoin prospects.\nThe research found that speculation remains the primary use case for bitcoin, with most transactions involving funds being moved in and out of exchanges with no growth in merchant adoption. Other findings concluded that bitcoin was \"not a rational market\" and was \"thinly traded and manipulated\".\nFinally, Jump Trading of Chicago has set up an electronic-based over-the-counter (OTC) trading system for bitcoin. This is a big step forward in the world of trading firms where OTC crypto deals are more often than not conducted over the phone or on Skype due to the immature nature of the marketplace.\nThese articles are provided for information purposes only.
