She explained on CNBC ‘s “Squawk Box” on Thursday:\nAs a payment system, I think it’s troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort. In fact [it’s] designed to be not transparent.\nBessant has apparently never visited one of the many websites tracking Bitcoin’s very public ledger . If she had, she might realize that it’s extremely transparent – significantly more so than private banking ledgers. Nevertheless, Bessant claims police forces are incapable of tracking criminal transactions on the public ledger, stating:\nThe way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that.\nBank of America is one of the many institutions which banned cryptocurrency purchases via credit card. She explained:\nJust like we don’t allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we’re not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards.\nBessant also took the time to praise traditional banking’s security, stating:\nI do actually think we’re in a better position every day. Awareness is higher, the sophistication of our defense and detection efforts are growing every day. There are more players in the mix with a lot of expertise, and the threat environment is beginning to show patterns that make prediction and even automated prediction something we can do every day. So I do believe we’re in a better place. ‘It’s Never Going to Work’\nBank of America’s CTO isn’t the only one throwing FUD at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nEconomist Nouriel Roubini, most widely known for correctly predicting the global financial crisis, claimed digital currencies create “chaos” in the world of traditional payments. He explained at the Fluidity Summit in Brooklyn on Thursday:\nIt’s totally inefficient. It’s never going to work. You are going to the world of the Flintstones to buy any good you have to exchange, you go back to the Stone Age of bartering.\nAs noted by CNBC , Roubini loves digital payment platforms like Alipay, Venmo, PayPal, and Square. Interestingly, he doesn’t think blockchain technology will have any significant impact on the future of finance He stated:\nI’m affirmative on that significant disruption, but most of this has nothing to do with blockchain, nothing to do with cryptocurrency.\nDo you agree that blockchain technology won’t have a future in the financial sector? Do you think cryptocurrencies are preventing authorities from catching criminals? Or do you think both of these experts are mistaken?

actively against Bitcoin trading on Social Media\nThe tax authority in Israel, Israel Tax Authority (ITA), for some time against the trade with Bitcoin. So by now she is looking for Social Media channels, according to Bitcoin traders. The Concerned are admonished to put all of the transactions and the Wallets open and report the income.\nAt the beginning of the year, the authority announced that Bitcoin and crypto-currencies as assets. Thus, a capital gains tax of 25 percent on any profits. To run a company that deals with Bitcoin & co., to fall a further 17 percent value-added tax. The categorization moved at that time already a controversy, because they ignore the economic reality. Now the attitude to take against the digital Gold additional features: Private persons come to the attention of the tax man. Social Media channels as Bitcoin exchanges\nIn Israel, it seems not unusual that buyers and sellers of crypto-currencies connect via social networks. However, this Form of Peer-to-Peer exchange is a Problem in the eyes of the Israeli tax authority. Because very few of your Trades for the tax. Therefore, the ITA has urged the population to disclose all relevant information. This means on the one hand, all of the Trades and also Wallets. Data are required to 2013.\nSpecifically, the ITA writes also become conspicuous persons. How the authority came to the information, would like to announce the ITA. As the banking sector reacts in Israel, in principle, a negative impact on Bitcoin, it is reasonable to assume that the banks are more proactively the data of your customers. On the other hand, is not excluded, that even undercover agents are on the Social networks on the go. Good news for decentralized Exchanges?\nThe Social media are intended primarily for the connection between well-Known not for the exchange of crypto-currencies. Messages can be either public of all, or of the respective companies (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.). In the case of a judicial decision, the company is likely the customer data.\nAs an Alternative to Social Media decentralized Exchanges (DEX) can serve better. The communication traffic is End-to-End encrypted. In addition, there is no Single Point of Failure – no enterprise carried on by a public authority under any pressure.

Bears are baying for blood! Despite their May 15 hard fork, Bitcoin Cash isn't finding any reprieve and so far it is down 20 percent week over week. In the last 24 hours alone, price erosion exceeds 15 percent. It might be a correction yes, but at the moment it a beautiful Picasso showing how Bitcoin Cash sellers are marauding, staking any attempts of bull pressure.\nFrom the News Roger Ver, the Crypto evangelist many Bitcoin Core supporters love to hate won't stop pitching his beloved coin . He still insists that it's a better currency and therefore a better store of value that Bitcoin Core. Now, if you have been tracking this guy for sometimes then you will realize that this is the umpteenth time he his saying so. Will repetition come to pass someday? Well, maybe, maybe not. What we know for sure is that Bitcoin Cash shall be forking once more .\nHowever, this time since it shall be done at MTP time, there is no need to track block height. We anticipate this upgrade to take place on Tuesday, May 15 and there, the block size would be hiked to 32 MB from 8MB making it that largest ever block size increment in the world. Besides, their protocol data carrier sizes shall be increased to 220 bytes.\nIf you are a Bitcoin Cash full node or miner, please update, if not then you better stay on the side line and watch. Before the fork begins, full nodes should upgrade their clients to the 32 MB supporting Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version.\nSo, while speculations are rife that this upgrade shall increase Bitcoin Cash transaction throughput and fees, will this boost prices after the fork? Or, will it even be successful in the first place regardless of Bitcoin Cash staunch following in Korea and Japan? Let's wait and see!\nBitcoin Cash (BCHUSD) Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nUnless a miracle happen, Bitcoin Cash shall end up with a conspicuous double bar bear reversal pattern right at the middle BB, a resistance line. That's a fact! So, despite that stochastic buy signal turning from deep the oversold territory, the general sentiment is bearish.\nBitcoin Cash prices are down 18 percent in the last 24 hours and 20 percent in the last 7 days effectively reversing week ending May 7 gains. At this rate, we shall be aiming for take profit targets at $1000 and $800. Many didn't expect this to happen and advised by this, we shall be looking for sells in lower time frames.\nDaily Chart Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nLike the weekly chart, the depreciation is real but not as wholesome. Bears are stepping on the gas and the result has been that clear break below the middle BB. Inevitably, this means sellers are in charge and it means we shall be trading a bearish break out pattern.\nSo, building on to the bearish engulfing pattern we are seeing in the weekly chart, immediate targets is at $1200, there we might see a reaction and a bounce back to $1400 or so before bears resume their pressure with targets we mentioned earlier.\nThe post (Despite the Hard Fork and Historic Block Size increase, Bitcoin Cash is Spineless and dropping Like a Stone) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis: May 12, 2018 appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "picasso", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mtp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T10:50:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2b28235f2a3e89de7b151b15593cbd06e3cd7f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY6tMXKHZcLp3JhjzUo.8K.OSSdj8e6ajcKW3t7iAdUYbT.TRkChI6Kg0VyOZt3QmQw--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 3", "title_full": "How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 3", "published": "2018-05-12T10:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2b28235f2a3e89de7b151b15593cbd06e3cd7f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY6tMXKHZcLp3JhjzUo.8K.OSSdj8e6ajcKW3t7iAdUYbT.TRkChI6Kg0VyOZt3QmQw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T10:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 3", "text": "The following opinion piece was written by Jonald Fyookball .\nIn parts 1 and 2 of How Bitcoin Cash …, we uncovered the important principles of community education and clarity. Now it is time to turn our attention to one of the most obvious things that went wrong in BTC — the centralization of protocol development.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 2\nHow Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid Centralization Decentralization comes in many forms: decentralization of nodes, mining pools, wealth, and so on. One thing that was overlooked for a long time in Bitcoin BTC was that while many things were well distributed, there was only one main group of developers (Bitcoin Core).\nDecentralized Development\nMost of the BCH community is now well aware of this folly, and that is why we seek to have multiple independent teams of developers along with multiple full node implementations.\nMiners need established, robust software they can rely on, and its important to have several choices; otherwise it means that a single group of developers essentially controls the protocol.\nEntrenchment of \"The Reference Implementation\"\nBitcoin Core became entrenched as \"the\" Bitcoin software, which led to stagnation. Although there were already several different implementations, the dominance of Bitcoin Core has been overwhelming.\nTechnically, it's hash power that matters, not how many different nodes are running a certain software… But given the totally lopsided distribution, it was clear that anyone running a different version from Core would be a tiny minority. That means Bitcoin Core calls all the shots as far as BTC protocol rules.\nBCH is Doing Better Already\nWe're heading in the right direction but we're not out of the woods yet. One interesting phenomenon is that the current level of BCH development decentralization is often either underestimated or overestimated.\nOn one extreme, some believe development is fully decentralized (since there's, what, 6 node implementations now?). By contrast, others see the leading team (Bitcoin ABC) as having become the next reference implementation.\nThe truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin ABC runs around 60–70% of the BCH nodes and Bitcoin Unlimited runs about a third of them. Essentially, instead of one main implementation, there's now two.\nMaybe that sounds a bit disappointing, but that's twice as many as BTC.\nMeritocracy A meritocracy is defined as \"the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability.\"\nThere's often a misguided notion that the main development groups in BCH should have magically have equal influence, rather than acknowledging that influence must be earned.\nThose fearful of ABC having too much power might not understand this principle, or more likely, they haven't seen all that ABC has accomplished to earn what is currently a majority \"market share\".\nThe fact of the matter is that Bitcoin ABC has been the best in class when it comes to leading protocol development, producing timely releases of solid code, and solving problems.\nTo be specific, it was Bitcoin ABC that created the first node software for Bitcoin Cash, and spearheaded both hard fork upgrades along with the Cashaddr addresses.\nHealthy Competition is the Way Forward\nThis is not to say that Bitcoin Cash wouldn't benefit from an even more disbursed landscape, with several of the smaller implementations gaining more market share and influence.\nInstead of the misplaced idea that ABC should be reigned in, other teams should catch up to ABC by competing. That means they need to do as good a job as ABC has done at leading protocol development and delivering reliable software that serves the community.\nWhile its good to have a healthy fear of avoiding another \"Core\", Bitcoin ABC actually has been extremely inclusive toward other teams. ABC organizes meetings with other BCH devs (both online and in real life), has created open work groups for various Bitcoin related topics, has invited developers from other groups into their private discussion channels, and has even written code for other teams.\nIt feels that we're on the right track with decentralizing protocol development, and I expect it will continue to improve over time.\nIn the upcoming conclusion (Part 4), we'll take a look at mining, development funding, and some big picture solutions.\nWritten by Jonald Fyookball\nJonald Fyookball (pseudonym) is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, best known as the project leader of the Electron Cash wallet, and for a series of hard hitting articles on the Bitcoin scaling debate.

Exchange accounts can be hacked, mobile wallets breached, and smartphones lost, stolen or destroyed. But paper? It's impervious to all digital attack vectors. It's not foolproof – fire, water damage, or theft can still take their toll – but if you're careful where you stash your paper wallet, it's one on the safest ways to store cryptocurrency. Be it as a backup of an existing hardware, mobile or desktop wallet, or as a standalone wallet that exists solely offline, paper is perfect.\nThe ultimate form of cold storage, a paper wallet simply consists of a printout of the private and public keys to your address. (These can even be handwritten if you don't trust printers or have access to one). Suffice to say that while the public key can be shared so that others can send you coins, you shouldn't share your private key with anyone. Thus, once you've printed your wallet, you need to store it somewhere only your eyes can view it. That could be a safe, a bank vault or a sly hiding place in your home.\nIf you're ultra cautious, you can even split your paper wallet into parts and store it in separate locations. Not much use if you're a day trader, admittedly, but if you're a hodler for life, a distributed paper wallet (with at least one duplicate to ensure redundancy) is about as safe as cold storage gets.\nHow to Make a Paper Wallet There are numerous websites that allow you to create a paper wallet in seconds before printing it off. Choose a favorably reviewed site whose code is open sourced to prevent the sort of scams that are all too prevalent in the crypto space. Examples of paper wallet generating sites include the following:\nBitaddress.org : A simple but effective open source Javascript wallet generator. Select the BTC wallet type you'd like, generate some entropy, choose how many addresses you want and hit \"Print\". You can also create vanity, bulk, split, and brain wallets.\nBitcoin.com : The tools section of Bitcoin.com allows you to create a bitcoin cash paper wallet just like the BTC example described above. Bitcoin.com's paper wallet generator, like all of the sites listed here, does not store knowledge of your private key.\nBitcoinpaperwallet.com : A self-explanatory site that allows you to create BTC and BCH paper wallets. There's a useful section on paper wallet security tips and you can order tamper-proof holographic stickers for creating your own folding paper wallet. When it comes to print out your wallet, the sensitive details – namely the private key and QR code – are securely taped shut and sealed with a sticker. That way, you know that no one's accessed your paper wallet and peeked at your private key.\nHow to Make a Bitcoin Paper Bill Making a paper wallet containing your private key is fine for your own purposes, but what if you want to share your BTC address with others? In that case you only need to print your bitcoin address and QR code. Sites such as Gobitcoin.io will allow you to enter your BTC address, generate a QR code and even specify an amount. If you charge a fixed 0.05 BTC for a service, for example, you can hand people a QR code they can scan with that amount pre-entered. All they have to do is scan the QR code and hit send. Other sites will let you create QR codes for bitcoin cash and loads of other cryptocurrencies.\nVersatile and ultra-secure, paper wallets are one of the smartest ways to keep your crypto. Create it, print it, and then stash it in a very safe place.\nDo you use cold storage to secure your bitcoin?

BTC has seen a price surge with renewed interest from big names like Goldman Sachs while altcoins have major events on the horizon. This is a very exciting period for altcoins like BTC, ZCL, ENJ, and DGB.\nWhat a Week It Has Been, What a Week It Will Be The cryptocurrency markets have finally broken out of a multi-month bear slump in brute force. BTC is up more than 50% from recent lows with altcoins trading significantly higher. With positive momentum in the cryptocurrency markets , teams from across the world are announcing major cryptocurrency projects, deadlines are being hit, and milestones are being reached.\nThe bearish markets in the past week have begun to seem increasingly bullish with a major forking announcement from ZClassic; a security break-through for DigiByte, and the Unite world tour for Enjin.\nBTC- Goldman Sachs Futures Trading and Possible Trading Desk The most important name in cryptocurrency trading at $9,952 per coin with a market cap of $170 billion is Bitcoin. This week has been exciting and the near future should also be exuberant as Bitcoin bulls have retaken the reigns and it once again is pressing the $10,000 mark . BTC was trading as low as $6,000 during this recent bear raid and looks to have built significant momentum heading into May.\nThere are a few main reasons BTC has once again accelerated forward in value: renewed interest from the world's wealthiest via OTC (over the counter deals) and trading platforms/operations opening up to institutional investors such as Goldman Sachs.\nGoldman Sachs announced earlier this week they would begin futures trading of BTC and also were considering a trading desk. This was confirmed on Thursday, May 3, 2018, with the likely pursuit of similar operations by other Wall Street Banks. As more money pours into the cryptocurrency space BTC will obviously be the first big winner with institutional money likely trickling off to other altcoins as well.\nA recent announcement by the Anonymous Bitcoin team revealed that BTC and ZCL will both be receiving a forked coin on September 10, 2018. Allowing those that enjoy the BTC bull run to have a nice 'dividend' at the end of summer.\nZCL – A Real Forking Announcement (FUD, Upcoming Announcements) ZClassic (ZCL) is trading at $21.50 with a market cap of $83.6 million. This past week a new dev team announced on CNBC they would be forking ZCL with BTC, creating Anonymous Bitcoin . This was the first televised fork announcement by a major broadcaster like CNBC. The technology behind Anonymous Bitcoin WILL include zkSNARKs anonymity features plus masternode staking ability.\nThis would allow individuals to be incentivized to hold their Anonymous Bitcoin vs actively trade it. This fork was officially announced April 28, 2018. ZCL quickly rose to over $40 before conflicting news was announced by prior ZCL dev teams regarding the inauthenticity of the fork.\nThe Anonymous Bitcoin team has defended their position and remained completely transparent regarding their methods for forking ZCL while being present and doing interviews at the last two cryptocurrency conventions in Miami and Los Angeles.\nThe Anonymous Bitcoin lead developer, Sam Abbassi, proudly has a speaking engagement coming up at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The Founder of the project, Jake Greenbaum, will be going to Consensus to continue to network, interview, and share the philosophy behind why forks create better technology at little to no cost to the crypto community. The Anonymous Bitcoin team is not hiding behind the veil of a fork but instead attempting to create a new cryptocurrency with a vibrant community behind it.\nIn the months leading up to ZCL's prior fork, ZCL was trading as high as $220 per coin with a market cap of almost $700 million. Currently, ZCL is trading under $22 with new advisors to be announced in the near future, the executive summary to be released in the next week, and the white paper to be released by June 1 st . At a bare minimum, the next few weeks will be exciting to watch the charts of ZCL.\nEnjin Unite Tokyo: May 7-9; Unite Beijing May 11-13 Enjin (\"ENJ\") is currently on the \"conference tour\" at Unity events. For those that are not big gamers or developers \"Unity\" may not be a familiar term. Unity is a cross-platform game engine that is used to develop video games for all consoles and mobile devices. The unity platform now includes over 15 platforms and hosts major conferences regarding gaming, app development, and technology all over the world.\nThis week is important for ENJ because they are speaking and having booths at Unity's event in Tokyo and next week's event in Beijing. ENJ is attempting to integrate its currency into multiple gaming platforms and where better to demonstrate their capabilities than at Unite Tokyo and Unite Beijing?\nENJ currently is trading at $.17 with a market cap of $127 million. If ENJ's presentations and exposure in Asia is viewed positively this numbers should trend upward. As an altcoin ENJ is well suited to enter the gaming market as they are already partnered with Unity for \"True in Game Ownership of Digital Assets.\" Having a partner like Unity while being on their conference tour should provide ENJ the perfect amount of momentum to build their user base and continue to excel as a cryptocurrency.\nDigiByte (DGB) – Blockchain Based Open Authentication Protocol Service May 11 One of the biggest concerns of individuals actively participating in the cryptocurrency space is the possibility of being hacked. Managing a handful of passwords that conceal what could amount to thousands of dollars is a frightening prospect. May 11, 2018, maybe a revolutionary day for passwords and that irritating 2FA authentication.\nA highly secure, DigiByte blockchain-base open authentication protocol service is claiming it can be used to replace usernames, passwords, and even 2FA. If this is correct this will relieve much of the irritation associated with logging into an exchange or accessing a wallet. However, if a hack occurs their entire platform could come crumbling down.\nDGB is trading at $0.048 with a market cap of $492 million. DGB was trading over $0.12 January 7, 2018. With one of their biggest developments to date being released May 11, this should be a very exciting week for DGB. The price of DGB will gauge the market's reaction. DGB's focus is their security, \"by putting security first, our decisions help make sure that transactions, mining, and the blockchain distribution are as decentralized as possible.\nDGB blocks occur on the network every 15 seconds making DGB the fastest UTXO blockchain in the world.\" DGB has focused on security and speed and this week releases their authentication protocol that very well may revolutionize how passwords and usernames are used as a means of verification.\nBulls Retaking the Reigns This has been an exciting week for many as their portfolios have risen nicely and major projects have started back up in the crypto space. Summer should be a period where enthusiasm is rebuilt and the BTC train begins to build major momentum again . With such excitement on the horizon, it is important to look at coins this week like BTC, ZCL, DGB, and ENJ.\n[Full disclosure: Jakethecryptoking has a stake in and is the founder of Anonymous Bitcoin.

The measures are apparently being taken to “protect the public and safeguard the integrity, safety and soundness of the country’s financial system.” The ban applies to all financial instituions. The Irony…\nThat statement is a bit ironic in that anyone who has been living in Zimbabwe since 2000 knows that our country’s financial system is neither safe nor sound. Maybe they meant to say they do not want to compound already existent issues but I guess this will be made known as this is a controversial stance that will garner a strong response from the public, especially those who are already trading.\nThe statement from the RBZ reads: advertisement\nAs monetary authorities, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is the custodian of public trust and has an obligation to safeguard the integrity of payment systems. Cryptocurrencies have strong linkages with standard means of payments and trading applications and rely on much of the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system. Following in the footsteps of others\nJohn Mangudya RBZ governor, in a separate statement, said the RBZ would continue to monitor regional and global cryptocurrency developments in order to inform policy direction. I guess they were taking cues from countries such as Algeria, Bolivia, Ecuador and Bangladesh who are a few of the countries who have also banned Cryptocurrencies. Activities being banned\nUnder RBZ’s directive a number of activities have been highlighted as illegal and these include: Accepting cryptos as collateral Opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them Transfer/receipt of money in relating to purchase/sale of virtual currencies\nThe financial institutions that are trading have been given 60 days to exit any relationships with virtual currency exchanges so at least they have been given an opportunity to sell what they had. This means over the next 60 days Zim is probably going to be a good place to buy cryptos as these institutions will be trying to sell as much as they can before the harsh hand of the law is placed upon them. RBZ is yet to make it clear what action will be taken if some institutions do not comply with the directive.\nThe financial institutions -your banks and the likes of EcoCash- were the guys enabling people to trade. This means that although this ban is directed to financial institutions it still leaves everyone in the cold. Cryptos were always a high risk\nWell, as long as the government had not stated its official position on Cryptos there was always the risk that once they did, things would go south but no one really expected a ban. Keeping that in mind there was literally a 50/50 chance and that made the cryptos risky. Coupled with the mixed opinions about cryptos which sees influential figure such as Bill Gates sounding very cautious about the currencies.\nWe reached out to Golix and they said they had no knowledge of this directive:\nWe haven’t seen the directive itself. As soon as we see we’ll be able to comment on it\nWe are also reaching out to the recently introduced Styx24 , which had been in the crypto trading game for just over 3 months.\nThis directive is also a major upset to the recently launched Dala crypto. Dala became available in Zim a few weeks ago –through Wala- and I think they did not foresee having to deal with this hurdle .\nThe government’s decision may have also been motivated by scams surrounding cryptocurrencies but I honestly do not think those were a major consideration since pyramid schemes were existent using conventional currencies.\nWhat do you think about the governments position on Cryptos? Do you agree this is necessary or this is a major mistep? Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe John Mangudya\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) is the central bank of Zimbabwe.

As such, “it’s a bit of a strawman to say that bitcoin maximalists think there will only be one currency. The reason crypto is zero-sum is [because] money, in general, is zero-sum.”\nIn his analysis, global economies typically have one currency by which others are measured or held in reserve, whether it be gold or dollars. Rochard believes bitcoin is becoming that global store of value and transactional medium for the digital world, especially since other cryptocurrencies appear to be “heavily dependent” on it as a reserve currency.\nSo while other blockchain experts are launching multi-coin crypto hedge funds or freelancing as consultants for the tokenized fundraising projects known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), Rochard just launched Bitcoin Advisory LLC in Brooklyn, N.Y. – call it the maximalist consultancy.\nRochard wants to provide a variety of prospective investors with unadulterated insight into bitcoin.\nBut unlike with a traditional financial advisor or fund manager, clients are only paying for Rochard’s time. His advice, then, won’t be motivated by wanting people to invest through him or in anything offered exclusively by his company; to the contrary, he wants clients to walk away with the tools to manage their own investments.\n“I do want to also present the case against investing in bitcoin or at least being more cautious about its valuation or more rigorous about analyzing the risks of investing in bitcoin. I don’t want investors going all in on bitcoin,” Rochard said, adding:\n“I think that’s the worst possible thing they could do, even though that might not make me popular on Twitter. There needs to be a cautious portfolio approach to bitcoin.”\nIn fact, Rochard’s wife, a financial planner herself, insisted their “very boring” retirement funds exclude high-risk investments like bitcoin. Objectivity needed\nThis idea that people shouldn’t trust third parties and instead empower themselves fueled Rochard’s passion for starting Bitcoin Advisory LLC in the first place.\nAccording to him, the thwarted “New York Agreement,” in which a group of miners and businesses proposed ultimately unpopular changes to the bitcoin software, highlighted a dire need for independent advisors in this space. Since one aspect of the update was related to keeping transaction fees low for these corporate players, Rochard believes they had a vested interest to support the agreement, even though developers were worried about the effects of that change.\n“These CEOs are the main liaison between institutional investors,” Rochard said. “I want to unbundle the information from the financial product.”\nOf course, as a bitcoin maximalist Rochard isn’t completely objective.\nBut he may perhaps have less conflict of interest than a service provider that benefits from pushing users and investors to certain cryptocurrencies, for example.\nAt least, in his mind:\n“They [startup CEOs] are the ones providing views on the bitcoin ecosystem. As such, they have an effect on the way investors think about bitcoin. Their companies have an agenda with regards to bitcoin.”\nRochard said his fidelity belongs solely to bitcoin and related projects like the lightning network, the technology many bitcoin developers are working on which looks to push transactions off-chain so that bitcoin can scale to more users in time. Community building\nIn his new role, investors who want to run their own bitcoin nodes will find Rochard to be a particularly eager educator. And it’s definitely an area where expert advice could help, since running a full node can be one, quite the setup, and two, technically challenging,\nBut for Rochard, it’s a crucial activity in helping users to fully realize bitcoin’s potential, and ties into his engineering work (he’s created several tools to tally and organize access to new contributions to Bitcoin Core software on Github).\n“What I want to see from my own contributions to Bitcoin Core is to help accelerate the development of Bitcoin Core’s wallet,” he said.\nBecause the open-source wallet relies on Bitcoin Core nodes, which broadcast and tally transactions for bitcoin miners to validate, in contrast to lighter software wallets like Jaxx or Bread, which only facilitate transactions, Rochard said this is the best way to be fully in control of your money.\nSpeaking again to his interest in weening people off third-party systems, Rochard said, “I generally want people to be running a full node regardless of the implementation it’s in because we’ve seen a lot of reliance on third parties.”\nThe new consulting gig isn’t Rochard’s first crack at launching a project geared towards educating people on bitcoin.\nFor instance, he co-founded the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute in March 2014 with two fellow alumni of the University of Texas at Austin, Michael Goldstein and Daniel Krawisz. The institute is essentially a free archive of reading materials related to money and cryptography from as far back as the 1970s, including a collection of emails from bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\nMore recently, Rochard and Goldstein started the Noded Bitcoin podcast, where they interview leading developers and bitcoin community influencers.\nSpeaking to his love of bitcoin, Rochard told CoinDesk:\n“There’s so much to research in bitcoin alone. After five years, I’m still peeling the bitcoin onion.”\nImage via Pierre Rochard\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Now it is time to turn our attention to one of the most obvious things that went wrong in BTC — the centralization of protocol development.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 2 How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid Centralization\nDecentralization comes in many forms: decentralization of nodes, mining pools, wealth, and so on. One thing that was overlooked for a long time in Bitcoin BTC was that while many things were well distributed, there was only one main group of developers (Bitcoin Core).\nDecentralized Development Most of the BCH community is now well aware of this folly, and that is why we seek to have multiple independent teams of developers along with multiple full node implementations.\nMiners need established, robust software they can rely on, and its important to have several choices; otherwise it means that a single group of developers essentially controls the protocol.\nEntrenchment of “The Reference Implementation” Bitcoin Core became entrenched as “the” Bitcoin software, which led to stagnation. Although there were already several different implementations, the dominance of Bitcoin Core has been overwhelming.\nTechnically, it’s hash power that matters, not how many different nodes are running a certain software… But given the totally lopsided distribution, it was clear that anyone running a different version from Core would be a tiny minority. That means Bitcoin Core calls all the shots as far as BTC protocol rules.\nBCH is Doing Better Already We’re heading in the right direction but we’re not out of the woods yet. One interesting phenomenon is that the current level of BCH development decentralization is often either underestimated or overestimated.\nOn one extreme, some believe development is fully decentralized (since there’s, what, 6 node implementations now?). By contrast, others see the leading team (Bitcoin ABC) as having become the next reference implementation.\nThe truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin ABC runs around 60–70% of the BCH nodes and Bitcoin Unlimited runs about a third of them. Essentially, instead of one main implementation, there’s now two.\nMaybe that sounds a bit disappointing, but that’s twice as many as BTC. Meritocracy\nA meritocracy is defined as “the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability.”\nThere’s often a misguided notion that the main development groups in BCH should have magically have equal influence, rather than acknowledging that influence must be earned.\nThose fearful of ABC having too much power might not understand this principle, or more likely, they haven’t seen all that ABC has accomplished to earn what is currently a majority “market share”.\nThe fact of the matter is that Bitcoin ABC has been the best in class when it comes to leading protocol development, producing timely releases of solid code, and solving problems.\nTo be specific, it was Bitcoin ABC that created the first node software for Bitcoin Cash, and spearheaded both hard fork upgrades along with the Cashaddr addresses.\nHealthy Competition is the Way Forward This is not to say that Bitcoin Cash wouldn’t benefit from an even more disbursed landscape, with several of the smaller implementations gaining more market share and influence.\nInstead of the misplaced idea that ABC should be reigned in, other teams should catch up to ABC by competing. That means they need to do as good a job as ABC has done at leading protocol development and delivering reliable software that serves the community.\nWhile its good to have a healthy fear of avoiding another “Core”, Bitcoin ABC actually has been extremely inclusive toward other teams. ABC organizes meetings with other BCH devs (both online and in real life), has created open work groups for various Bitcoin related topics, has invited developers from other groups into their private discussion channels, and has even written code for other teams.\nIt feels that we’re on the right track with decentralizing protocol development, and I expect it will continue to improve over time.\nIn the upcoming conclusion (Part 4), we’ll take a look at mining, development funding, and some big picture solutions.\nWritten by Jonald Fyookball Jonald Fyookball (pseudonym) is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, best known as the project leader of the Electron Cash wallet, and for a series of hard hitting articles on the Bitcoin scaling debate.

Several sources said that number would be “a good approximation”– though the price can still be volatile.\nInterestingly enough, with its reputation unmatched by other firms, Xapo has in effect created something more than just a bitcoin vault. It’s essentially the first private bank for rich bitcoiners.\nBecause in addition to its security offerings, Xapo also provides customers with a bitcoin debit card and access to a bitcoin trading desk.\nAlready, the company’s holdings – which constitute roughly 7% of the global bitcoin supply – are higher than 98% of the 5,670 banks in the US.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nFounded by Argentine entrepreneur and PayPal board member Wences Casares, who is widely credited with turning the Valley’s VC billionaires on to bitcoin, the company has amassed a network of underground vaults, including a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nThanks to Cesares’ reputation, Xapo has managed to attract venture investments from some of the Valley’s biggest names, including LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reed Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who is, of course, is in the process of setting up his own crypto “merchant bank” that might end up competing with Xapo.\nIt also has relationships with major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\nXapo’s clients aren’t limited to wealthy individuals. First Block Capital, one of Canada’s first registered crypto firms, chose Xapo to be its custodian – the first sign that the institutional market for crypto custody could some day dwarf Xapo’s private business.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nTo pursue institutional investors, Xapo President Ted Rogers hired Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group and Royal Bank of Scotland Group, to oversee outreach to pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\nThe perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nHowever, there’s one factor that could limit Xapo’s growth, particularly as the crypto market outside of bitcoin grows (assuming the alt-coin universe hasn’t already reached its zenith). The company only works with bitcoin because of Cesares’ belief that it alone will succeed.\nFor everybody who’s not wealthy enough (or too cheap) to pay a third party for an elaborate private-storage scheme, individuals can always store their private keys – the tool that gives them access to their bitcoin – on a hard drive that’s air-gapped from the Internet.\nOf course, no solution is 100% safe from hackers and thieves. And at the end of the day, that reality might be enough to indefinitely stave off the “mainstream adoption” that bitcoiners say is just around the corner.

Anyone can copy some code, rewrite some code, and 'create value' out of thin air. This will dilute the value of current coins and can become no different from today's inflationary fiat money. Unlike gold, the value of crypto is not protected by nature.\nSo these three VIPs threw everything they had against cryptos (including phrases like 'rat poison,') but forgot to use their biggest weapon!\nWhy? My guess is that they've been directed by the elites to say bad things about cryptos (and trust me, the elites have plenty of leverage against people like these.)

Now it is time to turn our attention to one of the most obvious things that went wrong in BTC — the centralization of protocol development.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 2 How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid Centralization\nDecentralization comes in many forms: decentralization of nodes, mining pools, wealth, and so on. One thing that was overlooked for a long time in Bitcoin BTC was that while many things were well distributed, there was only one main group of developers (Bitcoin Core).\nDecentralized Development Most of the BCH community is now well aware of this folly, and that is why we seek to have multiple independent teams of developers along with multiple full node implementations.\nMiners need established, robust software they can rely on, and its important to have several choices; otherwise it means that a single group of developers essentially controls the protocol.\nEntrenchment of “The Reference Implementation” Bitcoin Core became entrenched as “the” Bitcoin software, which led to stagnation. Although there were already several different implementations, the dominance of Bitcoin Core has been overwhelming.\nTechnically, it’s hash power that matters, not how many different nodes are running a certain software… But given the totally lopsided distribution, it was clear that anyone running a different version from Core would be a tiny minority. That means Bitcoin Core calls all the shots as far as BTC protocol rules.\nBCH is Doing Better Already We’re heading in the right direction but we’re not out of the woods yet. One interesting phenomenon is that the current level of BCH development decentralization is often either underestimated or overestimated.\nOn one extreme, some believe development is fully decentralized (since there’s, what, 6 node implementations now?). By contrast, others see the leading team (Bitcoin ABC) as having become the next reference implementation.\nThe truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin ABC runs around 60–70% of the BCH nodes and Bitcoin Unlimited runs about a third of them. Essentially, instead of one main implementation, there’s now two.\nMaybe that sounds a bit disappointing, but that’s twice as many as BTC. Meritocracy\nA meritocracy is defined as “the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability.”\nThere’s often a misguided notion that the main development groups in BCH should have magically have equal influence, rather than acknowledging that influence must be earned.\nThose fearful of ABC having too much power might not understand this principle, or more likely, they haven’t seen all that ABC has accomplished to earn what is currently a majority “market share”.\nThe fact of the matter is that Bitcoin ABC has been the best in class when it comes to leading protocol development, producing timely releases of solid code, and solving problems.\nTo be specific, it was Bitcoin ABC that created the first node software for Bitcoin Cash, and spearheaded both hard fork upgrades along with the Cashaddr addresses.\nHealthy Competition is the Way Forward This is not to say that Bitcoin Cash wouldn’t benefit from an even more disbursed landscape, with several of the smaller implementations gaining more market share and influence.\nInstead of the misplaced idea that ABC should be reigned in, other teams should catch up to ABC by competing. That means they need to do as good a job as ABC has done at leading protocol development and delivering reliable software that serves the community.\nWhile its good to have a healthy fear of avoiding another “Core”, Bitcoin ABC actually has been extremely inclusive toward other teams. ABC organizes meetings with other BCH devs (both online and in real life), has created open work groups for various Bitcoin related topics, has invited developers from other groups into their private discussion channels, and has even written code for other teams.\nIt feels that we’re on the right track with decentralizing protocol development, and I expect it will continue to improve over time.\nIn the upcoming conclusion (Part 4), we’ll take a look at mining, development funding, and some big picture solutions.\nWritten by Jonald Fyookball Jonald Fyookball (pseudonym) is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, best known as the project leader of the Electron Cash wallet, and for a series of hard hitting articles on the Bitcoin scaling debate.

Recently, the price is fluctuating. Its range was between 8000 and 9000 USD. Some media reported the trend had been changed to optimistic beyond the bottom of 6000 USD line. However, it never broke the line of 9000 USD. One of the reasons was said to the custodian of Mt Gox which was bankrupted a few years ago. A large amount of Bitcoins is sold every ten days, according to some experts examining the blockchain. In addition, Upbit, one of the largest crypto coin exchanges, which is located in South Korea, was investigated by the prosecutor. Upbit is suspected to have been dealing with too many coins to be permitted based on its capital. Fortune: Bitcoin Slips Below $9,000 Following Korean Exchange Raid Cryptocurrency exchanges have been hardly investigated so far because their radical and innovative structure is not applicable to the conventional protocol of investigation for financial institutions. If Upbit sells Bitcoins more than they possess without any compensating safeguards, it is no other than a fraud. But, similar cases will happen whenever a new technology rises. The uniqueness of blockchain is recognized by many people. We should consider what it can do for the better future.

One thing that was overlooked for a long time in Bitcoin BTC was that while many things were well distributed, there was only one main group of developers (Bitcoin Core).\nDecentralized Development Most of the BCH community is now well aware of this folly, and that is why we seek to have multiple independent teams of developers along with multiple full node implementations.\nMiners need established, robust software they can rely on, and its important to have several choices; otherwise it means that a single group of developers essentially controls the protocol.\nEntrenchment of “The Reference Implementation” Bitcoin Core became entrenched as “the” Bitcoin software, which led to stagnation. Although there were already several different implementations, the dominance of Bitcoin Core has been overwhelming.\nTechnically, it’s hash power that matters, not how many different nodes are running a certain software… But given the totally lopsided distribution, it was clear that anyone running a different version from Core would be a tiny minority. That means Bitcoin Core calls all the shots as far as BTC protocol rules.\nBCH is Doing Better Already We’re heading in the right direction but we’re not out of the woods yet. One interesting phenomenon is that the current level of BCH development decentralization is often either underestimated or overestimated.\nOn one extreme, some believe development is fully decentralized (since there’s, what, 6 node implementations now?). By contrast, others see the leading team (Bitcoin ABC) as having become the next reference implementation.\nThe truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin ABC runs around 60–70% of the BCH nodes and Bitcoin Unlimited runs about a third of them.

That means they need to do as good a job as ABC has done at leading protocol development and delivering reliable software that serves the community.\nWhile its good to have a healthy fear of avoiding another “Core”, Bitcoin ABC actually has been extremely inclusive toward other teams. ABC organizes meetings with other BCH devs (both online and in real life), has created open work groups for various Bitcoin related topics, has invited developers from other groups into their private discussion channels, and has even written code for other teams.\nIt feels that we’re on the right track with decentralizing protocol development, and I expect it will continue to improve over time.\nIn the upcoming conclusion (Part 4), we’ll take a look at mining, development funding, and some big picture solutions.\nWritten by Jonald Fyookball Jonald Fyookball (pseudonym) is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, best known as the project leader of the Electron Cash wallet, and for a series of hard hitting articles on the Bitcoin scaling debate.

Several sources said that number would be \"a good approximation\" - though the price can still be volatile.Interestingly enough, with its reputation unmatched by other firms, Xapo has in effect created something more than just a bitcoin vault. It's essentially the first private bank for rich bitcoiners.Because in addition to its security offerings, Xapo also provides customers with a bitcoin debit card and access to a bitcoin trading desk.Already, the company's holdings - which constitute roughly 7% of the global bitcoin supply - are higher than 98% of the 5,670 banks in the US.\"Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,\" said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. \"You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.\"Founded by Argentine entrepreneur and PayPal board member Wences Casares, who is widely credited with turning the Valley's VC billionaires on to bitcoin, the company has amassed a network of underground vaults, including a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.

Gox isn’t done with bitcoiners just yet. Just as it appeared the world’s most popular cryptocurrency was ready to strike above the stubborn high nine thousands in price, Nobuaki Kobayashi, Tokyo-based, court appointed trustee of the remaining bitcoin to be distributed among creditors, seems ready to flood another 8,000 coins onto a fragile market struggling to recover.\nAlso read: Venezuela’s President Launches Crypto Funded Youth Bank, Encourages Mining Farms Gox Trustee to Flood Market with Over 8,000 Bitcoin\nThe Tweets were unusually sure over the last three weeks. Luminaries who’ve seen it all wistfully claimed that, should the speculative price of bitcoin core (BTC) break above $10,000 again, and this was all but a foregone conclusion in their view, it would be the last time investors would ever see such a low. And then something happened along the way. The hot hand held by BTC enthusiasts was left cold: the price dropped to the low nine thousands. Then it broke below $9,000. It would finally settle very near $8,000 by press time.\nMt. Gox happened, again.\nThe exploded exchange from ancient history by crypto standards, 2014, is rearing its head in the form of trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi. Yet another flood of bitcoin selling appears to be poised, as Blockchain.info shows over 8,000 from the court ordered fund’s cold storage wallets (two) was recently shifted. As watchdog news of coin movement spread, the corresponding bitcoin core (BTC) price plummeted.\nIt is unclear whether Gox coins will be shed through mainstream markets or over-the-counter exchanges. Fear, doubt, uncertainty (FUD) has been heaped on the digital asset in particular this week not only surrounding a potential market dump but also through legacy business media incessantly quoting Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Bill Gates about the supposed inherent ills of crypto. Not First Rodeo\nSomething on the order of 137 thousand bitcoin remain in the Gox trust, according to various sources and wallet monitoring groups. The ecosystem has long accused institutional whales of shorting the market at the expense of overall prices. And as BTC goes, so do, historically, the rest of the cryptocurrency listings across the board.\nNot quite two months ago, Mr. Kobayashi dumped nearly half a billion dollars worth of BTC and bitcoin cash (BCH) onto markets. The response, which the Gox trustee denied, seemed to be an economic law: prices bottomed out under the mere weight of momentary over supply. Mr. Kobayashi insisted his flood back then had been orchestrated through OTC outlets rather than more mainstream markets.\nWhat is highly probable, however, is arbitrage of a sort. Keen OTCers could snap up discounted BTC and BCH, and then promptly unload them onto recognizable exchanges. The rub is always trying to avoid the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc , exuberantly asserting because X happened before Y, it caused Y. But price movement charts are pretty compelling, correlating well between Gox floods and price drops.\nDo you think the Gox trustee’s actions are influencing prices? Let us know in the comments section below.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelas-president-launches-crypto-funded-youth-bank-encourages-mining-farms/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nobuaki kobayashi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto funded youth bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:25:27.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd3e9fe61d669176f23ec9cd1eda04aff49a62f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9V_QWj8UdBdroWTkaxDr0z1ga0RrcXrhn31lYFFv1a3UuC6Oz2hVvGX.AVPmzXwbRuHbeR7bKCGu07bshISPj9LVb3BielDZ79sX3fuN4gg9DNaZ_omUlB8ez2U1s64qArGOIPqM5LlxXEas7t6vqfkNaOh3AhJYb7NcWKEkyc7xldDuOymsqerk0rnH8vBL8-", "site_full": "www.couriermail.com.au", "site": "couriermail.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/economy", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Economy News and Economic Announcements | The Courier Mail", "title": "Bitcoin: Federal Budget 2018 cash ban to affect cryptocurrencies", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Federal Budget 2018 cash ban to affect cryptocurrencies | The Courier-Mail", "published": "2018-05-12T09:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/40d2d125a2c843aafe83982de980f75c", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14432, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 33, "comments": 0, "shares": 33}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd3e9fe61d669176f23ec9cd1eda04aff49a62f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9V_QWj8UdBdroWTkaxDr0z1ga0RrcXrhn31lYFFv1a3UuC6Oz2hVvGX.AVPmzXwbRuHbeR7bKCGu07bshISPj9LVb3BielDZ79sX3fuN4gg9DNaZ_omUlB8ez2U1s64qArGOIPqM5LlxXEas7t6vqfkNaOh3AhJYb7NcWKEkyc7xldDuOymsqerk0rnH8vBL8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jason Murphy, news.com.au", "published": "2018-05-12T09:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Federal Budget 2018 cash ban to affect cryptocurrencies", "text": "Close WTF is Bitcoin? 1:18\nBitcoin is an online currency created from computer code, but how does it work and why do people use it?\nNovember 30th 2017 6 months ago /display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Technology - syndicated/ WTF is Bitcoin? Fed Budget Could ScoMo’s cash ban be just what cryptocurrencies want? Jason Murphy, news.com.au May 13, 2018 1:44am\nTHE Australian Government has made big cash payments illegal, but is it just giving a free kick to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?\nIn Tuesday’s Budget, Treasurer Scott Morrison announced a crackdown on the “black economy”, and a ban on cash payments was the centrepiece . From July 1, 2019, any business transaction over $10,000 has to be done using electronic payments. Handing over a hundred $100 notes or more will be illegal, as the government tries to flush out tax avoiders, drug dealers and the rest of the underground economy.\nBitcoiners and other cryptocurrency fans predicted this, and the government is playing into their greedy little hands.\nGRINDING ON UP\nBitcoin surged to $US20,000 last year and then quickly plunged back down to about $6700. Many thought it would continue back down close to zero. Instead, it has rebounded about 40 per cent in the past month to more than $9000, as this next graph shows.\nmedia_camera The volatile Bitcoin has rebounded in the past month.\nThe recommendation of a ban on cash comes from the government’s Black Economy Task Force. The head of the task force, Michael Andrew, described the reasons people use cash in a recent podcast, giving as an example a shopkeeper who runs two tills, keeping some money out of sight of the taxman.\n“It’s basically paying people cash who want to maintain their welfare, their visa status or avoid their child maintenance,” Mr Andrew said. “That is widespread in certain areas particularly … the services-based economy, security industry, hospitality, cleaning, couriers, personal trainers, hairdressing and nail salons for example.”\nGovernments around the world are interested in cracking down on cash, and not just to get those dodgy nail salons paying tax, but also to kill off terrorist financing, to reduce money laundering, and even to let them reduce interest rates below zero. (If you make interest rates negative, people will just take cash out of the bank, but if you also make cash illegal, that’s not possible.)\nANARCHY IN THE BLOCKCHAIN\nAll these anti-cash trends are giving life to Bitcoin, and other digital currencies that could serve as an alternative to cash. For some people, that’s the whole point of cryptocurrencies. A big part of the early adopters of Bitcoin were people who are deeply worried about government. Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their “I told you so!” moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n“It is not about encouraging a black market economy,” says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n“We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.”\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n“People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you’re creating a cash economy, under the table, can’t be monitored by government. That’s not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.”\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has.

Jason Murphy, news.com.au May 13, 2018 1:44am Share this on Twitter social-twitter_circle Share this by Email social-email_circle\nTHE Australian Government has made big cash payments illegal, but is it just giving a free kick to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?\nIn Tuesday’s Budget, Treasurer Scott Morrison announced a crackdown on the “black economy”, and a ban on cash payments was the centrepiece . From July 1, 2019, any business transaction over $10,000 has to be done using electronic payments. Handing over a hundred $100 notes or more will be illegal, as the government tries to flush out tax avoiders, drug dealers and the rest of the underground economy.\nBitcoiners and other cryptocurrency fans predicted this, and the government is playing into their greedy little hands.\nGRINDING ON UP\nBitcoin surged to $US20,000 last year and then quickly plunged back down to about $6700. Many thought it would continue back down close to zero. Instead, it has rebounded about 40 per cent in the past month to more than $9000, as this next graph shows.\nmedia_camera The volatile Bitcoin has rebounded in the past month.\nThe recommendation of a ban on cash comes from the government’s Black Economy Task Force. The head of the task force, Michael Andrew, described the reasons people use cash in a recent podcast, giving as an example a shopkeeper who runs two tills, keeping some money out of sight of the taxman.\n“It’s basically paying people cash who want to maintain their welfare, their visa status or avoid their child maintenance,” Mr Andrew said. “That is widespread in certain areas particularly … the services-based economy, security industry, hospitality, cleaning, couriers, personal trainers, hairdressing and nail salons for example.”\nGovernments around the world are interested in cracking down on cash, and not just to get those dodgy nail salons paying tax, but also to kill off terrorist financing, to reduce money laundering, and even to let them reduce interest rates below zero. (If you make interest rates negative, people will just take cash out of the bank, but if you also make cash illegal, that’s not possible.)\nANARCHY IN THE BLOCKCHAIN\nAll these anti-cash trends are giving life to Bitcoin, and other digital currencies that could serve as an alternative to cash. For some people, that’s the whole point of cryptocurrencies. A big part of the early adopters of Bitcoin were people who are deeply worried about government. Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their “I told you so!” moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n“It is not about encouraging a black market economy,” says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n“We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.”\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n“People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you’re creating a cash economy, under the table, can’t be monitored by government. That’s not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.”\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has. (“You could be forgiven for thinking that accepting Bitcoin payments is a publicity stunt,” the firm’s website says, insisting it will actually be efficient. However, you can check its Bitcoin address on the Blockchain and see that no customers have paid bitcoin to that address yet).\nThe big risk is when the guy who is installing your new kitchen asks if he can be paid in anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Dash.

An attempt at an early trend bucking move back through to $9,000 levels after an initial dip, saw Bitcoin face strong selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,980, leading to a mid-morning sell-off that saw Bitcoin fall through the day’s first major support level at $8,877.9 and second major support level at $8,745 to morning low $8,510, before hitting an intraday low $8,333.8 in the late afternoon to call on support at the day’s third major support level at $8.354.1. It’s been some time since Bitcoin has called on support at a day’s third major support level, Friday’s losses marking a 5 th day out of the last 6 to be in the red, with Friday’s moves affirming the formation of a near-term bearish trend at 5 th May’s swing hi $9,999, with Friday’s new swing lo $8,333.8. Bad news has been the cause of the broad based market sell-off, with news hitting the wires of South Korea’s largest exchange UPbit being raided doing all the damage and handing the reins over to the Bitcoin bears. The good news for the Bitcoin bulls was that Bitcoin managed to avoid double digit losses seen amongst some of the other major cryptos and, as the case has been in previous raids, a recovery is likely to be on the cards, barring a reversal of the South Korean’s recent announcement that it would look to become more cryptomarket friendly. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 2.05% to $8,239.8, Bitcoin continuing to see lighter losses than its peers, the early fall through to a morning low $8,204.4 holding above the day’s first major support level at $8,158.17. For the day ahead, a move back through to the day’s $8,486.5 high would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $8,842.47, though market sentiment will need to have improved for selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $8,730 to not lead to another reversal that would likely bring the day’s first major support level at $8,158.17 into play. Failure to move back through to the morning’s high and take a run at $8,700 levels will likely see Bitcoin pullback through sub-$8,200 levels to test support at $8,158.17, with Bitcoin’s resilience likely to be tested later in the day should the market panic over the latest crypto exchange raid not abate. Likely updates from the South Korean government at the start of next week should ultimately pin Bitcoin and the broader markets back through the weekend, investors unlikely to be jumping back in on fear that there could be a shift in attitude towards cryptocurrencies. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash was down 6.34%, with Cardano’s ADA sliding 7.15% in what is another day of red for the markets.

2018\nThe cryptocurrency market has continued to fall over the past 24 hours, after seeing a decline of more than $40 billion on May 11. The bitcoin price fell to $8,250 while the majority of tokens recorded losses in the 20 percent range.\nUPbit + Mt. Gox\nOn May 11, CCN reported that UPbit, South Korea’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, was raided and investigated by local police, the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KIU) and Financial Services Commission (FSC).\nThe two-day raid at the UPbit headquarters led local investors in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market to panic sell, eventually affecting the global cryptocurrency market.\nThe UPbit case coincided with the movement of more than 8,000 bitcoins from the Mt. Gox trustee, who previously stated that he will not sell any more of its funds until September of this year. The sudden sale of the Mt. Gox trustee funds and the unexpected investigation into UPbit led the entire cryptocurrency market to demonstrate a daily loss of $30 billion, from $400 billion to $370 billion.\nLast week, the cryptocurrency market peaked at $470 billion, as tokens such as Ziliqa (ZIL) and 0x (ZRX) along with both bitcoin and Ethereum recorded gains in the 5 to 40 percent range. Since then, the cryptocurrency market has recorded a loss of $100 billion, within a seven-day period. The market lost more than 20 percent of its value over the past week.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph young", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean financial intelligence unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial services commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T16:09:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6bfeb778ca927c96a7f5fd3e48320ee649a10b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdT79pWVr05p2.zj2Lbv6m9JnTi5SQqg20wvefZLwU2Ua6bonOjpPjJWpIB48hk1WRmQ--", "site_full": "earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Earn Money", "title": "'BITCOIN' INCOME- LET'S REACH FINANCIAL WEALTH !", "title_full": "'BITCOIN' INCOME- LET'S REACH FINANCIAL WEALTH !", "published": "2018-05-12T08:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6bfeb778ca927c96a7f5fd3e48320ee649a10b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdT79pWVr05p2.zj2Lbv6m9JnTi5SQqg20wvefZLwU2Ua6bonOjpPjJWpIB48hk1WRmQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "earn money (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T08:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "'BITCOIN' INCOME- LET'S REACH FINANCIAL WEALTH !", "text": "Herculist Ad\nThis Herculist ad was brought to you by Smart-list.\nPlease see removal instructiones at the end of this e-mail.\nHello;\nSTART EARNING NOW !\nCLICK> https://www.crypto-builder.com/ref/0206247daa\nCrypto-builder is a simple but powerful Matrix program.\nMatrix 1 (Tortoise) and Matrix 2 (Ambitious) After has been activated.\nEvery member can have only two referrals on their Level 1 but can have as many positions as they want without having to open more than one account.\nThe program has six levels, it is a 2x6 Team Forced Matrix.\nYou pay the US Dollar value of $20/$100 in Bitcoin.

There has been an immediate surge in the demand of the bitcoin due to which many people are inclined to buying it. As per the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathway Inc, Buffett stated that the secret behind the immediate surge of Cryptocurrencies prices is the adrenaline rush that goes inside you when you hear from people about Bitcoin. If you fail in understanding the exact terms of Cryptocurrencies you get overexcited as most of us are often fond of speculation and gambling. He further stated that investors now refrain themselves from buying US stocks as the prices of the stocks increases but after a considerable amount of time. Charlie Munger , business partner of Buffett and also vice chairman of Berkshire stated that even he is one of those who have no interest in Bitcoin and he describes Bitcoin as worthless artificial gold. Buffet also mentioned that last week Berkshire has acquired around 75 million additional Apple Inc Shares in the first quarter. This increased the stake of Berkshire by 5% in the iPhone maker. After this action of Buffett he stated if the share price of Apple would fall due to repurchases then he would be happy enough to see this. Munger further stated Berkshire always have been a little reluctant when it comes to buying the shares of Apple as they have found the price of it quite reasonable though strong. Buffett mentioned that he will soon be retiring from the position of CEO and the entire board of directors of Berkshire were in a dilemma on deciding for who would be the right one to take the place of Chief Executive Officer after Buffett. The list of final CEO for Berkshire does not include many names and they are looking for the right person for this position of CEO as they want someone extremely effective to handle the healthcare venture between Berkshire, JPMogan chase and also www.amazon.com.

It looks as if the crypto currency markets are going to struggle, and we are starting to get very negative technical signals in this market. I think that the next move seems to be lower.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin fell against the US dollar during the week, slicing through the $9000 level, an area that I thought was a bit of a barrier or “zone” that extended down to the $8800 level. Now that we are below there, I think the market unwinds, with an initial target of $8000, perhaps followed by $6000. When you look at the chart, you can see that the highs in this market continue to go lower, and I think that $10,000 has just proven itself to be an even more significant barrier than originally thought. Because of this, it’s obvious that we will continue to struggle in that general vicinity.\nBTC/JPY\nBitcoin has also fallen against the Japanese yen, well below the ¥1 million level. I think that the market is going to test the ¥900,000 level, and then possibly even as low as the ¥700,000 level as it is the bottom of the overall consolidation. Whether we break down below there, I don’t know yet, but I do know that it certainly makes a nice target. I believe that the markets continue to punish Bitcoin, with the ¥700,000 level being massive support. If we were to break down below that level, things could get ugly, especially if we break through the “zone” that extends down to the 600,000 level. In fact, if we break down below there I think we are looking at a multi-year bear market. The alternate scenario is that we turn around and break above the ¥1.1 million level, but that doesn’t look likely right now.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al zibluk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:23:50.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4321a355b3b214aa9d9b3656a664f27c9d4df2f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQbjtDI77B9rfisY1JmBnSg9bPozJx31mFpLbaaLuZkkdqkUfXZy81X.2vY5fGXfOpp42Crkb_pTT.WzTZZ5KpLf8JLpObcqGbYyI3rs2RtWU-", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Vad är bitcoin – bitcoin explained and made simple | guardian animations", "title_full": "Vad är bitcoin – bitcoin explained and made simple | guardian animations", "published": "2018-05-12T08:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hqdefault-853.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4321a355b3b214aa9d9b3656a664f27c9d4df2f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQbjtDI77B9rfisY1JmBnSg9bPozJx31mFpLbaaLuZkkdqkUfXZy81X.2vY5fGXfOpp42Crkb_pTT.WzTZZ5KpLf8JLpObcqGbYyI3rs2RtWU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Canadian Stock Trader", "published": "2018-05-12T08:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vad är bitcoin – bitcoin explained and made simple | guardian animations", "text": "You can try here – http://trade25.net (risk warning: your capital might be at risk) Vad är bitcoin – bitcoin explained and made simple | guardian animations Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T08:55:27.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "92748f174e2414b33116cf76ebc8086526a1f044", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStMGcM3ZV4rV9gXYoKqZ1vCPOr0WYuZBAZuGEzE.zdT6MqIDOUmK.208skDWNCDBmEcjz_idHUKGZq_btKvCcXVSrHB50ePukT12INBBRbAw--", "site_full": "earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://earnmoney4ya.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Earn Money", "title": "Affiliates Wanted!

Finance in an interview . Bitcoin Will Go To $30k… Soon?\nKeiser met Munger’s words on par, telling viewers the 94-year-old “would have the pleasure of watching Bitcoin soar past $30,000 per coin as he expires from this planet.”\nWhile not guessing at when exactly Bitcoin’s implied jump to $30,000 would take place, Keiser has not been shy about his predictions for the cryptocurrency’s future.\nIn an interview with Bitcoinist last month, while also keeping quiet on timeframes, the figure of $100,000 came easily.\n“My only Bitcoin prediction is that the price will top $100,000. As far as timing, extrapolate from current trends and you get a sense of when,” he said.\nSimilar optimism has since surfaced from other regular Bitcoin bulls including Tom Lee, whose company Fundstrat Global Advisors this week produced research concluding mining trends will send BTC/USD to $36,000 by the end of 2019.\nWhat do you think about Max Keiser’s reposte to Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger?

Gox Bitcoin (BTC) Dump Occurring Atop Upbit News May 12, 2018 409\nAnother theory has been postulated by CCN.com with regards to the current loss of over $50 Billion in market capitalization in the entire crypto market. Less than 24 hours ago, the total market cap was sitting comfortably at levels of $440 Billion but now that figure has dropped to levels of $389 Billion at the moment of writing this. This has in-turn affected all the values of the coins and tokens in the markets with the top coins not being immune to the dip. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Tron (TRX) and other top coins have been affected with most showing decreased price values of between 7% to 25% in the last 24 hours.\nWith regards to the Mt. Gox possible dump of over 8,200 BTC as reported by CCN.com , there are four alleged wallets of the Mt. Gox trustee that have moved around 2,000 BTC each. They have sent over 8,000 BTC in total in the past 24 hours. The Mt. Gox trustee had been ordered by Japanese authorities to sell off over 200,000 BTC and convert to Japanese Yen in a bid to reimburse creditors. This means that if the transactions are confirmed, the BTC funds are most likely being sold on cryptocurrency exchanges.\nBack in March, another selloff was orchestrated by Mt. Gox as they set out to reimburse the same Mt. Gox’s creditors. Being the trustee, Noboaki Kobayashi had this to say about the sell-off back in March:\n“I made efforts to sell BTC and BCC at as high a price as possible in light of the market price of BTC and BCC at the timing of the sale. I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC”\nWhen you add the Upbit news of South Korean officials raiding their headquarters and taking away books and hard-drives for audit purposes, you get the feeling that today was perhaps a not so good day in the Crypto-verse. The exchange is being accused of actually trading without having the actual cryptocurrencies at hand. Everything has been doctored and traders are not aware. What the exchange has been accused of doing, is carrying out fake balance sheets to deceive traders and investors.\nMany traders have probably withdrawn their funds from the exchange in a panic causing the current market dip.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

There's highs and lows. That can be frustrating, but it can also be fun. You can check out for a while, a few months, and come back to it and see where things are. Price changes, new developments, etc.\nIt's exciting to be a part of something that will change the financial system in this world. Now, it's still possible that the financial system changes without bitcoin, banks are capable of creating a copycat product, but if nothing else Satoshi (and us for our involvement and support) have made the financial system and payments market more competitive and that in itself helps consumers.\nQuote: from: European Central Bank on May 11, 2018, 10:26:01 PM for myself it has certainly made my life very different, but i can't say it's made it happier, and probably a bunch less happy. if it isn't personal stress then involvement exposes you to the worst of human nature over and over again and it's impossible to avoid. even when it doesn't personally affect you, you can watch it affecting other people in real time.\nWhat's caused you so much stress? Did you buy in late 2017 have been suffering through the lull? Talking to us about it might make you feel better.\nBitcoin can make money and teach you in many things like trading, about Bitcoin, how to avoid scams and so on. It is exciting in part of gaining money or profit but i can't or we can't say that it made us happier because Bitcoin has a long journey and way to earn a lot of money and become a successful person in the world.

Touting new partnerships and making solid headlines, this blockchain gaming platform and associated cryptocurrency are looking to regain lost ground after the huge drop felt by the entire market over the past months. While Bitcoin (BTC) slows down after testing $10k in the last week, Enjin Coin (ENJ) is revving up, to the delight of gamers of hodlers worldwide.\nEnjin, the gaming platform known for their innovative platform allowing developers to mint their own crypto using Enjin Coin (ENJ) as a parent currency, has been back in the headlines recently with news of a partnership with Unity Technologies. Unity is, of course, the world’s most popular real-time development platform. The news has sent Enjin Coin (ENJ) soaring recently, and it couldn’t have come at a better time. The consistent spike in price since the announcement continues to give the team some well-deserved attention as Bitcoin (BTC) and a number of rival blockchain-gaming companies fall back.\nThe coin now sits near $.16, well below the market peak nearing $.50 last January. Still, the recent developments are spurring new investment in this up-and-coming crypto-company, giving hope to a potential future where the coin can again challenge its previous all-time highs. There are over 750 Million coins circulating now, and with the recent price increase, Enjin Coin (ENJ) ranks in the top 150 cryptocurrencies on the market.\nEnjin is by far the largest of the available social gaming-website platforms available. With nineteen million gamers attracted to their site, and hosting over 250,000 gaming communities, it is no wonder that partnerships keep lining up for this soon-to-be giant in the crypto-universe. Their customize-able cryptocurrency is now trading on nine exchanges, reaching worldwide markets through the likes of Binance, Okex, HitBTC and more.\nThe team made a recent appearance at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, known as E3. The premier trade event for the video game industry, E3 continues to grow with users and an excited audience dedicated to gaming. With the industry’s top professionals gathering to give presentations to over 68,000 attendees, Enjin (ENJ) was able to capitalize on their Unity partnership, connecting with executives and gamers alike at the expo.\nA favorite in the blockchain gaming industry, Enjin and it’s associated cryptocurrency, Enjin Coin (ENJ), are likely just getting started as the team seeks to hold and add to gains for the remainder of the year.

NEO went from $44.62 to a $92.63. EOS has surged from $4.01 to its recent high of $21.13! […] I have written frequently about these super coins. They are truly worthy of your investment dollars.\nNo Time for Losers The analysts at Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings are bullish on every altcoin in the market, of course. In fact, they're particularly bearish when it comes to forks.\nIn addition to calling Bitcoin Cash (BCH) intellectually dishonest and Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, and Bitcoin God seriously flawed, Weiss added a new set of borderline scamcoins to its list of cryptocurrencies to avoid.\nFirst up is ZClassic, which Weiss says is nothing more than a cheap copycat from \"serial coin imitator\" Everett Forth, also known as Rhett Creighton. Explains Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings:\nFirst, he grabs the innovative genius from ZCash by copying their code. Second, he (with his team) cooks up a rationale for making a minor change: He argues ZCash developers have created an annoying \"miner tax,\" which collects money from coin miners to fund work by developers. And he bashes the implied centralization. Next, he deletes that one small piece of the code; touts his project as more decentralized; boasts he's taking the higher moral ground; and positions his project as \"truer to the core philosophy of cryptocurrencies.\" His real agenda: To cash in on the innovations made by the ZCash team and disguise the fact that his work is just a cheap imitation.\nAlongside ZClassic comes Bitcoin Private, which Weiss sees as just another copycat from Creighton:\nApparently, copying ZCash isn't quite enough. So the serial coin imitator makes a new announcement: He and his team are forking ZClassic itself into another coin named Bitcoin Private. And get this: The reason for the fork is that they want to introduce a \"voluntary miner contribution\" program to their original ZClassic. The say it's different. But it means they're essentially adding back the same \"miner tax\" they had previously deleted. Now, Bitcoin Private is truly identical to the original ZCash, except for meaningless differences. The only noteworthy change is the branding. They figure going back to the tried-and-tested name \"Bitcoin\" will earn them more visibility.\nFinally, Weiss cautions investors away from what is likely Creighton's next cryptocurrency project, Bitcoin Prime. Writes the rating agency:\nAfter misleading investors by creating Bitcoin Private, building some hype around it, and making some big money in the process, the serial coin imitator is not giving up. Based on one of his recent Tweets, it looks like he wants to grab the code of a nearly dead cryptocurrency called PrimeCoin, fork it into a new one he calls \"Bitcoin Prime,\" and start the game all over again.\nWeiss sums up their analysis with three (self-promoting) rules, which some may consider wise:\nRule #1. Focus your investment dollars on the coins at the top of our list, meriting a grade of B- or better.\nRule #2. Avoid — or promptly get rid of — any coins you may have that merit ratings of D+ or lower, like Bitcoin Gold (D), DigiByte (D+), Electroneum (E), Nebulas Token (D+) or ReddCoin (D+).\nRule #3. Don't touch the cheap imitation coins with a 10-foot pole. We don't even bother to rate them.\nWhat do you think of Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings' dismissal of ZClassic, Bitcoin Private, and Bitcoin Prime? Do you agree that such forks should be avoided at all costs?

Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker. In the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold? Two Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady. ‘Patient Zero’ Even in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable — amounting to about 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 percent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states. The outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares — a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin — has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares. “Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.” Xapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffmanand former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft. The first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key — the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar. The most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense. Trading Desk Xapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards. “They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partnersled a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.” At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it. Casares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews. Yet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock. Such salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault. “Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.” Xapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds. ‘Tidal Wave’ The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound. “A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said. Casares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth. That drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 percent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin. “I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc. ‘High Hurdle’ Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies. Other purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer. Xapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too. “It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg.com", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T08:18:16.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53d90e40a466c5f2e425736cdb5fcb2f3587b73e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRZtnDtRrmxo3xLmB1kP8Ug-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "why do you take payments in bitcoins?", "title_full": "why do you take payments in bitcoins?", "published": "2018-05-12T08:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53d90e40a466c5f2e425736cdb5fcb2f3587b73e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRZtnDtRrmxo3xLmB1kP8Ug-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "hoavantathan", "published": "2018-05-12T08:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "why do you take payments in bitcoins?", "text": "Because goverment can not track you.

You should have messaged me after sending the payment or at least indicated that it had been sent in this thread; I didn't even notice the payment until reading this message. I'm assuming that this transaction of 0.0020834 BTC was the payment that you sent to me?\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/5213b7d32f9ae2c4fe47c4b512db0a48a9ce6872e26c01fa6f5332101c89a906\nI don't know how much of that you want me to test; or if any of that is supposed to be a reward... Given that your minimum mix is 0.002 BTC , there doesn't seem to be any incentive or reward for me using this service? I might as well mix my own preferred amount instead...\nEDIT:\nI just submitted an order to mix 0.005 BTC with a service fee of 0.3%, delay of 4 hours, and tx fee of 0.00001 BTC .\nHere's some initial feedback while I wait to receive my tumbled coins back:\nThe \"?\" button next to the \"Delay\" does nothing. I want to know when the delay starts; after confirmation of my transaction or after I submit my order? I have no idea what \" Txfee x. BTC for receive address \" means. Does this mean that the receiving address receives a payment of this fee? The \"for\" is the tricky word in this statement. On the payment screen, it shows \" Your personal fee is 0.3% + 0.00001 BTC for every forward address \". This is a little confusing, as I have no idea what my personal fee is/was when submitting my order. You should change this verbiage to match the verbiage of the order page, as follows: \" You have chosen to pay a service fee of 0.3% and a transaction fee of 0.00001 BTC (for each receiving address)\". The \"?\" next to the Client Code (on the confirmation page) does nothing. What is the client code? The Letter of Guarantee states the following: \"This service will only be available for all coins sent between 12.05.2018 00:29:22 UTC and 13.05.2018 00:29:22 UTC with a minimum incoming amount of 0.002 BTC and a maximum amount of 0.22757536 BTC.\" Does this mean that if I send subsequent deposits until 24 hours from now, that they will all be returned to my receiving address that I indicated? Will they be returned in 4 hour intervals, or in bulk? This could be better specified... My transaction has confirmed, but the \"Transaction txid(s):\" section is still blank, even after refresh. Is this where the transaction for my returned bitcoin will be displayed?\nI'll provide more feedback once this order is fulfilled in 4 hours.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blockchain.info/tx/5213b7d32f9ae2c4fe47c4b512db0a48a9ce6872e26c01fa6f5332101c89a906"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T05:13:41.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c64cf2a254eac39f8bb1ce34a73bd1457d4cd8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhDXJWh8Qf0M5zokZ9pVLyIM-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-12T08:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c64cf2a254eac39f8bb1ce34a73bd1457d4cd8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhDXJWh8Qf0M5zokZ9pVLyIM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T08:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 12, 2018 NEWS Tech compnay brings Bitcoin ATMs to Fresno KFSN-TV What some might call the future of currency is sitting in the corner of this CellPros shop in Northwest Fresno on Ashlen Avenue-- a Bitcoin ATM.

But what happens when you lose a digital wallet? As a matter of fact, what happens if it’s a password to a wallet that has maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin? This is not a hypothetical question. It actually happened to someone last year. Daniel Rodriguez is the CEO of Animusoft. He is also the CTO of a company called BILLSHARK. In 2017, rodriguez suddenly realised that he had not only lost his digital wallet, but had also forgotten the password. Unfortunately, Rodriguez had Bitcoin worth millions of dollars in the lost wallet. Despite being a tech expert, all his hard-mined money was gone in a flash. What would you do if you were in this type of situation? The problem is, if you lose a digital wallet, it often cannot be recovered. Thankfully, if you only forget the password, there are several ways to recover it. As a matter of fact, if you have only lost the password to a computer that you are using for Bitcoin mining, then it is much easier to get in. In this piece, we’ll talk about a couple of ways to reset or crack your Bitcoin mining computer’s password. Free Tools There are several free software utilities that you can use to crack a computer password. However, not all of them are reliable or even safe to use. When reviewing such freeware, it is important to check feedback from other users. You also need to check when the software was last updated; you don’t want an old piece of software that might open itself up to potential malware attacks or anything like that. Ophcrack is of the best free applications available to reset a Windows computer’s password. However, there are some limitations to using this application. For example if your PC has only one user account and that is the password you have forgotten, then your entire PC is locked. Ophcrack does have a solution for this, though; it offers a solution in the form of what is known as a Live CD. It is basically a disc image that you can burn onto a CD, which you then used to reboot your PC and regain access to your account. You can also burn the media to a USB drive. If you choose to go with freeware, then please follow the advice in this section. You are still proceeding at your own risk, but if you do the research you can effectively reduce the magnitude of that risk. Premium Solutions There are also several premium solutions that you can use to unlock your Windows PC. Some of them use different types of attack methods like Brute Force to reset your user or admin password. Others, like the widely trusted PassMoz LabWin , can be used to create bootable media on another Windows machine that you can then utilize to unlock your Bitcoin mining PC. Such premium software applications can be a godsend, especially if you have a significant amount of digital coinage stored on a particular Windows machine. Most of these cost far less than $100, and when you compare that cost with your potential earnings doing Bitcoin mining, most of the time that decision is a no-brainer. Most important, the process is quite easy. You can check the online user guide from its official website. While it is true that free utilities can be tempting, it is equally true that you may not get the same kind of performance or results that you would get with premium software. In addition, the risk of data being deleted or corrupted is quite high. With premium utilities, you get several other advantages such as technical support, regular security updates, guaranteed results and so much more. The choice is ultimately yours, but let it not end up as a case of “penny wise and pound foolish”. You don’t want this to become one of your “I should have…” stories you tell your grandkids!

The exchange known as UPbit—South Korea’s largest crypto platform—has been accused of selling cryptocurrency it doesn’t hold, according to local news outlet Chosun. “We have secured hard disks and accounting books through confiscation.\nAnalysis is expected to take days,” local authorities said, according to a translated version of the Chosun report.
