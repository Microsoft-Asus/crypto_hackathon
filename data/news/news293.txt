Last month, as the Bitcoin won after the recovery from this year’s market crash, he announced that his forecast for Bitcoin is to the end of the year in the $ 25,000 – an increase of 184% compared to Bitcoins current price of $ 8.900.\n“We are still quite confident that the investment in Bitcoin ratio-is a good risk-reward and we believe that it could reach to the end of the year $ 25,000 in … It is overdue. Bitcoin was incredibly oversold.“\nLee explained that the reason for this price increase to the end of the tax season and refunds of these would invest in crypto-currencies. The forecast is based on new Bitcoin Mining white paper\nAccording to AMBCrypto Lee’s new forecast is based on the new Bitcoin Mining white paper, which of the Fund, joined the Quant was published.\nIn the paper, it was found that the Bitcoin Mining Economy is the main factor in the price of Bitcoin. The paper establishes that the multiplication of Bitcoin’s price, as well as the costs facing mining companies, represented as P/BE , as a reliable long-term support level for the Bitcoin price have proven. Therefore, the growing Bitcoin-Mining-infrastructure should support “the increase in the value of Bitcoin”.\nOn the basis of this argument, the prediction of a Bitcoin price, which corresponds approximately to the value of 36000 USD appears to be, based on the historical average of 1.8 for the P/B value, to be reasonable, because the Mining industry is likely to increase in the near future.\nThe increased Mining efficiency, which is introduced by the introduction of new Hardware, could invalidate Fund strate calculations. This is because the discounted cost of electricity per geschürftem Bitcoin could change the P/BE-value.\nNevertheless, we can be sure of one thing – the increasing mining difficulty will be great to join encourage-scale operations, which have enough Hash Power to actually make a Profit, while smaller Miner Mining will be compelled Pools, in order to keep above water.

Not to do so, he told CNN , is “almost irresponsible.” Crypto To Disrupt Every Vertical On Wednesday, Novogratz’s firm and Bloomberg launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, an index that tracks 10 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and Ethereum. Investing in cryptocurrency is important not on account of expected gains, Novogratz said, but because in two to four years blockchain technology, which allows companies to make and record near instant transactions, will be challenging every vertical. While the decentralized version of Uber may not be Uber, it will be a challenge and it constitutes a “real value proposition,” he said. Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs partner, said he has invested 10% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies. Traditional Institutions Testing The Waters The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is reportedly considering launching a cryptocurrency exchange. | Source: Shutterstock\nMainstream financial institutions, meanwhile, are finding ways to allow traditional investors to benefit from bitcoin. Nasdaq in April signed an agreement with Gemini Trust, a cryptocurrency exchange. One unknown, however, is how governments will regulate cryptocurrency. Novogratz predicted the New York Stock Exchange will be active in cryptocurrency trading in less than six months. Not everyone on Wall Street agrees with Novogratz. Warren Buffett, an investment icon, has been bearish on bitcoin, having most recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway ’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. Novogratz said the difference in opinion is age-related, with older players much more skeptical about cryptocurrency. Galaxy Digital Moves Forward Galaxy Digital, meanwhile, has announced plans to buy Canadian startup First Coin Capital and then merge with Bradmer Pharmaceuticals — which is publicly listed on the Toronto-based TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) — through a reverse takeover. Following the merger, Bradmer will be renamed to Galaxy Digital, allowing the company to trade publicly without having to undergo traditional financial disclosures associated with listing on an exchange. Galaxy Digital’s cryptocurrency merchant bank — which Novogratz reportedly hopes to make the “Goldman Sachs of Crypto” — will have a fourfold business model, according to public statements made by the firm. The bank will open a cryptocurrency trading desk and initially seek to capitalize on opportunities for cross-exchange arbitrage. It will also invest in blockchain startups and ICOs, much as Novogratz intended to do through his now-shelved cryptocurrency hedge fund. Finally, it will provide advisory and asset management services to wealthy clients.

Segwit and P2SH addresses are not the same.\nP2PKH and P2SH addresses are generated in a similar way. P2PKH takes the hash160 of a public key (RIPMED160 of the SHA256 of the public key), appends the version byte of 0x00 to the hash160, and Base58 Check encodes it.\nP2SH addresses are the Base58 Check encoding of the hash160 of a script (known as the redeemScript). It uses a version byte of 0x05 instead. The rest of the encoding is the same, just Base58 Check encoding.\nFor Segwit addresses, there are multiple types. There are native segwit addresses which follow the Bech32 standard. There are also P2SH wrapped segwit addresses.\nFor a P2WPKH (pay to witness pubkey hash) wrapped in a P2SH address, the redeemScript is 0x0014 <hash 160 of the pubkey> . That redeemScript is hashed and encoded in the typical P2SH way.\nFor a P2WSH (pay to witness script hash) wrapped in a P2SH address, the witnessScript (redeemScript but for segwit addresses) is first hashed with SHA256. Then the P2SH redeemScript is 0x0020 <SHA256 of witnessScript> . The hash160 of this redeemScript is then encoded in the typical P2SH way.\nAs for your code, you are appending 0x04 to your public key which is simply incorrect. The 0x04 is not part of the address encoding, it is part of the public key encoding itself. Your public key generator should already be doing this for you. Note that if the public key is compressed that the prefix byte will be either 0x02 or 0x03 (depends on the Y value of the public key) instead of 0x04 which is for uncompressed public keys.\n[Technical difference - Example solution]\n` def hash160(self, v): r = hashlib.new('ripemd160') r.update(hashlib.sha256(v).digest()) return r def doublehash256(self, v): return hashlib.sha256(hashlib.sha256(v).digest()) def ecdsaSECP256k1(self, digest): # SECP256k1 - Bitcoin elliptic curve sk = ecdsa.SigningKey.from_string(digest, curve=ecdsa.SECP256k1) return sk.get_verifying_key() def publicaddress1(self): prefix_a = b'\\x04' prefix_b = b'\\x00' digest = self.privkeyhex.digest() p = prefix_a + self.ecdsaSECP256k1(digest).to_string() # 1 + 32 bytes + 32 bytes self.pubkey = str(binascii.hexlify(p).decode('utf-8')) hash160 = self.hash160(p) m = prefix_b + hash160.digest() checksum = self.doublehash256(m).digest()[:4] self.pubaddr1 = base58.b58encode(m + checksum) def publicaddress3(self): prefix_even = b'\\x02' prefix_odd = b'\\x03' prefix_a = prefix_odd prefix_b = b'\\x05' prefix_redeem = b'\\x00\\x14' digest = self.privkeyhex.digest() ecdsa_digest = self.ecdsaSECP256k1(digest).to_string() x_coord = ecdsa_digest[:int(len(ecdsa_digest)/2)] y_coord = ecdsa_digest[int(len(ecdsa_digest)/2):] if (int(binascii.hexlify(y_coord),16) % 2 == 0): prefix_a = prefix_even p = prefix_a + x_coord self.pubkeycompressed = str(binascii.hexlify(p).decode('utf-8')) redeem_script = self.hash160(prefix_redeem + self.hash160(p).digest()).digest() # 20 bytes m = prefix_b + redeem_script checksum = self.doublehash256(m).digest()[:4] self.pubaddr3 = base58.b58encode(m + checksum)`", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://segwitaddress.org/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T15:37:05.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a517d4797ae96d0d255bc6405b2d9492ded5dad9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYx8VCuWfEdBsoC8qPO8V_UPOHJY0Ql9Mu8SRxQnh3asr5UfpZQp81QkD7LgE15RoxQ--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Largest Ever Bitcoin Short Trade ($119 Million) Closes on OKEx", "title_full": "Largest Ever Bitcoin Short Trade ($119 Million) Closes on OKEx", "published": "2018-05-12T14:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a517d4797ae96d0d255bc6405b2d9492ded5dad9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYx8VCuWfEdBsoC8qPO8V_UPOHJY0Ql9Mu8SRxQnh3asr5UfpZQp81QkD7LgE15RoxQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T14:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Largest Ever Bitcoin Short Trade ($119 Million) Closes on OKEx", "text": "In the current gradual climb in the price of bitcoin , a trader has exited a short position worth a blistering $119 million. As bitcoin slowly regains both respectability and value with almost genteel trading over the last few weeks, previous short positions are evaporating. Although the price rise has been gradual, it was enough for the holder of a massive short position to have to cash in.\nA short position is a common trading ploy, and virtual coins and virtual exchanges are not exempt from the tactic. In essence, \"shorting\" involves betting on a price dipping and thus borrowing stock of whatever nature (in this case bitcoin ) and replacing it later for cheaper, after that price tumble. The short position never has to outlay buying capital as the assets are borrowed, but can score handsomely when their replacement value dips by pocketing the difference.\nThe Risks of Short Selling The margins and futures market is risky because there are other considerations to any short position. The owner may call the deal at any point, and in the worst case scenario, prices actually go up, not down, and the short position holder then is obliged to replace the borrowed goods at whatever current market value might be, even at a personal loss.\nSource: BTCVIX Twitter\nThe OKEx exchange was launched by OKCoin and has maintained a clean bill of health, in spite of rumors that forced it to halt trading on occasion.\nThe top-listed short spot on OKEx has now bailed on any further HODL strategies and exited the position, possibly losing substantially.\nTrader, in this case, would have lost $1.9 million if leverage was 100x or $19 million if leverage was 10x. In either case, that's a lot of money to lose.\nThe second weightiest short position on OKEx was worth $73 million and has also closed with bitcoin now hovering around the $10,000 mark. In the far more volatile altcoin market, short positions become even riskier than they typically are in other markets. Shorting sees a trader borrow bitcoin at, say, $8,000 in the anticipation that it will still plummet to $4,000 in value.\nThe trader sells the bitcoin immediately at the prevailing price, even though it is borrowed, and waits for the price to plummet. Once the price has dipped substantially, from the proceeds of the original sale, the trader will buy and replace the borrowed bitcoin and declare a profit of whatever is left, as a difference between what they made selling borrowed goods and what they spent replacing them.\nWill Hong Kong Rival Pamplona With a Bull Run? In the example above, it's easy to see that the short seller's theory held and the value plummeted to $4,000, they would have made $4,000 when they sold at that predicted point. Conversely, had the market moved against short positions, and the price rose to anything from $8,001 and up, the short position trader would have immediately started losing.\nWith such massive figures, there has been speculation that some of the players in the deal were institutional. That remains unclear, but it has been noted that in spite of the weight of the two largest shorts, demand is rising and moving against the doomsayers. Managing to largely avoid extreme volatility and without much of the fanfare of 2017, bitcoin is rising in value. That the bitcoin price rode roughshod through the heavy shorts could be indicative of a bullish sentiment forming. The price of bitcoin is currently trading at $9,502.\nThe post Largest Ever Bitcoin Short Trade ($119 Million) Closes on OKEx appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:15:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "748c131f2eaa79d7f0d552ab355cb5e78346b369", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDI_l18ooMn4PlxEokNm2TPii9j3xQbKzwMZt2CbEL53c9McYaVL2Z6c_obcA_m4F", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Financial news and views", "title": "bitcoin news", "title_full": "bitcoin news : finance", "published": "2018-05-12T14:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.505, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "748c131f2eaa79d7f0d552ab355cb5e78346b369", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDI_l18ooMn4PlxEokNm2TPii9j3xQbKzwMZt2CbEL53c9McYaVL2Z6c_obcA_m4F", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emrenas", "published": "2018-05-12T14:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin news", "text": "submitted by /u/Emrenas\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://cryptogod.site/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:30:23.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31ce8b85765e88cc79e07c03692fe3785f404516", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYDdBlbUR0Ik2mbW38U.TCd6vh63gEfsoET7AFYzoo6QY42XyP38WLfGywWukHk816SDeaTi7M4hYA--", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 12/05/18", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 12/05/18", "published": "2018-05-12T14:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eiFkrew3fA_pQ2jxGwVYng--~B/aD00MTY7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/ac1dddcb9146726ec2964abcb486688c", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 12, "comments": 0, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31ce8b85765e88cc79e07c03692fe3785f404516", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYk1t8McosAxYDdBlbUR0Ik2mbW38U.TCd6vh63gEfsoET7AFYzoo6QY42XyP38WLfGywWukHk816SDeaTi7M4hYA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Empire", "published": "2018-05-12T14:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 12/05/18", "text": "Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 12/05/18 Bob Mason Reblog Bitcoin Cash Bears Reign Bitcoin Cash slumped 10.19% on Friday, following on from Thursday’s 6.94% slide, to end the day at $1,366.4. A morning rise through to an intraday high $1,556 fell well short of the day’s first major resistance level at $1,626.8, with selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,550 taking its toll through the late morning, Bitcoin Cash sliding through to an intraday low and new swing lo $1,300.1. The slide took Bitcoin Cash through the day’s first major support level at $1,453.8 and second major support level at $1,393.4 with ease before psychological level support at $1,300 kicked in to stave off bigger losses. The moves through the day reaffirmed the near-term bearish trend formation, with Bitcoin Cash closing at $1,300 levels for the first time since 2 nd May. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 0.85% to $1,357, a start of the day move through to a morning high $1,426 left the day’s first major resistance level at $1,515.9 untested, while sellers came forward once more as Bitcoin Cash came within reach of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,430 to pin Bitcoin Cash back early on, falling through to a morning low $1,331. Failure to move back through to $1,400 levels early will likely see more material declines, support levels proving to be of little comfort for investors who continue to pull out in fear of another tumble back to sub-$1,000 levels. We’ve yet to see the day’s first major support level at $1,259 be tested, but should sentiment not shift in the early part of the morning, sub-$1,300 levels are on the cards in the day. A move through to $1,400 levels would support another run at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,430, with sentiment across the broader market to dictate whether Bitcoin Cash can break out and take a run at the $1,500 levels. It’s looking bearish for now and going in at current levels would need some tight stop losses to prevent exposure to another sell-off. BCH/USD 12/05/18 Hourly Chart Get Into Bitcoin Cash Trading Today Litecoin back in the $130s Litecoin tumbled 8.04% on Friday, adding on to Thursday’s 5.36% slide, to end the day at $136.5, Friday’s fall marking a 6 th consecutive day of declines. It was downhill all the way for Litecoin, falling through the day’s first major support level at $144.14 in the early morning before a slide through the day’s second major support level at $133.52 to an intraday low and new swing lo $133.52. The day’s high $148.5 left key resistance levels untested through the day, the moves through to the new swing lo $133.52 affirming the bearish trend reversal formed at 5 th May’s swing hi 182.35. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 0.96% to $135.2, with an early move through to a morning high $139.2 falling short of the day’s first major resistance level at $145.49 and 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $145. Litecoin’s slide resumed through the early morning, falling to a morning low $133.63, with the bearish trend reflected across the broader market. For the day ahead, a move back through to the morning’s $139.2 high would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $145.49, though for Litecoin to hold on to any gains and avoid selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $145, sentiment across the market will need to improve, Litecoin unlikely to be able to go it alone. Story Continues Failure to move back through to $139 levels would support a continued sell-off in what could be 7 out of 7 for Litecoin this week, Litecoin having already coughed up 20% by the end of Friday. The day’s first major support level at $130.51 is certainly in play today, with any pullback through to sub-$130 levels bringing sub-$100 levels into play, investors likely to jump ship should Litecoin give up more ground. For the bolder investor, current levels are certainly attractive when looking at historical levels, but when factoring in the uncertainty over the regulatory outlook and classification of Litecoin, things could get worse before they improve. LTC/USD 12/05/18 Hourly Chart Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly Ripple sees threat turn reality and hits the $0.60s Ripple’s XRP slid 10.14% on Friday, following Thursday’s 6% slide, to end the day at $0.67468, Ripple XRP’s first visit to $0.60 levels since 20 th April. Friday’s fall also marked a 6 th consecutive day in the red, Ripple’s XRP joining the broader market in a mass sell-off that saw Ripple’s XRP form a bearish trend at 24 th April’s swing hi $0.96837, with a failure to break through to a fresh swing hi in early May weighing more heavily on Ripple’s XRP. Friday’s slide to an intraday low and new swing lo $0.64641 saw Ripple’s XRP slide through the day’s first major support level at $0.7258 and second major support level at $0.7051 before finding support at the third major support level at $0.6442. The moves through Friday affirmed the bullish trend reversal that will likely continue to weigh on sentiment through the weekend and the early part of next week. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down 3.87% to $0.6538, with an early move through to a morning high $0.69556 failing to break through to $0.70 levels to test selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.7224 and the day’s first major resistance level at $0.7389. A mid-morning slide saw Ripple’s XRP fall through to a morning low $0.65195, Friday’s sell-off resuming as investors continue to pull out, the early moves providing little evidence of a bearish trend reversal. For the day ahead, a move through to $0.70 levels would provide some confidence, with buying appetite likely to build on any break out from the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.7224, though the negative market sentiment will likely continue to pin back Ripple’s XRP through the remainder of the morning, bringing the day’s first major support level at $0.6284 into play. We would expect Ripple’s XRP to avoid sub-$0.60 levels today, with some support likely to kick in at $0.60, though caution would be needed at the $0.60 psychological support level, the market’s negative sentiment capable of pulling Ripple’s XRP back through to test the second major support level at $0.5822. It’s been a bad week and it’s unlikely to get much better, as Ripple’s XRP sees its April gains unravel.

The bitcoins were recovered from the Binance wallet of Kirit Paladiya, the mastermind behind the crime, on Wednesday.\nThe cryptocurrency worth Rs 7.2 crore was recovered on Wednesday. Since this is the first time that the officials have seized bitcoins, they are still in the process of figuring out a way to freeze the assets. Sources told DNA that the CID is looking at three options to do the same.\nThey can either freeze the bitcoins in the Binance wallet by contacting the company, or transfer them to a government wallet, or sell the bitcoins and confiscate the money from the sale. \"Mostly they are going to freeze the coins by contacting the company as we have come to know that it can be done,\" a senior CID official told the newspaper.\nAshish Bhatia, DGP, CID (Crime) said: \"Right now, in the bitcoin matter, we are trying to follow the process of freezing the bitcoins which were seized from Kirit Paladiya by us.\" Paladiya was arrested on May 4. A sessions court bench on Thursday extended his remand by two more days on request from the CID.\nBJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya still untraceable. Investigators reached ruling party MLA Nalin Kotadiya's house in Amreli on Friday, but he was not there. He is still untraceable but the police has taken his wife's statement.\nOn Monday, Kotadiya released a press note, stating that he was innocent and was being framed in the bitcoin case. He even alleged that in February, Surat-based builder Shailesh Bhatt had abducted Piyush Savaliya and Dhaval Malvani and extorted 2,300 bitcoins from them.\nOn Wednesday, Kotadiya faxed a letter to CID (Crime), stating he has been out of station for some personal work, and hence skipped the two summons. He even asked the CID officials to give him time, claiming that he will reach the CID office by May 11 or 12.\nFLASHBACK The cryptocurrency worth Rs 7.2 crore was recovered on Wednesday.

Highlights Bitbond allows to transfer loans anywhere in the world Digital currencies are held shortly to avoid the currency fluctuations Loans are relatively small and don't exceed $50,000 German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin. Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\"Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,\" Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin's fashionable neighbourhood Prenzlauer Berg. \"With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"Clients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates. Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.Albrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.Most clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says.

Xapo has established a network of underground Cold Storage vaults, and specialized to store large amounts of Bitcoin.\nCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg would like to have the above-mentioned Figures. According to two customers of Xapo, which was founded by Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares, in 2014, is home to Xapo around 7% of the world’s Bitcoin Supply. According to Bloomberg, this would mean (loosely translated),\nthat Xapo, only 4 years old, has more deposits than 98 percent of the approximately 5.670 banks in the United States.\nTo belong to the capital providers of Xapo, among others, the co-founder of LinkedIn Corporation, and Reid Hoffman, as well as the crypto-supporters, Ex-Hedge Fund Manager and Goldman Sachs Partner Milke Novogratz. Among the consultants of Xapo, the former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, the former Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup Inc., John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nThe business idea of Xapo consists of large amounts of Bitcoin in Cold Storage in highly protected areas such as mountain slopes and secure a disused military bunkers, and these combine with multiple layers of electronic protection devices. At the end of last year, Xapo made headlines when it became known that it has rebuilt a Bunker in Switzerland, which was built in 1947 by the Swiss army and in the Cold war as a secret headquarters was used for the Bitcoin Bunker.\nThe large Bitcoin holdings at Xapo underscore the trust and confidence of Casares in the case of Bitcoin whales and large investors enjoy, and although the memory concept to the owners, to some extent, control and a centralizing component in comparison to Cold Storage, such as Hardware Wallets adds.\nCuriously, currencies, managed Xapo Bitcoin and any other Crypto, as Casares only looks at Bitcoin as the only true crypto currency.\nRyan Radloff, CEO of the UK investment platform CoinShares said to Bloomberg (freely translated):\nAnyone who holds the key, holds it in Xapo. You could not pay me to keep it in a Bank.\nThe Retrieval of stored Bitcoins take Xapo about two days. The company reviewed during this period, the identity of the customer and authenticates the request, before the transactions with the private keys will be signed in from multiple locations manually. For the approval of a permission of three separate vaults, according to information of Bloomberg required so that a transaction can be carried out.\nIn addition to this core business, the company also offers its clients a trading platform to buy Bitcoin and sell it.\nAccording to Casares, the Lack of a Depot solution for Bitcoin at the institutional level, is a huge weak point in the system. This is exactly why Xapo would like to offer a solution.\nDisclaimer: — trading in crypto-currencies carries a large financial risk, and can be up to a total loss of the invested capital.

Roger Keith Ver, also known as ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, is an early investor in Bitcoin and Bitcoin related startups. Born and raised in America, he has since moved to Japan and has been a prominent supporter of the use of bitcoin as a means to accelerate the much yearned for economic freedom envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.\nWhat then is Flippening? Flippening is a term that has caught on in the crypto-verse that defines the act of one or more altcoins, no longer riding on the back of Bitcoin in terms of deriving market value from it. It marks the end of the dominance and special status of one coin in the form of market capitalization and popularity amongst crypto enthusiasts, and the entry of a new, better and more popular alternative.\nSo why does Bitcoin Jesus predict that Ethereum will Flippen Bitcoin? In an interview with The Independent, UK, Roger Ver had this to say about Ethereum:\nI see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent. Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020.\nMr. Ver went on to highlight the hurdles that the Bitcoin core technology is having in terms of transaction speed and scaling. Many users are now faced with higher fees although the Lightning network is working on reducing these costs. However, it might be a little too late as Ethereum is gathering a massive following especially with the prospects of scaling being solved through sharding.\nHe was also keen to say that the use of Bitcon Cash (BCH) might see it even eclipsing Ethereum and Bitcoin by having its price reach ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars’. He added the following about BCH:\nIt’s not guaranteed but it is much more likely to happen than not. Bitcoin cash has more than doubled in value in the last month and big investors coming in soon could see it double again by next week. People love to chase a rising star.\nBitcoin Jesus’ predictions will now stand the test of time.\nThe post ‘Ethereum (ETH) Could Overtake Bitcoin,’ says ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ appeared first on Ethereum World News.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flippening", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger keith ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flippen bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:16:22.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd4441f88015eaf638fe927fdeb606fb567be5d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbadRCM1Bf4fckoewmRzxCJSw8hrsxPODFnBfJxU24_Krl_a8e4XuB7FhEj5SlcVxj.gC9fb19am", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz", "title_full": "‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz", "published": "2018-05-12T13:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd4441f88015eaf638fe927fdeb606fb567be5d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbadRCM1Bf4fckoewmRzxCJSw8hrsxPODFnBfJxU24_Krl_a8e4XuB7FhEj5SlcVxj.gC9fb19am", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T13:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz", "text": "'Almost Irresponsible' to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz\nLester Coleman\nBillionaire bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Capital Management, says every investor should have 1% to 2% of their portfolio in cryptocurrency.

The bitcoin price fell to $8,250 while the majority of tokens recorded losses in the 20 percent range.\nUPbit + Mt. Gox On May 11, CCN reported that UPbit, South Korea’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, was raided and investigated by local police, the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KIU) and Financial Services Commission (FSC).\nThe two-day raid at the UPbit headquarters led local investors in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market to panic sell, eventually affecting the global cryptocurrency market.\nThe UPbit case coincided with the movement of more than 8,000 bitcoins from the Mt. Gox trustee, who previously stated that he will not sell any more of its funds until September of this year. The sudden sale of the Mt. Gox trustee funds and the unexpected investigation into UPbit led the entire cryptocurrency market to demonstrate a daily loss of $30 billion, from $400 billion to $370 billion.\nLast week, the cryptocurrency market peaked at $470 billion, as tokens such as Ziliqa (ZIL) and 0x (ZRX) along with both bitcoin and Ethereum recorded gains in the 5 to 40 percent range. Since then, the cryptocurrency market has recorded a loss of $100 billion, within a seven-day period. The market lost more than 20 percent of its value over the past week.\nLarge-scale investors and analysts including Fundstrat’s Tom Lee and CNBC Fast Money’s Brian Kelly have expressed their optimism towards the short-term trend of the bitcoin price given the start of the Blockchain Week in New York marked by the opening of Consensus 2018, the largest cryptocurrency conference in which institutional investors, cryptocurrency startups, developers, and traders come together.\nEarlier this week, BKCM founder Brian Kelly said on CNBC’s Fast Money that he was shocked investors did not push the valuation of the cryptocurrency market upwards after reports about the entrance of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) were released.\n“I’m actually a bit shocked that the market did not pick up on this. Dominic Chu of CNBC said that investors will get physical delivery of bitcoin. That doesn’t sound that interesting except for the fact that it means ICE Exchange has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets. These are generally bear instruments, just like gold bearer bonds. That’s the big deal. They have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders,” said Kelly.\nWith the Blockchain Week starting in May 15, the entrance of Goldman Sachs and NYSE into the cryptocurrency market, and the rising interest of institutional investors for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, investors have expected the market to surge in the short-term.\nHowever, several events including the Mt. Gox sale and the UPbit case led the cryptocurrency market to slump over the past five days.\nWhere Does the Market go From Here The cryptocurrency market has declined by more than 20 percent over the past week. But, given the upcoming events including the Blockchain Week in New York, it is likely that the market will see a recovery in volume across major exchanges, allowing the market to rebound.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "korean financial intelligence unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial services commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:16:22.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59da59a64c5fd2d15a350a701274b74d276b1fe1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCftSb97H1fkkdHOKa2fT4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin and altcoins now the price is going down!", "title_full": "bitcoin and altcoins now the price is going down!", "published": "2018-05-12T13:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59da59a64c5fd2d15a350a701274b74d276b1fe1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCftSb97H1fkkdHOKa2fT4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lambe45", "published": "2018-05-12T13:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin and altcoins now the price is going down!", "text": "bitcoin and altcoins now the price is going down, do you panic see it?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T12:11:40.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed0ca459d295106b54ada2000b41a7be4e011de2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46wRy8RJj.HtK.1oSUzvr4HQ--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=6", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "lenguaje C+,C++ - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "That is why Bitcoin crashed...", "title_full": "That is why Bitcoin crashed... - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-12T13:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed0ca459d295106b54ada2000b41a7be4e011de2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46wRy8RJj.HtK.1oSUzvr4HQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-12T13:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "That is why Bitcoin crashed...", "text": " software complex for breaking any Captcha\n can solve\nXEvil 4.0 + XRumer: BEST bypassing ReCaptcha app. , XEvil + XRumer: NEW breaking Recaptcha v.1,v.2,v.3 program! , This app can bypass ANY captchas, including Google ReCaptcha-2 , I'm shocked!

Dự báo giá Bitcoin & Altcoin Trong quá trình này, giá sẽ vẫn biến động như những con bò đực, và những con gấu chiến đấu nó ra để thiết lập uy quyền của họ. Các tin tức hỗ trợ sẽ thấy giá tăng lên trong khi tin xấu có thể dẫn đến sự suy giảm. Bộ tin tức mới nhất ảnh hưởng đến sự suy giảm đối với hầu hết các tiền điện tử là cuộc điều tra về Upbit trao đổi của Hàn Quốc bởi Ủy ban Giám sát Tài chính (FSC) và thanh lý Bitcoin của các giám đốc phụ trách hoàn trả người dùng bị ảnh hưởng bởi sự sụp đổ của sàn giao dịch cũ của Nhật Bản Mt.Gox. Các tin tức về mặt cơ bản cũng đã được tích cực với nhiều tổ chức tài chính có kế hoạch để nhập tiền điện tử, nhưng nó vẫn không phản ánh trong giá cả. Công ty nghiên cứu đầu tư Fundstrat tin rằng điều này sẽ sớm thay đổi và Bitcoin có thể đạt 36.000 đô la vào cuối năm 2019. Họ đã dự đoán một phạm vi có thể xảy ra là $ 20,000- $ 64,000. Ngay cả khi Bitcoin chỉ đạt đến điểm cuối thấp hơn, nó sẽ trả lại khoảng 125% so với mức hiện tại. Chúng ta hãy xem liệu chúng ta nên mua hiện tại hay chờ đợi. BTC / USD Bitcoin đã cố gắng giữ tỷ lệ thoát khỏi đường EMA 20 ngày vào ngày 09 tháng 5 nhưng không thể tìm thấy sự hỗ trợ mua ở các mức cao hơn. Vào ngày 10 tháng 5, nó đã bứt phá dưới đường EMA 20 ngày và đường hỗ trợ nhỏ. Dừng lỗ của chúng tôi tại $ 8.900 đã được nhấn hôm nay khi tiền điện tử giảm xuống mức thấp 8539.62 $. Mặt khác, SMA 50 ngày tại 8423 $ là một ngưỡng hỗ trợ mạnh, dưới mức giảm có thể kéo dài đến $ 7.900. Nếu mức này cũng bị phá vỡ, cặp BTC / USD có thể chìm xuống mức 7.000 đô la một lần nữa. Nếu đường SMA giữ trong 50 ngày, đồng tiền kỹ thuật số sẽ cố gắng tăng lên, nhưng nó có thể gặp kháng cự tại đường EMA 20 ngày. Việc làm phẳng các đường trung bình di chuyển chỉ đến sự hình thành của một phạm vi. Sự hỗ trợ và kháng cự của phạm vi có thể xảy ra vẫn chưa được thiết lập. Do đó, chúng tôi không khuyến nghị giao dịch trong phiên hôm nay. ETH / USD Ethereum không thể duy trì trên $ 745 vào ngày 10 tháng Năm. Điều này dẫn đến sự sụt giảm đã phá vỡ dưới đường EMA 20 ngày, gây ra sự mất mát của chúng tôi ở mức 680 đô la. Với sự sụp đổ, hình thành đáy hình chữ 'V' đã bị vô hiệu. Cặp ETH / USD đã hỗ trợ ở mức 656,55 USD, là mức thoái lui Fibonacci 38,2% của mức tăng từ mức thấp 363 USD đến 838 USD. Nếu mức này cũng phá vỡ, $ 600.50 sẽ đóng vai trò như một ngưỡng hỗ trợ mạnh, đó là mức thoái lui 50%. Các nhà đầu tư nên đợi mua để xuất hiện ở các mức thấp hơn trước khi vào bất kỳ vị thế mua bán nào. BCH / USD Bitcoin Cash không thể duy trì trên mức 1.600 đô la vào ngày 10 tháng 5, dẫn đến phân tích bên dưới kênh tăng dần. Hôm nay, cặp BCH / USD giảm xuống dưới đường EMA 20 ngày và chạm ngưỡng dừng lỗ của chúng tôi ở mức $ 1.400. Hiện tại, giá đã phục hồi từ mức thấp nhất, và các nhà đầu cơ giá đang cố gắng tăng trở lại trên đường EMA 20 ngày. Nếu các cấp giữ lại, Bitcoin Cash sẽ lại cố gắng mở rộng trên 1.600 đô la. Ngưỡng hỗ trợ quan trọng ở mức giảm là 1.221 đô la. Nếu mức này bị phá vỡ, slide có thể kéo dài đến SMA 50 ngày. XRP / USD Ripple đã phá vỡ phạm vi cung cấp cho nó một mục tiêu thấp hơn là $ 0,58223. Hiện tại, những con bò đang cố gắng bảo vệ đường SMA trong 50 ngày. Ngay cả khi họ thành công, sự phục hồi sẽ đối mặt với một ngưỡng kháng cự mạnh tại $ 0.76 và EMA 20 ngày. Nếu cặp XRP / USD phá vỡ dưới đường SMA 50 ngày, thì mức giảm có thể kéo dài đến vùng hỗ trợ tiếp theo là 0,56- $ 0,58. Ở đây cũng vậy, tỷ lệ cược của sự hình thành của một phạm vi rộng lớn đã tăng lên. Chúng tôi sẽ chờ cho tiền điện tử để tìm một số hỗ trợ trước khi mua nó. XLM / USD Stellar đã phá vỡ dưới ngưỡng hỗ trợ ngang tại $ 0.334 và hiện đang cố gắng hỗ trợ tại đường SMA 50 ngày. Sự thất bại của các nhà đầu cơ giá để giữ một ngưỡng hỗ trợ quan trọng cho thấy sự yếu kém. Nếu cặp XLM / USD phá vỡ dưới đường SMA 50 ngày, nó có thể giảm xuống còn 0,184 đô la. Xác suất của đồng tiền kỹ thuật số hình thành một cúp và hình thành xử lý đã giảm. Nó có khả năng trở thành phạm vi ràng buộc giữa $ 0,84 đến $ 0,477. Chúng tôi sẽ chờ đợi một giao dịch mua mới được thiết lập để hình thành trước khi đề xuất bất kỳ giao dịch nào trên đó. LTC / USD Litecoin đã bứt xuống dưới kênh tăng dần, đường EMA 20 ngày và đường SMA 50 ngày. Hiện tại, nó đang gặp khó khăn trong việc giữ ngưỡng hỗ trợ ngang tại mức $ 141.026. Nếu cặp LTC / USD chìm và đóng (UTC) dưới mức 141 đô la, nó sẽ trở thành số âm và có thể giảm xuống 127 đô la và thấp hơn xuống mức 115 đô la. Nếu các mức giữ, đồng tiền kỹ thuật số sẽ tiếp tục giao dịch bên trong phạm vi nhỏ $ 141- $ 167. Do sự suy yếu chung, tốt hơn là đợi cho sự suy giảm kết thúc trước khi mua. ADA / BTC Các nhà đầu cơ giá không thể duy trì mức giá cao hơn mức phá vỡ 0,00343445, dẫn đến sự sụt giảm đã phá vỡ dưới ngưỡng dừng lỗ của chúng tôi tại 0,003232. Điểm dừng lỗ khác tại 0,002929 được lưu bằng một biên độ nhỏ khi đồng tiền kỹ thuật số đã trượt xuống mức 0.00002902 ngày hôm nay. Cặp ADA / BTC hiện tại là SMA 50 ngày. Nếu mức này giữ vững, những người đầu cơ sẽ cố gắng thoát ra khỏi ngưỡng kháng cự trên không một lần nữa. Nếu mức này bị phá vỡ, nó có thể trượt xuống mức 0,000020. Do đó, chúng tôi khuyên bạn nên duy trì các điểm dừng tại 0,002929 ở vị trí còn lại. IOTA / USD IOTA đã xuống dưới ngưỡng hỗ trợ ngang, đường EMA 20 ngày và đường hỗ trợ của kênh tăng dần. Điều này cho thấy sự yếu kém trong ngắn hạn. Cặp IOTA / USD có mức hỗ trợ nhỏ ở mức 1,81 đô la từ nơi mà nó đang cố gắng phục hồi. Nếu mức này bị phá vỡ, mức giảm có thể kéo dài đến $ 1,63, đây là một ngưỡng hỗ trợ quan trọng. Chúng tôi dự đoán mua sẽ xuất hiện gần đường SMA 50 ngày. Hãy chờ cho người mua quay trở lại trước khi vào bất kỳ vị thế dài nào. EOS / USD Việc hợp nhất trong EOS đã giải quyết được nhược điểm khi giá đã phá vỡ trong phạm vi hẹp. Những con bò đang cố gắng để bảo vệ mức thoái lui 50% của đà tăng từ $ 5.9610 đến $ 23.0290. Cặp EOS / USD có thể giảm xuống đường hỗ trợ của kênh giảm dần, cũng trùng với mức thoái lui Fibonacci 61,8%. SMA 50 ngày cũng nằm ngay dưới mức này. Trong khi xu hướng vẫn duy trì ở mức tích cực, tốt hơn là chờ đợi đợt thoái lui kết thúc trước khi bắt đầu bất kỳ vị thế mua mới nào.

These stories and many more were covered in this week's daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Young New Zealand Man Spared Jail for Dealing Drugs With Bitcoin\nOutage Downs Telegram, Bitcoin Shines on a Bank As the messaging service of choice for many cryptocurrency groups, the problems at Telegram made headlines on Monday . While the company was facing a crackdown in Russia and Iran, this time it was a technical issue in one of Telegram's data centers after a power outage in Amsterdam that caused interruptions across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Russia, and the CIS countries. Additionally covered were a photo which shows a huge Bitcoin logo projected on the Swiss National Bank building in Zurich and major companies' blockchain developments in South Korea.\nIOTA Ditched, Bitcoin Taking Over Popular Culture On Tuesday we reported that UCL (University College London) cut all its ties with the IOTA Foundation because of its repeated threats against critics that reviewed the technology, that Wikimédia France will soon begin accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, and that someone has created the annoying bitcoin price alarm from HBO's comedy series Silicon Valley. But the big news was all about bacon.\nOscar Mayer, the meat brand owned by Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), announced it had launched the \"first-ever cryptocurrency backed by bacon.\" Fans were invited to \"mine\" Bacoin by participating in a promotion and pump the value by shilling for it on social media. The company was soon hit with a cease-and-desist letter by someone claiming he invented a bacon-backed coin with the exact same name back in 2014. Luckily for fans, everything turned out well at the end. Oscar Mayer has offered to make a donation in his name, and to send its famous Wiener-mobile to the guy's house to give him free bacon and entertain his kids for a while and the case was thus settled.\nHacker Gets Trolled, Vertcoin Gets Hacked Hackers, a constant pest in the crypto world, have been our focus on Wednesday . Some scammers have taken over the official Vertcoin Twitter account and duped a handful of followers to send them some bitcoin with the false promise of a giveaway. Another scammer tried to blackmail a podcaster into giving him bitcoin by holding his website for ransom but got trolled hard. Additionally covered was Coinmarketcap's five year anniversary, when the site unveiled a new logo, an iOS mobile app and added some new features.\nCrypto Traders in Troubled Waters A few unfortunate cases were covered on Thursday . Bitgrail, the Italian crypto exchange which suspended operations after losing 17 million XRB, has briefly reopened and soon closed again under order from the court of Florence. Btcxchange, the oldest bitcoin trading platform in Romania, has apparently closed down for good this time after multiple setbacks through the years. Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees lashed out in a tweet against Chase Bank which has closed his credit card account without warning nor an explanation.\nIn other news, US-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet Coinbase has applauded the investigation by New York Attorney General into the industry's business practices. This was in sharp contrast to the strong rebuke by Kraken CEO Jesse Powell which took a brave stand against the American regulatory overreach.\nFarms on Wheels, a Hotel, and a Simulator for Miners On Friday , the latest developments in the mining space were our focus. These included a \"mining hotel\" in Moscow, Russia, a Bitmain Zcash ASIC miner, and even mining trucks. Italian inventors plan on installing their miners in shipping containers loaded on trucks, enabling them to rapidly move the mobile farms to destinations with cheap electricity and more favorable regulations. We also reported that a team of Belarusian developers is working on a project to create a \"True Mining Simulator\" – a computer game dedicated to replicating the life experiences of a cryptocurrency miner.\nRussian Crypto-Millionaire Found Dead The main news on Saturday , other than BTC flirting with the $10,000 price level again, was that Russian Youtuber Pavel Makushin had been found dead in his apartment. The 23-year-old was the victim of a robbery in January, which saw 24 million rubles (approximately $38,000 USD) stolen from him. Mr. Makushin's mother was reported to have indicated that the robbery could have led him to take his own life.\nThis Week in Bitcoin Podcast To make sure you didn't miss any big bitcoin news this week, listen to the following podcast:\nWhat other stories everyone in the bitcoin world must have read this week?

Now it is time to turn our attention to one of the most obvious things that went wrong in BTC — the centralization of protocol development.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 2\nHow Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid Centralization\nDecentralization comes in many forms: decentralization of nodes, mining pools, wealth, and so on. One thing that was overlooked for a long time in Bitcoin BTC was that while many things were well distributed, there was only one main group of developers (Bitcoin Core).\nDecentralized Development\nMost of the BCH community is now well aware of this folly, and that is why we seek to have multiple independent teams of developers along with multiple full node implementations.\nMiners need established, robust software they can rely on, and its important to have several choices; otherwise it means that a single group of developers essentially controls the protocol.\nEntrenchment of “The Reference Implementation”\nBitcoin Core became entrenched as “the” Bitcoin software, which led to stagnation. Although there were already several different implementations, the dominance of Bitcoin Core has been overwhelming.\nTechnically, it’s hash power that matters, not how many different nodes are running a certain software… But given the totally lopsided distribution, it was clear that anyone running a different version from Core would be a tiny minority. That means Bitcoin Core calls all the shots as far as BTC protocol rules.\nBCH is Doing Better Already\nWe’re heading in the right direction but we’re not out of the woods yet. One interesting phenomenon is that the current level of BCH development decentralization is often either underestimated or overestimated.\nOn one extreme, some believe development is fully decentralized (since there’s, what, 6 node implementations now?). By contrast, others see the leading team (Bitcoin ABC) as having become the next reference implementation.\nThe truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin ABC runs around 60–70% of the BCH nodes and Bitcoin Unlimited runs about a third of them. Essentially, instead of one main implementation, there’s now two.\nMaybe that sounds a bit disappointing, but that’s twice as many as BTC.\nMeritocracy\nA meritocracy is defined as “the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability.”\nThere’s often a misguided notion that the main development groups in BCH should have magically have equal influence, rather than acknowledging that influence must be earned.\nThose fearful of ABC having too much power might not understand this principle, or more likely, they haven’t seen all that ABC has accomplished to earn what is currently a majority “market share”.\nThe fact of the matter is that Bitcoin ABC has been the best in class when it comes to leading protocol development, producing timely releases of solid code, and solving problems.\nTo be specific, it was Bitcoin ABC that created the first node software for Bitcoin Cash, and spearheaded both hard fork upgrades along with the Cashaddr addresses.\nHow Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 3", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T13:19:59.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf46ed75931d25aa2634ab2ed689faf3fcc1283a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSJr2_9tHuWlvrIxBZcXaPw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Now and Forever", "title_full": "Bitcoin Now and Forever", "published": "2018-05-12T13:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.135, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf46ed75931d25aa2634ab2ed689faf3fcc1283a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSJr2_9tHuWlvrIxBZcXaPw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gundala", "published": "2018-05-12T13:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Now and Forever", "text": "Quote: from: tansoft64 on May 11, 2018, 02:19:03 AM Bitcoin will last forever as technology will also exist because this two are partners in development, bitcoin as digital currency is the future money that will still exist and maybe that eliminate the fiat because we are continue to adopt and making life easier with paper less transaction.\nMoreover, supported by the legality of the government will definitely make the bitcoin more brilliant in the future.

There is a major bullish trend line forming with support at $9,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair remains in an uptrend and it may well break the $10,000 level and settle above it. Bitcoin price is gaining momentum above $9,500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD is likely to accelerate higher above the $10,000 and $10,500 levels in the near term.\nBitcoin Price Uptrend This past week, bitcoin price traded with mostly bullish bias above the $9,000 support level against the US Dollar. The price slowly moved higher and broke the $9,250, $9,500 and $9,700 resistance levels. It traded close to the $10,000 level and formed a high at $9,960. Buyers failed to push the price above the $10,000 level, but the bias is still positive.\nThere was a minor downside correction from the $9,960 high. BTC price declined and traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,847 low to $9,960 high. However, the decline was prevented by the $9,600 support level. There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support at $9,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Moreover, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,847 low to $9,960 high also acted as a support. At the moment, the price is placed nicely above $9,600 and it may continue to move higher during the coming days.\nLooking at the chart , it seems like the price could accelerate gains above the $10,000 level. Above this last, the next stop for buyers could be $10,800 and $11,000 in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly reducing its bullish slope.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving lower from the 70 level.\nMajor Support Level – $9,600\nMajor Resistance Level – $10,000\nThe post Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis – BTC/USD Could Settle above $10,000 appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T13:01:18.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4fb488b5491e4be2341d7ee3eefda268f5b4e62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YklCK6BXqD548VdPplZ3eLetMY0m_1gSnfE3w1L_dea9JZ3oVswCGvs2K4GDnVjMCzO548puRGibH", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Continuous improvement - The Bitcoin Cash philosophy.

[…] They don’t want to come down from their pedestal of crony capitalism and free money from central banks to address that, so they attack crypto. Berkshire’s elite gained considerable press coverage earlier this week after they delivered further soundbites against cryptocurrency and trading it. Buffett, who has been open about his distaste for Bitcoin, described it as “probably rat poison squared” at an annual shareholder meeting last weekend, a comment that was widely criticized by the Bitcoin users. #bitcoin is rat poison because central bankers are the rats — Honey Badger (@badgerbitcoin) May 7, 2018 Munger, who previously said Bitcoin was “utterly assinine,” backed up his stance by asserting trading it was like “trading fresh harvested baby brains.” “It’s antisocial, stupid and immoral,” he told Yahoo! Finance in an interview . Bitcoin Will Go To $30k… Soon? Keiser met Munger’s words on par, telling viewers the 94-year-old “would have the pleasure of watching Bitcoin soar past $30,000 per coin as he expires from this planet.” While not guessing at when exactly Bitcoin’s implied jump to $30,000 would take place, Keiser has not been shy about his predictions for the cryptocurrency’s future. In an interview with Bitcoinist last month, while also keeping quiet on timeframes, the figure of $100,000 came easily. “My only Bitcoin prediction is that the price will top $100,000. As far as timing, extrapolate from current trends and you get a sense of when,” he said. Similar optimism has since surfaced from other regular Bitcoin bulls including Tom Lee, whose company Fundstrat Global Advisors this week produced research concluding mining trends will send BTC/USD to $36,000 by the end of 2019.

Cryptocurrency Seized A recent article from USA Today reports that the London Metropolitan Police managed to seize cryptocurrencies from a prolific hacker. According to the report, Grant West was arrested last year on a train by British police, who were working with Scotland Yard. The British police force was able to seize cryptocurrencies worth $700,000 from the 25-year-old hacker. On the subject of hackers, police investigator Mick Gallagher says: These people generally feel they can operate with impunity, that they can’t be touched. We have now debunked that. Investigators say that West, who went by the online name “Courvoisier,” was behind cyber attacks on more than 100 different companies, including gambling shops, mobile phone companies, and supermarkets. The report also notes that “Courvoisier” used Bitcoin to launder his proceeds from the sale of passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information on the Dark Web. An interesting twist to this cryptocurrency seizure is that the police were able to snag the bitcoins due to the fact that West was still logged into his computer, and investigators found his access keys that were saved on his computer. Cybercriminals and Cryptocurrencies Many cybercriminals have used cryptocurrencies to launder their proceeds from illegal activities. Some cryptocurrencies are also massively used in Dark Web markets to purchase illegal goods or services like drugs, credit card information, DDoS attacks, etc. Alex Lakatos, a lawyer from Washington D.C., states: When it comes to transactions on the Dark Web, (people) nearly universally use cryptocurrency. He also added: The use of virtual currency for illicit purposes has been a huge success. Some cybercriminals may believe that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may offer anonymity, but it has been pointed out that investigators often times can track certain cryptocurrencies but cannot tell who owns them. Another point of fact is that the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions are for perfectly legal reasons. However, the media and centralized authorities love to play up the meme of crypto and illicit activity. What are your thoughts on the cryptocurrency seizure by the London police? Will police be able to enhance their ability to go after hackers or will hackers stay a few steps ahead? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock, iStock, and Pixabay.

C2 is an international community that intends to bolster open standard development in order to provide long-term Bitcoin Cash growth. Also read: Upgrade Time: Bitcoin Cash 32MB Fork Activates Tuesday The Cash Consortium: Open Standards for Bitcoin Cash Much of the cryptocurrency community understands what open source or open standard development is, and most of them embrace the idea. Furthermore, organizations like the W3C and other believers of open standards welcome the sharing of open sourced code that allows anyone the rights to study, change, and distribute OSS protocol for any purpose. Open standards also allows other developers to review a protocol’s design in order to prevent flaws and bugs within the software by coming up with sets of development standards that everyone agrees to and uses. The Cash Consortium will have engineers from leading companies to work together to build Bitcoin Cash (BCH) development standards much like how developers build on the open web with shared concepts like HTML. “The C2’s mission is to lead Bitcoin Cash to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the blockchain,” explains the C2 website. Bitcoin Cash is the soundest money the world has ever known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability and transferability. It’s our intention that it remain the soundest money the world has ever known — Bitcoin Cash enables smart contracts/property, colored coins, tokens, ICOs and much more. We intend to standardize these emerging technologies in a way that plays to Bitcoin Cash’s strengths. A Formal Bitcoin Standards Body At the moment organizations that are listed as members of C2 include Cointext , Atlantis Labs, Akari Global Foundation, the Bitcoin Cash Fund , Bitbox, Blockpress , Centbee, and the social network Yours . Last night news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the creator of the Cash Consortium, Carlos Cardona , who is also the lead developer of Bitbox , the open source development toolkit for Bitcoin Cash. Cardona tells us he is a firm believer in open standards and explains why he initiated the C2 organization. “When I was in college I was a member of the W3C’s HTML5 Working Group. There were engineers from Apple, Google (who I was with), Microsoft, Firefox and many more meeting up regularly in working groups to flesh out the next generation of technical specs for the web (HTML/CSS etc),” Cardona tells news.Bitcoin.com . “When the spec was nearing completion the teams would each implement it. Some open source like Firefox. Some closed source like Internet Explorer. But both implementing technical specs which were created together.” When I joined the blockchain space several years ago it surprised me that there was no formal Bitcoin standards body. The Cash Consortium will affirm and adhere to the Principles in support of The Modern Paradigm for Standards —cooperation, due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness. Huge Forces at Play Are About to Phase the Blockchain Industry Then Cardona says he started thinking about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash upgrade that will not only increase the block size by 4X but the fork will also add Satoshi OP_Codes that can enable the ability to create color coins and smart contract features on the BCH network. “With the new OP_Codes coming I had recently been thinking again about how to best standardize on new transaction types and then Memo/Blockpress happened,” Cardona emphasizes. “Having recently updated Bitbox’s block explorer to support both Memo and Blockpress I was struck with the same feeling I had during IE6/FF days — writing code twice with slightly different APIs because there was no standard. With OP_RETURN going from 80 bytes to 220 bytes we’re just seeing the start of OP_RETURN prefixed protocols — That got me thinking again about a standards body.” In my opinion our industry spent many years fighting the Blockstream wars and became complacent — Things which I would expect in any other nearly decade old tech industry (such as a tech consortium) doesn’t exist in our space. The final part which caused me to move on it was when I found out Zuckerberg created a blockchain division last week. To me that is just a sign that HUGE forces are at play which are about to phase shift our entire industry. Cardona Believes the Opportunity to Move Quick and be Proactive is Now The C2 website explains that if you work with a company that develops with Bitcoin Cash then they can feel free to fork this repo or reach out to Cardona to see how you can get involved. “I believe we have the opportunity to move quick, be proactive, build bridges and standardize or some much larger player will step in an do it for us,” Cardona adds. What do you think about the Cash Consortium (C2)? Do you think its a good idea for BCH developers to initiate open standards for protocol and application development?

The plan is worth a mention, especially on the backdrop of the crypto ban imposed by the social media network. In Saturday’s Bitcoin in Brief, we also cover Telegram’s advance towards implementing its payment system using the Gram token. Some blockchain stories with beers and beamers complete today’s round-up.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: China Mulls Blockchain Standard, Zcash Fights Chinese ASICs Facebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nFacebook is reportedly considering creating its own cryptocurrency. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the social media giant is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments on its platform. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies.\nFacebook announced recently that it had formed a team whose main task will be to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that the company can utilize to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase.\nThe development of the payments system, however, is likely to take some time, possibly years. Marcus, who is a crypto enthusiast and an early investor, has been quoted as saying that crypto payments are still very slow and expensive. Facebook is not planning to hold an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund the project. In January, the social network banned crypto-related ads, including advertisements of token sales. Telegram Moving Forward with Crypto Payments\nTelegram , on the other hand, has already raised enough money to fund its own blockchain project and payment system. The messaging service, which is popular with the crypto community, has already attracted $1.7 billion dollars to finance its Telegram Open Network (TON). The company, founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, has decided to call off a planned public ICO.\nAccording to Russian media reports, Telegram is now conducting closed tests of a new service designed to store users’ information and documents for verification purposes. Telegram Passport will be used to keep personal details and copies of IDs, banking statements, and utility bills which will be used to identify users on Telegram’s blockchain TON.\nThe identity verification feature is needed to facilitate payments using Telegram’s own crypto token called Gram. Once uploaded, the personal information can be potentially shared with partners within the platform, but also on their systems. Telegram Passport, which should be launched by the summer, is expected to prevent anonymous crypto payments. Crypto Beer Vending Machine to Check Age\nCivic, a San-Francisco-based startup, has recently announced plans to introduce a “crypto beer vending machine.” The project, which will be realized in partnership with a leading US beer producer, aims to also prove that blockchain can be used to verify if a thirsty guy or girl have 21 years of age to legally consume the alcoholic beverage. To get a cold can, one has to install Civic’s app on their smartphone, verify their ID, and then walk up to the machine, Futurism reports. The project’s success depends on the readiness of government authorities to accept identity verification performed on a blockchain. Civic’s beer vending machine is still a prototype. BMW Tracking Mileage on a Blockchain\nAnother blockchain partnership aims to track the mileage of cars. A team at BMW, the German automobile manufacturer, has been tasked with finding a way to better preserve the resale value of vehicles leased by the company. Collecting reliable data for the mileage, amortization and maintenance of these cars is crucial for achieving the best price on the second-hand market.\nThe blockchain startup DOVU has been invited by BMW to establish a partnership with Alphabet, the auto giant’s leasing and fleet vehicle branch, and BMW’s Innovation Lab in order to develop a system to collect and keep record of the important information. The companies behind the project hope to also evaluate how effective tokenization can be in encouraging customers’ cooperation.\nIn a pilot program implemented by the partners, BMW drivers are prompted by a custom wallet app to take a picture of their dashboards once a week. All submissions are added to DOVU’s blockchain which is used by Alphabet to compile consistent and unalterable data reflecting the exploitation of the vehicles. The information is then used to assess the mileage and the depreciation of the used cars and ultimately determine their resale value.\nWhat do you think of today’s Bitcoin in Brief stories?

Bitcoin Miners Do the Selling According to independent research boutique Fundstrat, which provides market strategy and sector research, the bitcoin mining boom could potentially send the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization to upwards of $64,000 USD by the end of 2019. States the company’s head of research, Sam Doctor, in a report: We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range. Bitcoin is infamously volatile, creating FOMOers and naysayers on what feels like a weekly basis. Nevertheless, Fundstrat believes the economics behind bitcoin mining create key support levels — since bitcoin miners are less likely to sell their rewards during market downturns, and more likely to cash out during bull runs. Explained Doctor in a conference call to CNBC on Thursday: The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors. We believe breakeven mining costs provide a support level for $BTC , as #miners – main natural #Crypto sellers – reduce selling at low $BTCUSD price. Based on expected computing hashpower and breakeven cost growth, that could imply #Bitcoin price of $36,000 by 2019 year end. pic.twitter.com/CVwIWNz8Lr — Sam Doctor (@fundstratQuant) May 10, 2018 Fundstrat has estimated that the current cash break-even price Antminer S7 models is $6,003 USD per bitcoin. The newer and more powerful Antminer S9 , however, features a much lower break-even point at $2,368 USD. Both popular pieces of bitcoin mining hardware are manufactured by Bitmain, which boasted an operating profit between 3 billion USD to 4 billion USD in 2017. Doctor said: The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.

FILE PHOTO: A token of the virtual currency Bitcoin is seen placed on a monitor that displays binary digits in this illustration picture, December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic//File Photo\nBitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.

Since their low of the year of $245 billion on April first, markets have gained 90% to current levels today. Bitcoin has remained flat over the past 24 hours and hovers just below $10k at $9,870. The general sentiment is that altcoins could start to fall once BTC pushes past that barrier and a bull run on it ensues. At the moment the alts are a mixed bunch with some making solid gains while others have fallen. The coin performing the best right now is Bitcoin Cash.\nAccording to Coinmarketcap BCH is up 15% on the day and has had a very bullish week. Currently trading at a touch under $1,800 Bitcoin Cash is up from $1,540 this time yesterday. Over the week BCH has risen 24% from $1,450 this time last Sunday. The monthly view for Bitcoin's brother is even more impressive with a gain of 180% from $640 this time last month. Despite the war between the two factions, who both insist their version is the real Bitcoin, BCH has outperformed BTC in recent weeks. On the day it is up 15% against BTC to 18157000 satoshis, monthly gains are around 94% from 93 sats this time last month.\nThe impending hard fork has driven traders back to Bitcoin Cash. Scheduled for May 15, the split will quadruple the block size from 8Mb to 32Mb, many believe this will increase overall adoption as transaction times and costs are reduced. A full specification of the 'Bitcoin ABC' upgrade has been posted on Github . In addition to an adaptive block size, the update could also reduce block intervals to 2.5 minutes, similar to Litecoin. It could also potentially activating dormant code to offer a similar feature to the ERC20 tokens based on the Ethereum network. The two camps are still actively duking it out on social media with BTC advocates claiming that the Lightning Network is the way forward while the BCH clan claims that increased block size is a truer reflection of Satoshi's vision. Either way, Bitcoin Cash is on a roll at the moment.\nSouth Koreans are buying up Bitcoin Cash this morning with Upbit and Bithumb taking 20% of the trade in KRW. USDT is the next commonly used medium to buy BCH on Huobi, Bitfinex and OKEx. Total volume has doubled from $1 billion to $2 billion in the past 24 hours. Market cap for BCH is currently $30 billion which is only $5 billion behind XRP in third spot.\nAll cryptocurrencies have increased their total market capitalization once again by 1.5% to $469 billion at the time of writing. Over the week markets have gained 7.3% since this time last Sunday. Other altcoins having a good run during Asian trade this morning include Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold, and Bytecoin.\nMore on Bitcoin Cash can be found here:

She explained on CNBC ‘s “Squawk Box” on Thursday:\nAs a payment system, I think it’s troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort. In fact [it’s] designed to be not transparent.\nBessant has apparently never visited one of the many websites tracking Bitcoin’s very public ledger . If she had, she might realize that it’s extremely transparent – significantly more so than private banking ledgers. Nevertheless, Bessant claims police forces are incapable of tracking criminal transactions on the public ledger, stating:\nThe way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that.\nBank of America is one of the many institutions which banned cryptocurrency purchases via credit card. She explained:\nJust like we don’t allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we’re not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards.\nBessant also took the time to praise traditional banking’s security, stating:\nI do actually think we’re in a better position every day. Awareness is higher, the sophistication of our defense and detection efforts are growing every day. There are more players in the mix with a lot of expertise, and the threat environment is beginning to show patterns that make prediction and even automated prediction something we can do every day. So I do believe we’re in a better place. ‘It’s Never Going to Work’\nBank of America’s CTO isn’t the only one throwing FUD at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nEconomist Nouriel Roubini, most widely known for correctly predicting the global financial crisis, claimed digital currencies create “chaos” in the world of traditional payments. He explained at the Fluidity Summit in Brooklyn on Thursday:\nIt’s totally inefficient. It’s never going to work. You are going to the world of the Flintstones to buy any good you have to exchange, you go back to the Stone Age of bartering.\nAs noted by CNBC , Roubini loves digital payment platforms like Alipay, Venmo, PayPal, and Square.

She explained on CNBC ‘s “Squawk Box” on Thursday:\nAs a payment system, I think it’s troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort. In fact [it’s] designed to be not transparent.\nBessant has apparently never visited one of the many websites tracking Bitcoin’s very public ledger . If she had, she might realize that it’s extremely transparent – significantly more so than private banking ledgers. Nevertheless, Bessant claims police forces are incapable of tracking criminal transactions on the public ledger, stating:\nThe way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that.\nBank of America is one of the many institutions which banned cryptocurrency purchases via credit card. She explained:\nJust like we don’t allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we’re not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards.\nBessant also took the time to praise traditional banking’s security, stating:\nI do actually think we’re in a better position every day. Awareness is higher, the sophistication of our defense and detection efforts are growing every day. There are more players in the mix with a lot of expertise, and the threat environment is beginning to show patterns that make prediction and even automated prediction something we can do every day. So I do believe we’re in a better place.\n‘It’s Never Going to Work’ Bank of America’s CTO isn’t the only one throwing FUD at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nEconomist Nouriel Roubini, most widely known for correctly predicting the global financial crisis, claimed digital currencies create “chaos” in the world of traditional payments. He explained at the Fluidity Summit in Brooklyn on Thursday:\nIt’s totally inefficient. It’s never going to work. You are going to the world of the Flintstones to buy any good you have to exchange, you go back to the Stone Age of bartering.\nAs noted by CNBC , Roubini loves digital payment platforms like Alipay, Venmo, PayPal, and Square. Interestingly, he doesn’t think blockchain technology will have any significant impact on the future of finance He stated:\nI’m affirmative on that significant disruption, but most of this has nothing to do with blockchain, nothing to do with cryptocurrency.\nDo you agree that blockchain technology won’t have a future in the financial sector?

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav a", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T12:16:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f07021d37e036e0d89d42b013c9ba2da1bea59dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhF9f0EvDCb2LjEZHqahQvHo-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-12T12:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f07021d37e036e0d89d42b013c9ba2da1bea59dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhF9f0EvDCb2LjEZHqahQvHo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T12:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 12, 2018 WEB New York Stock Exchange Could Launch Physical Bitcoin Futures Trading CoinStaker Bitcoin futures trading options are spreading in the United States and all over the world.

The difference is big, talk about Bitcoin or Bitcoin. In written language this has to do with the uppercase letter and that is when we speak of bitcoin in lowercase, in the system refers to the \"token\", that is, to the bits that the user uses as \"coins\", or that others use it as a digital asset. Only in the previous thing the great confusions arise and it is that in the case of the economists, these try to explain the basics of bitcoin, using concepts that are proper of the economy that derives from the way in which the central banks operate, and there are enormous differences in the way a fiduciary money bill is produced with the production of a \"token\", that a user assigns value to the market and also uses it as a means of payment. While they may seem the same, they are not, therefore, on the concepts of the economy that exist today, you can not issue criteria on cryptocurrencies. If it has been difficult for those who know clearly of bitcoin, when they go into Bitcoin, it becomes much more complex. When talking about Bitcoin, it is no longer about the currency, or the encrypted bits that are transferred between one user and another, but the project that allows this technology and there then the big difference arises. It is one thing to think that Bitcoin is only a means of payment and that it only serves to speculate with the value of the underlying asset and another thing is to detect the whole complex of investments, new projects, developments, updates and others that are being implemented after the irruption of Bitcoin in the world. It is correctly true what Mr. Buffett says about bitcoin, that when used as a financial instrument to speculate with this, a person who buys it, would have to wait for someone else willing to pay a higher amount. But until then, everything that has arisen around Bitcoin does not take it into account, the mining companies that have emerged, the more than 10 thousand exchanges around the world, the thousands of cryptocurrencies, each with different uses and with projects very particular, the development of any number of applications for cell phones, for desktops, the number of solutions for users and micro-payments transfers, new investment models similar to fixed income with master nodes, an entire industry advertising on the web has been born, which uses cryptocurrencies, lotteries, online gambling houses, loan sites, digital media, exchanges that pay interest, a system that not only generates employment, but also that is creating new companies in the technology sector.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic//File Photo Reuters\nBERLIN (Reuters) - German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin.\nBitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n\"Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,\" Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin's fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. \"With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\n(Writing by Laura Dubois,; Editing by Joseph Nasr and Matthew Mpoke Bigg)\nCopyright 2018 Thomson Reuters .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reuters/dado ruvic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "online bank uses bitcoins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters berlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T13:26:53.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce0c62526fe63fc4d89ebe61c7c25d6d25330f49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9C9p_jG4jBW3E9La6mPoHEvNFLTvHmkp7mAp3nVo7c8RfxxH1.b4upxcg4Nktr6Jz50cEjXyX6hFuhNz2BoQo5m_JMNqV_coA-", "site_full": "www.monkeyfarts.org", "site": "monkeyfarts.org", "site_section": "http://www.monkeyfarts.org/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Technology news | latest news about information technology & world IT", "title": "German online bank uses Bitcoins to transfer loans", "title_full": "German online bank uses Bitcoins to transfer loans", "published": "2018-05-12T12:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce0c62526fe63fc4d89ebe61c7c25d6d25330f49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9C9p_jG4jBW3E9La6mPoHEvNFLTvHmkp7mAp3nVo7c8RfxxH1.b4upxcg4Nktr6Jz50cEjXyX6hFuhNz2BoQo5m_JMNqV_coA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters: Technology News", "published": "2018-05-12T12:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "German online bank uses Bitcoins to transfer loans", "text": "technologyNews German online bank uses Bitcoins to transfer loans BERLIN (Reuters) - German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin.
