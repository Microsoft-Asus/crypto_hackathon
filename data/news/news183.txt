CoinDesk Releases 'Bitcoin Pizza Day' Price Tracker ANNOUNCEMENT Stan Higgins May 22, 2018 at 12:00 UTC | Updated May 23, 2018 at 11:35 UTC\nEight years ago today, the first reported exchange of bitcoin for a consumer product - a pair of Papa John's pizzas - took place.\nAt a total cost of 10,000 bitcoins, it was a milestone for the adoption of cryptocurrency and one that has since been commemorated though the celebration of May 22 as \"Bitcoin Pizza Day.\"\nYet even the most cursory observation of Bitcoin Pizza Day isn't complete without a calculation of precisely how much, in dollar terms, those two pizzas cost. With that, CoinDesk is today releasing a new widget that provides a real-time calculation that you can add to any website .\nAs of press time, that's about $83.7 million for the two pies, or just shy of $42 million apiece.\nBut why does this matter? To understand, one needs to wind back the clock to 2010.\nIn mid-May of that year, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz sought to exchange some of his hard-earned bitcoins for pizza - several days later, he was able to do so with the aid of a fellow user of the Bitcoin Talk online forum, then a central hub for discussion around cryptocurrency.\nA deal was struck: 10,000 BTC for two Papa John's pizzas. That eye-watering amount was worth a mere $25 at the time, or a fraction of a penny apiece.\nYet at the time, it wasn't so much the number of bitcoins spent or the product involved - the event was a milestone simply because the transaction had taken place. Though limited to 16 slices of pizza, the era of bitcoin-powered commerce had begun - not to mention the silent wincing over spending millions of dollars for two pizzas.\n\"It wasn't like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,\" Hanyecz said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times , adding:\n\"No one knew it was going to get so big.\"\nStill, the tradition lives on, with the purchase being used to track other notable bitcoin milestones.\nIndeed, it was Hanyecz himself who would later participate in what might one day be known as \"Lightning Pizza Day\" after he used the next-generation technology, now in development, to purchase a pie in February .\nPizza image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

During the past 50 bars, there have been 0 white candles and 0 black candles.\nA gravestone doji occurred. This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nA rising window occurred (where the top of the previous shadow is below the bottom of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bullish trend. There have been 26 rising windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current rising window even more bullish.\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 18.6947. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a sell 9 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 46.32. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 35 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -71. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a buy 0 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 6 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed up 290.822 at 8,396.777.

Mohammad-Reza Pourebrahimi, who chairs the Iranian Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs, raised the idea during a recent meeting in Moscow with Dmitry Mezentsev, the Chair of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy. He explained that the Russians “share our opinion.

Still, Iranian citizens have reportedly sent more than $2.5 billion out of the country to purchase cryptocurrencies with. US Politician Raises $100k From Crypto Community\nCongressional candidate Brian Forde has celebrated on Monday in San Francisco his campaign raising $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations. A former head of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative and Obama’s Senior Technology Advisor, he is considered to be a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile his main Democratic opponent, a former SEC enforcement attorney, has attacked Forde for his work in cryptocurrency, referring to his donors in an ad as “bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nThis contested race is shaping up to be a major example of cryptocurrency impact on electoral politics in America. It is also nice to see that the matter is now getting bipartisan support in the US. As we recently reported, on the other side of the country and the opposite side of the aisle , a Trump-supporting Republican and a bitcoin enthusiast is running to be the next New York Attorney General . Liberation Through Radical Decentralization\nVitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled “ Liberation Through Radical Decentralization .” In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work.\nThey remind us that: “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in particular emerged directly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of the traditional financial system, with ‘The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks’ carved indelibly into Bitcoin’s genesis block. That said, the decentralized technologies behind cryptocurrencies have potential applications far beyond finance.” Real Products, Real Adoption\nWith all the recent news about so many ICOs being outright scams or just failures, it’s good to remember that there are actual projects in the cryptocurrency space that are delivering real services to real users. Two recent examples are Brave and Steemit, coincidentally two different attempts to change how online content monetisation works.\nThe Brave browser recently passed 5 million downloads for the Android operating system and now boasts over 2.3 million monthly active users and over 14,000 verified publishers. And recently the one millionth account was created on the Steem blockchain, which now sees around 60,000 unique accounts transacting each day, and over 250,000 unique daily visitors for the site.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates and what they mean for the future?

that makes it more stronger. Recently, Bitcoin has crossed the border of $19,891/BTC on December 17, 2017 that is also a record high for cryptocurrecny world. You may not believe that a cryptocurrency called bitcoin which was worth .003$ in 2010, $2 in 2011, $13 in 2012 is now trading around $8000+. If you had invested of just $100 to buy BTC in 2010, can make $266 million USD today at the rate of 1 BTC = $8000 which is the current trade price. As of May, 2018, you can see this data as on media and press, according to CNBC and Washingtonpost , investment of $100 in 2010 was worth $75 million USD in May, 2018. You can clearly see, after the six months period from May, 2017 to November 2017, it goes from $75 million to $266 million which is more than x3. That means a user who invested $100 in 2010 and hold it upto 6 Years and few months i.e., till May, 2017 makes $75 million and if it holds additional 6 months, makes $266 million. Clearly show its volatility and how the world is now become crazier about this cutie. Just imagine you have invested only $100 in 2010 in bitcoin and you have sell it around its peak point lets consider $19000/BTC, you earned $633,333,333, it is approximate $633 million.\nRead more » The original post is on Blogger & SEO Technology © copyright, 2015\nMohammad Shadab\nBest Regards!

The latest case is also one of extortion and kidnapping where around Rs155 crores were taken from two bitconnect company investors, the officials said.\nShailesh Bhatt, who the cops took for a victim in the 176 bitcoins case, has turned out to be the main conspirator in the latest case, CID crime branch sleuths revealed.\nWhile investigating the 176 bitcoin case, the sleuths began a parallel probe to find a lead to Shailesh Bhatt's bitcoins' source. Bhatt was also involved in abducting the victim that took place between January 30 and February 1.\nA case was lodged against Shailesh Bhatt and his associates with the Surat CID crime on May 19. Ashish Bhatia, DGP of CID crime branch, said, \"Shailesh Bhatt and his 9 associates had hatched a conspiracy to kidnap the two bitconnect company employees and extort the bitcoins from them. Bhatt was the main conspirator and the others were used as manpower.\"\nAccording to the sleuths, the case started when Bhatt lost Rs2crore which he had invested in the bitconnect coin that closed in January. Bhatt already knew the company members as most of them were from Amreli, his native place. Out of this Rs2crore, he got Rs1.8 crore, the sleuths said. The associates have ben identified as Jignesh Marodiya, Kirit Vala, Nikunj Bhatt, Jignesh Kheni, Umesh, Bavaji, J.K Rajput, Dilip Kanani and Hitesh Jotasana.\nPosing as Income tax officers, Bhatt and his associates abducted one Piyush Savaliya on 30 January. The gang thought Savaliya, an employee, to be the administrator of the company. He was held hostage for three days at a farmhouse in Surat, during which he coughed up the name of Dhaval Mavani, the administer.\nBhatt and his associates again impersonated as Surat Crime branch officers and abducted Mavani from the parking area of his office in Surat on 1 February.\nMavani was taken to a farmhouse in Surat where he was beaten up and threatened at gunpoint to transfer the bitcoins to their wallet. With the help of one Nikunj Bhatt, 2256 bitcoins, worth Rs131 crore, were transferred to Shailesh Bhatt's blockchain wallet.\nAlso, 11000 litecoins were converted to 166 bitcoins worth Rs9.64Crorre and was transferred to Shailesh Bhatt's Binance wallet. Apart from that, Rs14.50Crore cash was extorted from Mavani and it was transferred through a Surat-based Angadia firm. Also, Rs155Crore was extorted from Mavani.\nMavani was later released with threats never to be seen in Gujarat. According to sources, Mavani initially fled to Singapore and later went to Indonesia. Savaliya, on the contrary, was also threatened to be killed if he ever disclosed anything about the incident.\nThe extorted cryptocurrencies and money was distributed by Bhatt to his associates, where Jignesh Marodiya got 500 bitcoins, Kirit Vala got 350 bitcoins, Dilip Kanani 350 bitcoins, and Shailesh Bhatt got more than 700 bitcoins.\nCID nabs two accused in the case Two accused, named Nikunj Bhatt and Dilip Kanani, were nabbed by Surat CID crime from the Surat on Sunday. The duo was allegedly involved in the abduction and kidnapping case. During investigation, the sleuths recovered 152 bitcoins from Dilip Kanani’s blockchain wallet which has a market value of Rs 8.5crore. Shailesh Bhatt, who is on the run, has switched off his mobile phone, the cops said.\nKotadiya hiding in Nepal: Cops Former MLA Nalin Kot adiya, whose name was revealed in the bitcoin case, is absconding over last 18 days. CID sleuths have issued a non-bailable warrant and a lookout notice against Kotadiya after he skipped two summons sent by the investigating agency. The cops believe that Kotadiya has fled to Nepal. Four teams of cops have been deployed to find him.\nCase began in 2016; ED probes CID officials said a major chunk of the extorted money was converted to bitcoins during the demonetisation period in 2016.\nIt is believed that a number of investors have converted their stack of black money into bitcoins.\nThe CID sleuths have also spoken to Income-Tax and Enforcement Directorate officials.\nBhatt had sent 25 men to Goa Shailesh had sent around 25 people to Goa to search Satish Khum-bhani in January. Khu-mbhani had lau-nched the bitconnect coin. Shailesh got information that Khumbhani was in Goa and had planned to abduct him. Unfortunately, Khumbhani had already left Goa and fled to some other country, when Shailesh reached.\nKotadiya, Bhatt video record out As per senior CID officials, they have recovered a voice record in which Kotadiya and Bhatt are speaking. Bhatt is heard laughing and narrating the abduction and extortion case to Kotadiya. The entire recording was done by Kotadiya.\nBitcoins Umesh Ashish Bhatia Shailesh Bhatt Bavaji CID Crime Branch Bitcoin case Piyush Savaliya Bitcoin extortion case Jignesh Marodiya Kirit Vala Nikunj Bhatt Jignesh Kheni J K Rajput Dilip Kanani Hitesh Jotasana", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ashish bhatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T04:14:10.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b023392e7876fdae2f523db7a6180002cf349ad0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFjfsgWaply8uCs18ZECik7R5FzMnrkbK11d7A5KVNXyJfpyCEmg9Og5SlV8lg0IBr74aXjioc0gg_v_jy5xwl7Le5bORnfVE0g--", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Equipment Company Canaan Plans to Raise $2B in ipo Bitcoin Mining", "title_full": "Equipment Company Canaan Plans to Raise $2B in ipo Bitcoin Mining", "published": "2018-05-22T14:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Equipment-Company-Canaan-Plans-to-Raise-2B-in-ipo-Bitcoin-Mining.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b023392e7876fdae2f523db7a6180002cf349ad0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFjfsgWaply8uCs18ZECik7R5FzMnrkbK11d7A5KVNXyJfpyCEmg9Og5SlV8lg0IBr74aXjioc0gg_v_jy5xwl7Le5bORnfVE0g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-22T14:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Equipment Company Canaan Plans to Raise $2B in ipo Bitcoin Mining", "text": " Equipment Company Canaan Plans to Raise $2B in ipo Bitcoin Mining\nCanaan, one of the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining chips and devices, submitted a listing application to the HKEX.

Eos? Litecoin? How to spot the next Ethereum", "text": "Click to followThe Evening Standard\nIn his brilliant new column in the Evening Standard, Jay talks us through the technicolour range of different crypto currencies and - most importantly - predicts which will thrive and which will die.\nJay Smith\nJimmy Song and the Maximalists may sound like a Fifties rock ‘n’ roll band, but they’re actually a highly influential group of blockchain experts.\nTheir view - if you believe them - will make you sell every cryptocurrency you own bar Bitcoin.\nYou see, Song believes there is no point investing in anything but Bitcoin, the granddaddy of cryptos, because it will be the only one to survive.\nHe and many other so-called “Bitcoin maximalists” say that, rather than waste money developing rivals, we may as well just invest in making Bitcoin faster and better, with more services built on top. Even the big cryptos like Litecoin and Ethereum are inevitably doomed, according to them. Why EOS is the most exciting new crypto in the Blockchain world\nBitcoin vs Blockchain\nSong is a smart dude - he’s made a fortune in Bitcoin and when he talks, people listen.\nHe’s also wrong.\nLast week, he got star billing at the New York Consensus 2018 conference - a sort of crypto Davos.\nHe was joined on stage by Joe Lubin, a man who has built a 500-employee tech powerhouse building apps entirely based on Song’s arch-enemy,Ethereum.\nCue some feisty verbal MMA.\nBitcoin vs Blockchain, the battle was dubbed.\nSong declared that in five years Bitcoin would be the sole crypto survivor, to which Lubin retorted: “I’ll bet you any amount of Bitcoin that you’re wrong.”\nLubin will win that bet, and here’s why:\nCryptocurrencies are no longer just currencies. In fact, one of my favourite brainiacs - Chris Burniske - prefers to call them “Crypto Assets” (he also wrote a pretty good book about them).\nIt’s a far more fitting name.\nOver the past couple of years there has been an explosion in different types of Crypto Assets.\nAnother smart guy by the name of Don Tapscott took the stage early at Consensus to outline the seven main crypto categories.\nThe Seven Types of Crypto:\n1 - The Currency ( Bitcoin , Litecoin , Dash , Monero , Zcash )\nThis is the plain vanilla: designed to be a currency like the dollar or the pound, but both digital and global. Weekend in Prague? Pay for everything with Bitcoin and you’ve got no currency commission. Got a friend on the other side of the planet who needs some money? Do it instantly and cheaply rather than wait a week for an expensive bank transfer.\nThese currencies are money for the internet age and are widely accepted online by major companies such as Microsoft, Expedia and Wikipedia.\nSome have even found their way onto our high-streets. CEX and Lush were two of the earliest to begin accepting Bitcoin in the UK. In Canada, KFC released a “Bitcoin Bucket” meal across the nation, inviting people to trade their bitcoin for chicken! These cryptos are all fighting each other to be the fastest, safest, most widely accepted and easiest to use replacement for money.\n2 - The Platform (Ethereum, EOS , Cardano , IOTA , NEO , Tron , Ark , Polkadot )\nThese cryptos are all essentially an operating system; a programmable blockchain on which you can make your own apps. They allow complex computer code to run on a blockchain rather than just simple transactions, the code that tells an app to buy you a song, play a video or download a file all stored on a decentralised network. No easy task. See my Evening Standard post from last week on EOS for an example.\nSome of these projects, such as Ark and Polkadot, are on a grand scale, attempting to build a system to connect all other blockchains with one standard. They are extremely complex.\n3 - The Utility tokens ( Augur , Golem , Siacoin , Steem , Loopring , Status )\nThese are blockchains where you need the crypto’s token to use the application.\nTake Augur, the potential Betfair killer, for example. It’s a totally revolutionary way of betting but the system requires Augur’s tokens to work.\nSiacoin is another. It’s a decentralised dropbox whereby you can rent out your spare hard-drive space, or rent some for yourself for 80% less than Google’s newly reduced drive space! The token has “utility” because only that token is accepted as payment for the service, usually exclusively.\n4 - Security tokens ( Recovery Right Tokens , BitGrail Shares, tZERO )\nThese get their name from “securities” - City language for shares, CFDs, bonds and the like. They can be divided into smaller units and are easy to own and transfer. That’s a significant advantage over your indivisible, expensive to trade, not-really-owned-by-you-personally, $1574, Amazon share.\nUnfortunately this token type has been responsible for many scams and ponzi schemes. This is almost certainly where the term “shitcoin” gained popularity.\nThe projects are not usually building anything blockchain related.\nIn fact, the suspicion among investors is often that businesses opt for a security token initial coin offering rather than a stock market flotation because they’re trying to raise money while avoiding regulation or legal repercussions if they fail.\nThey’re not all bad though, BitFinex is a crypto exchange that got hacked to the tune of $70M a few years ago. Instead of closing shop and declaring bankruptcy it created shares as a token called RRT and distributed them to the victims. Fast forward a few years and those victims are pretty happy and have now all been paid back in full . US furniture and homewares giant Overstock’s CEO Patrick Byrne has just launched tZERO, a self-described security token registered with the SEC.\n5 - Natural Asset Tokens ( Everledge r, Provenance , Digix , Sandcoin , Dignity )\nThese are really cool for those of us who get excited about crypto making the world a far better place.\nThey come in two categories - Asset Backed, and Asset Bound Tokens.\nYou create tokens to represent real natural resources - forestry, diamonds, uranium or iron ore, for example. With asset bound tokens, each tree, precious stone or nugget would be bound to a token which stays with that material every time it gets traded or processed. That gives you a clear map of its history and provenance. You can see how that might work to stamp out illegal logging, blood diamonds and the like. Because they’re digital, you could use them as a basis for carbon credit systems too.\nSee why I’m always on about crypto being a force for good?\nThe more common Asset-backed variety allows large mines to sell tokens in advance for whatever they’re going to mine over the next year or so. The token is backed by the produce, similar to how futures markets work.\nAlternatively, someone could just keep a bunch of Gold in a safe and release tokens which are backed by it. Just as with to the gold standard on the Pound or Dollar a few decades ago, you can redeem your chunk of gold with your tokens.\n6 - Crypto Collectables ( Crypto Kitties , Epics , WAX )\nThese are collectable tokens that each have their own unique stamp. Like Natural Asset tokens, they track provenance, but they’re not usually linked to something of real value. Instead, they exist entirely on their own and are used as a mechanism to create scarcity.\nThe best example so far is Crypto Kitties. Experimenting whether this “scarcity tech” could work, some clever guys came up with the idea of collectable cat tokens. Each cat has its own traits - eye colour, markings - that can be passed on when they breed. They became so successful that one particularly rare cat sold for over $140,000!\nYou know they used to talk about crypto being Tulip Mania? Well, that moment there, the $140,000 digital cat - that was Tulip Mania.\nActually, Crypto Kitties collectables could be useful for attaching to the records of limited edition luxury goods like cars, where you could have an identification token with a unique model number.\nBut, as someone who used to make a living on the esports gaming circuit, the place I see collectables having the biggest impact is in video games. For years, gamers have been able to buy or win new “skins” for their characters; turn your panda into a polar bear, or make your M16 rifle pink instead of black.\nBelieve it or not, the market for these skins was estimated to be worth $50 billion last year.\nImagine if you could turn those skins into crypto tokens: you could make them inherently more rare, easier to trade and simple to trace. You could even swap them between different games. So, your hero character in the Fortnite game could play in Call of Duty or Overwatch.\nCollection focused games like Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, Baseball Cards or even McDonalds Happy Meal toys would also make for a good fit.\n7 - Stable coins ( Tether )\nThese are cryptos where the units value is pegged to a currency and directly managed. The best example currently is Tether. Each Tether token is worth $1 and is backed by real dollars held in reserve bank accounts around the world.\nThey’re useful for electronic trading because they’re digital, obviously, and you can break the crypto down to whatever fraction of a dollar you want.\nPeople also prefer them to holding straight cash because you can trade cryptos without big fees.\nStable is a relative term though, projects such as Telegram ’s TON plans on utilising their vast funds to rebuy tokens whenever their value drops below a certain amount, and releasing more supply when it’s value increases too much.\nThat gives them the power to creates an artificial floor and ceiling on the price. Effectively making them a central bank. In recent months several nations such as Norway, Sweden and Switzerland have expressed interest in creating their own cryptocurrencies which would fit into this category.\nPretty messy, huh?\nSo you see, there’s a whole hotchpotch of cryptos, all designed to do different things and solve different problems. The more observant among you may have noticed something though. Many of the projects I’ve listed actually fit in several of these categories.\nIn fact, it’s hard to find a project that sits only in one of them.\nEthereum is a Currency, Platform, and Utility token. Its platform enables the creation of Stable tokens, Natural Asset tokens, Collectible tokens and Security tokens. Essentially, Ethereum is everything!\nWhy Jimmy Song is oh-so wrong\nWith so many different uses of cryptos already being developed and worked on, the idea that we can push everything back into just Bitcoin or just Ethereum is ludicrous. Yes people can build services on top of Bitcoin to enable everything that Ethereum and EOS enables, but it will not be specialised, and as a result will not be as efficient.\nIt’s similar to the way jobs in society evolved; back in the Stone Age your job would include hunting, security, building, cooking, cleaning, caring, politics, economics; you name it.\nThese days those are all specialised jobs, so the pros who are focused on them do the work better than ever before. Just as you wouldn’t ask a chef to design a building, you wouldn’t want to use Bitcoin (or a service built on it) to run the global supply chain IT for VW car engines. You’d find a specialist.\nPerhaps Jimmy and Joe should place their bet on the Augur betting system so we could all join in their not-so-little wager.\nI know who my money would be on.\nSo, which of these types of cryptos should you be investing in?\nThat’s the billion dollar question, and one every trader has a different view on.\nFor my money, though, logic tells you it has to be the platforms and the utility tokens.\nWe’re still at the very early stages of the platform market, meaning there is still some tremendous value yet to be realised. Personally, I wouldn’t be jumping into Ethereum because it has already grown exponentially and is now maturing - 2017 was its year.\nThis year, I’d be looking at those which are transitioning from planning to launch phase.\nEOS and Cardano certainly fit into that bracket. It’s also a good time to be looking at early crypto-based apps. Augur, Golem, Status and a handful of others built on Ethereum are approaching readiness for early adopters.\nAs a final thought, don’t forget about the currencies, Jimmy has one very strong argument for Bitcoin: it’s tried, tested and works now. If you’re looking for something safer, Bitcoin remains the crypto king.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bitfinex.com/", "https://www.iota.org/", "https://telegram.org/", "https://diamonds.everledger.io/", "https://status.im/", "https://litecoin.com/", "https://www.epicblockchain.io/", "https://www.ethereum.org/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/siacoin/", "https://www.cryptokitties.co/", "https://www.tzero.com/", "http://www.augur.net/", "https://neo.org/", "http://blog.bitfinex.com/announcements/bitfinex-recovery-right-tokens/", "https://steem.io/", "https://ark.io/", "https://golem.network/", "https://getmonero.org/", "https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/198", "https://explorer.dash.org/chain/Dash", "https://www.provenance.org/", "https://z.cash/", "https://sia.tech/", "https://tether.to/", "https://bitcoin.org/", "https://wax.io/", "https://www.cardano.org/en/home/", "https://polkadot.network/", "https://cryptocoincharts.info/pair/rrt/usd/bitfinex/10-days", "https://loopring.org/", "https://eos.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jay", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "song", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay smith jimmy song", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T16:35:39.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5113d1349fe0a07ca8ec262d96bafdf6d1e8edf9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma2ZHrrWKqSVfy3WzLSWCew-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin VS Trading forex ?", "title_full": "Bitcoin VS Trading forex ?", "published": "2018-05-22T14:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5113d1349fe0a07ca8ec262d96bafdf6d1e8edf9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdma2ZHrrWKqSVfy3WzLSWCew-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tolobua", "published": "2018-05-22T14:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin VS Trading forex ?", "text": "Forex trading will never give you such large profits with minimal investments, as it can be done with cryptocurrency!

The inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on May 20 indicated a short-term reversal which may have seen bitcoin increase to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method). Nevertheless, the bulls ran out of steam at a high of $8,644 yesterday and costs had fallen back to $8,240 at time of writing – a fall of 2.8 percent over the last twenty four hours, according to Bitfinex. The decrease did not come as a surprise, though, given the breakout lacked volume support, and a fall to $8,000 could currently be on the cards. 1-hour chart\nAs seen from the chart above, BTC dropped back beneath the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline yesterday, weakening the bulls and has generated a lower-high and lower-low pattern (bearish setup). Assuming a failed breakout usually suggests a bigger-picture bearish reversal, in this case it means the corrective rally from the low of $7,925 has finished as well as the sell-off from the May 5 high $9,990 has declared. Therefore, prices could fall beneath the immediate aid of $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) seen from the daily chart below. Daily chart\nA break below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would reinforce the bearish setup seen from the hourly chart and would allow a fall to $8,000. Note, though, the 5-day and 10-day moving averages are starting to curl upward, so if the price moves above $8,408 (daily high), the bulls may make a comeback. View\nBTC looks set to take out service at $8,207 and fall to $8,000 in the next twenty five hours. A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,000 will indicate a revival of the sell-off from the May 5 large of $9,990. In this case, bitcoin could endure a deeper sell-off towards $7,500. On the higher side, a move above $8,408 would open the doors to $8,858 (100-day moving average). A daily close above that level would indicate a bullish trend reversal and may yield rally to $10,000.\nBitcoins and USD picture via Shutterstock\n information, that strives for the highest abides by CoinDesk is an independent operating subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups.\nSources:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:27:23.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9fa1ee75a9aff50ed38de73be4800064fd52562", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSTCUscUJquBWPoHkv4GCiHwO64QFExU3R1n07_GwJh.Lf2ZgIvS8bFt5JfIbkCAL5E0Z4xNQqGNc", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Let's say I find a sha256 collision.

While the company’s IPO application remains in draft form and it remains unclear how much capital the firm intends to raise, Bloomberg reports the amount to be around $1 billion. If the IPO succeeds with the reported amount, the development will make it the most valuable IPO in the cryptocurrency industry ever. The listing of shares that will be followed by commencement of trading is expected to happen by July. This will be the first ever cryptocurrency IPO for the Hong Kong market. Financial Figures of Canaan Creative\nThe company is among the top manufacturers of ASIC chips, used for mining bitcoins and other compatible cryptocurrencies. It is primarily known for its Avalon brand of bitcoin mining chip series. It ranks second with a 15 percent global market share of bitcoin mining chips and computer equipment and trails the Chinese leader Bitmain. Its primary customer base includes large mining pools that employ hardware to gain bitcoin rewards through the standard mining process. (See also, How Does Bitcoin Mining Work? )\nAs per the IPO filing, the firm reported an annual profit of $56 million during the year 2017, which was a 500 percent increase over the previous year. It stated annual revenue of 1.3 billion yuan (around $205 million) during the year 2017, which was a gain of 3,000 percent over the previous year. Earlier Funding and Corporate Developments\nDuring May of last year, Canaan Creative successfully raised 300 million yuan (around $43 million) in Series A funding, which was then the largest ever investment in a bitcoin mining firm. The funding saw participation from leading Chinese investors like Baopu Asset Management, Jin Jiang International Group, and Tunlan Investment. It used the proceeds to expand into a new segment for developing dedicated chips that find use in artificial intelligence applications. The company also has a software enterprise unit, called Hangzhou Canaan, which is eligible for preferential tax treatment. While it paid no income tax in 2016 and 2017, it is eligible for a reduced rate of 12.5 percent between 2018 and 2020.\nIn 2016, a Chinese listed electrical equipment producer called Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric attempted to acquire Canaan, but regulators blocked the deal citing uncertainties.\nBloomberg also reports predictions by Frost & Sullivan that the Chinese ASIC -based blockchain hardware market will grow to 28.6 billion yuan by the year 2020. It jumped from 50 million yuan in 2013 to 7.3 billion yuan in 2017.

This is according to Jack Dorsey, the owner of Square . He says that Bitcoin will emerge with time to become the Internet’s “native currency”, with the increasing popularity of the currency to overrun other internet currencies and become a preferred medium of exchange. Bitcoin’s predicted future dominance\nJack Dorsey predicted the future dominance of Bitcoin back in March 2018 during an interview with Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs, where he expressed belief that when native internet currency emerged, Bitcoin would be at the fore..\nSpeaking during the Consensus 2018 Conference in New York, he said that the internet deserved a native digital currency that would become the mode of all payments for all transactions running across the web. The digital marketplace\nThe concept of digital currency is entrenched in the world of online trade. In many instances, new digital currency such as Bitcoin has been the subject of discussion.\n“Similarly, a day never lapses at Square without people discussing the idea of Bitcoin dominating the future of all internet transactions,” added Dorsey. Despite some people being skeptical about the digital currency, the open access policy will inspire its quest for dominance in all internet payments. Payments solutions boosting the rise of Bitcoin\nAdditionally, the payment solutions developed for blockchain recognizes the significance of Bitcoin.\n“At Square, any payment that comes across our table, the seller should be able to accept it,” remarked Dorsey. Square is in the payment industry and applauds Bitcoin’s role in ensuring swift and safe payments through the internet.\nSquare has a system that accepts Bitcoin payments. According to Mike Brock, an engineer at Square, the reason why they settled on Bitcoin is because of its simplicity. Simple payments\nMike and Dorsey were eyeing simple internet payments that would work like any other common dollar payments. With Bitcoin, simple transactions like coffee purchases would not look any different as a transaction, so much so that cashiers might not even notice that the payment was in Bitcoin.\nSquare will build systems that will accommodate the payments for consumers and merchants. It wants to push for the acceptance and the dominance of Bitcoin payments by developing payment solutions. However, according to Dorsey, the goal for all these payment solutions must remain the same – just like walking into a coffee shop and making payments with Bitcoin.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Bitcoin Predicted to Dominate Future of Online Marketplaces appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

The hard fork happened following the controversy over the integration of SegWit feature with Bitcoin’s blockchain.\nA host of forks have since followed — christened by adding any random word you can imagine next to Bitcoin: Candy , Pizza , God , Faith , Diamond , Gold , Atom , etc.\nMost of the forked cryptocurrencies, however, don’t seem to have had any luck when it comes to adoption or trading volumes.\nAs per Coinmarketcap data, only four of the forks (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Private) see trading volumes of more than $100,000 per 24 hours.\nBitcoin’s software is open-sourced, and a hard fork happens when a developer clones the Bitcoin’s blockchain to make a new blockchain and cryptocurrency by modifying the original code.\nIdeally, the purpose of a hard fork is to make technical advancements in the existing blockchain, when some people still want to keep using the consensus protocol of the older blockchain.\nBut it seems that most of the hard forks are only aimed at minting quick money using Bitcoin’s name rather than bringing any significant advancements in blockchain technology.\n“Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab,” George Kimionis, CEO of Coinomi told Bloomberg at the beginning of this year predicting that 2018 will see the launch of at least 50 Bitcoin hard forks. “Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases — rather than honest attempts to contribute to the blockchain ecosystem.”\nWith services such as Forkgen , which allow even rookie programmers to create Bitcoin hard forks, it is likely that the number will end up being a lot higher.\nLet’s see what names they’ll come up with — I am rooting for Bitcoin Butter Chicken Masala.

They found that between January 30 and February 1, Bhatt and his associate had kidnapped bitconnect investment company Admin Dhaval Mavani and Piyush Savaliya, an employee of the company, and had extorted 2,256 bitcoins, 11,000 litecoins and Rs14.50 crore from them.\nFurther investigations revealed that Bitconnect Investment company was initiated by Satish Khumbhani, a native of Amreli, and was earlier based in the UK. CID officers said Khumbhani had launched the bitconnect coin through the Initial Coin Offering where he had started a scheme in December 2016.\nThe company had guaranteed investors up to 40% return per month. BitConnect followed a four-tier investment system based on the sum of the initial deposit, the more cash you put down, the bigger and faster profits you could rake in. Which also made it somewhat akin to a pyramid scheme.\nAs per officers, the value of the bitconnect coin went up to $445 in two years from $5 to $6. In January 2018, the company abruptly announced it was shutting down its lending and exchange service and duped its investors.\nThe investors' money was taken by the Khumbhani and he also distributed it among his more than 10 agents in Surat and then he fled away from the country. The 10 agents included Dhaval Mavani also, who was the Administrator of the company and software engineer, who also got a major part.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted.

For example, Bitcoin’s engimatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, or the fact that much of Bitcoin’s historical moments are emblazoned forever in archived internet chat forums.\nAnother (perhaps lesser-known) piece of Bitcoin ’s mythology is today, May 22. What could be so special about a day like today, you ask?\nHelp us to make Finance Magnates better!\nWell, it’s Bitcoin pizza day: a holiday that combines one of the most powerful global pop cultural movements of 2017-18 with the most meme-licious and celebrated food of the last several years. Now that’s a holiday.\nThe story goes back to May 22nd, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid another Bitcoin talk forum user for two Papa John’s pizzas for the low, low price of 10,000 BTC (worth about $25 at the time.) What Toppings Would You Put on Your $80 Million Pizza?\nNowadays, that 10,000 BTC is worth roughly $82,479,400. Yep. The #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day!\n— Bitcoin Pizza  (@bitcoin_pizza) May 22, 2018\nIn an interview with the New York Times that took place last year, Hanyecz said, “It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.”\nOf course, Hanyecz is right. Satoshi Nakamoto themself was unsure of the future of BTC–although they did believe that Bitcoin would either be huge, or that it would be nothing at all: “in a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for [mining] nodes. I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.”\nNowadays, you can buy just about anything with Bitcoin, although it might take a long time to download the necessary apps and for the transaction itself to be confirmed. You can even buy pizza–although you may not want to pay 10,000 BTC for it.\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/ceo-defunct-mt-gox-doesnt-want-get-rich-taking-%E2%80%8Ecreditors-bitcoins/", "https://twitter.com/bitcoin_pizza/status/998748808514334721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/guide-sending-receiving-bitcoin/", "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRisHN0415X-E5Ru16ORunEn_qNxIuhGgZIlFqtW8ul0HEpg/viewform?usp=sf_link", "https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/interactive-brokers-introduces-nextshares-funds-with-no-transaction-fees/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:58:29.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a1d1af8f86b67bdaf25afc4cf0c4f2bcbedf02f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQXEKxCbWm0tAMv9q3fXZrs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can bitcoin turns into physical form?", "title_full": "Can bitcoin turns into physical form?", "published": "2018-05-22T13:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a1d1af8f86b67bdaf25afc4cf0c4f2bcbedf02f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQXEKxCbWm0tAMv9q3fXZrs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "brightology", "published": "2018-05-22T13:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can bitcoin turns into physical form?", "text": "I don't think so, Bitcoin is designed to be a decentralized online currency.

Thus, prices could drop below the immediate support of $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) seen in the daily chart below. Daily chart\nA break below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement) would bolster the bearish setup seen in the hourly chart and would allow a drop to $8,000.\nNote, though, that the 5-day and 10-day moving averages are beginning to curl upwards, so if the price moves above $8,408 (daily high), the bulls could make a comeback. View BTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and drop to $8,000 in the next 24 hours. A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,000 would signal a revival of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990. In such a case, bitcoin could suffer a deeper sell-off towards $7,500. On the higher side, a move above $8,408 would open the doors to $8,858 (100-day moving average). A daily close above that level would signal a bullish trend reversal and could yield rally to $10,000.\nBitcoins and USD image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Astonishing price shifts, legislation changes, and bold predictions for the future are all everyday matters with Bitcoin.\nTherefore, there is a chance that you missed out on the following stories. These are all potentially big changes in the Bitcoin world as well as being interesting pieces of news that are well worth taking a look at.\nThe Switch to Bitcoin Gaming It is clear that Bitcoin owners have more ways of spending their coins than ever before. More and more companies now allow customers to use this virtual currency to pay for their goods and services. Yet, it is still viewed by many as being more of an investment than as a currency for spending.\nThis is why it is important to note the shift towards Bitcoin in industries such as online gaming. It is becoming increasingly common for gamblers to use this currency to fund their playing on slots, blackjack, roulette and other classic casino games.\nThe main players in this industry haven't yet started accepting Bitcoin but it wouldn't be a great surprise to see this happen soon. By looking at the social media offerings of well-known casino sites such as Mr. Green we can see that these are typically forward-looking, innovative brands.\nThe Sky-High Mining Operation A fascinating news headline recently told us that a Bitcoin mining operation has started high in the sky. As unlikely as it sounds, this is a true story. It is based on an eye-catching initiative from the Miner One mining firm.\nThey sent up one of their Bitcoin mining rigs to an altitude of 35,000 meters (close to 22 miles) using a hydrogen balloon. This height was chosen to reflect the fact that the company had predicted earlier this year that Bitcoin would hit a price of $35,000 in 2018.\nWhile this might seem like a simple publicity stunt, it could have a major effect on the future of Bitcoin. One of the big worries about the currency is the amount of energy needed to mine coins. By putting mining rigs in space could solar energy be used instead?\nSource: Pixabay\nSmart Bitcoin Banknotes Issued Is it likely that people are still reluctant to use cryptocurrencies because of the lack of physical notes or coins? This is certainly possible. We are so used to paying with fiat currency that the switch to Bitcoin may be tough for some to even imagine.\nA multi-national company has recently made a move to alleviate any fears that may still lurk in the minds of cryptocurrency users. Tangem announced in Singapore that they are launching smart bitcoin banknotes in denominations of 0.01 and 0.05 BTC.\nThe announcement was made in the Megafash Suntec City store. They said that the \"first shipment of 10,000 production notes\" would soon be delivered to partners around the globe. Touching a banknote with an NFC smartphone confirms its validity.\nWith these and other interesting developments, it appears certain that the huge worldwide interest in Bitcoin isn't going to slow down anytime soon.\nImage : \" Poker Chips and Face Cards - Poker \" ( CC BY 2.0 ) by pokerphotos\nThe post Exciting Bitcoin Developments You May Have Missed appeared first on Bitcoin Network, News, Charts, Guides & Analysis .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:00:00.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b4496be35f1afb8e635c2ebd2befdfb404654fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR.pjcCQ.7z2T6ltX1UmVcQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What will happen with Bitcoin if it never scales?", "title_full": "What will happen with Bitcoin if it never scales?", "published": "2018-05-22T12:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.021, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b4496be35f1afb8e635c2ebd2befdfb404654fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR.pjcCQ.7z2T6ltX1UmVcQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pan Troglodytes", "published": "2018-05-22T12:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "What will happen with Bitcoin if it never scales?", "text": "I believe that the scaling problem of the bitcoin that exists nowadays is just because of the fights that they have over the access to this cryptocurrency and the way to control it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:16:13.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fbfbbfc3674dd1f973d5cac2d279d3b9de97456a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LofqelZk4JoQfOUZHtg8NZA-", "site_full": "www.instaforex.com", "site": "instaforex.com", "site_section": "http://news.instaforex.com/en/analytics/rss/?x=BAED", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex analysis review", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 22, 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for May 22, 2018", "published": "2018-05-22T12:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fbfbbfc3674dd1f973d5cac2d279d3b9de97456a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LofqelZk4JoQfOUZHtg8NZA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T12:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 22, 2018", "text": "22.05.2018 11:56 Bitcoin analysis for May 22, 2018\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading downwards.

That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender’s mobile device close to the recipient’s device. That’s why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.”\nnChain is a company that promotes, in its own words, “Bitcoin Cash as the true Bitcoin”. To this end, it promotes the use of blockchain technology via “open source, royalty-free software tools”. It employs around 60 scientists, engineers and researchers, notably including Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto.\nThe company’s blog page heavily features posts by and about Wright, and includes one entitled “A Wheelbarrow of Academic Achievements”. It is a video of Wright proving to a crowd that he is in fact qualified by showing them his certificates, which are brought to the stage in an actual wheelbarrow.\nOne’s opinion of nChain will thus likely correlate with one’s opinion of Wright and Bitcoin Cash. I feel it is relevant to mention that a May 2017 article in Hackernoon notes that the nChain website is not secure; one year later it still isn’t.\nBitcoin Cash is a spinoff of Bitcoin. In many ways it is a more useful cryptocurrency because it can be used to purchase cheap things, unlike its parent, but it is criticised by many because of its contentious claim of being the true Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash advocates will insist on referring to Bitcoin as ‘Bitcoin Core’.\nThe figurehead of Bitcoin Cash is a man called Roger Ver. Ver owns a website called Bitcoin.com, and is currently facing a lawsuit over claims that the website is fooling people that wanted to buy Bitcoin into buying Bitcoin Cash by misleading labelling.\nControversy aside, this is not the first time that NFC technology and cryptocurrency have met. In April we reported on a developer who is working on making contactless Bitcoin payments possible by using NFC chips and the Lightning Network . The latter is a system which enables fast and small-scale Bitcoin payments. It was first used for a real payment in January 2018.\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/hey-presto-developer-proposes-contactless-bitcoin-payments/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/want-to-see-evidence-that-craig-wright-is-satoshi-fk-off/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/speed-instant-fee-zero-future-almost/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/boom-bust-meltdown-oh-ongoing-saga-bitcoin-cash/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/buterin-calls-craig-wright-fraud-deconomy-conference/", "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRisHN0415X-E5Ru16ORunEn_qNxIuhGgZIlFqtW8ul0HEpg/viewform?usp=sf_link", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-com-faces-lawsuit-confusingly-labelled-wallet/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex agut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy nguyen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash research centre to offer contactless bitcoin cash payments bitcoin cash research centre", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:58:29.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "556b9c6747b903a37f1c70091356dd79fa53ea46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQcDcyVtETQ6miyq2lvjaQToH6ZRFAUd7waPVypXDnBmxowqKl3esfbA8n1RtfZMv_SlerbbCzIXK8FkQcpjmNGQUtOGgATwKVS6sHu9_SFqAx1zKXNAIQz7TkrSzAvq9w", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, IOTA, EOS: Price Analysis, M…", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, IOTA, EOS: Price Analysis, M…", "published": "2018-05-22T12:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hqdefault-1589.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "556b9c6747b903a37f1c70091356dd79fa53ea46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQcDcyVtETQ6miyq2lvjaQToH6ZRFAUd7waPVypXDnBmxowqKl3esfbA8n1RtfZMv_SlerbbCzIXK8FkQcpjmNGQUtOGgATwKVS6sHu9_SFqAx1zKXNAIQz7TkrSzAvq9w", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Canadian Stock Trader", "published": "2018-05-22T12:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, IOTA, EOS: Price Analysis, M…", "text": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, IOTA, EOS: Price Analysis, May 07 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, IOTA, EOS: Price Analysis, M… Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "iota", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:33:49.025+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 13909, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=18300", "requestsLeft": 479}
