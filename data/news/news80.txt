The users of the app are demanding an ever-wider, diversified crypto portfolio as the crypto sector expands and moves even further into the mainstream.” After the app released earlier this year, Green explained: “All the digital coins on Devere Crypto have different characteristics, strengths and values.

The survey’s findings demonstrate that high net worth individuals are increasingly unable to ignore the huge potential of cryptocurrencies. There’s now surging public awareness of the value, need and demand for digital, global currencies in a digitalised, globalised world. I expect that a broader awareness and understanding of the crypto sector will grow exponentially in the next year as the tech that underpins it further improves, as major corporations and financial institutions embrace it, and as regulation is further developed.”\nWhat do you think about Devere adding BCH and EOS support?

The users of the app are demanding an ever-wider, diversified crypto portfolio as the crypto sector expands and moves even further into the mainstream.\" After the app released earlier this year, Green explained: \"All the digital coins on Devere Crypto have different characteristics, strengths and values. As such these additions help to achieve portfolio diversification within this specific asset class and their individual traits make them useful in different ways for investors. I believe that there is no longer any doubt that cryptocurrencies in some form are the future of money.\"\nHNWIs Shedding some light on why the group has entered the crypto market, it also released the findings of a new poll in which it is revealed that 35% of high net worth individuals are now already invested in or will make investments in cryptocurrencies before the end of 2018. According to Devere, the 600+ respondents of this poll are some of the group's wealthy clients who currently reside in the U.S., the UK, Australia, the UAE, Qatar, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Spain, France, Germany and South Africa.\nCEO Green opined : \"This mainstream expansion is clearly evidenced by the fact that more than a third of wealthy individuals around the world – who are already likely to be successful investors – are telling us that they already have exposure to crypto or that they will have by the end of this year. The survey's findings demonstrate that high net worth individuals are increasingly unable to ignore the huge potential of cryptocurrencies. There's now surging public awareness of the value, need and demand for digital, global currencies in a digitalised, globalised world. I expect that a broader awareness and understanding of the crypto sector will grow exponentially in the next year as the tech that underpins it further improves, as major corporations and financial institutions embrace it, and as regulation is further developed.\"\nWhat do you think about Devere adding BCH and EOS support?

So far, the total market value of the cryptocurrency market ($306.3 billion) has been reduced by half compared to the record high of the beginning of the year ($830 billion). What’s “surprise” will cryptocurrency market give to us in the following months?\n2018 cryptocurrency difficult to rise again?\nLast year, the cryptocurrency market did not involve institutional investors and the market was handed over to a group of retail investors. Without short-selling trading tools, investors who are bullish on Bitcoin have pushed prices up all the way and investors who are bearish on Bitcoin cannot participate. This unbalanced phenomenon led to the bull market of cryptocurrency by the end of 2017.\nWith more and more uncertain and even negative factors appearing in the value equations, by the end of 2018, the cryptocurrency market was likely to “dismal”. Then we take a look at the performance of some cryptocurrencies in the market today:\n1,\nCapricoin\nCapricoin was jointly developed by a group of European and American technology companies. Cape Currency aims to become a mainstream cryptocurrency. This is a new generation of cryptocurrency with the latest available technologies; it uses advanced encryption technology based on a global peer-to-peer network to ensure its confidentiality. Capricoin Currency aims to establish a global real-time payment network so that anyone in the world can experience truly zero-cost transactions. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Capricoin can quickly confirm transactions and can handle business-level transaction volumes. Capricoin currency membership is distributed by the user’s network. In order to prevent inflation, Capricoin implement a limited supply of money. Once mined, there will be at most 210 million Capricoin currencies.\nCapricoin (currency: CPC ) on today June 1st, trading down 0.93%, Capricoin price is about $0.78, has a market cap of $1,562,052 USD, its 24 hours trading volume is about $32,657 USD.\n2, DOVU\nThe DOVU protocol allows data owners (individuals, organizations, IoT devices — any data source) to control access to shared data and obtain DOVU tokens in return for using that data. These tokens are then feed back to the ecosystem by moving traffic-related transactions, such as offsetting the cost of using the car, refueling the car, paying flight expenses, or taking a bus. The DOVU Agreement promotes and encourages the development of an unlimited number of distributed applications related to mobile traffic. Ethereum-based DOVu tokens are used when trading with these distributed applications. Using DOVU’s circular economy can create previously impossible mobile services, which makes the potential of distributed applications built through the DOVU platform unlimited.\nDOVU price today is about $0.094 trading down 2.71%. DOVU has a market cap of $7,004,702 USD, its 24 hours trading volume is about $7,770 USD.\n3, Innova\nInnova is a decentralized cryptocurrency, secure digital currency operated by user networks, using masternodes full nodes, just like in bitcoin networks, they provide a network service and require collateral to participate. When the masternode is running, the collateral can never be confiscated and it is safe. This allows investors to provide services for the network, earn investment interest, and reduce currency fluctuations.\nInnova price is about $0.37 and today has a good performance that its price rise 6.43%. Innova has a market cap of $1,247,820 USD, its 24 hours trading volume is about $6,977 USD.\n4, Bolivarcoin\nBolivarcoin abbreviated as BOLI, boli is a virtual currency created by satoshisimon bolivarmoto from Venezuela. Our goal is to create a credible cryptocurrency supported by Venezuelan citizens and natural resources in Venezuela. The philosophy of bolivarcoin is to follow the ideas developed by others and to promote its merits and uses by creating social media campaigns. Bolivarcoin price today is about $0.015, trading down 6.97%, Bolivarcoin has a market cap of $157,404 USD, its 24 hours trading volume is about $306 USD.\n5, EOS\nEOS is so popular that many people know, while in these 2 days, the high-risk loopholes in EOS that caused a lot of buzz have triggered the anxiety and people in the digital currency market.\nQihoo 360, the giant in the traditional Internet security field, has become a red-hot blockchain industry by relying solely on a high-risk vulnerability warning. Although EOS founder BM pointed out that it was a premeditated manufacturing panic, Block.one eventually launched the EOSIO vulnerabilities program with HackerOne security platform, which indirectly instilled hope and vitality for the EOS chain’s ecological construction. So what about EOS price today? Will it fall down due to this mater? Eos coin value is $12.22, trading down 1.05%, has a market cap of $10,924,800,330 USD.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://citicoins.com/Innova", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0nZjDq74zt4HwGF8bYk9oQ.jpeg", "https://citicoins.com/Capricoin", "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J3ChAIjsj5dYdCXmP_g5ww.jpeg", "https://citicoins.com/", "https://citicoins.com/bitcoin", "https://citicoins.com/eos", "https://citicoins.com/Bolivarcoin", "https://citicoins.com/DOVU"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T22:23:22.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c07b2d9fc3eadd00c4c1d663b9b54d0dc2b6122e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme_gyDIdMISwwrTm1REZPvY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin failed as a currency", "title_full": "Bitcoin failed as a currency", "published": "2018-06-01T00:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c07b2d9fc3eadd00c4c1d663b9b54d0dc2b6122e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme_gyDIdMISwwrTm1REZPvY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "paulmaritz", "published": "2018-06-01T00:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin failed as a currency", "text": "Quote: from: brawdias on April 23, 2018, 11:30:57 PM Bitcoin was supposed to be used as a currency, not only a form of investment.

Bittrex is working with New York-based Signature Bank, which will hold the dollar-denominated funds, along with other financial firms.\n“It’s been a long path,” Bittrex Chief Executive Officer Bill Shihara said in an interview. “It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.”\nLarger financial institutions, bound to strict government regulations on money laundering and customer verification, have mostly avoided putting their reputations at risk by getting involved with an industry that many still associate with criminal activity. As a result, some virtual-currency marketplaces are “crypto-to-crypto” only, meaning that they allow customers to trade using digital money, not dollars.\nSome banks are coming around. Coinbase, one of the biggest U.S. crypto trading venues, has developed relationships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the U.S., and recently secured a Barclays PLC bank account in the U.K. Noble Bank International, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, took over banking duties for Bitfinex last year after the exchange was dumped by Wells Fargo & Co., three people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.\n“They really do look and pore through the entire business,” Shihara said. “They want to make sure that we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes, that we’ve got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts.”\nBittrex, which has more than 3 million customers globally, is launching fiat trading Thursday for Bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD.

Heping, Sina Finance ile yaptığı röportajda Blockchainin kesinlikle merkeziyetsizlik demek olmadığını ve Bitcoinin 7000 dolar seviyelerine düşmesinin sebebinin merkez bankalarının işlerine doğrudan bir tehdit oluşturması olduğunu söyledi.\nBlockchainin kesinlikle merkeziyetsizliğe eşit olmadığı sözüne açıklık getiren Cao, Zincirdeki her katılımcının bir merkezdir. Bu nedenle Blockchain kısmen merkezi bir platformdur. dedi.\nHükümetler, Bitcoinin gelişimini sınırlamak isterler\nCao sözlerinin devamında, Bitcoin, ilk kez bize Blockchain teknolojisinin alternatif bir para birimi yaratma potansiyeline sahip olduğunu ve dolaşımdaki nakit para miktarını gösteren M0 para arzını değiştireceğini anlatır. Bitcoin neden şimdi 7000 dolar seviyelerine düşüyor? Çünkü Bitcoin M0 olarak görülebilir ve merkez bankalarına doğrudan bir tehdit oluşturur, bu nedenle hükümetler Bitcoinin gelişimini sınırlamak isterler. şeklinde konuştu.\nBlockchainle harika hikayeler göreceğiz\nBlockchain teknolojisinin ticari bankalar tarafından çözülemeyen bazı problemleri ele aldığını ve büyük miktarda maliyetten tasarruf getirdiğini söyleyen Cao, Eğer Blockchain üniversitelerin, hastanelerin ve otellerin yönetimine entegre edilecekse harika hikayeler göreceğiz.

Bu muhtemelen kısa ve uzun vadede bir tehdit oluşturacak. Zamanla Bitcoinin benimseme oranı daha fazla olduğunda ve piyasada daha fazla likidite gördüğünüzde bence istikrarlı bir fiyata sahip olabiliriz. dedi.\nLider kripto para Bitcoin, geçtiğimiz yılın Aralık ayında 20 bin dolara ulaşarak tarihi zirvesini elde etti, ardından uzun süren ve bugüne kadar ulaşan bir ayı piyasasına girdi. Şu sıralarda 7300 dolardan işlem gören Bitcoin, 20 bin dolarla kıyaslandığında yüzde 60ın üzerinde değer kaybetti.\nBazı uzmanlar, Bitcoinin yaklaşık 6 aydır düşüşte olmasını 17 Aralıkta piyasaya sürülen Bitcoin vadelileriyle ilişkilendiriyor. Bu teoriye göre, 17 Aralıktan önce büyük miktarda Bitcoin stoklandı ve bu da fiyatın 20 bin dolara ulaşmasını sağladı. Ardından Bitcoin vadelilerinin piyasaya sürülmesiyle kısa pozisyonlar arttı ve Bitcoin, 6 aydır süren bir ayı piyasası dönemine girdi.\nHemen hemen aynı bakış açısını sunan bir başka teoriye göre ise Bitcoinde kısa pozisyon alan ayıların gazı tükenmek üzere, bu da yakında ayı piyasasının son bulacağına işaret ediyor.\nHaber linki : https://uzmancoin.com/bitcoin-volatilite-etoro/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://uzmancoin.com/bitcoin-volatilite-etoro/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T21:10:29.054+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06b60db4fe2e597687009d309c334524163569a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR.gVMyOUYDw2tI.p6Svc5Zaj3AMCdSK_0SIryXJh5VTJwR.SnRSk3rCtbXgy8qksC8wCEbxkaWU3Z4VeuyD3Brc-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "\"Ask me About Bitcoin Cash\" T-Shirts & other BCH promotional materials for sale - help support BCH adoption!", "title_full": "\"Ask me About Bitcoin Cash\" T-Shirts & other BCH promotional materials for sale - help support BCH adoption! : btc", "published": "2018-06-01T00:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.285, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06b60db4fe2e597687009d309c334524163569a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR.gVMyOUYDw2tI.p6Svc5Zaj3AMCdSK_0SIryXJh5VTJwR.SnRSk3rCtbXgy8qksC8wCEbxkaWU3Z4VeuyD3Brc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "V-Nadjka", "published": "2018-06-01T00:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "\"Ask me About Bitcoin Cash\" T-Shirts & other BCH promotional materials for sale - help support BCH adoption!", "text": "submitted by /u/V-Nadjka\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cafepress.com/bitcoincashpromotionalmaterials"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T21:00:35.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "254c587aac7ec6c1df9629d19830a9d4c6c1a507", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU_F3bn196_aFJl79pR8ND8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin the success ladder.", "title_full": "Bitcoin the success ladder.", "published": "2018-06-01T00:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "254c587aac7ec6c1df9629d19830a9d4c6c1a507", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU_F3bn196_aFJl79pR8ND8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "addeqt", "published": "2018-06-01T00:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin the success ladder.", "text": "One thing that bitcoin thought me is that you cant undo the past.

And they want to help.\nAt Castle Craig, a 30-year-old Scottish addiction rehab facility, which treats drug, alcohol, and gambling addictions, crypto-users can now find some solace. Surrounded by the scenic countryside outside of Edinburgh, addicted cryptocurrency traders can seek treatment through the center’s gambling program.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, said in a press release that bitcoin trading, with its fast pace and potential for high risk and high reward, appeals to the same types of personalities drawn to gambling.\n“It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made,” said Burn.\nBitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, became a household name after its value skyrocketed last year. Worth just a few dollars in 2011, the once-obscure, digital-only currency rose to a high of nearly $20,000 in December.\nSince then, millions have swarmed into the bitcoin market looking for a cut of the gains. As of late 2017, Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency trading platform, had 13 million users, according to CNBC . But the currency is volatile, and people have lost big in recent months as bitcoin's value plummeted.\nRead: Criminals are racing to cash out their bitcoin. Here's how they're doing it.\nAll to say, there are opportunities for serious gains — and serious losses. Among the biggest losers in the big bitcoin downturn of early 2018 were Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins known for trying to wrest control of Facebook, alleging that Mark Zuckerberg appropriated their idea for the company. They lost nearly $1 billion in bitcoin.\nFor some, according to Castle Craig, the act of trading can become compulsive.\nThrough a 12-step program, Burn and his colleagues are trying to intervene to help those who can’t help but trade bitcoin — especially those who have incurred serious financial losses because of their addiction.\nCastle Craig said it had been receiving requests for such a program, according to MarketWatch , and they’ve received hundreds of inquiries from around the world since announcing they'd be treating crypto addiction.\nCover image : A view of a Bitcoin coin with the writing 'Bitcoin Digital' in Dortmund, Germany, 9 February 2018.

Has established an official agreement with Signature Bank in NY to allow corporate customers in specific states to buy virtual tokens using USD. The move was designed to increase the sum of institutional capital which makes its way throughout the crypto space. Ceo of Bittrex Bill Shihara claims that the exchange has been working on this partnership for months. It is been a long route, he remarked. It isn’t just about banks having the ability to trust Bittrex, it is about banks having the ability to trust crypto generally, and I think it is really showing that crypto is turning the corner with regards to mainstream acceptance.\n, Due to the regulatory uncertainty surrounding virtual currencies, many recognized financial institutions continue to associate them with money laundering and related criminal activity, and have chosen to avoid them altogether. Last Feb, as an example, clients who tried to buy electronic money through Citigroup were treated until serious delays and canceled trades after the investment firm made the choice to bar users from purchasing crypto with their debit cards or checking accounts. This decision was later reproduced by institutions such as Chase and Bank of America, both of which employed bans preventing clients from buying cryptocurrencies on major exchanges.\nTherefore, many digital currency markets still only allow clients to trade between digital assets, as opposed to dollar for crypto or vice versa. But some banks are starting to show signs of change in both mindset and business protocol, and became more composed of cryptocurrencies. Popular electronic money exchange Coinbase has lately partnerships developed with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank at the United States. The company has garnered a Barclays PLC banking account in the United Kingdom. Noble Bank International at San Juan, Puerto Rico, also took over banking obligations for Bitfinex in 2017 after the market’s relationship with Wells Fargo came to a sudden conclusion.\nDiscussing the requirements of traditional banks, Shihara went on to state, They truly do look and pour throughout the entire business. They would like to make sure we have got robust AML/KYC procedures and that we have got the right controls on our financing. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts. ,Bittrex, which allows approximately 3 million customers around the world, allows consumers to trade up to 200 different digital coins. Fiat trading capacities will also be launched on May 31, 2018, for bitcoins, Tether and TrueUSD. At press time, the agency is only available to corporate customers in NY, California, Washington and Montana, however executives say they’re working to expand this ability to retail investors once the regulations are better defined.\nSources:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bittrex bill shihara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bittrex lands bank agreement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bittrex inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citigroup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "signature bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T01:43:09.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a5b8d4692ca2898679c8526224e19de9d567b5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR44MnS14Xz5olpiUGESs20sDZpJXUsnQXx60AyMQaFR0iAsEygNAUYs0hwQ7cf4mTbqyu1IEnUda8AIgyeFAJeisMOLnQkJRhQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "We have peer-to-peer ridesharing, peer-to-peer housing, peer-to-peer crowdfunding.

The move is designed to increase the amount of institutional capital making its way through the crypto space.\nChief executive officer of Bittrex Bill Shihara says the exchange has been working on this partnership for months. “It’s been a long path,” he commented. “It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex; it’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general, and I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.”\nDue to regulatory uncertainty surrounding virtual currencies, many established financial institutions continue to associate them with money laundering and related criminal activity, and have chosen to avoid them altogether. Last February, for example, customers who tried to purchase digital currency through Citigroup were treated to serious delays and cancelled transactions after the investment firm made the decision to bar users from buying crypto using their debit cards or checking accounts.\nThis decision was later replicated by establishments like Chase and Bank of America, both of which implemented bans preventing customers from purchasing cryptocurrencies on major exchanges. Thus, many virtual currency marketplaces still only allow customers to trade between digital assets, rather than dollar for crypto or vice versa.\nHowever, some banks are beginning to show signs of change in both attitude and business protocol, and have become more welcoming of cryptocurrencies. Popular digital currency exchange Coinbase has recently developed partnerships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the United States. The company has even garnered a Barclays PLC bank account in the United Kingdom .\nNoble Bank International in San Juan, Puerto Rico, also took over banking duties for Bitfinex in 2017 after the exchange’s relationship with Wells Fargo came to a sudden end.\nDiscussing the needs of traditional banks, Shihara went on to say, “They really do look and pour through the entire business. They want to make sure we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes and that we’ve got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts.”\nBittrex, which boasts roughly 3 million customers around the world, allows users to trade up to 200 different digital coins. Fiat trading capabilities will also be launched May 31, 2018, for bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD. At press time, the service is only available to corporate clients in New York, California, Washington and Montana, though executives say they are working to expand this capability to retail investors once regulations are more defined.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/bitfinex-may-have-found-a-new-caribbean-partner-after-wells-fargo-divorce", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-31/bittrex-gets-bank-agreement-to-help-you-buy-bitcoin-with-dollars", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/jpmorgan-chase-bank-of-america-bar-bitcoin-buys-with-a-credit-card.html", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/", "https://cryptona.co/bittrex-obtains-bank-agreement-to-help-its-customers-buy-bitcoin-using-us-dollars/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/coinbase-cryptocurrency-exchange-opens-bank-account-with-barclays-in-uk.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/05/investing/bitcoin-banks-credit-cards-lloyds/index.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bittrex bill shihara", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bittrex lands bank agreement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citigroup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "signature bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bittrex inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bittrex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T00:41:35.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c993aaaf0640fe405f9c5bb6b094f2d924fcd0e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA5rJqJHfFHpJ4mK6EZ0tEJ3Fv0YZqoDYFBNqtMc1zLNguGx4nbQf2hitHqyyp5Rx5PLvBBmZQvqufTLdLqU.OeqMn1ET9uRfUk-", "site_full": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Magazine", "title": "Bittrex Lands Bank Agreement to Help Customers Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "title_full": "Bittrex Lands Bank Agreement to Help Customers Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "published": "2018-05-31T23:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 78582, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c993aaaf0640fe405f9c5bb6b094f2d924fcd0e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA5rJqJHfFHpJ4mK6EZ0tEJ3Fv0YZqoDYFBNqtMc1zLNguGx4nbQf2hitHqyyp5Rx5PLvBBmZQvqufTLdLqU.OeqMn1ET9uRfUk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nick Marinoff", "published": "2018-05-31T23:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bittrex Lands Bank Agreement to Help Customers Buy Bitcoin With Dollars", "text": "05.31.18 4:30 PM Bittrex Lands Bank Agreement to Help Customers Buy Bitcoin With Dollars\nSeattle-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex Inc. has established a formal agreement with Signature Bank in New York to allow corporate clients in specific states to purchase virtual tokens using USD.

Thus, many virtual currency marketplaces still only allow customers to trade between digital assets, rather than dollar for crypto or vice versa.\nHowever, some banks are beginning to show signs of change in both attitude and business protocol, and have become more welcoming of cryptocurrencies. Popular digital currency exchange Coinbase has recently developed partnerships with Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the United States. The company has even garnered a Barclays PLC bank account in the United Kingdom .\nNoble Bank International in San Juan, Puerto Rico, also took over banking duties for Bitfinex in 2017 after the exchange’s relationship with Wells Fargo came to a sudden end.\nDiscussing the needs of traditional banks, Shihara went on to say, “They really do look and pour through the entire business. They want to make sure we’ve got robust AML/KYC processes and that we’ve got the right controls on our finances. They do background checks and everything. They really look at our business soup to nuts.”\nBittrex, which boasts roughly 3 million customers around the world, allows users to trade up to 200 different digital coins. Fiat trading capabilities will also be launched May 31, 2018, for bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD. At press time, the service is only available to corporate clients in New York, California, Washington and Montana, though executives say they are working to expand this capability to retail investors once regulations are more defined.

As many traders on Twitter have noted, we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle (outlined in red):\nFigure 1: BTC USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Symmetrical Triangle\nSymmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Volume Trend\nOverall, the entire volume profile of the symmetrical triangle is sloping downward — this is indicating consolidation in the market. If we look closer at the consolidating volume trend, we can see a few details that are worth noting:\nThe red arrows are pointing out the decrease in volume off the peaks of the rallies. Typically decreasing volume off rally reactions indicates a diminishing pool of supply.\nVice versa, the green arrows are pointing out the increasing volume on the rallies. Increasing volume on rallies shows us there is still a steady amount of demand in the market.\nPoints 1 and 2 together also reveal something about the lows made at the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle: as the market pushes and establishes its lows, we see climactic volume. Climactic volume leading into support is a great sign of supply absorption and hints toward further demand in the market.\nThere is a really strong case for the current symmetrical triangle being a reaccumulation TR that, in the grand scheme of things, is nothing more than a pitstop in an otherwise upward-trending market. A breakout to the top of the symmetrical triangle would have a price target in the $15,000s. However, as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can also break to the downside. If the triangle breaks down, the measured move for the breakout would have us testing the $2000–$3000 price range.\nFor now, the volume is content with continuing to consolidate, but the market is poised for a very strong move that will likely shape the landscape of the market for the next several months. It's impossible to determine when a market will breakout, so all we can do is hedge our bets and wait.\nSummary: The market has been consolidating for months in the form of a symmetrical triangle and is tightly wound for a strong, sustained move.\nThere is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout.\nSymmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The machines can be used to purchase bitcoin — currently trading at more than $7,500 per unit — as well as other digital currencies, according to the company's website.\nAnd Prague isn't alone. There are bitcoin ATMs all over America, according to Coin ATM Radar , an online tool that tracks the machines.\nCoin ATM Radar's tracking shows that the United States boasts the most bitcoin ATMs in the world by far, with 1,960 of them.\nLos Angeles, where bitcoin ATMs reportedly date back to 2014, is the U.S. city with the most of the machines, with 250, according to Coin ATM Radar. There are also nearly 170 of the ATMs in Chicago and over 120 in both New York City and Atlanta. Washington, D.C. has more than 60 of the machines, and Texas-based company Coinsource is reportedly set to install 20 more machines in the nation's capital by the end of the year.\nCanada comes in second as a nation, with 540 crypto ATMS.\nThere are roughly 46 bitcoin ATMs in the Czech Republic, and more than 3,150 active located in 70 countries around the world, according to Coin ATM Radar.\nThe machines, which are made by a variety of different manufacturers , allow prospective cryptocurrency investors to buy their own digital currency on the spot by inserting cash to initiate a digital transaction that transfers the purchased bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) via either a paper receipt or an online \" wallet ,\" where digital currency can be safely stored. Also, some bitcoin ATMs support two-way transactions, which means you can even sell your bitcoin and have cash dispensed on the spot.\nA two-minute tutorial video posted on the website of General Bytes, the second-largest producer of bitcoin ATMs, shows how a customer can insert cash into the machines to purchase bitcoin while scanning a QR code to choose the digital address where they want to receive the bitcoin. The company sells its bitcoin ATMs online , with models selling for as much as $9,499. General Bytes said in a press release in April 2018 that it had sold more than 1,500 bitcoin ATMs worldwide, though Coin ATM Radar puts the number at 850.\nU.S.-based Genesis Coin has installed its own bitcoin ATMs in 1,065 locations.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin's price has rebounded somewhat recently, but the digital currency has still been a highly volatile investment for much of 2018, as its value is still more than 60 percent off its peak from December 2017.\nDon't miss:\nEx-NFL star Ricky Williams studies astrology – and it's telling him to invest in Bitcoin\nAshton Kutcher gave Ellen DeGeneres $4 million in cryptocurrency for her charity — here's what you need to know about Ripple's XRP\nLike this story?

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

PLUS they waive transaction fees when agents use cryptocurrency in their sportsbook. Why It Matters To Online Bookie Agents\nThe following are 3 reasons why Bitcoin and offshore betting matters to per head agents. 1. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are peer-to-peer\nThis means that when agents make transactions in Bitcoin, it’s between the agent and the other party.\nThere is no middle man like a credit card company facilitating the transaction.\nPeer-to-peer transactions aren’t impenetrable. They are much safer than non peer-to-peer transactions, though. 2. Sports bettors, all players, are switching to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency\nOver 60% of sports bettors now deposit via Bitcoin .\nThat’s a huge number. An online bookie agent won’t see that 60% if they don’t currently accept Bitcoin deposits. The number should rise to closer to 70%.\nThe reason has nothing to do with gambling laws. What it has to do with is privacy.\nCredit card companies are a nosy bunch. They want to know what their clients spend their money on.\nSports bettors would prefer to cut out the middleman when they make deposits. 3. Over 80% of sports bettors withdraw in Bitcoin\nSports bettors prefer to remain anonymous throughout the betting process. That includes depositing funds and making wagers. It also includes withdrawing funds.\nThe 80% number is a real number.\nWhen an agent thinks about it, it makes sense. Why would a sports bettor want to receive payouts in a traditional currency?\nTraditional currencies are regulated.\nThey’re also not peer-to-peer unless traditional currency transactions occur in cash. All players, sports, horses, casino, etc., value their privacy.\nIf they value their privacy on one end, the deposit end, they most definitely value their privacy on the other end, the payout end.\nThe bottom line is that players are utilizing Bitcoin. If players utilize Bitcoin, online bookies most definitely must utilize Bitcoin.\nCompetition in the bookie industry is too fierce not to.\nUnderstanding how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work is essential as an entrepreneur.\nPayPerHead offers the full rundown about cryptocurrency, and the benefits it has for sportsbooks and pay per head agents.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://payperhead.com/bitcoin?utm_source=g911&utm_medium=blog+post&utm_content=bitcoin+offshore+betting&utm_campaign=bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T05:36:00.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c203774e25ee0d38b4e6d433baa45a6f7ef2e3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTEaNWi93x_xQJNKR5rRRa4Hs1plVSFQzEOkoU8XZ.rkOUzYpEZOEev50g.hH7mfAfFwzpKC6LwoMcFnGGHNDNdEKnLBOv05nOjpKADYITZIhLX85E1xkxD", "site_full": "www.bigtrends.com", "site": "bigtrends.com", "site_section": "https://www.bigtrends.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Bigtrends", "title": "If bitcoin is a bubble, the ‘panic’ stage is near: economist", "title_full": "If bitcoin is a bubble, the ‘panic’ stage is near: economist", "published": "2018-05-31T23:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.bigtrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bubble.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c203774e25ee0d38b4e6d433baa45a6f7ef2e3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTEaNWi93x_xQJNKR5rRRa4Hs1plVSFQzEOkoU8XZ.rkOUzYpEZOEev50g.hH7mfAfFwzpKC6LwoMcFnGGHNDNdEKnLBOv05nOjpKADYITZIhLX85E1xkxD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jbrumley", "published": "2018-05-31T23:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "If bitcoin is a bubble, the ‘panic’ stage is near: economist", "text": "If bitcoin is a bubble, the 'panic' stage is near: economist 4:01 PM\nIt isn't uncommon for crypto-skeptics to look a bitcoin chart and, without much analysis, label it the tulip bubble of the 21st century.\nBut economists note that bubbles are complex things, with a life cycle of their own.\nAccording to the late Hyman Minsky, the U.S. economist whose theories on financial fragility came to the fore during the 2008 financial crisis when a surge in private debt accumulation led to the collapse in the housing market, an asset bubble has five stages; displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking, and panic.\nUsing this framework, Joost van der Burgt, a policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that if bitcoin is indeed a bubble, it's likely at the beginning of the profit-taking stage, which means panic might be around the corner.\nThe displacement phase of the bubble came in the years after Satoshi Nakamoto, the person or people credited with creating bitcoin, released the white paper on the first digital currency.
