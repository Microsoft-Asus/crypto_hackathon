The United Nations is involved in a crypto-funded project to power Moldova’s Technical University with solar energy. Initiatives in Malta and India will employ blockchain technologies to create more reliable public transportation and land registry systems.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: OECD Explores Cryptocurrencies, Central Asian Powerhouse Calls for UN Crypto Rules UN Launches Crypto-Funded Solar Power Project in Moldova\nThe United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) is launching this year a crypto-funded initiative to power a university in Moldova with solar energy. The project, to be realized in partnership with the South African solar power marketplace Sun Exchange, will allow people to buy solar cells and then lease them to the Technical University in Chisinau, which is one of the largest in the country.\nAccording to a VOA report, the purchases will be made using Solarcoin, a crypto launched by the blockchain startup Electricchain. The idea is to find new sources of finance “to help buildings go green overnight, in this case with rooftop solar panels,” said Dumitru Vasilescu, program manager with UNDP in Moldova. “One of the biggest obstacles to countries investing in renewable energy is the lack of financing, as you often have to wait 10 to 15 years before you get a return on your investment,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation .\nVasilescu added that the university will get a full 1 megawatt of energy installed in the summer as a result of the crowdfunding effort. The owners of the solar cells will in turn receive Solarcoins, as soon as the university produces energy, and will be able to earn about 4% interest on their investments. According to the UNDP representative, there is more than 10,000 square meters of unused rooftop space on public buildings in the country, which could potentially be covered with solar panels.\nMoldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, is heavily dependent on energy imports, mainly from the Russian Federation. Cryptocurrencies have been gaining popularity in the former Soviet republic which is economically and politically on a crossroad between East and West. The local crypto community has recently opened the country’s first cryptocurrency exchange and presented a new digital token, both developed locally. Malta Uses Blockchain for Better Public Transportation\nAuthorities in Malta, a country maintaining a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, are working on a project to use blockchain to improve the public transportation services. Maltese Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, Ian Borg, has announced a partnership with Omnitude, a multi-enterprise blockchain platform. According to a press release, the deal is part of the nation’s blockchain strategy that will see the technology implemented to develop a transport and logistics platform using Omnitude’s blockchain middleware technology.\nOn the first stage, the government will work with the company to introduce overall improvements in transport reliability. Omnitude is a tech partner of Formula 1 team Williams Martini Racing and is working to assess the benefits that blockchain can bring to advanced engineering. Their project is said to be the first example of using blockchain in F1.\n“We believe in Omnitude’s blockchain technology and its broad use-cases for the government […] It will improve the quality of life and enhance access to information for Maltese citizens. Blockchain technology is a key part of our overall technology strategy that will transform different sectors,” Ian Borg said. Earlier this year, Malta became one of the first countries in the world to approve a national strategy on blockchain technology. Land Registry in India Made Reliable with Blockchain\nThe potential of the technology underpinning the majority of cryptocurrencies is not left unnoticed in other parts of the world. In India , blockchain will be used to trace transactions in property sales almost in real time. A newly announced project aims to build a land registry using blockchain technology for the Indian city of Panchkula, according to a blog post on the website of the London School of Economics.\nThe people behind the initiative – Alexandru Oprunenco, innovation advisor for the UNDP in Asia, and Chami Akmeemana, CEO of the Blockchain Learning Group – say their small venture is actually a “big deal” that represents a “meaningful and commercially viable solution” for the region. They point out that in many cities across the developing world land registry systems suffer from inefficiency and corruption. People selling a piece of land are often unsure if they legally own it, even if they have a legitimate sale deed. Potential buyers, on the other hand, are also not sure if the seller owns the plot.\n“With blockchain we have a chance to fix many of these problems. The solution we are building incorporates many key benefits of the technology, such as an immutable history of transactions, so that no one doubts the authenticity of the records or be able to forge them,” Oprunenco and Akmeemana explain. Their project is using the Ethereum blockchain. The Central Bank of Libya Says Bitcoin Is Illegal\nObviously failing to recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technologies, the central bank of Libya has declared “virtual currency” illegal in the country. Those who use it cannot be protected by Libyan law, the financial institution said, quoted by The Libya Observer .\nOn Tuesday, the CBL warned all Libyan citizens and businesses of the “security perils” of cryptocurrency, saying that it could be used in crimes, financing terrorism and money laundering – arguments often heard from financial regulators and central banks around the world. According to the notice, any use of virtual currency requires prior permission from the central bank in Tripoli.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

But bitcoin has under-performed, down 5 percent since Monday.\nMasters pointed out that three years ago, the market and number of people interested in cryptocurrencies was very small. This week, however, more than 8,000 people showed up for Blockchain Week New York.\nIn fact, he said, bitcoin's life cycle \"is still very early.\"\n\"In derivatives, indices, pricing models and so on that go on around [building a financial system.]\nWe're nowhere near that part yet,\" Masters said.\n\"We're not even at the part yet where I'd say institutional investors even started in commodities.\nBecause these things — indexation, custody and so on — aren't there to bring in those bigger people just yet.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "danny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:24:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a66a1a8c3b74d9bc716f3a411b76f1f9b3b01922", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_TeNkHpyovK1kpBXSJkx118petamHWO8NC9MORDUguIMrhWPrVZ9aKegtHebqG7iPfPbgmQUDbkNGdYDU.q0CwA4ht154BfFmq3lIZBWKCZ4kpgxrp4AI4PumxwV6iFHgGX6edsjpzpRUBDugpmu25", "site_full": "www.rttnews.com", "site": "rttnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.rttnews.com/RSS/EconomicNews.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "education"], "section_title": "RTT - Economic News", "title": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Says Internet To Have Native Currency, Hopefully Bitcoin", "title_full": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Says Internet To Have Native Currency, Hopefully Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-18T13:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2018/may/jackdorseytwitterceo-may18-lt.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a66a1a8c3b74d9bc716f3a411b76f1f9b3b01922", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_TeNkHpyovK1kpBXSJkx118petamHWO8NC9MORDUguIMrhWPrVZ9aKegtHebqG7iPfPbgmQUDbkNGdYDU.q0CwA4ht154BfFmq3lIZBWKCZ4kpgxrp4AI4PumxwV6iFHgGX6edsjpzpRUBDugpmu25", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T13:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Says Internet To Have Native Currency, Hopefully Bitcoin", "text": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Says Internet To Have Native Currency, Hopefully Bitcoin 5/18/2018 6:22 AM ET\nJack Dorsey, chief executive officer of both Twitter and Square, said the internet is set to have a native currency and the crypto community must help it happen.\n\"I don't know if it will be Bitcoin, but I hope it will be,\" Dorsey said on stage at the Consensus 2018 blockchain conference that concluded on May 16 in New York.\nDorsey also reiterated his enthusiasm for Bitcoin during the conference.Bitcoin will become the global currency for payments after overtaking the dollar's dominant place within a decade, Dorsey had said in March during an interview to the UK's Times newspaper.\nRelated Stories:\nCitron Slams Square Saying 'Collection Of Yawn Businesses' According to him, bitcoin will overcome obstacles like high fees and slow transaction processing, to be used to for routine transaction such as buying everyday items such as coffee.\nLate January, the Dorsey-led mobile payment processing company Square launched Bitcoin trading on its Cash mobile payments app.\nEarlier this month, Citron Research , the online stock commentary website run by the well-known activist short-seller Andrew Left, slammed Square, saying it was just a \"collection of yawn businesses.\"\nSquare's adjusted revenue from Bitcoin trading was $200,000 during the first quarter.

Not so fast, experts say. by 0\nIn the late 1990s, some experts were concerned that by 2010, half of the U.S. electrical grid would be dedicated to powering the internet, a claim that nearly caused a panic. That proved to be more than a little overblown, as researcher Jonathan Koomey and his team at the Berkeley Lab showed at the time.\nThey then proved themselves correct again in an August 2011 study that concluded that data centers consumed less than 2 percent of the country’s electricity. Koomey, a lecturer at Stanford, is now concerned that the same false alarm is ringing once again.\nThis time, the shiny object is Bitcoin and the energy used to “mine” the digital currency. The latest spotlight on the conversation came from a study published Wednesday that was produced by Dutch researcher Alex de Vries, who concluded that the Bitcoin network consumes nearly as much electricity as the nation of Ireland.\nKoomey finds that assertion more than a little problematic. “For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing,” Koomey said.\n“My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.” De Vries estimates that the Bitcoin network consumes “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” “Economic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number,” comparable with Austria, which consumes 8.2 gigawatts, de Vries writes. “A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.” De Vries is not alone in warning about Bitcoin’s appetite for gigawatts.

crypto-anarchists and dark webbers. But now locals are getting rich on the cryptocurrency craze and Berlin has become a serious hub for the technology. How did bitcoin become so mainstream?\nIt’s been over four years since Bitcoin’s market value jumped from €80 to about €647 and Exberliner published its first piece about “Betting on bits” . At the moment, the virtual currency is on its way down from €13,600 in December to around €6,900 at time of press. But despite the drop, readers who were inspired to quickly invest in this hypervolatile nascent technology in 2014 would still have enjoyed a pretty serious return in 2018.\nAnyone with a network in the scene now finds their social media feeds flooded with pictures of Lamborghinis, yachts, and prototypical beach vacations all bought from the returns made from betting on Bitcoin early. Those who are not part of the community are still trying to understand the phenomenon and whether they, too, should be jumping on the crypto bandwagon. Basically, everyone wants to know how to turn €80 into €13,600 for free and, well, fair enough.\nA Kreuzberg pioneer's ideals\nSitting outside his bar in Kreuzberg, Room 77, Jörg Platzer looks like a man who made a good investment for good reasons. Everyone in his vicinity seems to be aware of this too: people coming by pat him on the back or give him discreet nods of recognition. He is greeted by friends in multiple languages. This might not seem unusual for a bar owner, but Room 77 has an added feature: it was the first brick and mortar business in the world to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.\nIn May 2011, when Platzer reportedly sold his first pint in exchange for the pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was far from big enterprise. He explains that he would have been lucky to have one or two customers a month looking to try it out. But the handful of enthusiasts who came to the bar in 2011 to spend their new internet money had found a home. They would lug their laptops into the bar and manually type in their Bitcoin wallet addresses, a cryptographically secure chain of numbers and letters, and thereby join a movement looking to overturn our current financial system.\nBack in the day, the technology was simply another extension of a grander ideology, explains Platzer. Posted on the walls, next to the Bitcoin stickers, one finds quotes from the likes of Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Aaron Schwartz. There is even a printout of “Free Ross Ulbricht”, the founder of the dark web marketplace, the Silk Road, taped to the wall. Below a panel of spirits, a sign reads: “I BELIEVE IN HONEST MONEY / GOLD, SILVER AND BITCOIN.” Platzer considers himself a crypto-anarchist, economist and ideological relative of the same utopian values that the internet promised: “I was never part of any official Cypherpunk group, but I was part of the movement,” he says referring to the few people really interested in cryptography and its technological applications during the 1990s.\nThe connection to the internet is critical because according to many, blockchain technology which underpins Bitcoin could birth a “web 3.0.” It’s still early days, but the hype is palpable. If not yet opening up a new technological era, Bitcoin does promise a correction to one of the internet’s original sins. Platzer explains: “The first mistake we made was not to have built money into the web. A means of payment. People needed a way to monetize their content. The only problem was no one invented the fucking digital cash to do it.”\nFrom idealism to investment\nWhile the logic seems oddly capitalistic, the alternative has clearly been much worse. In the absence of a native currency for the internet, banner ads, pop-ups, and click baits have spawned. Without internet money, Platzer argues, companies like Google and Amazon have a high incentive to collect as much data as possible and turn that into money. In 2017, Facebook alone made nearly $40 billion in advertising revenue. Platzer is sure that “if sites had had a button to let you send a micropayment, there would never have been all this advertising and giving-up-my-credit-card-details shit.” In the eyes of people like him, Bitcoin provided an anonymous way of exchanging value on the internet. No one harvests any data; everyone walks away with clean hands – that was the idea.\nWhat the Bitcoin pioneer is presenting as internet idealism has actually made him a lot of money. When asked if he would divulge information on his returns since accepting cryptocurrencies, Platzer responds abruptly: “Sorry, that’s not possible. I’m sure your editor understands that very well.” With a bit of simple arithmetic, however, we can arrive at a general conclusion: when the bar began accepting the virtual money, a Bitcoin was worth about €0.80, so a €4.20 pint would have cost around 5.25 BTC. In 2012, the price of Bitcoin rose to about €4.25 and that same beer would have then cost something like 0.9 BTC. So, in the span of 12 months, Platzer enjoyed a fivefold increase in value on that one beer sold in his bar. Skip ahead to December 2017, when Bitcoin was worth €13,600 a pop, meaning the Bitcoin value-equivalent of that same beer sold in 2011 (i.e. 5.25 BTC) was now worth around €85,000.\nAs the price of Bitcoin climbed, speculators entered the scene and the clientele at Room 77 changed. People were now showing up with their smartphone-integrated Bitcoin “wallets”, making transactions by conveniently swiping a QR code. In 2011, when people showed up for the monthly Bitcoin meet-up, they didn't see it as a means to make a living. Now, the same meet-ups at the bar attract start-up recruiters, libertarians and media representatives from notable German newspapers. At the March gathering, there even was a guy from Chad who explained that due to government-induced inflation of the country’s currency, many of his friends and family were turning to Bitcoin.\nBy now, institutional investors from J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs to politicians like Angela Merkel are waking up to this novel economic instrument – for very different reasons.\nDue to the same privacy features lauded by Platzer, Bitcoin was quickly adopted by the dark web. Things on offer at places like the Silk Road and Hansa included computer parts, cars, guns, knives, drugs and even people. In those spaces Bitcoin was the sole means of payment.\nGetting high on the gamble\nLongtime Berliner Simon (name changed) works at a bar near Schlesisches Tor. Going by his job and when speaking with him, you wouldn’t necessarily identify this guy as a crypto day trader. He looks nothing like an overnight millionaire. He is slim, wears skinny black jeans and a black hoodie. And yet, in between guests arriving at the bar, the twentysomething talks about the big “bounce” due to happen in the next few weeks.\nThe plunge in price is bound to follow a big sell-off by a “whale” (a trustee from Mt.Gox, the first Bitcoin exchange, who is currently trying to pay off creditors and subsequently liquidating swaths of the virtual currency), a shock regulation passed by China, and just the general chaos of valuating something that has never previously existed. This is what Simon is talking about. “It is just like April last year,” he explains. “Things were pretty boring, not much movement, Bitcoin kind of dropped a bit. But it’ll go on a bull run before the summer.” A “bull run” is old school stock market terminology for a continuous price hike. It’s also the term that earned Bitcoin prime television slots over the past few months. The opposite is called a “bear market,” from which we are apparently slowly emerging now. Both, ironically, come directly from the trading institutions that Bitcoin was hoping to destroy.\n“I’m bullish as long as it doesn’t dip below €6,000,” he says looking up from his phone. But this recent obsession wasn’t how Simon got hooked on trading. He explains that “at the end of 2014, maybe early 2015, I was just buying stuff on the dark web with Bitcoin. Mostly drugs for my friends. I just thought it was cool to have this Bitcoin wallet and use this new type of money.” Plus, Simon explains, it was only on the dark web that one could buy 100 percent pure cut Colombian cocaine. “I was basically just giving it away for free and telling my friends that I bought it with Bitcoin. I was never dealing,” he confirms. His early stage Bitcoin buying spree included the purchase of counterfeit money for an art project. The latter met its conclusion in 2015 after ten heavily armed Bundespolizisten broke down Simon’s door at six o'clock in the morning screaming, “ Wo ist das Geld!? Wo ist es!? ” In response to which he sheepishly pointed to a paper-mâché mobile he’d made from fake euro bills.\nThe ideal of freedom has more or less fallen by the way. Nobody gives a fuck.\"\nApparently, servers for a major dark web marketplace in Holland had been compromised by local authorities. Names, addresses and purchasing histories had immediately become available and with the help of foreign authorities relevant individuals were arrested. But since the police couldn’t prove that Simon had been using the money for anything other than arts and crafts with his girlfriend, he only “spent like five minutes in jail.” He was lucky not to have been caught actually spending the counterfeits. But this event, the collapse of the Silk Road and the arrest of darknet market operator Ross Ulbricht spelled the end of Simon’s wanderings around the hidden parts of the internet. As for cryptocurrencies, though, he found yet another use for them: safe storage while traveling.\nChanging bud for Bitcoin\nA year after his run-in with the law, Simon and his girlfriend took up work harvesting marijuana on a farm in Humboldt County, California. “The work wasn’t too difficult and the pay was pretty good,” he adds. It was, however, still very much illegal in California to grow the plant in 2016 and thus the couple’s paychecks were strictly in cash. “But you don’t really want to be travelling with huge stacks of cash in your bag. It just didn’t make sense. So we put it into Bitcoin.”\nThis process of moving money was performed via the German online bank Fidor and their convenient relationship with Bitcoin.de, the German Bitcoin exchange. Customers of the bank can open an account at Bitcoin.de, transfer any Bitcoin holdings from their personal wallets onto the exchange, and then sell these holdings for euros or dollars using a Fidor account. From there, it’s just like real money. Simon would first exchange his cash into Bitcoin using localbitcoins.com, a peer-to-peer exchange now illegal in Germany, and keep them on his phone before changing them over to dollars whenever the couple needed it.\nThis type of activity is exactly what Chancellor Merkel and global regulators are looking to stamp out in 2018. While comparatively lenient, Germany has strict anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) laws to prevent illegal money from moving hands. These kinds of global regulations were also a major talking point at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this year. Joachim Wuermeling, a member of the Bundesbank executive board, told Reuters in January that “effective regulation of virtual currencies would only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation, because the regulatory power of nation-states is obviously limited.”\nWhen they finally arrived at New York's JFK airport for the flight back to Berlin, their plane was delayed nearly ten hours. With the €647 the airline paid as compensation, Simon bought Ripple, a cryptocurrency that acts like a share in “a real-time settlement system and remittance network.” He was basically buying virtual stock in the next generation Moneygram or Western Union. And in 2016, this was an excellent decision. He recounts staking in Ripple when it was trading at less than half a cent per unit. By January 2018, the same digital currency reached approximately €2.50 a unit. This means that, simply by taking the gamble, Simon turned his €647 into €323,500. “It was good, but I was greedy and I could’ve made more,” he laments, “I should’ve sold some of it at the time, but you learn.” Naturally, his interest was piqued and he began further exploring the fast-growing market. “And then Monero started posting stuff about integrating into dark web sites and so I bought some of that too when it was like $11 or so,” he continues. Monero is perhaps the leading privacy-centric cryptocurrency and as such is becoming the new alternative for dark webbers in 2018. Now trading at €184 per coin, it has proven another excellent stroke of luck for Simon.\nWhen asked about paying taxes on his capital gains here in Germany, Simon is quick to reply: “Basically, if you hold a coin for more than a year, you don’t need to pay taxes on it. So I just sort of pull from the Bitcoin I had from when I started and only take out little amounts to pay my rent or whatever.” At the moment, Simon claims to be earning roughly €1600 per month, but “it’s obviously different if I catch a coin on a big run.” So, why the bar gig? “It’s good to get out and socialize. I’m just reading charts all day and following different threads. Even at the bar, I’m still constantly checking my phone. I think I drive my girlfriend crazy. We’ll be going to Asia for a while, which will be good,” he says. “Maybe I’ll quit one day, but I like working some hours here and there.” ×\nPhoto by Anastasia Chistyakova\nA sobering turn\nWhile Simon contemplates what exactly to do with his new windfall, others are repositioning entire companies to find the next Bitcoins, Ripples, and Moneros. April saw the very first C³ Crypto Conference, “Germany’s largest conference on cryptocurrency and blockchain,” which allowed participants to get a better feel for how crypto startups are trying to get their share of all this money. The Station, the conference venue near Gleisdreieck, is done up in blue banners and a striking amount of suits and start-up types pour through the venue’s iron gates. A scene that would probably make cypherpunks, dark webbers, and the 2011 anarchist folk cringe.\nOn day one of the two-day event, conference founder Dennis Weidner talks about his marketing firm Paranoid Internet and why people in Berlin suddenly are so stoked about Bitcoin. His company currently represents several cryptocurrency ventures looking to generate a native cryptocurrency, projects ranging from Holo (decentralised data storage), to redBUX (a currency for virtual reality porn).\nWhen these tokens are made, they are then put on sale, or “offered,” at a discount for anyone to buy up with currencies like Bitcoin. The business model is called ICO – short for initial coin offering – and, according to Weidner, these discounted tokens will draw colossal gains.\nThese ventures are basically trying to recreate what Simon experienced with Ripple, but start even earlier, when the virtual shares are worth even less and the windfall could be even greater. Weidner is there to translate the crypto jargon to eager investors. He found a niche left open by the early crypto-nerds who couldn’t get their point across: “In 2015 and 2016, all these developers were screaming ‘Check out this new technology!’ - but no one understood what they were talking about.” Berlin, he says, is an ideal base for what he does: “When I want to know what’s going on in America, I can find out right here in the city. It’s like a big think tank, everyone’s exchanging ideas. It’s all about people.”\nDespite the promise of fortunes, it's all highly tenuous. With billion euro sums flying across the internet, a lot can go wrong. So while this new funding model can be an excellent tool for attracting non-accredited investors, many ICOs have been shut down for fraudulent behaviour and down-right shadiness. Even ten years since Bitcoin’s inception, cyber money is struggling with its identity. Buzzwords like ‘mass adoption,’ and ‘ecosystem,’ are repeated constantly at conferences like C³, but back at Room 77 they ring superfluous to people like Platzer. He still thinks there is something much more important at stake: “We have reached everybody that we want to reach, but while everybody went crazy about Bitcoin, the ideal of freedom has more or less fallen by the way. Nobody gives a fuck. I could sometimes freak out about the surveillance state my government has built with my tax money.”\nPerhaps the future isn’t Bitcoin. Nonetheless, in the information age, it is addressing some of the most fundamental issues facing our society. Privacy, Big Data, all the Big Brothers: the internet seems to have opened a massive can of worms. Bitcoin, for what it’s worth in 2018, allows us to inspect the depths of this can – even if its value drops to zero tomorrow.

Some sources claim it is just fine, whereas others deem is not viable for much longer. Alex De Vries conducted an interesting piece of research, which claims the energy usage by Bitcoin miners will double by late 2018. An interesting study, although one that also misses out on key elements . The Alex De Vries Study\nLooking at how Bitcoin mining evolved, it is normal the energy usage has been on the rise. More people are excited about mining cryptocurrencies. At the same time, the efficiency of mining units has improved vastly. As such, one would expect the energy usage to remain somewhat stable. Alex De Vries claims that will be anything but the case. In his findings, BTC mining will use as much energy as the entire country of The Netherlands.\nHis research also claims how this energy consumption will continue to rise. It may even reach 5% of the world’s energy. On paper, this sounds very problematic, although there are always two sides to a story. There are some key factors which contribute to making Bitcoin mining profitable. The first of all is having access to electricity that is affordable and cheap. For Bitcoin mining purposes, the number of locations is fairly limited in this regard.\nCanada, Iceland, and some regions of the US are places that come to mind in this regard. China also has some “cheaper” electricity rates, but the country is trying to move mining firms out of the region. This factor is seemingly not taken into account by Alex De Vries. Bitcoin mining has become something for corporations rather than individual miners. These companies are also looking to keep their electricity usage in check first and foremost. The Rise of Renewable Energy\nAnother factor Alex De Vries overlooked is the use of renewable energy . All regions mentioned above have a high degree of renewable energy sources. Bitcoin mining operations are tapping into those solutions rather than the traditional power grid. One could even argue the focus on renewable energy makes the entire study by Alex De Vries a trivial issue.\nNo one denies the Bitcoin mining industry will continue to require more electricity. With the mining difficulty rising, more hardware is needed or new units will need to be developed which are even better at this process while keeping the energy consumption low. It is unclear if more robust units can be expected in this regard. Even so, existing hardware combined with renewable energy sources will not affect the world’s energy consumption all that much.\nThere are bigger threats to our environment than Bitcoin mining. It is a slight concern, but most of these studies tend to overlook all of the necessary information. Alex De Vries highlights some interesting aspects, but they are based on partial information and a few assumptions. This research will have no real impact on the popularity of Bitcoin or mining whatsoever.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/", "http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/2018/05/study-claims-bitcoin-mining-is-hurting-the-environment-flawed-argument/#respond", "http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/category/bitcoin/", "https://grist.org/article/bitcoins-energy-use-got-studied-and-you-libertarian-nerds-look-even-worse-than-usual/", "http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/category/opinion/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:51:13.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f95a8e5bd05d291b426edc708a1cefb6e4b5365", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMuUTQEeDkABWrMCldvGgnQjvj9H32Z07zOPhiQ5zKZFRWKMTVJf4fv4y6dh4_qOEOxYMVfQgT_P0nrsxPcnyevG", "site_full": "ventureburn.com", "site": "ventureburn.com", "site_section": "http://ventureburn.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Ventureburn", "title": "Ekasi Bucks to launch ‘world’s first crypto-mall, bitcoin taxis for townships’", "title_full": "Ekasi Bucks to launch ‘world’s first crypto-mall, bitcoin taxis for townships’", "published": "2018-05-18T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ventureburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lucky-Kgwadi2-150x150.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 72147, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f95a8e5bd05d291b426edc708a1cefb6e4b5365", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMuUTQEeDkABWrMCldvGgnQjvj9H32Z07zOPhiQ5zKZFRWKMTVJf4fv4y6dh4_qOEOxYMVfQgT_P0nrsxPcnyevG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stephen Timm: Editor", "published": "2018-05-18T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ekasi Bucks to launch ‘world’s first crypto-mall, bitcoin taxis for townships’", "text": "By Stephen Timm: Editor on 18 May, 2018\nJust months after a failed initial coin offering (ICO), South African blockchain consultancy Ekasi Bucks plans to launch what it calls “the world’s first crypto-mall and on-demand transport service for townships”.\nThe two services will be unveiled this Monday (21 May) by the startup in three launches in Gauteng, namely in Mabopane, Soshanguve and Soweto.\nThe launch comes after the Gauteng based startup last year sought to raise R50-million in an ICO to fund a blockchain-based rewards programme for township residents that buy from certain affiliated township businesses. But the ICO raised just R500 000, most of which was returned to investors.\nRead more: SA’s Ekasi Bucks ICO falls short of R50m target, nets just R500 000\nSpeaking to Ventureburn this week, Ekasi Bucks co-founder and president Lucky Kgwadi ( pictured above ) said the startup had intended to use much of the R50-million to buy land and pay for the initial building of a physical mall — but after the failed ICO the company has now “opted to therefore go digital” he said.\nThe digital mall will allow businesses based in the township to sell products on an online portal in exchange for the Ekasi Bucks token. Ekasi Bucks says it has received 800 applications for the crypto-mall and 20 for its on-demand taxi service for townships\nThe on-demand taxi service will operate similar to Taxify or Uber, but instead of paying with cash or credit cards customers will pay for the service using Ekasi Bucks.\nInitially Ekasi Bucks will source users for the token from their existing rewards programme which the company has been running since 2016 and is already active across the country with over 4000 merchants and 20 000 card users.\nThese users will be able to swap their points for Ekasi tokens, said Kgwadi. In the launch on Monday the company will offer R5-million worth of tokens.\nEkasi Bucks is also in talks with two local cryptocurrency exchanges, namely Coindirect and Ice3X, to make the Ekasi token available there. ‘Over 800 applications for crypto-mall’\nKgwadi said Ekasi Bucks has been running an awareness campaign for the past six weeks to recruit vendors to the mall and has received 800 applications from township entrepreneurs so far, to sell items such as clothing or food delivered from local restaurants. The mall will likely add services, at a later stage, he said.\nEkasi Bucks will charge vendors a monthly administrative fee of R50 to host them on the mall. Kgwadi added that the idea is to have unique malls for each township — with a Soweto mall to be the first one planned.\n“We are trying to allow residents to shop from their own townships and to shop from their own home,” he said.\nKgwadi is adamant that township residents, given the opportunity to do so, will buy from local retailers. “It’s not a matter of products and markups — people just don’t know where to find the product,” he added. ‘Commission for taxis will be 10%’\nIn addition, the company has been running Facebook ads for its on-demand taxi service and has received just over 20 applications from drivers interested in joining the on-demand taxi service.\nKgwadi said after drivers are vetted, the initial batch would form the first pilot.\nEkasi Bucks, he said, will charge drivers a commission of 10% on each token transaction — which is far lower than the fee that Uber and Taxify deducts from drivers (which are about 15% to 20% and 30%, respectively).\nHe said the company has also signed on an insurance partner to offer life cover to drivers who are part of the on-demand taxi service. The insurance is a white-labelled offering which is under written by Lion of Africa.\nWhile the startup wasn’t so lucky with its ICO last year, Kgwadi hopes the company’s new offering will gain more traction — despite admitting that it won’t be easy, given how sceptical many people are of cryptocurrency.

Follow Torjus Dorsey is chief executive of the payment service Square in addition to his role of chief executive of Twitter (Source: Getty) Torjus Roberg\nTwitter chief executive Jack Dorsey endorsed bitcoin at the cryptocurrency conference Consensus in New York saying that it should be the official currency of the internet.\nDorsey, who is also chief executive of the mobile payment service Square, has now become a public supporter of cryptocurrencies saying he is a “huge fan” of the growing crypto market.\nHe said on the stage in front of the 8,500 attendees: “The internet is going to have a native currency so let's not wait for it to happen, let's help it happen. I don't know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.”\nRead more : Buffett and Gates label bitcoin as non-productive investment\nSquare was one of the first payment services to accept bitcoin already in 2014 and has been a big supporter of it. Dorsey said that wanted to make payments easier and the way to do that would be to adopt bitcoin as a global payment method.\nHowever, Twitter has stated that it has banned all ads for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) which is the same strategy that fellow social media platform Facebook has taken on.\nLast week, former Goldman Sachs president and Trump adviser Gary Cohn made a similar statement that he though that there would be a global cryptocurrency in the future.\nHowever opposite to Dorsey, Cohn did not believe that it would be bitcoin when he told CNBC: “I’m not a big believer in bitcoin, I am a believer in blockchain technology. It will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency.”\n“It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it’s created, how it moves and how people can use it,” he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://iptc.org/std/rNews/2011-10-07#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torjus roberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torjus dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "torjus roberg twitter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T12:50:44.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfe4b52f41db01c07eca27434b5fa44a0d38abcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LjTnga5x7ihgarePrAxL3Fk-", "site_full": "www.instaforex.com", "site": "instaforex.com", "site_section": "http://news.instaforex.com/en/analytics/rss/?x=BAED", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex analysis review", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 18, 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for May 18, 2018", "published": "2018-05-18T12:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfe4b52f41db01c07eca27434b5fa44a0d38abcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_LjTnga5x7ihgarePrAxL3Fk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T12:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 18, 2018", "text": "Keep fit and be successful like Oleg Taktarov!

Bernstein & Co., Canaan holds about 15 percent of the global market for Bitcoin mining chips and computer equipment, behind its Chinese rival Bitmain.\nIn its preliminary prospectus filed, the company said it had revenue of 1.3 billion yuan or $203.8 million in 2017 and net income surged over 600 percent to 361 million yuan.\nCanaan also said its software enterprise unit, Hangzhou Canaan, gets preferential tax treatment and paid no income tax in 2016 and 2017. It will pay a preferential rate of 12.5 percent from 2018 to 2020.\nFor the proposed IPO, the company has named Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd. as joint sponsors, as per the prospectus.\nIn early May, the South China Morning Post had reported Canaan's plans to seek an IPO in Hong Kong instead of US.\nIn the filing, Canaan said the Chinese ASIC-based blockchain hardware market in 2017 grew to 7.3 billion yuan from 50 million yuan in 2013. This will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020, according to Frost & Sullivan.\nCanaan Creative co-chairman Kong Jianping said recently that the company pans to expand into the software business besides producing chips.\nby Renju Rogers RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanford c. bernstein & co.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T13:54:08.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "900e85baa53eee6a71534a8f5cfe12eb2252a67c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSc5npruJZbXekzo9ishhKLdTbnLNS8WJuR07bKjLRm1Ehy6RCNHchuu.W02A7mMYG5ydHZN1GDsGQVcar2nIrd3qQQlA2Z1ScIVkIuQpg1Tg--", "site_full": "delittodiusura.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://delittodiusura.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Delitto di Usura", "title": "A Wall Street si potranno scambiare Bitcoin.

Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.” \\n \\n The estimates, based on de Vries\\u2019 background in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts \\u2014 as noted, almost as much electricity as Ireland. Another comparison puts a single transaction as using about as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in an entire month. \\n One of the biggest factors that contributes to the coin’s high electricity usage is also an inherent part of its design. Since its inception Bitcoin\\u2019s decentralized consensus has been enabled by its proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, and the mining machines that perform this ‘work’ need tremendous amounts of energy to do so. \\n According to research published in April by equity analyst Charlie Chan and his team at Morgan Stanley, the key price point for Bitcoin mining profitability is $8,600 . As per their simulation, if\\u00a0the coin\\u00a0can\\u2019t stay above $8,600, many Bitcoin miners will likely find it unprofitable to keep creating the cryptocurrency. \\n Bitcoin\\u2019s Energy Cost Moving Forward \\n Moving forward, the electricity needed to operate the Bitcoin network is only going to increase. By the end of \\u00a0 2018, de Vries predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts \\u2014 as much electricity as the European country of Austria. Looking further ahead, if the price of Bitcoin continues to increase as some experts predict , de Vries believes the network could someday consume as much as 5% of the world’s total electricity, a tenfold increase from today’s 0.5%.\\u00a0 \\n \\n “To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said. \\n \\n Another consideration environmentally is Bitcoin\\u2019s carbon footprint. The problem is that much of the coin\\u2019s network is fueled by coal-fired power plants in China , where electricity is produced at very low rates, but the impact on the environment is more marked.\\u00a0 \\n Based on ‘conservative’ estimates from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index , the carbon footprint for each unique Bitcoin transaction totals almost 450 kilograms of CO2, which translates to 32,898 kilotons annually for the entire network. \\n Featured image from Shutterstock. \\n\nThe post The Bitcoin Network Uses as Much Electricity as Ireland: Study appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pwc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T04:22:13.104+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a33eb48a1b4c3bd7fd18f44d361adf1e40f4e51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.soLJeH2axJvONBfU.IaYiQNq.BK52pHGAyONtKqClxxNDiO3g.dLejOCQOa3hIOAKw--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "The day we begin to buy bitcoin in terms of satoshi, the faster the adoption of bitcoin will accelerate.", "title_full": "The day we begin to buy bitcoin in terms of satoshi, the faster the adoption of bitcoin will accelerate.", "published": "2018-05-18T12:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a33eb48a1b4c3bd7fd18f44d361adf1e40f4e51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.soLJeH2axJvONBfU.IaYiQNq.BK52pHGAyONtKqClxxNDiO3g.dLejOCQOa3hIOAKw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T12:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "The day we begin to buy bitcoin in terms of satoshi, the faster the adoption of bitcoin will accelerate.", "text": "The day we begin to buy bitcoin in terms of satoshi, the faster the adoption of bitcoin will accelerate.\n/u/kimbunchu\nHow much is 1 bitcoin worth according to this statement?\n\"I just bought 100,000 satoshi for a $1000 dollars on this exchange.\"\nsubmitted by /u/kimbunchu\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T12:22:09.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a80a403e0e67be96ab0ed82771acf021a186d06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeL3nsHNGUObAQo4UQ7RfQU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Ethereum a threat to bitcoin", "title_full": "Ethereum a threat to bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-18T12:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a80a403e0e67be96ab0ed82771acf021a186d06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeL3nsHNGUObAQo4UQ7RfQU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "leynylaine", "published": "2018-05-18T12:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ethereum a threat to bitcoin", "text": "Bitcoin and Ethereum have different project purposes.

There was a break below a triangle pattern with support at $8,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but it could face resistance near $8,150 and $8,250. Bitcoin price tumbled below key supports against the US Dollar. BTC/USD is currently consolidating near $8,000 and it is at risk of more losses.\nBitcoin Price Analysis There was no upside break above $8,500 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair failed on many occasions to trade above the $8,500 resistance area. There was a sharp bearish reaction and the price declined below the $8,200 and $8,080 support levels. It seems like the price was completely rejected from the 50% Fib retracement level of the leg from the $8,850 high to $8,080 low.\nMore importantly, there was a break below a triangle pattern with support at $8,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is now trading well below $8,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The decline was such that the price even spiked below $8,000 and a low was formed at $7,931. At the moment, the price is consolidating losses and moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the drop from the $8,486 high to $7,931 low. However, the price is struggling to move above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $8,150.\nLooking at the chart , the price may perhaps move above $8,150 in the near term, but it could face a strong barrier near $8,250. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the drop from the $8,486 high to $7,931 low is a key resistance at $8,209. On the downside, the price must stay above $8,000 to avoid a push towards $7,600.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving higher towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,000\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,250\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD at Risk of Further Declines appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T12:18:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e12bdd29d6ecd3de1a66e73341e848a19452aad1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYA5nj7PqGB.o1INw8gE3cuF", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "the bitcoin chart is a fractal pattern if you bou", "title_full": "/biz/ - the bitcoin chart is a fractal pattern if you bou - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2018-05-18T12:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 31, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e12bdd29d6ecd3de1a66e73341e848a19452aad1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYA5nj7PqGB.o1INw8gE3cuF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2018-05-18T12:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "the bitcoin chart is a fractal pattern if you bou", "text": "the bitcoin chart is a fractal pattern\nif you bought at 1000 in december of 2013 you would have been bagholding until february of 2017 to breakeven. in the same way, if you bought around 18k in december of 2017 you will be bagholding until february 2021. that is the next bullrun. remember that the btc market's participants is the entire human race and therefore the chart will behave in fractals.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:27:51.096+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8737e5c6680368f5375e765d835ba3c1a06dc6b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQhH3h8jj7Vt4.APtQBL8g8qaGTAC1s06Nl9jKNIprIj3Qo0AThW89BVJGGectxexlGyR6hmTTkijKV0EeRBwFwZmFjJiP87CxlH0KitTok3jG_b7cn7BcC687YHmUPvOETsRwKvWasnUJU_u556IuuCOdqcqv6TZTZVhLpwZNfPvKVyV7gRQ0Y", "site_full": "www.finanzen-nachrichten.com", "site": "finanzen-nachrichten.com", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/Finanzen-Nachrichten", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "jobs", "finance", "financial_aid"], "section_title": "Finanzen-Nachrichten - Finanznachrichten", "title": "- Twitter- & Square-CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin könnte gemeinsame Internetwährung werden", "title_full": "- Twitter- & Square-CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin könnte gemeinsame Internetwährung werden", "published": "2018-05-18T12:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8737e5c6680368f5375e765d835ba3c1a06dc6b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQhH3h8jj7Vt4.APtQBL8g8qaGTAC1s06Nl9jKNIprIj3Qo0AThW89BVJGGectxexlGyR6hmTTkijKV0EeRBwFwZmFjJiP87CxlH0KitTok3jG_b7cn7BcC687YHmUPvOETsRwKvWasnUJU_u556IuuCOdqcqv6TZTZVhLpwZNfPvKVyV7gRQ0Y", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T12:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "- Twitter- & Square-CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin könnte gemeinsame Internetwährung werden", "text": "- Twitter- & Square-CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin könnte gemeinsame Internetwährung werden - Twitter- & Square-CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin könnte gemeinsame Internetwährung werden Verfasst von FOCUS.de am .

However, the digital coin’s price began to fall in the afternoon, with the decline accelerating towards the end of the session. Bitcoin finished the session at $8,094.32, down from its opening price of $8,370.05.\nThe digital currency continued to fall in the early hours of today’s trading, dropping below the $8,000 mark for the first time since April 18. However, after hitting an intraday low of $7,974.82, the cryptocurrency has been able to bounce back and secure a seemingly more stable position above $8,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $8,140, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nA similar pattern has been observed across the wider cryptocurrency market. Other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and EOS also fell sharply, but subsequently recovered losses incurred earlier today. However, they have remained well below their yesterday highs.\nEarlier this week, CoinShares chairman Danny Master told CNBC that Bitcoin could return to its all-time highs this year, but in order for that to happen, the cryptocurrency market needs to develop better structures, such as custody solutions, indices, performance measures, things that could attract institutional investors to the market.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $8,147.23, as of 10:06 BST. The digital currency has lost nearly 2% of its value in the past 24 hours. Its total market capitalisation currently stands at $138.8 billion, which represents 37.4% of the total value of all cryptocurrencies.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.

Bitcoin only 13th in the ranking. The new index assesses technological capability, usefulness, and innovativeness of crypto blockchains.\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Ethereum is the top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space, while bitcoin, the original virtual currency, is ranked 13th, according to the Chinese government's first monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index released on Thursday.\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which features 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with a total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com.\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4% at $689.62.\nChina, in general, sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters' Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Leslie Adler)\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>> ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "getty/john phillips ethereum", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "vitalik buterin", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T12:14:02.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abfdb4db8d7080fd2a5ff30503a34c81cc11314d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy9WOhF_1wo8Kxk_Sn3NPlPmblkW5GKna3oCXWq9CBsJ8PKSGl58GzIgw.Ywemdwas-", "site_full": "forum.singaporeexpats.com", "site": "singaporeexpats.com", "site_section": "http://forum.singaporeexpats.com/viewforum.php?f=14", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Entertainment, Leisure &amp; Sports • Singapore Expats Forum", "title": "gambling host accept the bitcoin ?", "title_full": "gambling host accept the bitcoin ? • Singapore Expats Forum", "published": "2018-05-18T12:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.901, "main_image": "https://www.singaporeexpats.com/com/fb/ogimage-forum.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 52337, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abfdb4db8d7080fd2a5ff30503a34c81cc11314d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy9WOhF_1wo8Kxk_Sn3NPlPmblkW5GKna3oCXWq9CBsJ8PKSGl58GzIgw.Ywemdwas-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "brilliantsg", "published": "2018-05-18T12:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "gambling host accept the bitcoin ?", "text": "can you show mw some online casino accpeted the Bitcoin.

So I think there is really a lot of space for any kind of business.\nin spite of it all is basically this business requires a lot of capital to be successful. so in my opinion better be patient first to be able to wait everything goes and follow the groove\nThis thing is very obvious right now.

Since then, it has nearly halved in value which will mean that many who jumped on the bandwagon in December could have been badly burnt. The underlying technology behind bitcoin is blockchain, a financial ledger maintained by a network of computers that can track the movement of any asset without the need for a central regulator. Bitcoin launched in 2009, while ethereum only arrived in 2015. For some, the research shows that the Chinese government is throwing its weight behind blockchain development following its crackdown on illegal trades late last year. To date, the Chinese government has banned initial coin offerings, closed down domestic exchanges and blocked all access to websites dealing with cryptocurrency trading, including foreign platforms. Aside from its table rankings, the Chinese government's research body gave little detailed insights into the methodology behind their latest findings. Eric Zhao, a Shanghai-based engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Quartz he would not take the ratings very seriously because 'most old-school experts haven’t followed the crypto space long enough to grasp some of the traits of [the] tech and community that can’t be found elsewhere.' He added: 'I believe at least it’s a sign that the officials are starting to treat crypto projects more like a neutral endeavour towards better technology and innovations, rather than just challenging the power and authority of banks and government.' Tough stance: The Chinese government has banned initial coin offerings, closed down domestic exchanges and blocked all access to websites dealing with cyrptocurrency If you do buy into bitcoin Find out how bitcoin and the blockchain works, so that you have some understanding of the system, the ledger, the major players and the public and private key elements. Remember bitcoin yields nothing and its main source of value is scarcity. Most bitcoin activity is trading not investing. Research coin wallets, the digital vaults where cryptocurrency is held, and consider security carefully. Bitcoins have been stolen before, understand how this happened. Be prepared for extreme volatility. The price can move by 20 per cent in one day and you could easily lose half of your cash in a far quicker time that investing in the stock market. Consider how you would cash in any gains. There are reports that this has proved hard for some people. A time of market stress could lead to people being locked in and unable to trade.

Price is unimportant in the long run. The real value of it through adoption and real-world usage is sky-rocketing since months.\n/u/mooneken\nJust thought I'd share what I see as the most important lesson I've learned since I started to get Bitcoin.\nIts current price is not its value.\nPrice is only temporary and will always adjust to value in the end.\nYou can get a grasp of Bitcoins real value everytime you see news about which new country or organisation is adopting bitcoin. Everytime you see some random sign that says \"accepting Bitcoin now\". Hell, you can get credit cards by now that you just use like the normal ones and in the background every payment is paid from your wallet instead of your bank account.\nBut most importantly I learned to bother less about how much fiat my coins are worth because getting Bitcoin should be about having Bitcoin to use in the future because for me there is now doubt about it replacing our current money system.\nIt already is.\nSo better be honest to yourself. Do you really trust in Bitcoin and are willing to ignore the price going d own because you see its true value?\nOr are you just after something to make money with. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that but the problem is if you don't put value>price than you're in for a lot of sleepless nights.\nHave a good day everybody. And keep sharing all those pictures about random local stores accepting BTC now :)\nsubmitted by /u/mooneken\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T11:44:00.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0796f9bc7eae258d6da0cf0f1a1b4e93fb44620c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY3Xh8siAUqVHnHJFnwrSNDN_vk3edbNEtvoYtcqMbxP0OygsLR2LH0SR1RN2aaZY_w--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "4 Reasons Why Bitcoin Will Become More Valuable", "title_full": "4 Reasons Why Bitcoin Will Become More Valuable", "published": "2018-05-18T11:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0796f9bc7eae258d6da0cf0f1a1b4e93fb44620c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY3Xh8siAUqVHnHJFnwrSNDN_vk3edbNEtvoYtcqMbxP0OygsLR2LH0SR1RN2aaZY_w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T11:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "4 Reasons Why Bitcoin Will Become More Valuable", "text": "It is perhaps easy to get lost in the constant flurry of activities within the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. From government crackdowns to new crypto launches, the arena can seem like a swirling vortex of entropy. Bitcoin, the number one digital currency remains the focal point of the industry. Here are four reasons why Nakamoto's creation is destined for even greater heights in the future.\nThe Simplicity of the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain. Since its creation, there have been many other iterations of the technology to varying degrees of success. While not taking anything away from robust functioning environments like Ethereum and co, the bitcoin blockchain triumphs in its simplicity. Now, with upgrades like SegWit and the Lightning Network, the efficiency of its blockchain can be improved significantly.\nWhile other blockchains delve into more sophisticated and sometimes confusing applications, the Bitcoin blockchain remains quite simple and basic. This simplicity tends to create a mass appeal, especially with the not-so-tech-savvy.\nFintech Revolution The number one crypto is at the heart of the emerging fintech revolution. The tech market has established itself as a change-driver in the broader financial market. Bitcoin is beginning to dominate fintech with recent reports showing that Square Cash app is outstripping Paypal's Venmo regarding growth. Such has been the impact of bitcoin that Square sold $34 million worth of bitcoin in Q1 of 2018.\nIn Africa, bitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth with many remittance and payment platforms offering bitcoin products. As a result, payments have become significantly easier thus lifting a considerable burden from millions of unbanked and underbanked people.\nPrice Resilience Bitcoin, much like the larger crypto market is volatile. However, in recent times, bitcoin has shown itself resilient to otherwise profound market events. While other cryptos decline in the high double-digit percentages, bitcoin usually only suffers single-digit declines. A recent example is the Upbit investigation which saw bitcoin show some resilience despite the general crypto price decline. With the market maturing, bitcoin will begin to show even fewer reactions to negative market signals.\nBitcoin Price for the Last Three Months\nAdoption by Mainstream Finance Bitcoin is not without its naysayers like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates . However, there is a noticeable increase in the level of adoption coming from the mainstream finance arena. Nasdaq recently partnered with Gemini to ensure the fidelity of the exchange platform's bitcoin trading infrastructure. In 2017 both the CME and CBOE launched bitcoin futures trading.\n2018 has seen an influx of bitcoin products geared at increasing the presence of institutional investors in the market. Coinbase and Goldman Sachs recently unveiled products targeted at institutional investors. There are also reports of OTC bitcoin trading decks that will allow significant bitcoin buy and sell orders without negatively impacting the market.\nDo you agree that bitcoin will become even more valuable in the future? Will it remain the number crypto despite growing competition in the market?

For an obvious reason: It will help address multiple barriers to investing in major cryptocurrencies.\n&a;ldquo;Investing in cryptocurrency is complicated for the majority of investors,&a;rdquo; explains Jonathan Benassaya&l;strong&g;, &l;/strong&g;CEO and Founder of IronChain. &a;ldquo;The four main barriers to invest are custody, liquidity, diversification and fees. IronChain&a;rsquo;s solution addresses those four issues by allowing daily liquidity to all investors without any lockup, with an annual fee of 1% (the most economical of the market). There are no performance nor loading or redemption fees, an index-based portfolio of 10 of the largest protocols with a market cap weighting, and an institutional grade custody through xapo, kingdom and ledger. With this product, investors can invest in the cryptocurrency market in a product as close as possible to a regular mutual fund.&a;rdquo;\nMEDIA Protocol CEO, James Tabor agrees. &l;span&g;&q;This approach will make crypto more accessible to new investors, and any influx of money is good for the wider market.&q;&l;/span&g;\nEiland Glover, CEO of Kowala, an autonomously stablized cryptocurrency is also positive on the introduction of index funds, though he thinks they benefit mostly accredited investors. &a;ldquo;While this move will definitely increase accessibility, at this stage, it will mostly affect accredited investors rather than retail investors,&a;rdquo; says Glover. &a;ldquo;Billions of dollars of accredited investor money has remained on the sidelines because investing in crypto has thus far been difficult and has felt quite risky. An entire class of investors has been listening to buddies tell stories over beers about the ways they&a;rsquo;ve made 4000% returns, and as such, are likely to eagerly embrace a simpler and more secure way to enter the market. Ultimately, we hope this kind of product can be made available to retail investors, as such an evolution would drive growth and industry comfort levels as the pool grows larger.&a;rdquo;\n&l;strong&g;7d Performance of Major Cryptocurrencies&l;/strong&g;\n&l;/p&g;&l;div class=&q;table-wrapper&q;&g;&l;table&g;&l;tbody&g;&l;tr&g;&l;td width=&q;198&q;&g;Cryptocurrency&l;/td&g;\n&l;td width=&q;143&q;&g;%24H&l;/td&g;\n&l;td width=&q;153&q;&g;%7d Change&l;/td&g;\n&l;/tr&g;&l;tr&g;&l;td width=&q;198&q;&g;Bitcoin&l;/td&g;\n&l;td width=&q;143&q;&g;-3.18&l;/td&g;\n&l;td width=&q;153&q;&g;-7.54&l;/td&g;\n&l;/tr&g;&l;tr&g;&l;td width=&q;198&q;&g;Ethereum&l;/td&g;\n&l;td width=&q;143&q;&g;-3.22&l;/td&g;\n&l;td width=&q;153&q;&g;-4.24&l;/td&g;\n&l;/tr&g;&l;tr&g;&l;td width=&q;198&q;&g;Ripple&l;/td&g;\n&l;td width=&q;143&q;&g;&a;nbsp;-5.41&l;/td&g;\n&l;td width=&q;153&q;&g;-13.32&l;/td&g;\n&l;/tr&g;&l;/tbody&g;&l;/table&g;&l;/div&g;&l;em&g;Source: Coinmarketcap.com 5/15/18 at 3.30 p.m.&l;/em&g;\n&l;!–nextpage–&g;\nThe introduction of the new funds comes a few months after Wall Street introduced Bitcoin Futures to solve another problem for the digital currency: market volatility, paving the way for the people&a;rsquo;s currency to gain broad acceptance among merchants as a medium of exchange.\nThat&a;rsquo;s another bullish development for the &a;ldquo;people&a;rsquo;s currency.&a;rdquo;\nA few words of caution: IronChain MiX10 and IronChain are not registered with the SEC.

This is a clear example of when something may be overvalued and simply runs out of buyers. Any bulls will be left hoping that in the longer term, the things that have driven Bitcoin to $8000 and beyond will continue to be a factor and could set It off on another bull run. For now, it is awfully quiet in Cryptocurrency markets and if you go on Crypto-twitter, this is exactly how early adopters like it. Larger investors will still be extremely spooked by absurd liquidity costs which are likely worse in the current low volume environment, Iranians demand for Bitcoin soars as Rial collapses\nThe collapse of the Iranian currency in anticipation of US sanctions has many adverse effects for the people of Iran, but very interestingly, it seems to have prompted yet another nation which sees some serious benefits from having a currency independent of the state. In a fascinating report from Cryptovest, the Cryptocurrency news site, an interview with Juan Villaverde from Weiss ratings demonstrate the ratings institution as highlighting how crumbling fiat currencies provide the best incubator for rising Cryptocurrency demand,\n“To continually trust traditional money and banking, you must live in a country that has continually enjoyed financial stability. But there aren’t many of those left. For the rest of the world, the appeal of cryptocurrencies is immediately apparent”\nIt is freedom which seems to be the most crucial factor for a financially vulnerable person, and increasingly the knowledge that the decisions of a government won’t destroy your hard work and care to accumulate currency as Mr. Villaverde writes in regards to Bitcoin,\n“Your government won’t print this currency into oblivion. You can trade it with whomever you want. And you can enjoy a kind of financial freedom that would otherwise be impossible… It’s not hard for Washington to bar a nation’s access to the global financial system. So if you’re in a barred country, even if the dollars are still in your account, it’s almost impossible to get them out of the country”\nAll in all this means that the divergence for the case between the developing world and the developed world’s use of Bitcoin continues to grow. In emerging markets plagued by inflation it’s a no brainer for people to hold currency in something independent of their countries financial structure, but for stable fiat nation’s it takes doomsayers to really believe in the need for an alternative.

Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said that Bitcoin could emerge as a possible competitor to the US dollar in the future. He also did not rule out the prospects of the FED launching its own cryptocurrency, though he said that there was no plan at the moment. Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the fifth largest bank in the world by assets, is exploring options to launch its own cryptocurrency, known as MUFG Coin . It plans to test it by the next year. The existing cryptocurrencies are gearing up for a likely competition by introducing upgrades that can improve operations. Additionally, the crypto exchanges are launching new products targeting the institutional investors. All of these point to the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies and the acceptance that the blockchain technology can be a game changer. The long-term investors should welcome any fall in prices as it offers an opportunity to buy the digital currencies at a discount. Let’s see if we find any buy setups today. BTC/USD Bitcoin has broken below the 50-day SMA after holding it for the past four days, which is a bearish development. The only major support now is $7,941.68. If this level breaks, a drop to $7,000 is likely. If the $7,941.68 level holds, the BTC/USD pair might enter a period of consolidation between $7,941-$10,000. Once the range is confirmed, we shall try to trade it by buying close to the support and covering the position at the resistance. Currently, there are no buy setups, hence, we suggest waiting until a reliable pattern develops. ETH/USD Ethereum failed to break out of $745 on May 14 and turned down from there. It has broken below the 20-day EMA today. The small neckline of a possible head and shoulders pattern is providing a strong support level. Today, prices have rebounded sharply from it. The ETH/USD pair might consolidate between the neckline of the bearish pattern and $745. A break above the overhead resistance will be a positive move. Therefore, we suggest long positions above $750 with a close stop loss. The immediate target is a move to $838. This is a risky trade, hence we recommend traders to take a small position (about 30 percent of usual). If the bears succeed in breaking and closing below the neckline, the bearish pattern will complete, giving it a target of $418. However, we believe that $600, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level and the 50-day SMA will act as strong support on the downside. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has broken down of the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. If it closes (UTC) below the neckline, it will have a pattern target of $650. However, the bulls are unlikely to give up without a fight. The levels to watch out for on the downside are the horizontal support at $1221 and the 50-day SMA. We anticipate a bounce from either of these two levels. However, it is difficult to predict whether the rebound will sustain or fail. Though the 20-day EMA is turning down, the 50-day SMA is still trending up. Hence, we believe that the BCH/USD pair is unlikely to sink to $650. If the $1221 support holds, a range bound action is probable. It is not clear whether the digital currency will go up or down from the present levels. Hence, we would prefer to watch from the sidelines. XRP/USD Ripple could not scale above the $0.76 levels on May 14, resulting in a slide below the 50-day SMA. The next support on the downside is the May 12 lows of $0.632. A break below this will sink the digital currency to the $0.562 levels. If the XRP/USD pair manages to stay above the $0.63 levels, the bulls will again try to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.76. The 20-day EMA is turning down while the 50-day SMA is flattening out. As prices are quoting below both the moving averages and are some distance away from the critical support of the large range, we shall not propose any long positions. XLM/USD Stellar turned down from the 20-day EMA as higher levels lacked buyers. Currently, prices are back at the 50-day SMA, which is critical support. If this level breaks, the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern is the final support. The bearish pattern will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below the neckline. The pattern target of such a break is way lower at $0.2. If the XLM/USD pair either holds the neckline or the 50-day SMA, a range bound action will ensue. Any more above the overhead resistance of $0.47766719 will be very bullish because it will invalidate the bearish pattern. We shall look for buying opportunities above $0.373 levels. LTC/USD The recovery in Litecoin hit a brick wall at the 20-day EMA on May 14. Currently, prices are again back below the horizontal support at $141. A break below the May 12 lows of $132.163 will open a downside target of $115. Both the moving averages are turning down. This increases the probability of a drop to the critical support levels of $115, which is expected to hold. If this support breaks, the LTC/USD pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern on a breakdown below $107, which will be very negative. The digital currency is showing weakness; hence, we have no buy recommendations. We shall change our view if the bulls manage to hold the May 12 lows and break out of $170. ADA/BTC Cardano is unable to find buyers at a higher level. The bounce off the trendline and the 50-day SMA on May 12 did not even break above the 20-day EMA. Prices are again back at the supports, increasing the chances of a breakdown. The 0.000025 levels had held up nicely from April 13 to April 15. So, if the ADA/BTC pair breaks the trendline, it can drop to this level. The 20-day EMA will continue to act as resistance on any up move. The digital currency will pick up momentum after scaling 0.00003445 levels. IOTA/USD IOTA has not done a great deal in the past five days. It is stuck between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. On the upside, immediate resistance is at the 20-day EMA and once this level is crossed the next hurdle is at $2.2117 levels. On the downside, supports exist at the 50-day SMA and $1.63. Both the moving averages are flattening out, which increases the possibility of a range bound action. We don’t find any buy setup on the IOTUSD pair, hence, are not suggesting any trade on it. EOS/USD EOS continues to correct. It is currently at the 50-day SMA, just below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally. This is a critical level and should hold. The subsequent bounce will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the top trendline of the descending channel. If the EOS/USD pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, it can decline to the next support at the bottom trendline at $10. The digital currency has lost momentum and is likely to remain range bound for a few days before starting a new trend. We shall revisit our view if it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel for a couple of days.

Currently, Bitcoin related activities are consuming as much power as Ireland does and it’s set to grow even further in the coming months.\nThe cryptocurrency gained worldwide attention after shooting up in value and making many people rich – its strong potential and significant fluctuations in value gave rise to a whole new market.\nAs its usage continues to grow, it has been a strong concern for major companies and regulatory bodies to manage it, or tax it, as it drains a lot of resources such as electricity and powerful hardware. A Massive Energy Drainer\nThe amount of power used by Bitcoin is an important factor for understanding its global impact, in order to implement effective policies. Alex de Vries, a Netherlands-based economist and cryptocurrency expert said,\nWe’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research, ALSO READ Bitcoin is Halal Under Some Conditions: Muslim Scholar\nIt is currently using as much electricity as Ireland, LiveMint reports, and the entire network’s usage is at an estimated 2.55 gigawatts. Quite similar to its insane value fluctuations, Bitcoin’s electricity consumption is also highly volatile as each transaction done through it uses as much electricity as an average house in the Netherlands uses for a month. 0.5% of the World’s Electricity\nAlex says that he believes its usage could grow up to 7.7 gigawatts (0.5% of the entire world’s consumption) by the end of this year,\nTo me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\nMining Bitcoin needs powerful computers or dedicated hardware that consistently perform mathematical calculations.

From government crackdowns to new crypto launches, the arena can seem like a swirling vortex of entropy. Bitcoin, the number one digital currency remains the focal point of the industry. Here are four reasons why Nakamoto’s creation is destined for even greater heights in the future. The Simplicity of the Bitcoin Blockchain\nBitcoin was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain. Since its creation, there have been many other iterations of the technology to varying degrees of success. While not taking anything away from robust functioning environments like Ethereum and co, the bitcoin blockchain triumphs in its simplicity. Now, with upgrades like SegWit and the Lightning Network, the efficiency of its blockchain can be improved significantly.\nWhile other blockchains delve into more sophisticated and sometimes confusing applications, the Bitcoin blockchain remains quite simple and basic. This simplicity tends to create a mass appeal, especially with the not-so-tech-savvy. Fintech Revolution\nThe number one crypto is at the heart of the emerging fintech revolution. The tech market has established itself as a change-driver in the broader financial market. Bitcoin is beginning to dominate fintech with recent reports showing that Square Cash app is outstripping Paypal’s Venmo regarding growth. Such has been the impact of bitcoin that Square sold $34 million worth of bitcoin in Q1 of 2018.\nIn Africa, bitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth with many remittance and payment platforms offering bitcoin products. As a result, payments have become significantly easier thus lifting a considerable burden from millions of unbanked and underbanked people. Price Resilience\nBitcoin, much like the larger crypto market is volatile. However, in recent times, bitcoin has shown itself resilient to otherwise profound market events. While other cryptos decline in the high double-digit percentages, bitcoin usually only suffers single-digit declines. A recent example is the Upbit investigation which saw bitcoin show some resilience despite the general crypto price decline. With the market maturing, bitcoin will begin to show even fewer reactions to negative market signals. Bitcoin Price for the Last Three Months Adoption by Mainstream Finance\nBitcoin is not without its naysayers like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates . However, there is a noticeable increase in the level of adoption coming from the mainstream finance arena. Nasdaq recently partnered with Gemini to ensure the fidelity of the exchange platform’s bitcoin trading infrastructure. In 2017 both the CME and CBOE launched bitcoin futures trading.\n2018 has seen an influx of bitcoin products geared at increasing the presence of institutional investors in the market. Coinbase and Goldman Sachs recently unveiled products targeted at institutional investors. There are also reports of OTC bitcoin trading decks that will allow significant bitcoin buy and sell orders without negatively impacting the market.\nDo you agree that bitcoin will become even more valuable in the future? Will it remain the number crypto despite growing competition in the market?

Whether it’s used as a saving, long-term investment, or as short-term trading to make money, cryptocurrency is one of the first go-to options for everyone these days.\nWhere do you buy them? Where do you trade them? These are pretty common questions which anyone would have. This article is for people who are just starting off or are looking for a better alternative to their current exchange platform.\nDigital currency Exchanges (DCE) are the online platforms where trading of cryptocurrency for fiat money or other cryptocurrencies take place.\nCurrently, there are a lot of cryptocurrency exchanges present out there in the market. And choosing the best out of many ain’t an easy task. Several factors such as reputation, payment method, verification process, transaction fee, security, geographic restrictions have to be considered while selecting the right cryptocurrency exchange.\nIn order to make the task simple and quick for you, here is the compilation of the best cryptocurrency exchanges in the market. Best Crypto Exchange Platforms: 1. Binance\nThough Binance was founded in 2017, it attracted a pretty decent number of customers as there are no geographic restrictions i.e, it is open to all the countries around the world. Also, the transaction fee is quite low which is just 0.1% and it allows a wide range of cryptocurrencies for transactions with strong security.\nBinance also offers a mobile application for both iOS and Android users. However, it only allows a limited number of user registrations per day which would be open for a few hours. Binance will suit well for you if you do not need fiat access. 2. CoinBase\nCoinBase is one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges available right now with a 13 million user base. Founded in 2011, the company has sustained its reputation in the market with its easy to use user interface and pretty low transaction fee i.e, 1.49 – 3.99% depending on the payment method. Worldwide, it supports around 30 countries and is available as a mobile app for Android and iOS users.\nIt allows cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. However, CoinBase is highly popular for bitcoin exchange. Unlike Binance, CoinBase allows fiat transactions but users will have to go through a strict verification process for registering and trading. Another negative about Coin Base is that there have been few reports of glitches about the platform. 3. Bitfinex\nBitfinex is one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in terms of both users and volume of exchanges and is a perfect option for professional cryptocurrency traders. It has some advanced features such as limit orders, trailing stop, stop orders, TWAP. It also has a mobile app for Android and iOS users to trade cryptocurrencies.\nHowever, it doesn’t allow fiat exchanges and restricts the U.S.A users from registering for exchanges. Another drawback is the long verification process. Bitfinex takes up to 15-20 days for validating users. 4. Bitterix\nBitterix is one of the old and reputed cryptocurrency exchanges based in the US. It is available worldwide and allows users to trade around 190 cryptocurrencies. It charges around 0.25% as commission for all transactions.\nAlthough the registration process is fast and simple, one must submit ID documents for trading up to 100BTC per day. However, Bitterix hasn’t been allowing many registrations lately. 5. Kraken\nKraken is a US-based cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2011. It is available in countries such as U.S, Canada, Europe, Japan. It also supports fiat transactions with charges up to 0.36%.\nThe verification process is quite different which is carried out in 5 different tiers.\ntire 0 – requires an email address for verification.
