From a minimum of below $6,500 at the beginning of this month, the digital currency’s value has surged to over $9,000 , the highest point since mid-March, and is already threatening to break the psychologically significant ceiling of $10,000.\nThe first few months of the year turned out to be quite fraught for the digital currency market as a whole, with the industry facing harsh rhetoric from officials and regulators around the world. The threat of a large-scale clampdown led to an aggressive sell-off of Bitcoin, which fell rapidly from a record high near $20,000, achieved in mid-December . Plus, the wave of indignation from institutions resulted in day traders leaving the market, which led to decreased volatility in virtual asset values. Bitcoin Price – Looking Ahead! Credits: Coindesk\nNow the prospect of regulation, which is expected to be orderly and gradual, is being seen by many as a favorable factor for Bitcoin in the longer term . If the industry is regulated, that would mean lower risks and therefore the assets would appear more attractive and safe, including to institutional investors, which is not a small thing.\nThere are already signs of an inflow of such investors, and that has contributed somewhat to the cryptocurrency’s ongoing growth. For example, Barclays considers launching a trading platform for digital currencies , while Goldman Sachs hired former trader Justin Schmidt to serve as the first head of virtual assets in the bank’s securities division. With these giants as an example, the ecosystem is quite capable of attracting other major institutions in the future, which will serve only to strengthen Bitcoin and similar currencies.

This phenomenon is being observed on the market for the first time since March of last year and foretells further development of this bull market, in which optimistic investors, by inertia, keep raising the digital currency’s value and market capitalization. But What If Bitcoin Price Drops?\nIn just the last seven days, Bitcoin’s value has increased by 15%, and technical indicators point to a potential for further increases. But while the instrument’s more long-term prospects are cause for optimism, in the foreseeable future there could well be another wave of selling, which would be succeeded by a surge to even more impressive levels. This could be caused by profit taking, if any negative signals or news appear in the industry. If this scenario comes to pass, the sell-off would present a wonderful opportunity to buy in with even more ambitious goals for the middle- and long-term.\nThis local adjustment could, for example, take place as the $10,000 level is tested, near which is an intermediate zone of resistance around $9,850. Meanwhile, in the subsequent resurgence, Bitcoin could shoot up to $12,000 or higher, and that would not be too far off in the future. There is also the possibility that this digital asset would avoid a significant adjustment if the value is not held up around $10,000. Within the next 5–6 months, if no significant shakeups hit the market, it could return to December’s high water mark, or even try to exceed it.

On May 19, 2018, a person posted an image which contains a bitcoin puzzle that rewards the solver 1 BTC. Also read: A Brief History of Hidden Messages in the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin Puzzles: Hiding Cryptocurrencies in Plain Sight Since the inception of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, visual puzzles that contain digital asset rewards have been very popular. This week a Reddit user named ‘u/cryptogreetings’ posted a cryptic picture online that contained a puzzle with a 1 BTC prize. Since the image was published online no one has been able to crack it so far as the public address can be seen here . The picture is black and orange and white with a bitcoin symbol and many words, and numbers strewed across the image. The creator says if no one can crack it in a week they will publish some hints to help people out. “This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry,” explains the Reddit user u/cryptogreetings. The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life, and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work. This picture was published yesterday, it contains 1 BTC hidden within the image. It has not been solved yet. The Infamous Coin Artist 5 BTC Puzzle Solved This Year Just recently news.Bitcoin.com reported on a famous bitcoin puzzle that contained 5 BTC for years before the puzzle was decrypted. The painting called ‘The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto’ was designed by @coin_artist , who had hidden clues that revealed a private key to the tethered wallet . The puzzle was solved by a 30-year old programmer named ‘Isaac’ who solved the puzzle in less than two months. Isaac just happened upon the puzzle while searching for cryptocurrency related riddles online. This painting held 5 BTC at one time, it was solved this year. Cryptocurrency Puzzles and Riddles Strewn Across the Web There have been tons of bitcoin puzzles over the years and there even is a Reddit forum dedicated to these riddles called r/bitcoinpuzzles . The Reddit forum has lots of puzzles with large funds hidden and smaller mBTC fractions. News.Bitcoin.com reported on another bitcoin puzzle series that is tied to an Enigma game on Steam. Montecrypto is a game specifically designed for armchair detectives as this past February the game made headlines worldwide. During the first week of February, a gamer solved the Montecrypto puzzles and accumulated $50K worth of BTC, BCH, and other coins. Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos showing a hidden $12Mn BTC transaction back in 2015. As long as cryptocurrencies can be hidden people will always try to solve these puzzles using techniques like uncovering obscure clues, utilizing steganography and cryptography. People have also stored puzzles within the digital asset’s network as well as one user in 2011 wrote a paper describing a way to implement steganography inside the Bitcoin Core (BTC) network. “That is, storing hidden messages inside the network, that would be available only to those who knew where (and how) to look,” explained the creator and his paper’s summary.

Signs of recovery are now showing themselves as we inch away from the repeated drops of last week. At $8,500, bitcoin is at its highest point since Monday, when it briefly rose to $8,800 following the start of Coindesk’s Consensus Conference. It was prior to this event that Fundstrat’s Tom Lee (no stranger to these price articles) made a bold prediction regarding the currency’s price. He stated that bitcoin would rally during the Conference, and spike harder than it had in previous weeks. Ultimately, the price didn’t rally; in fact, it incurred several drops following the event’s commencement, and didn’t begin exhibiting signs of positive change until the Conference was over. Bitcoin lost about 10 percent of its overall value while the event was taking place. Lee later “owned up” to his incorrect prediction, writing: “Given conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction, and coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided cryptocurrency prices.” Lee blames that lack of price rises during the Conference on the fact that regulation in America is still unclear. He says that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general need more clarification from organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with an increase in institutional adoption rates before prices can really fire up. “Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions, “he later added. “But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance comes by way of financial institutions.” The fact is that bitcoin and the world of cryptocurrencies remain relatively volatile and speculative, and it’s right when we think we’ve got it down that we’re ultimately proven wrong. As we’ve seen, it’s near impossible to predict how digital currency prices will react to certain events, news, trends and other factors. Thus, making suggestions about what direction they’ll take in the future is an almost pointless task. Lee called bitcoin’s maneuvers during the Consensus “very disappointing.” However, the analyst is sticking to his guns and insists that the currency will reach a price of $25,000 by the end of the year, beating out last year’s mega-price record by approximately $5,000. He further states that bitcoin will hit the $91,000 mark by 2020. In addition to bitcoin, most major cryptocurrencies are hurling themselves deeper into green territory. At press time, Ethereum is up to $714 after a long week of wading through the $670 range. Ripple’s XRP has risen by approximately three cents and is on the verge of breaking $0.70, while Litecoin is traversing through the high $130 range. Bitcoin Cash remains the only major cryptocurrency “still in a funk,” having recently taken a nosedive towards $1,180 after a solid week of meandering through $1,200. The currency has an upcoming hard fork scheduled that’s slated to render the original BCH coin null and void. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T04:21:00.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1caf49a174ef4d83d38b24683b1497f7462f888", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCDW7NoyFBGBfH75xNUPvpQGDRBZvbnZsyatiNevq7WoMMZ.3mlylN26uJNlPOcRRUDELMni40V1A.S5yyZfYAq585tPq4K_Dw8WRcCN8Vff7QZWeZXGQRhbanoZthWBYd", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "How Bitfinex’s Tax Requirement May Have Contributed to the Bitcoin Price Correction", "title_full": "How Bitfinex’s Tax Requirement May Have Contributed to the Bitcoin Price Correction", "published": "2018-05-21T06:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1caf49a174ef4d83d38b24683b1497f7462f888", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCDW7NoyFBGBfH75xNUPvpQGDRBZvbnZsyatiNevq7WoMMZ.3mlylN26uJNlPOcRRUDELMni40V1A.S5yyZfYAq585tPq4K_Dw8WRcCN8Vff7QZWeZXGQRhbanoZthWBYd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T06:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Bitfinex’s Tax Requirement May Have Contributed to the Bitcoin Price Correction", "text": "8 hours ago Crypto World News CryptoCoinNews 85 On May 17, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency and bitcoin exchange Bitfinex officially asked its users to submit tax IDs and social security numbers that could be utilized by government agencies in the countries its users are based into tax gains recorded in the cryptocurrency market. “We request that you complete the appropriate self-certification The post How Bitfinex’s Tax Requirement May Have Contributed to the Bitcoin Price Correction appeared first on CCN - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news cryptocoinnews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T04:21:07.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bcfc5d2c11537969e2dabf56dd47df72525b86a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCx06HRI6sipu3ISshGNG4dnZH8GYvO6BTkYccsKtcc5S8MMn10wBLWDs.gR9KrN5Fhzl62Z9DHsQ-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #366 Outside Perspectives", "title_full": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #366 Outside Perspectives", "published": "2018-05-21T06:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bcfc5d2c11537969e2dabf56dd47df72525b86a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCx06HRI6sipu3ISshGNG4dnZH8GYvO6BTkYccsKtcc5S8MMn10wBLWDs.gR9KrN5Fhzl62Z9DHsQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T06:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #366 Outside Perspectives", "text": "5 hours ago Blogs and more Lets talk Bitcoin 51 On Today's Episode of Let's Talk Bitcoin...

The billionaire e-commerce guru said bitcoin is the bubble and not blockchain. He made these comments at the recently concluded World Intelligence Congress in Tianjin. Blockchain not Bitcoin Narrative Lives On During his address at the conference, Ma revealed that Alibaba focuses solely on blockchain implementation. According to Ma: Blockchain is now a hot word. First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era. The Alibaba executive also went to say that blockchain was the true technological breakthrough that would drive the coming digital revolution . He identified the technology behind cryptos as having immense potential for all kinds of business processes. Ma also revealed that his company was exploring several blockchain applications. Alibaba is investing in data security and privacy solutions built on the blockchain. Such is the extent of the company’s activities in the arena that it presently holds the most number of blockchain-related patents in the world. Ma is, however, dissatisfied with the current extent people are exploring the technology. According to Ma, too much emphasis is placed on blockchain as a money-making tool when it ought to be used as a value creation technology. He reiterated the need for the focus to be on improving the global business process rather than treating blockchain as a “gold mine.” Bitcoin is a Bubble On the subject of bitcoin, Ma ironically called the world’s most popular and secure blockchain, i.e. Bitcoin, a bubble. In the past, the Alibaba founder had shown a lack of interest in Bitcoin. Has even previously said that he knows little about the crypto preferring only to focus on the blockchain. Most of the company’s efforts in the blockchain realm focus on e-commerce and public welfare protocols. In 2016, Alibaba launched a blockchain email repository , and in 2017, the company signed a partnership with PwC to develop a food traceability architecture based on the technology. While previously noncommittal to the Bitcoin argument, Ma’s recent comments put him with the likes of Warren Buffett , Charlie Munger, Bill Gates and many others. These notable business figures all have negative things to say about the world’s first cryptocurrency much to the chagrin of the Bitcoin enthusiasts. Do you agree with Jack Ma’s comments? Are you in agreement with folks who say only blockchain technology has value and not bitcoin? Please share your views with us in the comment section below.

Ontology, Tron, AirSwap\nThe majority of tokens in the space have experienced an intensified movement on the downside, mimicking the downward pressure of bitcoin but with larger margins. Consequently, even tokens like ONT, ICON (ICX), and 0x (ZRX), which have consistently outperformed most major cryptocurrencies throughout April and May, fell substantially.\nOn May 21, most of these tokens rebounded from their recent losses, recording large gains against bitcoin which recorded a 4 percent increase against the US dollar. Against bitcoin, ONT recorded a 10 percent increase, AST rose by more than 15 percent and TRX demonstrated a 9.5 percent rise.\nAST is a particularly interesting token to observe, especially as a long-term investment because despite its hype and media coverage it received, it still remains as the 198th largest cryptocurrency in the world with a $62 million market valuation. Although the market cap of AirSwap is relatively small in comparison to other tokens like ONT and ICX, AST has more room to grow in the long-term.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of AST is at 53, signifying a neutral zone. Given that AST is still demonstrating a neutral condition after a 15 percent increase against bitcoin and both exponential and simple moving averages show a positive short-term trend, it is likely that AST continues to grow past its current price at 0.00004925 BTC. Strong Bounce\nBitcoin has been on a continuous downward trend ever since it failed to test the $10,000 support level in early May. Over the past 7 days, the bitcoin price has remained in the range of $7,900 to $8,785, struggling to gain momentum above $8,800, which is considered as a major support level that could allow the price of bitcoin to test the $10,000 support level again in the short-term.\nThe latest attempt of bitcoin to breach the $8,800 support level was on May 15, nearly a week ago. After surpassing $8,850, due to the pressure of bears, bitcoin dropped rapidly to $7,925 and bouncing back in the $7,900 region. If the bitcoin price can rebound to $8,800 in the upcoming days, possibly within the next 48 hours, it is likely that the bitcoin price tests the $9,600 support level soon after, eyeing an entrance into the $10,000 region by the end of May.\nOver the past week, bitcoin has been able to gradually build momentum from $7,900 to $8,500, which it has not done in previous corrective rallies. The stability in the price movement of bitcoin could provide more resilience in testing major support levels in the short-term.\nFollow us on Telegram.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "airswap", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T10:15:37.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a4a8ce009bea0c6e3d3d9dff517e86c8974ff4de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcHyn7_pi5_IL7upVOa.QzBF.vOvezLxt45P7yz8eEOODNXSAOC8gJsLd4FoXwm8vu2v1TXXYdxdlb6zZaHvLaoM0D946avJvYg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Fork Leaves Users Behind, But Does It Matter?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Fork Leaves Users Behind, But Does It Matter? : btc", "published": "2018-05-21T05:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a4a8ce009bea0c6e3d3d9dff517e86c8974ff4de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcHyn7_pi5_IL7upVOa.QzBF.vOvezLxt45P7yz8eEOODNXSAOC8gJsLd4FoXwm8vu2v1TXXYdxdlb6zZaHvLaoM0D946avJvYg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pilotavery", "published": "2018-05-21T05:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Fork Leaves Users Behind, But Does It Matter?", "text": "submitted by /u/pilotavery\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cash-fork-leaves-users-behind-matter/amp/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T01:24:04.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f35da43e1c592b8ca634bf58bccf0c754605b62a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOgXAPHf.I7cVGlJVD.TQfg-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-21T05:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f35da43e1c592b8ca634bf58bccf0c754605b62a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOgXAPHf.I7cVGlJVD.TQfg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T05:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 21, 2018 NEWS Technical Analysis May 20: Bitcoin , Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple CryptoSlate This week, cryptocurrency markets saw a severe drop as Bitcoin fell under the significant support level of $8,000.

As with other new initiatives, it is understood that a proportion of ICOO assets are reserved for OBITS, which Ronny Boesing, CEO of CCEDK ApS describes as a catch-all asset\" representing all present and future initiatives in the CCEDK community.One of the more successful ICOs has been the $18.5 million raise of capital done by Ethereum. Extra broadly, while coins and tokens may increase in value following an ICO, they're topic to excessive value volatility, which makes an ICO an inherently risky investment. Secondary markets for ICOs offering tokens which are securities must usually register as a national securities alternate or function pursuant to an exemption from such registration. Whether or not the Companies Act applies to an ICO will depend on the e-chat for bitcoin talk kind of ICO offering and what rights connect to the coins from the crypto news at echat ICO itself, underlying cash or tokens used within the ICO (all referred to as 'coins' for the purposes of this information sheet).

An ICO, or Token Sale, is an occasion wherein a blockchain undertaking sells a sequence of tokens to early adopters in alternate of authorized tender or cryptocurrency . The elevated popularity of ICOs among the startup neighborhood is largely as a result of facts that the method of running an ICO is much less rigid than seeking enterprise capital and startups do not need to show their thought in the marketplace earlier than receiving funds. ICO allows every individual and every firm to easily launch freely tradable tokens to lift funds. One of the explanation why investors are scrutinizing ICOs so closely is the growing prevalence of fraudulent initiatives. Given crypto cash differ from traditional equity or common shares, they're priced primarily based in the marketplace perception of worth and elevated adoption of the platform. For instance, the worth of Ethers - the tokens which have been released throughout the ICO of Ethereum - is strongly secured by the fact that they are required to run the DApps within the network. However, some ICOs contain the change of fiat money as effectively. The DAO's ICO was drained by means of an exploitation of the sensible contracts which allowed money to be transferred before the inner token balance was updated.

Ethereum, a well-liked blockchain for firms launching ICOs, is a more recent, separate expertise from Bitcoin, echat for bitcoin talk whose token is named Ether. One of many methods during which larger companies or more ambitious tasks increase cash is thru one thing we're all accustomed to — elevating cash from the public through the IPO. This number dwarfs the $358 million in traditional venture capital cash that went to blockchain startups over the same interval. ICOs conclude once the tokens or coins could be traded in the open market. IPO's are being held by established firms which regularly have been operating for a while and they largely look for long term capital, whereas ICO's principally search for capital to further develop their concept. An Initial Public Providing tries to lift capital by offering stock of their firm to the general public. As most of those early investments typically lose money and by no means make it to an IPO or even the reality of turning a profit, angel traders and enterprise capital companies take on a big risk for the opportunity to put money into corporations that can reap them a fortune akin to Uber, Tesla or Amazon. And eventually, inventory exchanges and firms listed by IPO are heavily regulated, whilst the exchanges on which ICOs are launched are fairly the other. Via these relationships and with the investment bank's due diligence, new companies provide their stock to the general public at prices and in amounts that handle the public's curiosity in these new equities. They are just like IPOs in that the unique funding funds in these ICOs are used for funding a startup or new project, and after the fundraising, the cash\" created are then accessible for exchanges where they will commerce for roughly than they were initially bought for.

Top-50 FinTech company, BANKEX, launched the beta version of its service on the 14 th of May as a way to introduce complete partiality during these disputes.\nThere is no doubt that blockchain technology has the potential to drastically change our lives. It offers security, immutability and a high level of transparency. It also an essential part of creating a paperless society, as are smart contracts.\nEliminating the need for reams of paper and intermediaries not only frees up time, but is also a more cost-effective and efficient way of doing business.\nHowever, because of the decentralized nature of the industry as a whole, arbitration for disputes regarding virtual currencies can be tricky. If you’re using a smart contract to facilitate payment for services rendered and things go south, you won’t be able to go to your nearest arbitration court for help.\nBANKEX is aware of this and has a solution – its Smart Justice service. If users are having a disagreement about goods or services received, this platform can help settle it. By basing the service on the law of big numbers and the game theory, there is also minimal opportunity for corruption. Dodgy Service Providers Beware\nEven though blockchain technology is reliable, some people aren’t. Terms of the smart contract on BANKEX’s Trust Service could state that payment will be released by Person A once a project is complete and submitted by Person B. However, what happens if that completed project isn’t up to scratch?\nJust as in a real-world court, Person A would file a dispute as the plaintiff. Unlike the real world, he or she would file it through the Smart Justice service. How Does it Work?\nInitially, the two parties involved would have to initiate a smart contract through the BANKEX Trust Service. All conditions of the contract will, therefore, be permanently available as and when the need arises, in this case, when arbitration is required.\nAs with any situation, there are always two sides to a story. With BANKEX’s arbitration board, Person B, or the Counterparty, would be able to give their version of events with the smart contract correspondence to validate or reject those claims.\nWith Smart Justice being a community-based service, it works on a voting system to determine which of the parties wins the dispute. In this case, these voters are actually arbitrators, or Decision Makers, who are randomly chosen by the platform to oversee these proceedings. They will have access to all of the information, including the smart contract details, as well as evidence provided by the plaintiff and defendant.\nBANKEX has researched how to use statistics and math and to provide a comprehensive solution with a minimal margin for error. A coin toss is a good analogy to explain the law of large numbers. There are two sides to a coin, which means that statistically, each time you toss it, there’s a 50% chance that it will land on either side.\nIn reality, you may find that it actually lands on heads seven out of 10 times. However, if you toss it for 10 or 20 more times, it may even out in that it lands on heads maybe 15 times out of 30. This shows that in the case of the voters, the more people that vote, the higher the chance of the right verdict being reached.\nInitially, the approved arbitrators will be the opinion leaders of the platform. However, community members can become arbitrators simply by purchasing voting tokens on the platform.\nOnce a case is available, 51 voters will be randomly assigned to work on it. With all of the information available, they will be able to vote in favor of either party or abstain. In the case of the latter, the Decision Maker will have their voting token returned to them.\nIn the event a resolution cannot be reached within the prescribed period for any of the above reasons, the Moderator fees fixed by the complaining party in BKX will revert to that party’s wallet, vote tokens will be returned to the Moderators, and the case will be closed without a resolution with all parties receiving notification of the causes. The complaining party may wish to initiate a new case repeating the process, taking into account the reasons why decision-makers decided to abstain from voting. Leveraging the Game Theory\nTo encourage fairness, those voters who voted on the majority decision will get financially rewarded. This will not only cover their initial cost in becoming a decision maker, but will also provide them with some extra earnings as a reward.\nOnce a verdict is reached, all of the case information will be recorded on the blockchain. Not only does this provide a high level of transparency to the rest of the community, it also gives others in similar situations a point of reference. Improving Service Delivery Through BANKEX\nThis seems like a great way to solve the disputes resolution problem in the decentralized industry. In addition, it will force service providers to always deliver an excellent product or experience to their clients so as not to be on the receiving end of a Smart Justice guilty verdict.\nBANKEX has launched their beta version of this service on the 14 th of May. The platform’s community is encouraged to test it and provide feedback.\nIf you’d like to know about BANKEX, have a look at their website. You can also read their blog discussing their Smart Justice service or join their Telegram channel if you’d like to have a chat with one of the founders.\nDo you think that BANKEX’s Smart Justice system will make people less apprehensive about using smart contracts and thereby actually increase mainstream adoption?

So more likely, I think bitcoin will be used more as a currency than an asset for investment. So that is may be why there are a lot people investing in bitcoin because of its fluctuations.

To put that in context, that’s nearly the same amount of energy consumed by the entirety of Ireland. That’s just the conservative current estimate; De Vries predicts that by December, the Bitcoin network could be using almost triple that. Bitcoins cost energy to “mine,” because mining is just a computer running calculations; the longer Bitcoin is around, the more energy it takes to mine each subsequent unit (it takes four times as much energy to mine a single Bitcoin now as it did when the currency launched in 2009).

But it's been shown (Unspent) for one address for more then 3 days. Why causes the fund to sit in that address and not move into the actual recipient wallet autmatically? Previous send to the same address went through fine, but the 2nd time sending to the same address, the fund just sits there, not automatically Spent. Please advise what recipient can do in this case. – Jake Johnson Mar 29 at 15:51 @JakeJohnson if I understand correctly, your tx has two outputs: one to the recipient, and the other is your change address. Your wallet controls the change address. So if you have not sent a subsequent tx that spent the coins in the change address, then of course they would remain unspent. There is no ‘automatically spent’. If you re read my answer you will see that the ‘spent/unspent’ tag that blockchain.info reports has nothing to do with whether or not your tx has confirmed. – chytrik Mar 29 at 19:26 Do you have any solution to turn \"Unspent\" status of the change address into \"Spent?\" It was sent from a blockchain wallet, and their support said after so many confirmations, it's irreversible, they can't do anything to help either. It's up to the recipient. But the recipient doesn't know what to do to claim the fund sitting on the network. Sending from Blockchain was always fast, but this time, it's stuck. Blockchain Wallet Support said it's not sender's issue and there's nothing they can do to help. The recipient doesn't know what to do. Please advise. Thanks a lot! – Jake Johnson Mar 30 at 6:59 Plz post the tx ID or address here so i can look. The unspent change address should be controlled by your blockchain.info wallet. To spend a utxo, the wallet that controls that address’ private keys needs to send a new tx using that utxo. – chytrik Mar 30 at 9:50 chytrik, thank you very much for offering help. Could you provide an email address, I'd be happy to send you the TXID to your email privately. – Jake Johnson Mar 30 at 22:49", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "– jake johnson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T10:19:55.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10b22b1b76cbeaa36417f99ee41272e226aa974a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa7zfoV0ZAxiEYpgFClYQmsMGr.R7jKPRcV0vl61P8tboimOSnGJy4gw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "How To Bitcoin 101", "title_full": "How To Bitcoin 101 : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-21T04:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10b22b1b76cbeaa36417f99ee41272e226aa974a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa7zfoV0ZAxiEYpgFClYQmsMGr.R7jKPRcV0vl61P8tboimOSnGJy4gw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "scooter_d", "published": "2018-05-21T04:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How To Bitcoin 101", "text": "submitted by /u/scooter_d\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://decentralstation.org/2018/05/18/how-to-bitcoin-101/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T23:57:32.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5822c622ca31d087a3755e401c022e7350984093", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTkodNUOVU8yaIe6E9cjSvpoKWb.igs8JBquC9PutPx1n7sjbFsQmcyV3xJFKv_x8dyhdlFsCPasXX6TWC4bHP57ZMzkw8SvxBMyISMInp49A--", "site_full": "wolfblitzzer0.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://wolfblitzzer0.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "wolfblitzzer0", "title": "Powerful Forces(Douglas Abrams ) Keep Bitcoin Heist Shrouded in Mystery, Alleges Bitcoin Entrepreneur", "title_full": "Powerful Forces(Douglas Abrams ) Keep Bitcoin Heist Shrouded in Mystery, Alleges Bitcoin Entrepreneur", "published": "2018-05-21T04:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5822c622ca31d087a3755e401c022e7350984093", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTkodNUOVU8yaIe6E9cjSvpoKWb.igs8JBquC9PutPx1n7sjbFsQmcyV3xJFKv_x8dyhdlFsCPasXX6TWC4bHP57ZMzkw8SvxBMyISMInp49A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tony Ryals (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T04:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Powerful Forces(Douglas Abrams ) Keep Bitcoin Heist Shrouded in Mystery, Alleges Bitcoin Entrepreneur", "text": "Powerful Forces(Douglas Abrams ) Keep Bitcoin Heist-MurderShrouded in Mystery, Alleges Bitcoin Entrepreneur\nSingapore death of young CEO tied to bitcoin raises questions - Home archive.jsonline.com/.../autumn-radtkes-death-in-singapore-ruled-...

Gox exchange heist is only intensifying with time. It all began in 2014 when Mt. Gox came under a severe cyber attack that saw unknown perpetrators stealing 850,000 bitcoin in addition to $28 million in cash. The stolen bitcoin alone was worth approximately half-a-billion US dollar back then. Shortly after the heist, the exchange shut down and was eventually declared bankrupt in Feb 2014. Mt. Gox eventually managed to recover as many as 200,000 of the stolen tokens in March. However, that has not stopped people familiar with the matter from raising questions about the suspicious circumstances that may have led to the death of at least one person. A recent revelation by bitcoin entrepreneur William Mook has further added to the mystery of the biggest ever cyber heist on record. According to Mook, “powerful forces” are at play to prevent the truth from coming into the limelight. Mook’s suspicion has a lot to do with the questionable circumstances under which virtual currency exchange First Meta’s chief executive Autumn Radtke was found dead. According to the police report, Radtke died after falling from her apartment building in Singapore. While some called it a suicide, others were more inclined to see it as a suspicious financial-sector death. “Autumn Radtke and her team and others quietly found half the bitcoins that were supposedly stolen by Mt. Gox,” Mook said in a conversation with RT .\nMook further underlined that Radtke’s death took place shortly after a Japanese court was briefed about her findings regarding the Mt. Gox hack: “Her team and others associated with the effort disappeared. Websites closed down. This is a frightening development. That person and that team, me included, were frightened off.” It is worth noting that the price of bitcoin pummeled after Mt. Gox’s shutdown, causing a significant setback for the cryptocurrency’s investors. However, Mook still maintains that the nature of bitcoin or blockchain technology has not undergone any changes because of the heist. “It merely delays its adoption,” he added. After the exchange’s bankruptcy, the Japanese government quickly stepped into action and laid out a new framework to deal with bitcoin. Local regulators were given the task to license cryptocurrency exchanges. Shortly after, Japan became the first country in the world to regulate virtual currency exchanges at the national level. On a related note, a group of creditors previously involved with Mt. Gox has filed an appeal with a Tokyo court to allow the exchange to spring back into action considering it recovered a significant proportion of the bitcoin previously stolen. According to them, the recent surge in bitcoin’s price has made the reclaimed tokens worth more than $3 billion, which means the company’s assets are now far bigger than its liabilities.

It is alleged that Bhatt, a Surat-based realtor, had illegally confined Dhaval Mavani and Piyush Savaliya , when he incurred losses in Bitcoins, and extorted crypto-currency. Bhatt has refuted these claims. Sources said that Savaliya has been questioned more than once in connection with the case by CID sleuths. If sources are to be believed, CID will register an FIR in its Surat office soon. The step will broaden scope of the current case, they said.\n“So far, the case was only about the extortion of 200 Bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore,” said an official. “But if a new case is registered, the scope will expand to 1,850 Bitcoins and cover more persons.

It will take away much the frustration of buying and selling cryptocurrency, and hopefully help make cryptocurrencies mainstream… It’s a different world there. Walking around in the streets of Germany you see signs with ‘Bitcoins accepted there’.”\nThe ATM, which was imported from Portugal, will be able to process various forms of cryptocurrency tokens including Ethereum and Bitcoin. It’s not the first in South Africa, as a previous machine was installed in 2014 at a men’s salon in Midrand, Johannesburg, but was closed down after a short period in operation. The store manager was excited about the prospect of making cryptocurrency available to his customers:\n“It is all awfully exciting. It will take away much the frustration of buying and selling cryptocurrency, and hopefully help make cryptocurrencies mainstream…Lots of people in South Africa are also in the cryptocurrency space and lots of South Africans are watching it. However, not all individuals have access to it.”\nNeophyou hopes that his ATM will make cryptocurrency accessible to those customers without a bank account, and hopes to roll out more ATMs, if successful.

It’s also tough to admit you’re wrong. One researcher may deserve some credit for owning up after his latest Bitcoin forecast failed to pan out.\nThomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicted on May 7 that Bitcoin would rally during Consensus, the cryptocurrency conference this week that drew thousands of enthusiasts (and some Lamborghinis) to a packed hotel in Midtown Manhattan.\nBitcoin didn’t rally. In fact, cryptocurrencies slumped about 10% during the past week, Lee admitted in a report to clients Friday.\n“Given conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralised place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction,” he wrote. “And coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided crypto-currency prices.”\nSo what went wrong? Lee said the crypto industry still needs more clarity from regulators like the US Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as increased adoption by traditional companies.\n“Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions,” Lee said. “But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions.”\nFundstrat still expects Bitcoin to be worth $25,000 by the end of this year.\n© 2018 Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "midtown manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T09:41:46.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e858afc2633d7a941292a0a0c208e69cbca7836", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW_3llc4Nyxe.4YoiatZ2Hyk-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-21T03:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e858afc2633d7a941292a0a0c208e69cbca7836", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW_3llc4Nyxe.4YoiatZ2Hyk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-21T03:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 21.

These continue to attract more investors especially by end of last year because of their value.\nHowever, with the recent market crash, it is evident that there is no coin that is unshakable. The creation of newer coin is as a result of failures experienced by older cryptocurrencies.\nThis leaves the investor at crossroads; not sure what each coin has to offer. Once the new cryptocurrencies introduce better features and capabilities, older coins like BTC and ETH might become less popular and that’s where Cardano (ADA) will emerge as the best option coin.\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum potential have been stretched almost to the limit, Cardano is just in its infancy. Cardano is fully decentralized open source outfit and is backed by three entities that have vast business interests on the platform.\nThese include the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo from Japan and a Hong Kong Based company, Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK). Built from ground up, Cardano is seeking to overcome the current issues of privacy regulation and scalability facing its two competitors. Bitcoin was the first to enter the market and out of its failures, Ethereum was born and due to its inefficiencies, the likes of Cardano came into being.
