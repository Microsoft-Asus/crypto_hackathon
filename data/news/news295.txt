May 12, 2018\nBitcoin Cash [BCH] is in an intense fight with Ripple [XRP] to determine who takes the 3rd spot on the crypto-rankings.\nBitcoin Cash has a market cap of $28.29 billion. It has a circulating supply of $17.12 million and a volume of $1.13 billion. It is currently priced at $1,652.43 as of 10th may 2018. Bitcoin Cash 7-day chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\nBitcoin Cash’s price needs to reach around $2000 to take the 3rd spot. This is highly possible as BCH increased from $600 to $1700 in one month. The coin has had a 5.57% growth rate over the past 24 hours.\nMany speculate the fork which will happen on the 15th of May might be the main factor in BCH beating XRP. The fork is an upgrade to BCH. The block size of Bitcoin cash is upgraded from 8 megabytes to 32 megabytes. The update will also allow developers to create smart contracts on the bitcoin cash network.\nThere is a lot of speculation that the fork will increase the number of BCH transactions due to increasing speed and reduction in the price of transactions. The volumes are rising and many people are investing in the coin, especially in Asia. Bitcoin Cash is widely popular in Asia, especially South Korea and Japan.\nThe coin was recently promoted and uplifted by Akari Global . The coin recently has been in the big stories like the Roger Ver Lawsuit which was canceled due to the lack of funds and the London Block exchange now accepting BCH.\nLexGrom, Reddit user comments on the Fork:\n“Darwinian evolution. I’m rooting for forking all open blockchains all the time.

The sites which publish them impersonate well known news outlets, such as CNN, to make them look legitimate, he warns.\n\"You may come across these sites via links advertised on various social media sites and paid for ads. They link through to scam sites like Bitcoin Trader, and also feature fake endorsements by the likes of Bill Gates alongside myself,\" Richard Branson complains.\nSir Branson Advises Vigilance The British magnate informs his readers that his legal teams are working hard to take down the fake stories and deal with companies misrepresenting him and his businesses. \"In the last year we've dealt with hundreds of instances. We are doing all we can and the police also work tirelessly to shut down the major operations,\" he says.\nBranson's Lawyers have also contacted the social networks where the fake stories are being spread: \"[We] urge them to take the stories down and do more to proactively stop them appearing in the first place.\"\nRichard Branson is not alone in this effort. Recently, British personal finance guru Martin Lewis vowed to take Facebook to court over fake ads featuring his photo, which have published on its platform. He accused the popular social media site of lack of vigilance in regards to fake accounts and adverts from scammers.\nIn his post, Branson advises everyone to remain vigilant: \"Check you are only clicking through to legitimate sites, with official website addresses and verified social media accounts.\" He also suggests that people verify if the story about him they are reading originates from an official Virgin website.\n\"All of my social networks are verified with blue ticks, so you can tell it is really me communicating with you,\" he adds, posting links to his profiles. The entrepreneur recommends reading sources like Citizens Advice for tips on how to avoid online scams. He also urges users to report fake stories to the platforms where they have found them.\nSince the beginning of the year, the social networks Facebook and LinkedIn , the search engines Google and \" Яндекс \" (Yandex), and the microblogging platform Twitter have banned advertising of cryptocurrencies and related projects on their platforms.\nRepresentatives of crypto communities around the world have protested the measures claiming they hurt legitimate businesses. Crypto and blockchain associations and businesses from Russia, China, South Korea, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, and Armenia plan to file this month a class action lawsuit against internet corporations over banned crypto ads.\nWhat measures should social media networks take to prevent spreading fake stories and scams related to Bitcoin without hurting legitimate businesses?

However, the fame obviously alarmed developers of the original wallet about Pro’s authenticity, leading them to investigate the product’s code. Their suspicions were later confirmed to be true, with Electrum’s team promptly releasing their findings to the public. We now have proof that \"Electrum Pro\" is bitcoin-stealing malware. The sha256sum of https://t.co/cCVFExIrNy is f497d2681dc00a7470fef7bcef8228964a2412889cd70b098cb8985aa1573e99. This hash can be confirmed independently using https://t.co/5RT3AeyjXp .\n— Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) May 8, 2018\nPosted on their website on May 9, 2018, with a link to their GitHub page , Electrum’s developer team released specifics of the malicious code and published a detailed DIY document that encouraged users to confirm the misdoings for themselves.\nAccording to the GitHub post, the malicious code is seen in the lines 223-248 in electrumpro_keystore.py, after which the Pro wallet appears to steal the user’s wallet seed keys and uploads them to the hacker’s servers.\nAdding to this, the developers reveal that their investigation has only been done on Pro’s “electrum pro-4.0.2.dmg” macOS binary and “ElectrumPro-4.0.2-Standalone.zip” Windows binary, but warned that “is safe to assume that the other Windows binaries are malicious as well.” Advertisement advertisement\nAs it stands, in order to trap unsuspecting users, the treacherous team behind Electrum Pro hosted the duping wallet on electrum.com, which easily misled users from the official electrum.org website.\nAn integral and sensitive part of a bitcoin wallet, seed keys are cryptographic trees that store human-readable words into an algorithmically-converted root private key. By gaining access to the seed keys, anyone can be capable of draining a user’s bitcoin wallet. Electrum No Stranger to Such Frauds\nIn the past, scammers have conducted similar attacks to dupe Electrum users, by registering similar-looking domains and providing a similar interface. However, this is by far the most significant instance of a phishing effort, with the malicious product closely replicating the original one.\nUnless a user was conversant enough with the original website, Pro’s interface comes close to Electrum’s, with the site claiming to be a “ fork ” of the latter.\nInterestingly, the fraudulent Electrum Pro was reportedly “higher-rated” on Google’s PlayStore, appearing above the original Electrum in a “bitcoin wallet” app search. Upon conducting a Google web search, BTCManager found out similar results. However, Electrum Pro has seemingly exited after its fraud coming to light and doesn’t appear in search results as on the time of writing. ( Source : Google )\nElectrum’s developers claim that only users of the Windows and OS X versions of Electrum Pro are affected, while the Linux version appears to be clean. To ensure such problems do not appear in the future, Electrum is working towards gaining a “verified” status on the Windows Store, with an official app on Mac Store soon to follow.\nAs a suggestion, BTCManager appeals to its readers to check their versions of Electrum, and immediately shift their bitcoins in case of a fallacy.

‘$36000 by 2019 year end’ May 12, 2018\nThomas Lee of Fundstrat Global released the highlights of a Bitcoin mining whitepaper published by FundstratQuant. He highlights his reasons believing Bitcoin would hit $36000 by the end of the year 2019.\nThe paper details that Bitcoin mining economics lead and explain the price for Bitcoin. The primary argument of the paper is that the multiple of the price and cost required for miners to break even, referred to as the metric P/BE, has “proven a reliable long-term support level” and that the projected trajectory of the growth of mining infrastructure should underpin the appreciation of the price of Bitcoin.\nThe paper mentions that the mining economy is expected to grow over the next several years, and project a BTC price roughly equivalent to $36000 based on the historical average of 1.8x for the P/BE multiple.\nEven as the rate of electricity cost escalation reduces, the network becomes more efficient with newer rigs coming to the market, which offer a higher hash power per watt of electricity consumes. The risk to the thesis lies within this, as a ‘material shift’ in the trajectory of hash power could change the P/BE support price.\nAs mining is becoming increasingly concentrated in large-scale operations, smaller miners are needed to join these so-called mining “pools” to stay competitive.\nMad Miner, a crypto miner tweeted:\n“will be interesting to see if we get there as the increase in difficulty is averaging 7% every 2 wks… Over the next 20 wks that means profit per rig will drop by 70%. We may be approaching a tiping point for smaller miners.”\nSciclo, another Twitter user commented:\n“That’s way of of my prediction witch was $ 231,000 in 2 to 3 years, 6 months ago. But that was an holistic calcultion and not a miner economics approach. #Bitcoin we ‘r talking! @rogerkver On the hypothesis of #investors taking a bigger share in #crypto for portfolio insurance.”\nA market enthusiast commented:\n“I think the assumptions do not include dramatic improvements like lightning network, as such the conclusions are light, likely by substantial amounts.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T10:14:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70db69fda5d72f93dbee3a57211a889ed0035e02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXbA32GeZpko6hYObq.Eakc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Why people dump their Bitcoins ?", "title_full": "Why people dump their Bitcoins ?", "published": "2018-05-12T06:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70db69fda5d72f93dbee3a57211a889ed0035e02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXbA32GeZpko6hYObq.Eakc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "randyboy", "published": "2018-05-12T06:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why people dump their Bitcoins ?", "text": "its just because their are not satisfied to what they have they want a high profit immediately by investing lest money so that's why they dump it and walk away and think its not happening but it is they dump and the price will fallow too so many will grab the chance to invest.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T09:20:29.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c799a35e64548cb6852f4ed18654fb3f072b606", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHL4fAS0qprreySPg0RipZ1MIHwM4JpHpvHUjAyQvvARswJeBtTb1l4KOQcnOedYhA2agubLWubS4dsCF5ifWpYGeMOXOD06uOJMlcPVMnKq3Z4UqrXUcK.FHHDMrkdo.kI-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – Irish University Study Calls For Government Action To Promote Blockchain In The Country", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Irish University Study Calls For Government Action To Promote Blockchain In The Country", "published": "2018-05-12T06:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://abitco.in/wp-content/themes/newspapertimes-codebase/icon/delicious.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c799a35e64548cb6852f4ed18654fb3f072b606", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHL4fAS0qprreySPg0RipZ1MIHwM4JpHpvHUjAyQvvARswJeBtTb1l4KOQcnOedYhA2agubLWubS4dsCF5ifWpYGeMOXOD06uOJMlcPVMnKq3Z4UqrXUcK.FHHDMrkdo.kI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-12T06:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Irish University Study Calls For Government Action To Promote Blockchain In The Country", "text": "Bitcoin – Irish University Study Calls For Government Action To Promote Blockchain In The Country 11 May 2018\nShare This Tags\nFollowing a study on blockchain adoption in Irish enterprises, researchers call on the government for a broader adoption initiative\nRead more –> click here all content is copyright CoinTelegraph.\nNeed Bitcoin marketing and PR?

The social network is also \"exploring other ways\" that it could use such a currency.\nMark Zuckerberg announced in January that Facebook planned to \"go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of\" new technologies such as cryptocurrency.\nFour months later, it seems his vision is coming to fruition. Earlier this week, Facebook announced that its head of Messenger, David Marcus, would spearhead a group researching potential uses of blockchain across Facebook's platforms. Marcus is a former Paypal president and CEO, and a member of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's board of directors, so it's pretty clear what they're going for here.\nWe're a bit puzzled as to why exactly Facebook would want to create a new currency, but it would certainly make it easier for customers in different countries to buy and sell through the platform without extra conversion fees. It could also be a transaction resource for Facebook buyers in countries with more volatile currencies.\nAt least, that may be what Facebook tells us in order to pass this all off as a project for the greater good . Of course, it's also likely to come with a transaction fee, so we're guessing it won't hurt Facebook's bottom line.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cheddar/status/994950539430445056"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marcus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark zuckerberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david marcus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T01:51:24.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5abe64bd9dbc9b882d767702fc07d79e892f4f44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhGcZWn0.Y090ZszNg7VUA70-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-12T06:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5abe64bd9dbc9b882d767702fc07d79e892f4f44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhGcZWn0.Y090ZszNg7VUA70-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T06:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 12, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Moons to $36000 by End of 2019 According to Fundstrat Bitcoin News (press release) Fundstrat Global, a favorite research firm in the cryptosphere with Wall Street-street cred, is once again providing eye-popping bitcoin (BTC) ...

Warren Buffet and His Crony Capitalists,’ Says Max Keiser May 12, 2018 245\nMax Keiser delivered a scathing rebuttal to Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger May 10 after the Berkshire Hathaway moguls compared Bitcoin to “rat poison” and “baby brains.” ‘Crony Capitalism’\nIn a fresh episode of RT’s Keiser Report, the outspoken Bitcoin bull accused Buffett and Munger of “crony capitalism.”\n“Bitcoin is a reaction to Warren Buffett and his crony capitalists,” he said.\n[…] They don’t want to come down from their pedestal of crony capitalism and free money from central banks to address that, so they attack crypto.\nBerkshire’s elite gained considerable press coverage earlier this week after they delivered further soundbites against cryptocurrency and trading it.\nBuffett, who has been open about his distaste for Bitcoin, described it as “probably rat poison squared” at an annual shareholder meeting last weekend, a comment that was widely criticized by the Bitcoin users. #bitcoin is rat poison because central bankers are the rats\n— Honey\nMunger, who previously said Bitcoin was “utterly assinine,” backed up his stance by asserting trading it was like “trading fresh harvested baby brains.”\n“It’s antisocial, stupid and immoral,” he told Yahoo! Finance in an interview . Bitcoin Will Go To $30k… Soon?\nKeiser met Munger’s words on par, telling viewers the 94-year-old “would have the pleasure of watching Bitcoin soar past $30,000 per coin as he expires from this planet.”\nWhile not guessing at when exactly Bitcoin’s implied jump to $30,000 would take place, Keiser has not been shy about his predictions for the cryptocurrency’s future.\nIn an interview with Bitcoinist last month, while also keeping quiet on timeframes, the figure of $100,000 came easily.\n“My only Bitcoin prediction is that the price will top $100,000. As far as timing, extrapolate from current trends and you get a sense of when,” he said.\nSimilar optimism has since surfaced from other regular Bitcoin bulls including Tom Lee, whose company Fundstrat Global Advisors this week produced research concluding mining trends will send BTC/USD to $36,000 by the end of 2019.\nWhat do you think about Max Keiser’s reposte to Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger?

That foreign money can be utilized to make purchases at certain on-line outlets, or you should use it as an funding.\n“You’ll be able to just save little by little and have the ability to throw 20 bucks in at a time and watch it grow,” stated Garrett.\nTech company Coinme has almost 50 of these throughout the U.S., two of those are in Fresno. Garrett stated they added the second machine final month because of elevated interest. The first ATM was put in the Tower District last September, within the CellPros on Olive Avenue.\n“And during the last couple of months it has develop into considered one of our prime performing machines,” stated Garrett.\nProper now you possibly can solely purchase Bitcoin on the ATM, but Garrett stated within the weeks to return, individuals will be capable of change their cryptocurrency for cash.\n(Copyright ©2018 KFSN-TV.

C2 is an international community that intends to bolster open standard development in order to provide long-term Bitcoin Cash growth.\nAlso read: Upgrade Time: Bitcoin Cash 32MB Fork Activates Tuesday The Cash Consortium: Open Standards for Bitcoin Cash\nMuch of the cryptocurrency community understands what open source or open standard development is, and most of them embrace the idea. Furthermore, organizations like the W3C and other believers of open standards welcome the sharing of open sourced code that allows anyone the rights to study, change, and distribute OSS protocol for any purpose. Open standards also allows other developers to review a protocol’s design in order to prevent flaws and bugs within the software by coming up with sets of development standards that everyone agrees to and uses. The Cash Consortium will have engineers from leading companies to work together to build Bitcoin Cash (BCH) development standards much like how developers build on the open web with shared concepts like HTML.\n“The C2’s mission is to lead Bitcoin Cash to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the blockchain,” explains the C2 website.\nBitcoin Cash is the soundest money the world has ever known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability and transferability. It’s our intention that it remain the soundest money the world has ever known — Bitcoin Cash enables smart contracts/property, colored coins, tokens, ICOs and much more. We intend to standardize these emerging technologies in a way that plays to Bitcoin Cash’s strengths. A Formal Bitcoin Standards Body\nAt the moment organizations that are listed as members of C2 include Cointext , Atlantis Labs, Akari Global Foundation, the Bitcoin Cash Fund , Bitbox, Blockpress , Centbee, and the social network Yours . Last night news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the creator of the Cash Consortium, Carlos Cardona , who is also the lead developer of Bitbox , the open source development toolkit for Bitcoin Cash. Cardona tells us he is a firm believer in open standards and explains why he initiated the C2 organization.\n“When I was in college I was a member of the W3C’s HTML5 Working Group. There were engineers from Apple, Google (who I was with), Microsoft, Firefox and many more meeting up regularly in working groups to flesh out the next generation of technical specs for the web (HTML/CSS etc),” Cardona tells news.Bitcoin.com . “When the spec was nearing completion the teams would each implement it. Some open source like Firefox. Some closed source like Internet Explorer. But both implementing technical specs which were created together.”\nWhen I joined the blockchain space several years ago it surprised me that there was no formal Bitcoin standards body. The Cash Consortium will affirm and adhere to the Principles in support of The Modern Paradigm for Standards —cooperation, due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness. Huge Forces at Play Are About to Phase the Blockchain Industry\nThen Cardona says he started thinking about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash upgrade that will not only increase the block size by 4X but the fork will also add Satoshi OP_Codes that can enable the ability to create color coins and smart contract features on the BCH network.\n“With the new OP_Codes coming I had recently been thinking again about how to best standardize on new transaction types and then Memo/Blockpress happened,” Cardona emphasizes. “Having recently updated Bitbox’s block explorer to support both Memo and Blockpress I was struck with the same feeling I had during IE6/FF days — writing code twice with slightly different APIs because there was no standard. With OP_RETURN going from 80 bytes to 220 bytes we’re just seeing the start of OP_RETURN prefixed protocols — That got me thinking again about a standards body.”\nIn my opinion our industry spent many years fighting the Blockstream wars and became complacent — Things which I would expect in any other nearly decade old tech industry (such as a tech consortium) doesn’t exist in our space.

C2 is an international community that intends to bolster open standard development in order to provide long-term Bitcoin Cash growth.\nAlso read: Upgrade Time: Bitcoin Cash 32MB Fork Activates Tuesday\nThe Cash Consortium: Open Standards for Bitcoin Cash Much of the cryptocurrency community understands what open source or open standard development is, and most of them embrace the idea. Furthermore, organizations like the W3C and other believers of open standards welcome the sharing of open sourced code that allows anyone the rights to study, change, and distribute OSS protocol for any purpose. Open standards also allows other developers to review a protocol's design in order to prevent flaws and bugs within the software by coming up with sets of development standards that everyone agrees to and uses. The Cash Consortium will have engineers from leading companies to work together to build Bitcoin Cash (BCH) development standards much like how developers build on the open web with shared concepts like HTML.\n\"The C2's mission is to lead Bitcoin Cash to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the blockchain,\" explains the C2 website.\nBitcoin Cash is the soundest money the world has ever known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability and transferability. It's our intention that it remain the soundest money the world has ever known — Bitcoin Cash enables smart contracts/property, colored coins, tokens, ICOs and much more. We intend to standardize these emerging technologies in a way that plays to Bitcoin Cash's strengths.\nA Formal Bitcoin Standards Body At the moment organizations that are listed as members of C2 include Cointext , Atlantis Labs, Akari Global Foundation, the Bitcoin Cash Fund , Bitbox, Blockpress , Centbee, and the social network Yours . Last night news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the creator of the Cash Consortium, Carlos Cardona , who is also the lead developer of Bitbox , the open source development toolkit for Bitcoin Cash. Cardona tells us he is a firm believer in open standards and explains why he initiated the C2 organization.\n\"When I was in college I was a member of the W3C's HTML5 Working Group. There were engineers from Apple, Google (who I was with), Microsoft, Firefox and many more meeting up regularly in working groups to flesh out the next generation of technical specs for the web (HTML/CSS etc),\" Cardona tells news.Bitcoin.com . \"When the spec was nearing completion the teams would each implement it. Some open source like Firefox. Some closed source like Internet Explorer. But both implementing technical specs which were created together.\"\nWhen I joined the blockchain space several years ago it surprised me that there was no formal Bitcoin standards body.\nThe Cash Consortium will affirm and adhere to the Principles in support of The Modern Paradigm for Standards —cooperation, due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness. Huge Forces at Play Are About to Phase the Blockchain Industry Then Cardona says he started thinking about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash upgrade that will not only increase the block size by 4X but the fork will also add Satoshi OP_Codes that can enable the ability to create color coins and smart contract features on the BCH network.\n\"With the new OP_Codes coming I had recently been thinking again about how to best standardize on new transaction types and then Memo/Blockpress happened,\" Cardona emphasizes. \"Having recently updated Bitbox's block explorer to support both Memo and Blockpress I was struck with the same feeling I had during IE6/FF days — writing code twice with slightly different APIs because there was no standard. With OP_RETURN going from 80 bytes to 220 bytes we're just seeing the start of OP_RETURN prefixed protocols — That got me thinking again about a standards body.\"\nIn my opinion our industry spent many years fighting the Blockstream wars and became complacent — Things which I would expect in any other nearly decade old tech industry (such as a tech consortium) doesn't exist in our space. The final part which caused me to move on it was when I found out Zuckerberg created a blockchain division last week. To me that is just a sign that HUGE forces are at play which are about to phase shift our entire industry.\nCardona Believes the Opportunity to Move Quick and be Proactive is Now The C2 website explains that if you work with a company that develops with Bitcoin Cash then they can feel free to fork this repo or reach out to Cardona to see how you can get involved.\n\"I believe we have the opportunity to move quick, be proactive, build bridges and standardize or some much larger player will step in an do it for us,\" Cardona adds.\nWhat do you think about the Cash Consortium (C2)?

C2 is an international community that intends to bolster open standard development in order to provide long-term Bitcoin Cash growth.\nAlso read: Upgrade Time: Bitcoin Cash 32MB Fork Activates Tuesday The Cash Consortium: Open Standards for Bitcoin Cash\nMuch of the cryptocurrency community understands what open source or open standard development is, and most of them embrace the idea. Furthermore, organizations like the W3C and other believers of open standards welcome the sharing of open sourced code that allows anyone the rights to study, change, and distribute OSS protocol for any purpose. Open standards also allows other developers to review a protocol’s design in order to prevent flaws and bugs within the software by coming up with sets of development standards that everyone agrees to and uses. The Cash Consortium will have engineers from leading companies to work together to build Bitcoin Cash (BCH) development standards much like how developers build on the open web with shared concepts like HTML.\n“The C2’s mission is to lead Bitcoin Cash to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the blockchain,” explains the C2 website.\nBitcoin Cash is the soundest money the world has ever known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability and transferability. It’s our intention that it remain the soundest money the world has ever known — Bitcoin Cash enables smart contracts/property, colored coins, tokens, ICOs and much more. We intend to standardize these emerging technologies in a way that plays to Bitcoin Cash’s strengths. A Formal Bitcoin Standards Body\nAt the moment organizations that are listed as members of C2 include Cointext , Atlantis Labs, Akari Global Foundation, the Bitcoin Cash Fund , Bitbox, Blockpress , Centbee, and the social network Yours . Last night news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the creator of the Cash Consortium, Carlos Cardona , who is also the lead developer of Bitbox , the open source development toolkit for Bitcoin Cash. Cardona tells us he is a firm believer in open standards and explains why he initiated the C2 organization.\n“When I was in college I was a member of the W3C’s HTML5 Working Group. There were engineers from Apple, Google (who I was with), Microsoft, Firefox and many more meeting up regularly in working groups to flesh out the next generation of technical specs for the web (HTML/CSS etc),” Cardona tells news.Bitcoin.com . “When the spec was nearing completion the teams would each implement it. Some open source like Firefox. Some closed source like Internet Explorer. But both implementing technical specs which were created together.”\nWhen I joined the blockchain space several years ago it surprised me that there was no formal Bitcoin standards body. The Cash Consortium will affirm and adhere to the Principles in support of The Modern Paradigm for Standards —cooperation, due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness. Huge Forces at Play Are About to Phase the Blockchain Industry\nThen Cardona says he started thinking about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash upgrade that will not only increase the block size by 4X but the fork will also add Satoshi OP_Codes that can enable the ability to create color coins and smart contract features on the BCH network.\n“With the new OP_Codes coming I had recently been thinking again about how to best standardize on new transaction types and then Memo/Blockpress happened,” Cardona emphasizes. “Having recently updated Bitbox’s block explorer to support both Memo and Blockpress I was struck with the same feeling I had during IE6/FF days — writing code twice with slightly different APIs because there was no standard. With OP_RETURN going from 80 bytes to 220 bytes we’re just seeing the start of OP_RETURN prefixed protocols — That got me thinking again about a standards body.”\nIn my opinion our industry spent many years fighting the Blockstream wars and became complacent — Things which I would expect in any other nearly decade old tech industry (such as a tech consortium) doesn’t exist in our space. The final part which caused me to move on it was when I found out Zuckerberg created a blockchain division last week. To me that is just a sign that HUGE forces are at play which are about to phase shift our entire industry. Cardona Believes the Opportunity to Move Quick and be Proactive is Now\nThe C2 website explains that if you work with a company that develops with Bitcoin Cash then they can feel free to fork this repo or reach out to Cardona to see how you can get involved.\n“I believe we have the opportunity to move quick, be proactive, build bridges and standardize or some much larger player will step in an do it for us,” Cardona adds.\nWhat do you think about the Cash Consortium (C2)? Do you think its a good idea for BCH developers to initiate open standards for protocol and application development?

(KFSN) SHARE Friday, May 11, 2018 FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- What some might call the future of currency is sitting in the corner of this CellPros shop in Northwest Fresno on Ashlan Avenue, a Bitcoin ATM.\"All you need is just an ID, four quick taps on the screen, less than 60 seconds and you can own cryptocurrency,\" said Coinme director of marketing Dom Garrett.It all starts with your ID, which goes in the ATM, and a profile is created, which acts as a virtual wallet.\"You don't have to put in your password, you don't have to put in any usernames, it's all right here in your ID,\" said Garrett.You put in your money and congratulations; you now own some Bitcoin. That currency can be used to make purchases at certain online shops, or you can use it as an investment.\"You can just save bit by bit and be able to throw 20 bucks in at a time and watch it grow,\" said Garrett.Tech company Coinme has nearly 50 of these across the U.S., two of those are in Fresno. Garrett said they added the second machine last month because of increased interest. The first ATM was put in the Tower District last September, in the CellPros on Olive Avenue.\"And over the last couple of months it has become one of our top performing machines,\" said Garrett.Right now you can only buy Bitcoin on the ATM, but Garrett said in the weeks to come, people will be able to exchange their cryptocurrency for cash.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH), for instance, is in the red zone. But the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) team has too much going on next week to worry about this, specifically; the Bitcoin Cash network upgrade. Bitcoin Cash Network Upgrade\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network is set to upgrade the base block size in less than a week. On Tuesday, May 15, the BCH network will upgrade the base block size to 32MB. For perspective, the original size was 8MB. This means the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network will be increasing the size by 4X. Considering this is the largest block size expansion the crypto world has seen, there are a few things to note before we move into the weekend. This way you can prepare on Saturday and Sunday for what is to come on Tuesday. “In less than a week on May 15, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network will be upgrading the base block size from 8MB to 32MB, as well as re-enabling and adding some OP_Codes to the codebase.” https://t.co/JYdeGpMYuT\n— Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) May 11, 2018 Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\nDespite the importance of the upgrade, and the need to prepare for the week to come, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is in the red today. As is the rest of the market, though. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently selling for $1,417.78. This puts BCH down 13.45% in the past twenty-four hours. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has a market capitalization of $24.28 billion, making it the fourth largest virtual currency. Source: CoinMarketCap Things to Know About the Bitcoin Cash Network Upgrade\nWith only a few days left before the upgrade, we don’t want anything to surprise you when it finally does roll around. Here are four things the crypto community should note about the forthcoming BCH network upgrade.\n1. The BCH network upgrade will be based on the median time past method. This means there will not be a specific block height. The BCH fork will have similar characteristics to the fork activations that happened in August.\n2. Before the BCH fork can begin, both full node clients and miners are required to upgrade their software.\n3. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) team has included “Satoshi OP_Codes.”\n4. The BCH fork will expand the default data-carrier-size of the protocol to 220 bytes.\n>>EOS Token Swap: Register Your EOS Coins Before They’re Frozen Forever What is the Crypto Community Saying?\nSo, is the crypto community looking forward to the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network upgrade? On Twitter, the community is fairly quiet, but a few people have decided to use their platform to share the news. Here’s one tweet that appears to be in BCH’s favor:\n— Jean Woodruff (@daitoukesb) May 11, 2018 The Takeaway\nWhat do you think of the BCH network upgrade?

According to Bitfury, the tool can help the authorities speed up their investigations into illicit activities involving the cryptocurrency.\nThe firm’s website says that it took just three hours to find the entity behind the $5 billion WannaCry ransomware attacks last May. “If law enforcement agencies had had the proper tool to find criminals on the Bitcoin Blockchain,” the company said in a presentation, “they could have quickly cornered the criminals and prevented further global damage.” Bitfury also markets Crystal to companies, which face potential legal repercussions for accepting bitcoin derived from black market activities.\nUsing Crystal, Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov told CoinDesk in January, “you can track bitcoin transactions and see if this bitcoin address that you’re getting money from is green or black.” Bitfury Enters Bitcoin Crime-Fighting Business with Crystal Launch Bitfury isn’t waiting for law enforcement to clean up the bitcoin space.

A look at the digital currency\nReduced liquidity on cryptocurrency exchanges and regulatory uncertainty are, for now, limiting monthly bitcoin-based remittances to millions of dollars in a multibillion-dollar market, the start-ups say. But if cryptocurrencies mature, they say, traditional businesses will be in for some serious disruption.\n“Bitcoin is so much better as a mechanism to send money around the world,” said George Harrap, chief executive of Bitspark, a company that performs transfers for dozens of remittance shops in Hong Kong, Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana.\n“There’s a lot less overhead that you need to do.”\nMany of the start-ups, such as Bitspark, do not deal directly with individual customers, but instead provide the “back end” transfer mechanism for remittance shops.\nThe businesses estimate how much money they will need for a day, buy bitcoin in advance and immediately sell it for the currency in the receiving country. That means they do not hold cryptocurrency for any meaningful length of time, and customers’ transactions are resolved in minutes, rather than days.\nKate Corporal, 28, a Filipina working at an international company in Incheon, South Korea, said she saved “huge” amounts sending money home using Rebit compared with traditional services.\n“One thing I can guarantee is that the money I intended to send and the money that my family received was exactly the same,” Corporal said. “Using bitcoin is really helpful for many Filipinos ... as every single cent that we send can be very significant.”\nReduced demand for cryptocurrencies in smaller economies often means bitcoin prices are lower, so sending $100 to Indonesia or the Philippines via bitcoin results in the equivalent of more than $100 at the other end.\nPublished in Dawn, May 12th, 2018\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george harrap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitspark", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "satoshi citadel industries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloom", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "payphil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T05:56:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12378135051328e2d5967fb44d5344963ffb7db1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YkmPo5CtevkY69pVPbk5zxRbo6EnnBBu3MgYojzV.8SzBQAiQB1ZDQnbtRLeKJmvd9ccRPzvTc_jl26W_7oMR7pQ-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

According to the report, Grant West was arrested last year on a train by British police, who were working with Scotland Yard.\nThe British police force was able to seize cryptocurrencies worth $700,000 from the 25-year-old hacker. On the subject of hackers, police investigator Mick Gallagher says:\nThese people generally feel they can operate with impunity, that they can't be touched. We have now debunked that.\nInvestigators say that West, who went by the online name \"Courvoisier,\" was behind cyber attacks on more than 100 different companies, including gambling shops, mobile phone companies, and supermarkets. The report also notes that \"Courvoisier\" used Bitcoin to launder his proceeds from the sale of passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information on the Dark Web.\nAn interesting twist to this cryptocurrency seizure is that the police were able to snag the bitcoins due to the fact that West was still logged into his computer, and investigators found his access keys that were saved on his computer.\nCybercriminals and Cryptocurrencies Many cybercriminals have used cryptocurrencies to launder their proceeds from illegal activities. Some cryptocurrencies are also massively used in Dark Web markets to purchase illegal goods or services like drugs, credit card information, DDoS attacks, etc. Alex Lakatos, a lawyer from Washington D.C., states:\nWhen it comes to transactions on the Dark Web, (people) nearly universally use cryptocurrency.\nHe also added:\nThe use of virtual currency for illicit purposes has been a huge success.\nSome cybercriminals may believe that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may offer anonymity, but it has been pointed out that investigators often times can track certain cryptocurrencies but cannot tell who owns them.\nAnother point of fact is that the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions are for perfectly legal reasons. However, the media and centralized authorities love to play up the meme of crypto and illicit activity.\nWhat are your thoughts on the cryptocurrency seizure by the London police? Will police be able to enhance their ability to go after hackers or will hackers stay a few steps ahead?
