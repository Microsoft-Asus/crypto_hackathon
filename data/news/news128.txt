Recently, British economic historian and author Niall Ferguson told the Bank of England that Bitcoin is the financial system of the future.\nAlso Read: This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee’s Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car The Future of Finance\nNiall Ferguson is a noted historian, commentator, and the author of fifteen books including The Ascent of Money and The House of Rothschild. On Tuesday he has given a seminar to the Bank of England, talking about the 2008 financial crisis and the reactions to it to this day. In his conclusion of the subject, he mentioned that bitcoin is part of the major challenges ahead for the current fiat-based system.\nFerguson said: “The financial system of today is not fundamentally that different than the financial system of the pre-crisis period, except that big banks are better capitalized. I don’t think much else is really different. The novelties, the things that will really matter ten years hence are still relatively small in scale. Whether its bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally or the massive revolution in online payments that is being achieved by the big Chinese tech companies, that’s the financial system of the future, and it is still small enough not to be systemically important in 2018. In short, I am left feeling we are only a matter of time before the next crisis.” Bombarded by ICOs\nThe above isn’t such a surprising statement coming from Ferguson. Back in December 2017 he wrote : “At some point, no doubt, regulatory changes in the US will deflate the current bitcoin bubble. But they will not halt, much less undo, this financial revolution. Think about it this way. The maximum number of bitcoins that can be created is 21m. The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, is 36m. Their total wealth is $128.7 trillion. If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as bitcoin, the price would be not $15,000 but north of $60,000. If they raised that to 5%, the right price for bitcoin would be above $300,000. I am not saying this is certain to happen. I’m just saying my teenage son thinks it could.”\nSince then he has also been exposed to more sides of the cryptocurrency market, such as the endless flood of ICO offers. “I wish I had a bitcoin for every phony white paper I’ve been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down,” Ferguson reportedly said last week. “When there’s no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.”\nFerguson isn’t the only noted academic figure that looked at how bitcoin fits economic history recently. Last Monday, Professor Robert Shiller, who received the 2013 Nobel prize in economics and is famous for the Case-Shiller Index, published an article talking about the way the allure of bitcoin fits enthusiasm around previous attempts to reinvent money.\nWhat role in the economy do you see Bitcoin fulfills in ten years from now?

These stories and many more were covered in this week’s daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief. And the most commented on story of the week talked about a guy living is his car while working two jobs just to invest in crypto.\nAlso Read: US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture\nYou could not have missed the impact of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force this week, not with all the emails you must have received from any service that has ever had access to your address. However, one might have not known that the new regulations also had severe consequences for some services that had to shut down.\nOn Monday we reported that team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced that due to GDPR they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check. Crypto Revolution Reshaping Global Politics\nThe intersection of politics and cryptocurrency was our main focus on Tuesday . We reported that Iranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. And in the US, Congressional candidate Brian Forde raised $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations, and an opponent attacked him for this, referring to his donors as “bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nWe also reported that Vitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled “Liberation Through Radical Decentralization.” In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work. McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip\nJohn McAfee’s prediction of a bull run on the cryptocurrency markets in the near future was one of the most discussed issues on Wednesday . Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, the internet security expert expects. McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said. He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,” the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads. Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street\nOn Thursday we reported that Deutsche Börse AG, the group which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is actively examining its options for launching cryptocurrency derivatives. This was revealed by Jeffrey Tessler, CEO of the post-trade services provider owned by Deutsche Börse Clearstream and member of the group’s executive board. And changes to the Volcker Rule give Americans a new reason for moving their money away from big banks to cryptocurrencies, according to the latest analysis by Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings. Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Offered for BCH\nThe growing number of bitcoin cash adoptions has been in the headlines on Friday . White Company, founded by former executive at Formula 1 and LVMH, Elizabeth White, which offers high-end products and luxury brands, including fine watches and sports cars, has become the latest business to accept BCH payments. And the online travel agency Cheapair.com has also announced it started accepting bitcoin cash for booking flights and hotels. Man Goes All In on Crypto\nThe most commented on story of the week talked about a guy living is his car while working two jobs just to invest it all in crypto. The Canadian man explains that he parks his car in his friend’s garage to sleep, for which he pays $40 CAD per month. Despite the cramped conditions, he hasn’t forgone all home comforts, finding space to squeeze in a memory foam mattress and comfy quilts. He’s also able to shower at a friend’s house and store some items there. As for his crypto portfolio, the unnamed Canadian is currently pinning his hopes on Collosusxt, Fundrequest, Policypal, and Dero.

Coinbase is getting into the decentralized exchange business with its acquisition of Paradex, potentially opening up thousands of ERC-20 tokens to traders, depending on what the SEC ends up doing with regulations. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, continues work to implement a system to allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. And Germany’s Deutsche Boerse is looking at getting into the cryptocurrency game. Finally, the city of Memphis had its first blockchain conference, which included keynotes from FedEx and a hackathon for various market segments that included some great prizes.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, David Hollerith and Nick Marinoff\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Coinbase Takes Another Step Toward Trading ICO Tokens by Acquiring\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase just made an enormous play by acquiring decentralized relayer Paradex this week. Paradex bills itself as a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning no third party is involved in holding the funds. Instead, users can use the platform to trade ERC20 tokens directly wallet to wallet. Paradex is built on top of the 0x (pronounced “zero x”) protocol .\nRight now, Coinbase trades four coins: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC). Adding ERC20 tokens could significantly boost the number of digital assets it carries. Due to the ICO boom that has taken place over the last few years, thousands of different ICO tokens are now available. German Stock Exchange Eyes Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange parent company, Deutsche Boerse AG , appears to have begun work on technology that will allow them to offer their clients bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related products.\nSpeaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: “We are deep at work with it.” The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation\nAs reported earlier by The New York Times (NYT) and Bitcoin Magazine , Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is developing an online trading platform that would allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future. What Happened At Graceland’s Ethereum Conference\nIn its first year, EthMemphis distinguished its place on the blockchain conference circuit for displaying an under-the-hood glimpse at what actually moves this young industry forward, specifically on the Ethereum network. The focus was on blockchain topics and projects applied to supply chain, healthcare, tourism/hospitality, education and law. Verge Cryptocurrency Suffers Its Second Hack in Less Than Two Months\nWhile Verge executives are claiming a DDoS attack is responsible for the recent serious delays on their blockchain, it appears that the problem may be more serious than the company is implying. The attack lasted more than a few hours and has resulted in over 35 million XVGs (worth approximately $ 1.7 million) being stolen. The theft occurred when hackers exploited a specific glitch in Verge’s technology by mining multiple blocks virtually one second apart using the same algorithm. This was the same tactic used in a hack just last month that saw over 250,000 XVGs disappear into thin air, forcing Verge to prepare a subsequent hard fork .\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

By JP Buntinx on May 27, 2018\nTransaction fees are a hot topic of debate in the cryptocurrency world. There are numerous discussions regarding Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash fees in this regard. It now seems the average Bitcoin transaction cost is lower than that of BCH. As is usually the case, such a temporary snapshot can look very different in a few hours. The Bitcoin Fees in Perspective\nWhen directly comparing BTC with BCH fees , it seems there is no real contest. The cost of a Bitcoin Cash transaction has been far lower compared to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In fact, the BHC costs have been relatively flat for quite some time now. Bitcoin’s fees, on the other hand, are erratic as they have always been. Bitcoin fees have been lower than BCash fees in the last 6 hours. pic.twitter.com/XAll68BbC9\n— Ben Verret (@verretor) May 27, 2018\nHowever, temporary snapshots often tell a different story. The Tweet by Ven Verret shows the BTC fees are lower than BCH in a six-hour period. An interesting development, albeit one that only tells a small part of the story. The screenshot itself shows these fees for Bitcoin have spiked just an hour or two prior. Why that sudden increase took place, remains a bit unclear at this time.\nThis doesn’t mean Bitcoin has suddenly become cheaper to use. When timing transactions correctly, that may be the case temporarily. Additionally, users with patience can still send transactions at 1 Satoshi per byte. It may take several hours to confirm, but it is another interesting option worth exploring. When looking at the bigger picture, however, BCH remains the cheaper option by quite a margin. The Debate Continues\nAs is usually the case when trends like these are pointed out, the public backlash is palpable. Bitcoin Cash supporters do not take kindly to this development. However, they also point out how their average TX fee is 0.24 cents or lower. That is quite cheap, although others will argue this point. The overall use of the BCH network compared to Bitcoin is very different.\nThe bigger question is how this situation will evolve. More specifically, there is a growing need for faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions. The Lightning Network may effectively provide that functionality. Thanks to the growth in payment channels, it seems this logical development may occur pretty soon. Even so, the technology is still in beta testing, and an “official” launch has not yet been announced.\nDevelopments like these are interesting to keep an eye on. However, keeping the bigger picture in mind needs to be a top priority first and foremost. That picture clearly shows Bitcoin has the highest market cap and Bitcoin Cash remains the altcoin. It also shows Bitcoin has higher fees in general, and that situation may not change soon. As such, the current status quo between BC and BCH will not swing in favor of either currency.

An inside job or software hack, that hasn’t had an official determination, and fingers are still pointing between the exchange’s charismatic operator and crypto devs. International heavy law firm Bonelli Erede effectively petitioned to have the exchange remain offline, instituting bankruptcy proceedings, and the Court of Florence recently agreed.\nAlso read: DOJ Crypto Investigation Tanks Prices, Fundstrat Welcomes Adult Supervision Bitgrail Shuttered by Court of Florence\n“This morning,” a post on the exchange’s website read earlier this month, “following the re-opening, we were notified of a deed by the court of Florence requesting the immediate closure of Bitgrail and this situation will persist until a decision is made by the courts, about the precautionary suspension request made by the Bonelli law office on behalf of a client […] Even though we don’t agree with this decision, we are obliged to respect the law and to suspend any Bitgrail business immediately.”\nThis week the court indeed made a decision.\n“We have temporarily disabled the Bitgrail exchange pending further notice,” came what appears to be a rather final Tweet from, presumably, the embattled exchange operator Franceso Firano on May 2nd. It’s what remains of communication since an injunction was filed to prevent Mr. Firano from reopening. The exchange was halted, temporarily, and that decision was formally upheld as bankruptcy proceedings loom.\nRepresenting more than 3,000 exchange complainants is the international firm Bonelli Erede . Its team is a veritable who-is-who of Italian legal pros: Partner Monica Iacoviello , Giuseppe Sbisà , with assistance from senior associates Gianpaolo Ciervo and Alessandra Frigerio. Nano user and Foundation coordinator Espen Enger has also contributed to efforts.\nBonelli Erede is a two-decades old consortium of sorts, formed from successful firms responding to merger and acquisition pressure at the present century’s turn. The result is a legal powerhouse of over 400 lawyers, half a dozen offices scattered throughout Europe, and revenues of something like €150 million. Uphill Battle, Especially for Exchange Users\nAnd so it is Mr. Firano facing a colossal uphill battle that might very well be moot at the time of publication. Bitgrail could be relegated to so much toast, burnt … done. It doesn’t help that Mr. Firano, once known as “The Bomber” for his outbursts and ribald commentary, has been radio silent since the beginning of May.\nThe tone early that day weeks ago was one of optimism, as Mr. Firano floated ways to attempt making looted users whole. The then-latest scheme involved opening the exchange to generate the requisite revenue. And so he attempted to open, announcing he was “pleased to announce the re-open of our exchange! Given the probable overload of servers, it is possible that in the first hours there may be slowdowns in the functionality of the site.”\nMere hours later, the opening was halted pending a more definitive hearing. The Court of Florence in recently upholding that initial stoppage has frozen all assets, tipping off formal bankruptcy proceedings. Typically trustees are appointed to look over books and accounts, and then whatever remains is divvied up according to creditors, victims, etc. The process could take years and yield pennies on the dollar returns. So far, no criminal charges have been filed.\nAll this suggests Mr. Firano being pushed out, along with his proposals for a new crypto and to have devs roll back the blockchain. The Nano Foundation insists losses were the result of bugs on the exchange side of things, and the Nano project will soldier on.\nIs formal bankruptcy the correct remedy here?

Coinbase is also opening a New York office to focus on Wall Street clients.\nThe six-year-old company runs the largest U.S. digital-currency exchange by volume and offers a popular app for storing and transferring bitcoin. Coinbase doesn't directly bet on the price of bitcoin, but instead makes money by collecting fees when customers buy or sell the cryptocurrency.\nCoinbase enjoyed eye-popping growth in late 2017 as small investors piled into bitcoin. It now boasts of more than 20 million customers -- more than Charles Schwab Corp., which has 10.8 million active brokerage accounts.\n\"In U.S. markets, Coinbase is just way ahead of everyone,\" said Ari Lewis, co-founder of crypto hedge fund Grasshopper Capital. \"And they're not standing still with the retail stuff.\"\nBut the end of bitcoin mania raises questions about whether Coinbase's success has peaked. Its exchange handled about $8 billion worth of digital-currency trades in April, down 78% from its record volume in December, according to CryptoCompare.\nRegulators could also trip up Coinbase's quest to broaden bitcoin's appeal. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned in March that many crypto trading platforms were potentially unlawful. Coinbase has approached the SEC and U.S. bank regulators about obtaining various federal licenses, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\nCoinbase was founded in 2012 by Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb Inc. software engineer, and Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. foreign-exchange trader. Mr. Ehrsam left in 2017 but remains on the firm's board.\nWhen Coinbase launched, bitcoin was little known outside a small circle of enthusiasts, many of them libertarians inspired by the idea of a currency outside government control.\nCoinbase always aimed to take bitcoin mainstream, say current and former employees. A major goal was to make it easy to exchange so-called \"fiat\" currencies -- dollars, euros and so on -- for bitcoin. That wasn't always straightforward: Early on, one popular way was for bitcoin aficionados to arrange meetings at Starbucks and swap the digital currency for cash.\nAt a time when bitcoin was widely associated with crime, Coinbase cooperated with U.S. authorities. It registered as a money-services business with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in 2013 and has since amassed 41 state licenses.\nThat helped Coinbase avoid the fate of rivals such as BitInstant, whose founder, Charlie Shrem, was arrested in 2014 in a case linked to the Silk Road underground narcotics bazaar. Mr. Shrem pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitter business and spent about a year and a half in prison. \"The early days of crypto were very much like the Wild West, with very little legal clarity,\" Mr. Shrem said in an email.\nOther bitcoin exchanges failed after hackers stole investors' funds. But Coinbase says it has never been hacked. \"Not being compromised is one of the big reasons that Coinbase is what it is today,\" said Olaf Carlson-Wee, an early employee who now leads crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital.\nCoinbase has had its share of growing pains. The company says its user base doubled from August to December. That led to overloaded systems and customers unable to reach tech support.\nAbout 1,530 complaints have been filed about Coinbase with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so far this year, more than American Express Co. and PayPal Holdings Inc. combined, according to CFPB data.\nNikhil Thomas, an IT analyst in Maryland, was unable to access his Coinbase account for four months because of a problem verifying his identity. Calls and emails to customer service yielded few results, and he missed out on thousands of dollars in profits as bitcoin tumbled, he said. \"The ordeal was painful,\" Mr. Thomas said in an interview.\nCoinbase declined to comment on Mr. Thomas's experience, but says it was overwhelmed as its user base mushroomed. \"As a result of this unprecedented demand, some customers had a poor experience,\" Dan Romero, general manager of Coinbase's retail business, said in an email.\nOver the past three months, Coinbase has expanded its customer-support team by more than 150% and resolved 95% of its outstanding requests for help, Mr. Romero added.\nCoinbase has faced other controversies. In December, it vowed to probe allegations of insider trading after suspicious market moves accompanied the introduction of Bitcoin Cash, a bitcoin offshoot, on Coinbase's exchange. The price of Bitcoin Cash climbed 28% in the 24 hours before Coinbase announced the launch, fueling rumors that some traders had been tipped off in advance.\nA spokeswoman declined to discuss the insider-trading allegations, citing pending lawsuits. Coinbase has previously said it prohibits employees from trading on nonpublic information or sharing it with people outside the company.\nThere is no guarantee that Coinbase will maintain its lead over rivals. Robinhood, the free stock-trading app with more than four million users, added cryptocurrency trading in February. That could erode Coinbase's hold over retail crypto investors.\nMr. Thomas is considering Robinhood after his frustrating experience. \"Coinbase works beautifully,\" he said, \"until you have a problem.\"\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nMay 27, 2018 07:14 ET (11:14 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ari lewis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alexander osipovich coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "charles schwab corp.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T17:10:24.055+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9b1d14cafab82b7f5fc2ab923c7ccc4f57b784b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTK8cHrpJn8tEqSI890wMR8rqSJXW_PUKrmLXBSXY6TG_8DP1KzPvhrMK48HoIB8JDAyVCdDMJtZ3TQlsamHmFSBqM4Si.pWzo4iE8aB2TRwbXFnuLt34OAhoksJnP17ZZTZTT1HRBRFQ--", "site_full": "walletinvestor.com", "site": "walletinvestor.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin $7284.720 - CryptoCurrency Trading Report - 27.05.2018 19:01 - CryptoCurrency Blog", "title_full": "Bitcoin $7284.720 - CryptoCurrency Trading Report - 27.05.2018 19:01 - CryptoCurrency Blog", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "https://walletinvestor.com/static/frontend/images/cryptocurrency-news-icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f9b1d14cafab82b7f5fc2ab923c7ccc4f57b784b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTK8cHrpJn8tEqSI890wMR8rqSJXW_PUKrmLXBSXY6TG_8DP1KzPvhrMK48HoIB8JDAyVCdDMJtZ3TQlsamHmFSBqM4Si.pWzo4iE8aB2TRwbXFnuLt34OAhoksJnP17ZZTZTT1HRBRFQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin $7284.720 - CryptoCurrency Trading Report - 27.05.2018 19:01 - CryptoCurrency Blog", "text": "Bitcoin $7284.720 – CryptoCurrency Trading Report – 27.05.2018 19:01 Posted by CryptoCurrency on\nHot news:\nHere we summon for you the changes of the market of CryptoCurrency from the last 60 minutes.\nBitcoin was in the top position in the last hour, the exchange rate decreases from 7347.171 dollars to 7284.720 .

Ever since the fateful first-ever recorded transaction of Bitcoin for a physical good, the use case for the currency has taken off, with customers now able to use Bitcoin for real estate deals, online shopping , airplane bookings and, of course, pizza . Cointelegraph got the chance to speak to both Laszlo and Jeremy this week about their views on Bitcoin, how they feel about the legacy of the “Bitcoin Pizza” and their favorite type of pizza.\nCointelegraph: You probably get asked this question a lot, but I have to ask. Since 10,000 Bitcoin is worth around 80 million dollars today, do you ever regret paying 10,000 BTC for two pizzas?\nLH: You know, I don't regret it. I think that it's great that I got to be part of the early history of Bitcoin in that way, and people know about the pizza and it's an interesting story because everybody can kind of relate to that and be [like] - \"Oh my God, you spent all of that money!\" I was also kind of giving people tech support on the forums and I ported Bitcoin to MacOS, and you know, some other things - fix bugs and whatnot, and I've always kind of just wanted people to use Bitcoin and buying the pizza was one way to do that. I didn't think it would get as popular as it has, but it's gotten to be a really catchy story for people.\nCT: So do you use Bitcoin in everyday life?\nLH: Yeah, I do, I try to whenever I can. I've bought many things over the years with it, I play around with the Bitcoin software and things like that, but I try to kind of keep it as a hobby.\nBut I haven't really used Bitcoin much in face-to-face payments. I've done it mostly online. It’s one of those things where I like to keep an eye on it and I like to participate in online, but as far as face-to-face stuff, I just feel like it's not really the best. It tends to be more frustrating, and the goal is that Bitcoin should become better than the status quo, right?\nCT: What’s your favorite cryptocurrency?\nLH: Bitcoin! [Laughs]\nCT: What's your favorite pizza?\nLH: Pizza? I like Supreme.\nCT: In your original post from the first Pizza Day , you compared your desire to buy a pizza with buying a hotel breakfast platter. What is your ideal hotel breakfast platter?\nLH: Oh, I don't know. I like eggs, bacon, pancakes - you know, standard stuff.\nJust to expand on that - the reason that I compared it that way - I was thinking of the experience of me picking up the phone and saying \"Hey, I'd like breakfast in room 123\", and I just get charged on my account and I get the food delivered to me - I don't care how they did it. Whether it's a contractor, or Papa John's, or whoever brings it. What I was trying to do was make it clear that I didn't want somebody to send me a Papa John's gift card, or a Domino's credit or anything like that - I wanted food and I wanted to pay Bitcoins for food. Because if I can buy food with it, then it's it's as real as any other money, right? Food is a basic necessity -- if I can eat from Bitcoin, I can live off of Bitcoin.\nCT: Does your current job involve working with cryptocurrency?\nLH: I don't really like engaging in it as a primary business, it's sort of a side project for me. I know that's kind of weird to explain to people, but I feel like that keeps it more fun for me - than if it was like a nine-to-five kind of thing of \"Oh, you know, let's do some crypto business.\" I don't want to be one of those guys with like a scam ICO or something like that.\nJust recently at my job, I kind of convinced people here to accept Bitcoin, and, being a developer, I integrated it on our website. We are trying to see how that goes now. People here are excited about it, they're excited about about what I'd done and everything. And so we're trying it out. I'm kind of applying my hobby at work now, so that's pretty cool when you can do that.\nCT: Have you ever thought about buying a pizza with any other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin?\nLH : I like Bitcoin. I was around early, when it was just Bitcoin, and to me, the copycat coins or whatever you want to call them - you know 90% of these things are simply a copy-paste of Bitcoin, and they changed the logo, or they changed something. I'm not that interested in those, I am interested in Bitcoin.\nCT: Do you think that your original Bitcoin pizza purchase directly influenced the fact that you can now buy pizza and other food with Bitcoin?\nLH : I'd like to think that what I did helped. But I think if it wasn't me, somebody else would have come along. And maybe it wouldn't have been pizza. But I think Bitcoin was kind of destined to get big, and I didn't know everything about Bitcoin back then - I mean, I had only been playing with it a couple months, and I figured out how to mine, I actually wrote the first GPU miner - and that's how I got all those Bitcoins that I was kind of giving away.\nCT: Do you think it makes sense for people to use Bitcoin for kind of pizza-type purchases now?\nLH : If everybody wanted to pay for pizza with Bitcoin right now – it wouldn't work -- they would try it, they'd realize that their transactions aren't confirming, and they'd lose interest. And that's kind of where we're at today, right?\nIn December, everybody was like \"Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin,\" and then \"Oh my god, my transaction has been sitting there for 12 hours, what's going on, this thing sucks!\" People learned how it works and we actually saw the fee market working and all that, so I think it's really exciting, but I have no idea on how it's gonna go, I think it's really interesting to watch.\nCT: What would it take for Bitcoin to become more widely used?\nLH: I know you guys covered it when I did the Lightning pizza thing . I feel like when something like that – the Lightning Network or something similar to it – ends up becoming mainstream, usable for people. I think that's where it'll become more interesting to actually spend bitcoins face-to-face.\nCT: How do you think the Lightning Network will make Bitcoin more mainstream?\nLH: The Lighting Network is not perfect either, it has issues, it can be in abused in various ways, but it's a step in that direction, and to me, if something like Lightning Network takes off, I think you're gonna see every online retailer just switch to it because nobody wants to use MasterCard , and Visa , and PayPal .\nI think the Lightning Network is definitely the goal there, to bring more usability to people, because it really does enable instant payments, and Bitcoin payments are not instant. If you're accepting with zero confirmation of payment, you're not really doing it correctly. And that's okay to do if you're gonna extend trust to people – because same thing happens with a credit card – all you have is the promise today, you haven't actually gotten paid. So in some businesses that's perfectly fine, but that's not really the spirit of Bitcoin, you shouldn't have to trust anybody, you should be able to say \"Hey, I have this Bitcoin, and here's the cryptographic proof.\" The Lightning Network can also give us back some of the privacy that people originally mistakenly thought they had. CT: In the photo of your family eating the “Lightning Network Pizza”, your children are wearing “I <3 Bitcoin” t-shirts. Do you educate your children about Bitcoin? Image source: Laszlo Hanyecz’s Feb. 25 post on Lightning-dev mailing list\nLH: Liam is my son, he's seven and Amy, my daughter, is nine. They actually have their own paper wallets, they own like a thousandth of a Bitcoin or something like that. I showed them how to go on GDAX and things like that. I just made them a bookmark on their computer so that they could check the price. I showed them how to multiply their little thousandth of a Bitcoin by the price and things like that.\nI spent time explaining it to them, they were like:\n- Daddy, what are you doing? - Bitcoin. - Oh, what's the Bitcoin?\nMy kids are fairly young, I can't really explain market forces and things like that to them yet, but they understand that more is good, and Bitcoin is good, and that I'm involved with Bitcoin somehow. I try to get them to learn, and I think when they get older, I'll try to teach them more technical stuff. Jercos – the man who earned 10,000 BTC by selling two pizzas\nCointelegraph also had the chance to speak with Jeremy Sturdivant, also known as Jercos, who participated in the original Bitcoin pizza deal as the recipient of those 10,000 BTC that he turned into two pizzas. Sturdivant, who told CT that he turned Hanyecz’s BTC into fiat for a trip when they were worth a couple of hundred dollars, noted that he still uses Bitcoin in his everyday life “to some extent:”\n“Doing independent contract work brings money in a variety of forms, and I've been paid in Bitcoin, Litecoin, even Dogecoin. My local grocery stores don't take it though, so I most often find myself trading it away to put it to use, aside from online services [...] Steam, Humble store, and other video game retailers accepted Bitcoin during a lot of the times I had free time for video games. Certainly the bulk of my Steam library was paid for with Bitcoin.”\nWhen asked about the most amount of Bitcoin he has ever had, Sturdivant estimated it to be close to 40,000 due to both mining and trading early on:\n“I've never seen Bitcoin as an investment, and while it's easy to look back and say ‘I could have been a millionaire,’ I think it's more important to look at the mindset I had during the pizza transaction, not being that of acquiring an investment, but of making use of a form of currency. If I was looking to hoard coins, I very likely wouldn't have been in the right place at the right time.”\nSturdivant also noted that he’s also continued to buy and sell pizza in cryptocurrency using Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH), and that he prefers pizza with meat and red onions, although “for a little controversy, I like ‘Hawaiian’ pizza quite a lot.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T04:29:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3cc3bee2d1ebda1b6882d457ee61f83ae3c9971", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zclhl6DUxaUppcWqgWg_mXy51WMNgzIlonqDiWfTkQK4K3_BDHXep_7mQo_nBNAhYZ0FAdYAVv0WEbwQZdZWtvmYhQeSncKibQ--", "site_full": "btcmanager.com", "site": "btcmanager.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Xapo’s Bitcoin Wallet Adds Support for Segregated Witness – XBT.MONEY", "title_full": "Xapo’s Bitcoin Wallet Adds Support for Segregated Witness – XBT.MONEY", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.791, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Xapo-Bitcoin-Wallet-Adds-Support-For-Segregated-Witness-Segwit-660x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d3cc3bee2d1ebda1b6882d457ee61f83ae3c9971", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zclhl6DUxaUppcWqgWg_mXy51WMNgzIlonqDiWfTkQK4K3_BDHXep_7mQo_nBNAhYZ0FAdYAVv0WEbwQZdZWtvmYhQeSncKibQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Xapo’s Bitcoin Wallet Adds Support for Segregated Witness – XBT.MONEY", "text": "Xapo’s Bitcoin Wallet Adds Support for Segregated Witness May 27, 2018 6 Views\nBack in August 2017, Segregated Witness (SegWit) was implemented for bitcoin; a protocol that’s aimed at alleviating the problems of scalability and high transaction fees. Now, Xapo has integrated SegWit into its wallets and vaults in a bid to serve its retail clients as well as institutional investors who use its cold storage vaults better. Another Significant Player Adopts Segwit\nAccording to Yahoo Finance , the president of the Hong Kong-based Xapo, Ted Rogers has announced that the cryptocurrency wallet now supports SegWit. Xapo prides itself as the world’s most secure bitcoin wallet . It allows users buy bitcoins pay for goods and services and send money globally.\nAccording to reports , Xapo has a network of underground bitcoin vaults on five continents including one in a decommissioned military bunker in Switzerland that holds approximately $10 billion worth of the world’s flagship cryptocurrency.\nIn January 2017, Xapo which reportedly holds about seven percent of the global bitcoin supply, was granted conditional approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to do business in the region.\nJust four years old, the company has grown to become an institutional big whale in the nascent world of blockchain finance. Xapo Holds More Value than Many U.S. Banks\nXapo ’s $10 billion bitcoin stash is larger than 5,670 banks in the United States and the firm also handles more deposits than most financial institutions in the world.\nThe Xapo journey started way back in 2011 when the CEO of Xapo, Wences Casares bought his first bitcoins but felt the methods of storing the coins at the time were not safe enough so he built a vault for his personal use and within a short while friends and even institutional investors started storing their cryptos in the vault.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial, and security functions would be key. He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer,” said billionaire LinkedIn co-founder, Reid Hoffman, who pumped in over $20 million in Xapo in 2014.\nWith Xapo’s new support for SegWit, it has joined the growing list of wallets and exchanges such as Luno, Coinbase and a host of others that have integrated SegWit. SegWit Adoptions Nears 40 Percent\nThe issue of scalability has been a hot topic in the world of cryptocurrencies. World number two cryptocurrency ether is also developing solutions like sharding and plasma in a bid to offer users faster transactions and meager fees while adding less burden on the blockchain.\nBitcoin’s Lightning Network protocol, another solution that is touted to solve the scaling issues entirely is also on its way to full use as quite a vast array of bitcoin supporters have been experimenting with the superfast scaling system.\nAlong with the blessing by Xapo, the Bitcoin ecosystem is increasingly utilizing the SegWit update; recent figures from transactionfee.info shows that adoption is nearing 40 percent of payments on a 7-day rolling average basis.

In 2013, when the price of BTC surpassed the $100 mark, Howells started to search for the thumb drive which he used back in 2009 to store private keys to the 7,500 BTC he had mined. He then recalled that instead of throwing the empty thumb drive, he mistakenly threw away the thumb drive with his private keys. “I mined more than 7,500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush. Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty, and the other contained my bitcoin private keys. I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information,” said Howells. More Bitcoin is a unique digital asset because it forces its users to take responsibility over their funds and eliminates the possibility of central institutions or third party service providers gaining access to user funds. One downside of this aspect of BTC is that if and when a user loses private keys to a wallet, it is impossible to recover the funds, however large the amount may be. After realising that he had thrown away millions of dollars, Howells admitted that he had felt physically sick. Howells stated: “I looked up the price, did the calculation . . . and thought, ‘S – – t. [My investment is] worth around $2 [million] or $3 million.’ A few months later it was worth $9.9 million. I was annoyed, pissed off, sick. I spoke to the people at the landfill and told them that I threw away a hard drive worth $10 million. They looked at me stupidly.” Bitcoin is Undervalued Millions of bitcoin are permanently lost from its immutable blockchain network because of cases like the loss of funds of Howells. A study done by Chainalysis , a blockchain-focused digital forensics company, found that 3.79 million BTC are potentially lost permanently and can no longer be re-obtained. 3.79 million is more than 18 percent of the maximum supply of BTC, 21 million. Given that the price of bitcoin is calculated by dividing the market valuation of the digital asset by its circulating supply, when the supply of bitcoin maxes out at 21 million, the price of bitcoin should be 18 percent higher than its actual price. “On the one hand, direct calculations about market cap do not take lost coins into consideration. Considering how highly speculative this field is, those market cap calculations may make it into economic models of the market that impact spending activity. Yet the market has adapted to the actual demand and supply available – just look at exchange behavior,” Chainalysis enior economist Kim Gauer said.

Most people ask how to buy cryptocurrency in a safe way. On this occasion I will share information and reviews about the best and most popular exchange sites in the include types of coins / cryptocurrency that can be purchased on the exchange, as well as its payment methods.\nThe first thing to notice when looking for bitcoin exchanges is how secure websites and servers are. Locations usually give an idea of ​​what’s on offer. On this occasion I will review the full range of trading exchange cryptocurrency at binance.com, following binance.com review: Register Binance.com\nOn their site, it says they are capable of processing 1,400,000 orders per second! An impressive number if you consider the number of people who visit their site every day. The company had an initial ICO in July 2017 and after a few months, released their exchange site where their BNB coins can be used to pay for transaction fees. This is a website that has just entered online cryptocurrency trading.\nAvailable Coins for Binance.com TradingBitcoin, Ether, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Ripple, BNB, ARK, AST, BNT, BQX, BTG, CTR, DASH, DNT, ENG, ENJ, EOS, Monero, litecoin, and more! To get a complete list of available coins, please go to their website and create an account.\nEase of use Binance.com. This site is not created for new players in world exchanges. They do not have a guide that says what is where and directs new merchants to the right path! With that said, it would be wise to read more about exchange websites even before trying to trade on Binance.com if you are new to the world of commerce. In addition to the non-user-friendly interface, we’ve noticed that their website has absolutely no lag issues. This means that when we move from one tab to another, it all happens in a flash and you are not forced to wait in an awkward silence to get to the next page. When it comes to ease of use, we give them a good 7/10 experience because everything is going well, the only advantage we have is that we know like graphics and numbers. Register Binance.com\nBinance.com Customer Support. After all exploring with features and how to trade, it is time to see what kind of support they have for their customers. One of the important things in looking at an exchange / trading platform is knowing their customer service. We have emphasized on so many reviews that when it comes to money-handling websites, customer service is essential for its advancement as it bridges the gap between the company and the customer.\nHere, in Binance.com, registered customers can contact them through email support because they do not have a live chat system that is integrated into their website, maybe features to be added in the future. In addition to email support can be achieved through support@binance.zendesk.com they can also be contacted through the QQ group: 344615861. QQ messenger App is widely used in China.

Coinbase is also opening a New York office to focus on Wall Street clients.\nThe six-year-old company runs the largest U.S. digital-currency exchange by volume and offers a popular app for storing and transferring bitcoin. Coinbase doesn't directly bet on the price of bitcoin, but instead makes money by collecting fees when customers buy or sell the cryptocurrency.\nCoinbase enjoyed eye-popping growth in late 2017 as small investors piled into bitcoin. It now boasts of more than 20 million customers -- more than Charles Schwab Corp., which has 10.8 million active brokerage accounts.\n\"In U.S. markets, Coinbase is just way ahead of everyone,\" said Ari Lewis, co-founder of crypto hedge fund Grasshopper Capital. \"And they're not standing still with the retail stuff.\"\nBut the end of bitcoin mania raises questions about whether Coinbase's success has peaked. Its exchange handled about $8 billion worth of digital-currency trades in April, down 78% from its record volume in December, according to CryptoCompare.\nRegulators could also trip up Coinbase's quest to broaden bitcoin's appeal. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned in March that many crypto trading platforms were potentially unlawful. Coinbase has approached the SEC and U.S. bank regulators about obtaining various federal licenses, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\nCoinbase was founded in 2012 by Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb Inc. software engineer, and Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. foreign-exchange trader. Mr. Ehrsam left in 2017 but remains on the firm's board.\nWhen Coinbase launched, bitcoin was little known outside a small circle of enthusiasts, many of them libertarians inspired by the idea of a currency outside government control.\nCoinbase always aimed to take bitcoin mainstream, say current and former employees. A major goal was to make it easy to exchange so-called \"fiat\" currencies -- dollars, euros and so on -- for bitcoin. That wasn't always straightforward: Early on, one popular way was for bitcoin aficionados to arrange meetings at Starbucks and swap the digital currency for cash.\nAt a time when bitcoin was widely associated with crime, Coinbase cooperated with U.S. authorities. It registered as a money-services business with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in 2013 and has since amassed 41 state licenses.\nThat helped Coinbase avoid the fate of rivals such as BitInstant, whose founder, Charlie Shrem, was arrested in 2014 in a case linked to the Silk Road underground narcotics bazaar. Mr. Shrem pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitter business and spent about a year and a half in prison. \"The early days of crypto were very much like the Wild West, with very little legal clarity,\" Mr. Shrem said in an email.\nOther bitcoin exchanges failed after hackers stole investors' funds. But Coinbase says it has never been hacked. \"Not being compromised is one of the big reasons that Coinbase is what it is today,\" said Olaf Carlson-Wee, an early employee who now leads crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital.\nCoinbase has had its share of growing pains. The company says its user base doubled from August to December. That led to overloaded systems and customers unable to reach tech support.\nAbout 1,530 complaints have been filed about Coinbase with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so far this year, more than American Express Co. and PayPal Holdings Inc. combined, according to CFPB data.\nNikhil Thomas, an IT analyst in Maryland, was unable to access his Coinbase account for four months because of a problem verifying his identity. Calls and emails to customer service yielded few results, and he missed out on thousands of dollars in profits as bitcoin tumbled, he said. \"The ordeal was painful,\" Mr. Thomas said in an interview.\nCoinbase declined to comment on Mr. Thomas's experience, but says it was overwhelmed as its user base mushroomed. \"As a result of this unprecedented demand, some customers had a poor experience,\" Dan Romero, general manager of Coinbase's retail business, said in an email.\nOver the past three months, Coinbase has expanded its customer-support team by more than 150% and resolved 95% of its outstanding requests for help, Mr. Romero added.\nCoinbase has faced other controversies. In December, it vowed to probe allegations of insider trading after suspicious market moves accompanied the introduction of Bitcoin Cash, a bitcoin offshoot, on Coinbase's exchange. The price of Bitcoin Cash climbed 28% in the 24 hours before Coinbase announced the launch, fueling rumors that some traders had been tipped off in advance.\nA spokeswoman declined to discuss the insider-trading allegations, citing pending lawsuits. Coinbase has previously said it prohibits employees from trading on nonpublic information or sharing it with people outside the company.\nThere is no guarantee that Coinbase will maintain its lead over rivals. Robinhood, the free stock-trading app with more than four million users, added cryptocurrency trading in February. That could erode Coinbase's hold over retail crypto investors.\nMr. Thomas is considering Robinhood after his frustrating experience. \"Coinbase works beautifully,\" he said, \"until you have a problem.\"\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at [email protected]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ari lewis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alexander osipovich coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "charles schwab corp.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T17:18:16.037+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2f8970870e99623664cc07533dbec97f763db3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR0AU.lIlyqZek3rucCJTFR3ndz5YYDv.y6i35sB_RTZI7KyvdcMoA1tXpE1CBYpWk-", "site_full": "karbeka.com", "site": "karbeka.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoins 4 Backpage - BITCOIN & EXCHARGE CRYPTO", "title_full": "Bitcoins 4 Backpage - BITCOIN & EXCHARGE CRYPTO", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "https://karbeka.com/bitcoin/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2018/05/binance-300x187.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2f8970870e99623664cc07533dbec97f763db3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR0AU.lIlyqZek3rucCJTFR3ndz5YYDv.y6i35sB_RTZI7KyvdcMoA1tXpE1CBYpWk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Oleh Admin", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoins 4 Backpage - BITCOIN & EXCHARGE CRYPTO", "text": "Oleh admin\nBitcoins 4 Backpage. Most people ask how to buy cryptocurrency in a safe way. On this occasion I will share information and reviews about the best and most popular exchange sites in the include types of coins / cryptocurrency that can be purchased on the exchange, as well as its payment methods.\nThe first thing to notice when looking for bitcoin exchanges is how secure websites and servers are. Locations usually give an idea of ​​what’s on offer. On this occasion I will review the full range of trading exchange cryptocurrency at binance.com, following binance.com review: Register Binance.com\nOn their site, it says they are capable of processing 1,400,000 orders per second! An impressive number if you consider the number of people who visit their site every day. The company had an initial ICO in July 2017 and after a few months, released their exchange site where their BNB coins can be used to pay for transaction fees. This is a website that has just entered online cryptocurrency trading.\nAvailable Coins for Binance.com TradingBitcoin, Ether, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Ripple, BNB, ARK, AST, BNT, BQX, BTG, CTR, DASH, DNT, ENG, ENJ, EOS, Monero, litecoin, and more! To get a complete list of available coins, please go to their website and create an account.\nEase of use Binance.com. This site is not created for new players in world exchanges. They do not have a guide that says what is where and directs new merchants to the right path! With that said, it would be wise to read more about exchange websites even before trying to trade on Binance.com if you are new to the world of commerce. In addition to the non-user-friendly interface, we’ve noticed that their website has absolutely no lag issues. This means that when we move from one tab to another, it all happens in a flash and you are not forced to wait in an awkward silence to get to the next page. When it comes to ease of use, we give them a good 7/10 experience because everything is going well, the only advantage we have is that we know like graphics and numbers. Register Binance.com\nBinance.com Customer Support. After all exploring with features and how to trade, it is time to see what kind of support they have for their customers. One of the important things in looking at an exchange / trading platform is knowing their customer service. We have emphasized on so many reviews that when it comes to money-handling websites, customer service is essential for its advancement as it bridges the gap between the company and the customer.\nHere, in Binance.com, registered customers can contact them through email support because they do not have a live chat system that is integrated into their website, maybe features to be added in the future. In addition to email support can be achieved through support@binance.zendesk.com they can also be contacted through the QQ group: 344615861. QQ messenger App is widely used in China. They can also be followed through Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, and Wechat accounts.

However, one might have not known that the new regulations also had severe consequences for some services that had to shut down.\nOn Monday we reported that team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced that due to GDPR they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check. Crypto Revolution Reshaping Global Politics\nThe intersection of politics and cryptocurrency was our main focus on Tuesday . We reported that Iranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. And in the US, Congressional candidate Brian Forde raised $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations, and an opponent attacked him for this, referring to his donors as “bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nWe also reported that Vitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled “Liberation Through Radical Decentralization.” In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work. McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip John McAfee’s prediction of a bull run on the cryptocurrency markets in the near future was one of the most discussed issues on Wednesday . Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, the internet security expert expects. McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said. He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,” the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads. Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street\nOn Thursday we reported that Deutsche Börse AG, the group which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is actively examining its options for launching cryptocurrency derivatives. This was revealed by Jeffrey Tessler, CEO of the post-trade services provider owned by Deutsche Börse Clearstream and member of the group’s executive board. And changes to the Volcker Rule give Americans a new reason for moving their money away from big banks to cryptocurrencies, according to the latest analysis by Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings. Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Offered for BCH The growing number of bitcoin cash adoptions has been in the headlines on Friday . White Company, founded by former executive at Formula 1 and LVMH, Elizabeth White, which offers high-end products and luxury brands, including fine watches and sports cars, has become the latest business to accept BCH payments. And the online travel agency Cheapair.com has also announced it started accepting bitcoin cash for booking flights and hotels. Man Goes All In on Crypto\nThe most commented on story of the week talked about a guy living is his car while working two jobs just to invest it all in crypto. The Canadian man explains that he parks his car in his friend’s garage to sleep, for which he pays $40 CAD per month. Despite the cramped conditions, he hasn’t forgone all home comforts, finding space to squeeze in a memory foam mattress and comfy quilts. He’s also able to shower at a friend’s house and store some items there. As for his crypto portfolio, the unnamed Canadian is currently pinning his hopes on Collosusxt, Fundrequest, Policypal, and Dero.

The investigations are to ascertain if they are conducting activities that require regulation: “If we conclude that they are, then we may investigate and take action, identifying and determining the most serious matters which pose the greatest risk to consumers.”\nThe FCA said that it would “continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing regulatory framework”.\nThat regulatory framework is still being worked out. The FCA considers cryptocurrency to be a commodity, not a currency, so technically it falls outside of the authority’s remit. In April it issued a statement clarifying that while cryptocurrencies themselves are not regulated, companies that offer cryptocurrency derivatives do need a licence. However companies whose sole purpose is to provide ownership of cryptocurrency to end clients remain completely unregulated.\nIn February of this year, a number of cryptocurrency companies joined forces to form CryptoUK , a self-regulatory industry body. All members must sign a code of conduct. In April, the organisation offered a written proposal for regulations to the government, suggesting that licences be issued to companies that meet certain standards. The group wants regulation because this lends legitimacy to the industry which is good for business, and also means that companies receive protection under the law.\nCryptoUK suggested that instead of regulating individual cryptocurrencies, the FCA should focus on the companies that process them – exchanges, wallet providers, trading platforms, etc.\nTwo days ago, the FCA issued a warning against a cryptocurrency broker called Get Financial. The company’s crime was that it falsely claimed to be licensed – the FCA advises against giving this firm any money.\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin news fca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T13:30:00.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "325940d40bd78af70949e1fb0ed20d602bb4dd67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94velBpL6eCE9xF2MusIB0zJFI", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "Bitcoin backlash as ‘miners’ stress power grids in Central Washington", "title_full": "Bitcoin backlash as ‘miners’ stress power grids in Central Washington | Hacker News", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "325940d40bd78af70949e1fb0ed20d602bb4dd67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94velBpL6eCE9xF2MusIB0zJFI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "testplzignore", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin backlash as ‘miners’ stress power grids in Central Washington", "text": "I like how it is done by the utility in San Francisco.

The Bitcoin Cash price, for example, has dipped below $1,000 for the second time in a few days. This seemingly confirms there are growing concerns regarding the long-term future of this project. Bitcoin Cash Price Struggles are Very Real\nAnyone who has kept an eye on the Bitcoin Cash price this week may have noticed an interesting trend. Despite a somewhat steady price level throughout most of 2018, things have taken a dire turn since this week. With the Bitcoin Cash price dropped from over $1,200 all the way to $980 in a few days, the setback was pretty steep.\nAt that time, some industry experts speculated Bitcoin Cash has not convinced most investors and speculators. An interesting stance, although it is always subject to interpretation first and foremost. All cryptocurrencies are bleeding value as of right now, thus this “problem” is not unique to BCH whatsoever. Until the Bitcoin value picks up the pace, it seems safe to assume the Bitcoin Cash price will continue to decline as well.\nOver the past 24 hours, there has been a 4.08% Bitcoin Cash price decline. Surprisingly, there is only a 0.92% drop in the BHC/BTC ratio, which seemingly confirms Bitcoin Cash would have a stable value if Bitcoin wasn’t getting manipulated. Even so, it also shows how BCH – just like all other cryptocurrencies – is primarily linked to the Bitcoin value, and right now, the future is not looking all that impressive.\nWith $493.313m in 24-hour trading volume , it seems the demand to buy and sell BCH is not slowing down compared to 24 hours ago. It is evident there is a lack of trading volume for all currencies as of right now, but for Bitcoin Cash, the trend doesn’t necessarily look all that bad. Compared to some other top 10 coins, its volume is holding up surprisingly well, at least, for the time being.\nThe way things stand right now, OKEx is the leading exchange in terms of BCH trading volume. Its USDT pair is well ahead of LBank’s BTC pair and HitbTC’s BTC market. EXX and OKEx’s BTC market complete the top five, which means there are no fiat currencies in the top five as of right now. In fact, there’s only one fiat currency pair in the entire top 10, which confirms the Bitcoin Cash price will not reserve course today by any means.\nWhether or not the Bitcoin Cash price can gain control around $1,000 is a difficult question to answer right now. While that seems somewhat plausible, it will heavily depend on how the Bitcoin price moves along in the hours and days to come. As of right now, the BTC price seems to be heading lower and lower, which will also push the Bitcoin Cash price down even further. Today won’t be a pleasant day in this regard, albeit stranger things have happened in the past. About The Author Jdebunt\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

He dipped into his savings, and asked his brother, relatives and even neighbours for cash.\nThe accused told Ali the money would be transferred to China and the Bitcoins would reflect in his e-wallet account. One of the accused said once the money is “converted to cash”, he would retrieve it from Dubai.\nAli handed over the money in Karol Bagh, where he waited at a mobile recharge shop till 11 pm before the owner asked him to leave. “They brothers then told me to book a hotel room in Paharganj.”\nWhen Ali didn’t get Bitcoins the next day, the accused said their father was ill, and gave him a cheque for Rs 91.2 lakh before leaving the hotel. When Ali tried to encash the cheque, it bounced.

Coinbase is also opening a New York office to focus on Wall Street clients.\nThe six-year-old company runs the largest U.S. digital-currency exchange by volume and offers a popular app for storing and transferring bitcoin. Coinbase doesn't directly bet on the price of bitcoin, but instead makes money by collecting fees when customers buy or sell the cryptocurrency.\nCoinbase enjoyed eye-popping growth in late 2017 as small investors piled into bitcoin. It now boasts of more than 20 million customers -- more than Charles Schwab Corp., which has 10.8 million active brokerage accounts.\n\"In U.S. markets, Coinbase is just way ahead of everyone,\" said Ari Lewis, co-founder of crypto hedge fund Grasshopper Capital. \"And they're not standing still with the retail stuff.\"\nBut the end of bitcoin mania raises questions about whether Coinbase's success has peaked. Its exchange handled about $8 billion worth of digital-currency trades in April, down 78% from its record volume in December, according to CryptoCompare.\nRegulators could also trip up Coinbase's quest to broaden bitcoin's appeal. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned in March that many crypto trading platforms were potentially unlawful. Coinbase has approached the SEC and U.S. bank regulators about obtaining various federal licenses, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\nCoinbase was founded in 2012 by Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb Inc. software engineer, and Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. foreign-exchange trader. Mr. Ehrsam left in 2017 but remains on the firm's board.\nWhen Coinbase launched, bitcoin was little known outside a small circle of enthusiasts, many of them libertarians inspired by the idea of a currency outside government control.\nCoinbase always aimed to take bitcoin mainstream, say current and former employees. A major goal was to make it easy to exchange so-called \"fiat\" currencies -- dollars, euros and so on -- for bitcoin. That wasn't always straightforward: Early on, one popular way was for bitcoin aficionados to arrange meetings at Starbucks and swap the digital currency for cash.\nAt a time when bitcoin was widely associated with crime, Coinbase cooperated with U.S. authorities. It registered as a money-services business with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in 2013 and has since amassed 41 state licenses.\nThat helped Coinbase avoid the fate of rivals such as BitInstant, whose founder, Charlie Shrem, was arrested in 2014 in a case linked to the Silk Road underground narcotics bazaar. Mr. Shrem pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitter business and spent about a year and a half in prison. \"The early days of crypto were very much like the Wild West, with very little legal clarity,\" Mr. Shrem said in an email.\nOther bitcoin exchanges failed after hackers stole investors' funds. But Coinbase says it has never been hacked. \"Not being compromised is one of the big reasons that Coinbase is what it is today,\" said Olaf Carlson-Wee, an early employee who now leads crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital.\nCoinbase has had its share of growing pains. The company says its user base doubled from August to December. That led to overloaded systems and customers unable to reach tech support.\nAbout 1,530 complaints have been filed about Coinbase with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so far this year, more than American Express Co. and PayPal Holdings Inc. combined, according to CFPB data.\nNikhil Thomas, an IT analyst in Maryland, was unable to access his Coinbase account for four months because of a problem verifying his identity. Calls and emails to customer service yielded few results, and he missed out on thousands of dollars in profits as bitcoin tumbled, he said. \"The ordeal was painful,\" Mr. Thomas said in an interview.\nCoinbase declined to comment on Mr. Thomas's experience, but says it was overwhelmed as its user base mushroomed. \"As a result of this unprecedented demand, some customers had a poor experience,\" Dan Romero, general manager of Coinbase's retail business, said in an email.\nOver the past three months, Coinbase has expanded its customer-support team by more than 150% and resolved 95% of its outstanding requests for help, Mr. Romero added.\nCoinbase has faced other controversies. In December, it vowed to probe allegations of insider trading after suspicious market moves accompanied the introduction of Bitcoin Cash, a bitcoin offshoot, on Coinbase's exchange. The price of Bitcoin Cash climbed 28% in the 24 hours before Coinbase announced the launch, fueling rumors that some traders had been tipped off in advance.\nA spokeswoman declined to discuss the insider-trading allegations, citing pending lawsuits. Coinbase has previously said it prohibits employees from trading on nonpublic information or sharing it with people outside the company.\nThere is no guarantee that Coinbase will maintain its lead over rivals. Robinhood, the free stock-trading app with more than four million users, added cryptocurrency trading in February. That could erode Coinbase's hold over retail crypto investors.\nMr. Thomas is considering Robinhood after his frustrating experience. \"Coinbase works beautifully,\" he said, \"until you have a problem.\"\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com\nMay 27, 2018 07:14 ET (11:14 GMT)\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ari lewis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alexander osipovich coinbase inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "charles schwab corp.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:04:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ee7e0a381aa6e8d9a7b1314219d0ed1f070761b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpILZSe7QjGBhuCrofHC5qrkV0XFSSdHVMLXebh3yRsYV_HSobK7KJjYtP3RAfMmjlEKZTrXsCoHSYCwZTY8zHT8P4uVqy4_InfcjGm6d3Yg9xacVYkiI57VZUMIc2CkoM-", "site_full": "tribetica.com", "site": "tribetica.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "More than $8.5 Million in Bitcoin Seized by Israeli Police – tribetica.com", "title_full": "More than $8.5 Million in Bitcoin Seized by Israeli Police – tribetica.com", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.775, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ee7e0a381aa6e8d9a7b1314219d0ed1f070761b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpILZSe7QjGBhuCrofHC5qrkV0XFSSdHVMLXebh3yRsYV_HSobK7KJjYtP3RAfMmjlEKZTrXsCoHSYCwZTY8zHT8P4uVqy4_InfcjGm6d3Yg9xacVYkiI57VZUMIc2CkoM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "More than $8.5 Million in Bitcoin Seized by Israeli Police – tribetica.com", "text": "Bitcoin , Bitcoin Crime , Bitcoin Regulation , Blockchain , crypto , cryptocurrency , Israel , News , News teaser , Police\nA massive anti-money laundering action has been carried out by the cyber department of the State Attorney’s Office. It filed an indictment, alleging that Hilmi Git had managed to commit more than 20,000 fraudulent transactions using Israeli credit cards, laundering the money through the Bitcoin network. 1,071 BTC Seized by Israeli Police\nHalmi Git, a resident of Hebron, has been accused of multiple offenses of credit card fraud, providing means for committing a crime, carrying out fraudulent trade activity, and laundering the proceeds through Bitcoin. It is reported that the Git managed to accumulate a total of 1,071 Bitcoin over the course of his crimes.\nAt press time, Bitcoin is trading at $7,342.21, putting the total value of Git’s fraud at a little over $7.8 million. Web of Crime\nAccording to the indictment, Git ran a network of forums and websites used to provide information on how to commit a range of computer offenses. One such forum provided is reported to have provided stolen credit card information. While entry to the forum was free, members could purchase a “VIP” membership to receive “fresh” credit card data. Git also published different guides in violation with the country’s Computers and Money Laundering Law.\nBut wait… there’s more! Reportedly, Git also ran another scam, fraudulently selling mobile phones – often members of his own forums – at substantially reduced prices.\nThe indictment describes a scheme in which Git would request that the customer transfer his money for the phone, after which point he would proceed to block the customer from the forum without ever actually having sent the customer their phone. He would go on to publish a positive feedback message on behalf of the deceived customer, expressing gratitude for the cheaper mobile phone. All Payments Made in Bitcoin\nThe Israeli State Prosecutor’s Office claims that Git had requested all the payments to be made in Bitcoin . As such, he has reportedly managed to accumulate more than 1,071 Bitcoin between 2008 and 2018.\nThe Bitcoin wallet of the accused has been seized and the funds in it are to be confiscated if and when he is found guilty of his crimes.\nThe prosecution also seeks an extension of Git’s confinement until the end of the trial due to potential flight risk as well as concerns that having access to the internet will allow Git to “continue carrying out the criminal enterprise he established over the past decade.” Given the defendant’s thoughts on his actions, the concern seems more than warranted.\nShowing no remorse whatsoever, Git was quoted as saying:\nWe are thieves, from wherever we can take money – we’ll take it, no matter where – from Israel, The US or even the moon – we will reach it and use it.\nWhat do you think will happen to those 1,071 Bitcoin if Git is found guilty?

After surging last December to around $19,500, bitcoin has declined more than 50 percent since the start of the year. On Thursday, amid increased regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency space, the coin fell yet again — this time below $8,000, where bitcoin had hovered for several weeks. Late Friday, bitcoin changed hands around $7,400.\nRegardless, Bogart said it's still a buy. In fact, he said it's the only coin traders should be buying as the coin becomes more mainstream.\nMany of the other forms of cryptocurrency, Bogart said, are \"over-promising and under-delivering. Meanwhile you have a few that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\"\nBogart recommended selling coins like Cardano, TRON, IOTA and NEO.\n\"A lot of those tokens are overvalued,\" Bogart said. \"They could be go up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.\"\nAlternatives like ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS, however, he described as \"neutral\" — and he told investors to hold for now.\nBogart said he's especially cautious with ethereum, which he said has a lot of overhang because so many initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been built on top of ethereum. He pointed out that if the ICOs don't work out, that could be bad news for the platform its built on.\nBitcoin, however, should \"at least\" end above $10,000 by the end of the year, Bogart said, but he acknowledged that the even the large-cap coin could face some headwind.\n\"But when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing,\" he said of bitcoin increasing value.\n\"Could bitcoin trade lower? Certainly,\" Bogart said. \"But do I think it will be higher a year from now?

So basically the Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited are the same nodes of the main fork of bitcoin cash? If they are different, what would that be? I find out I could install Bitcoin Cash core from these links Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited . I installed from Bitcoin Unlimited download link a minute ago, and I am trying to get my foot in the door to discover the differences by looking at the commands from bitcoin-cli help – JayB Kim Dec 1 '17 at 5:41 Yes, Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited are two implementations of nodes that connect to the Bitcoin Cash fork. – dbkeys Dec 12 '17 at 11:48 up vote 0 down vote\nI agree with you, that from a marketing standpoint, the different names used by the various implementations of the Bitcoin Cash fork are confusing.\nFirst, let's understand what a fork is. The rules about what constitutes a valid block, to be added to a blockchain, are set in the program code which miners follow. They compete to be the next to validate a transaction block and add it to the blockchain. A fork occurs when these rules are changed by some, in a way which is incompatible with the old rules. A subset of miners starts following the new rules, and the rest of the miners keep following the old rules. The result is that each group of miners starts building distinct chains which fork from a common ancestor chain. So, if someone holds coins the original common ancestor chain, those coins are now valid on both forks, and can be spent once in each fork. This is because as far as one chain is concerned, spends on the other chain are not visible - they don't exist.\nThe main difference between original Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is that the Bitcoin Cash chain allows transaction blocks to be up to 8 MiB in size, instead of being limited to 1 MiB.\nTo install the Bitcoin Cash fork, one way is with Bitcoin ABC, \"a full node implementation of the Bitcoin Cash protocol\". In other words, Bitcoin ABC follows the rules of the Bitcoin Cash fork. In the Ubuntu 16 \"Xenial Xerus\" command line: # git clone https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc.git\nThis clones the official Bitcoin-ABC repository into your machine. Instructions for installing all the pre-requisite pacakges needed to compile the programs will be in ~/bitcoin-abc/doc/build-unix.md; read this file and make sure your machine is ready for compilation: # ./autogen.sh # ./configure # make\nNote: on a mult-core CPU machine, you may use 1.5x the number of cores to speed up compilation. For example, on a 4-core machine: # make -j 6\nNow, in the ~/bitcoin-abc/src directory, after compilation, you will have the server binary: bitcoind, the client: bitcoin-cli and another binary to create, parse, or modify transactions: bitcoin-xt. For convenience, you can copy these to a folder visible to all users, such as /usr/local/bin sudo cp ~/bitcoin-abc/src/bitcoind /usr/local/bin sudo cp ~/bitcoin-abc/src/bitcoin-cli /usr/local/bin sudo cp ~/bitcoin-abc/src/bitcoin-tx /usr/local/bin\nThen, as a regular user, create the .bitcoin folder mkdir ~/.bitcoin\nand create a bitcoin.conf file vim ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf # server=1 daemon=1 listen=1 maxconnections=16 rpcuser=bitcoin.rpc rpcpassword=<some-secret-password> rpcport=12345 keypool=256 #", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://download.bitcoinabc.org/0.16.1/", "https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/download", "https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc.git"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adam", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "bitcoin unl", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T03:38:48.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91bf03a11dd52dffc1fe8bde634d92257f825a43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQlUAzC69kbPVMd1_S.Mr1k-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bad news hit bitcoin, will bitcoin die?", "title_full": "bad news hit bitcoin, will bitcoin die?", "published": "2018-05-27T02:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91bf03a11dd52dffc1fe8bde634d92257f825a43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQlUAzC69kbPVMd1_S.Mr1k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dewi91", "published": "2018-05-27T02:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "bad news hit bitcoin, will bitcoin die?", "text": "some countries have banned bitcoin but you can see that until now bitcoin still alive and of course if one more country declarate to banned bitcoin, it can't make bitcoin died but may be it will give affect to the price, if that happen I not sure bitcoin price will increase again in a short time but I pretty sure if bitcoin will still alive for a long term.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T00:31:27.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfc4a507eb81ef30072fb7e3cca214d0cca2cd90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5c2dT8Jxa4qmNBCCeKyVsE8aD9I4u5w_I_lcOVk9bYevVz3KhhgHxHPBxFvflMbLhWdUaWdhqOyqQBlwiB5nYBj71Ir.G0uXo6tg.anb8UFCBiJvgihaTC", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin [BTC] worth more than half a million dollars confiscated by Scotland Yard", "title_full": "Bitcoin [BTC] worth more than half a million dollars confiscated by Scotland Yard", "published": "2018-05-27T02:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfc4a507eb81ef30072fb7e3cca214d0cca2cd90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr5c2dT8Jxa4qmNBCCeKyVsE8aD9I4u5w_I_lcOVk9bYevVz3KhhgHxHPBxFvflMbLhWdUaWdhqOyqQBlwiB5nYBj71Ir.G0uXo6tg.anb8UFCBiJvgihaTC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-05-27T02:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin [BTC] worth more than half a million dollars confiscated by Scotland Yard", "text": "Bitcoin [BTC] worth more than half a million dollars confiscated by Scotland Yard May 27, 2018\nThe Cyber Crime Unit of Scotland Yard has confiscated Bitcoin [BTC] worth around $ 667,000 from a hacker known as Grant West. The police department has said that the crime was committed by a prolific computer hacker, which they described as the first of its kind for the 188-year-old police department.\nThe officers from the Cyber Crime Unit of Scotland Yard have caught the hacker in front of startled passengers as he was traveling first class on a train. Grant West alias ‘Courvoisier’ had launched a number of cyber-attacks on various established firms like Sainsbury’s, Asda, Argos, Uber, Bookmakers Labrokes & Coral before selling their customer information for Bitcoin worth half a million pounds. He went on fortune trip to Las Vegas with money he made from selling the customer information online.\nGrant West had managed to obtain the personal information of millions of people and credit details of more than 60,000 people through cyber hacking. Later he had sold 47,000 of the information on the ‘Dark-web’ with help of his girlfriend Rachael Brookes. He has attacked more than 100 websites of various companies.\nGrant West ran his operation from a caravan in the Ashcroft holiday park at East church and he drove around in an Audi A5 coupe worth $54,000. The Police department has found around 78 million individual usernames and passwords stored on a memory card which he possessed.\nHe has admitted to two counts of possessing criminal property, one count of money laundering using bitcoins, four charges relating to the possession and supply of cannabis, one charge of computer hacking, and two counts of conspiracy to defraud.\nGrant’s girlfriend has admitted to unauthorized use of her computer material and she was sentenced to a two-year community order and curfew at an earlier hearing at the Southwark Crown Court in coming March. Grant West has been sentenced to 10 years and eight months at Southwark Crown Court.\nDetective Chief Superintendent and head of the Met’s Organised Crime Command, Mick Gallagher has said that:\n“The case showcases the lengths our detectives need to go in order to pursue the criminals on the dark web and we have used many different measures to make sure these criminals are identified and prosecuted by the law”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "argos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant west", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sainsbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bookmakers labrokes & coral", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyber crime unit of scotland yard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T03:36:21.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d821fbf936fef407e6a66854dfe92d92c3b4880", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOArOcQc0gllXYo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown -

In this article, I am going to cover every aspect of Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology. So fasten your seatbelt and get ready for a long drive :) In this article, we are going to cover several topics such as Blockchain, types of the Blockchain , definition of cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin, P2P networking, cryptocurrency regulations around the world, Bitcoin units and workflow, Bitcoin trading and exchange, Bitcoin mining, wallets, Bitcoin forks, Bitcoin v ariations, advantages and disadvantages of using cryptocurrency. What is the Blockchain? To understand the Blockchain, let us have a look at one word - The ledger - According to the Wikipedia, a ledger is the principal book or computer file for recording and totaling economic transactions measured in terms of a monetary unit of account by account type, with debits and credits in separate columns and a beginning monetary balance and ending monetary balance for each account. So the Blockchain is a decentralized ledger which has an ability to track digital assets on the peer-to-peer network. As mentioned in the previous image, each header of a block keeps the record of an earlier block. Each block contains the financial transactions or any type of records. It is like having page numbers in a book. Each page number in a book helps us to know the previous and next page numbers in it. The Blockchain is related to cryptocurrencies, but it is not a cryptocurrency. The Blockchain runs on P2P (Peer-to-Peer) networking concept unlike your torrent downloading. Blockchain = Chain of blocks It is a chain of blocks stored on lacs of machines over the planet. It keeps the track record of any credit or debit of a digital asset. A digital asset cannot be only derived in the from money. Whatever can be tagged as a number (for example, phone, water bottle, pen, etc.) can be considered as a digital asset. In this technology, each machine on the planet will have a complete copy of a ledger. That means if I send a pen to my friend, then every computer in the world will have a copy of my this transaction activity that I sent a pen to my friend. Likewise, if two of my friends are sending money to each other, every machine including mine will have the copy of that transaction as every computer is connected in some or other way to a ledger via a P2P network. Because every computer will have the copy of a full ledger (means all transaction in the world by every individual), any single computer can verify the transaction of any two entities without involving other computers. Consider a book - Book = Blockchain, Page in book = Block, Text (data) written in the page = Blockchain Transaction Why is this type of technology so powerful? Since every block (page) keeps the record of previous and later block (page), there are certain advantages of it: - Since they are tightly bound to one another, it is nearly impossible to tamper or delete the block (page) from a blockchain (book) - It is easy to arrange blocks (pages) and identify any malicious activity is happening in it. What is cryptocurrency? It is nothing but a number of a digital token. This digital token or a number can be tracked since the day zero. This number is stored in the Blockchain ledger. This number is unique, and it is the only single copy in the world. For example, if I have 50 bitcoins and I sent 20 Bitcoins to one of my friends who has 0 Bitcoins at the moment, then the Blockchain ledger will update, and it will create the copy of this digital transaction to every computer of the world. This transaction copy stats that I can now never have 50 Bitcoins as I have already sent 20 to my friend. The number of this digital transaction is unique and single in the world. A block of a Blockchain?

Image From T rustNodes Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally are topics that can prove to be surprisingly divisive. By ‘divisive’ I’m referring not to the debate about the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies but to the idiotic, at times cult-like behaviour of many of the so-called ‘fanboys’ of the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency universe. The Last Week Tonight segment on cryptocurrencies and their potential demonstrates this behaviour perfectly in the form of the possibly fictional but also all-too-real example of ‘Dan’, your office colleague who can’t stop ranting on about how Bitcoin ‘is the future, man’ and how he can’t wait to ‘hodl’ down some Ethereum before the price ‘moons’ and they become a ‘Bitcoin billionaire’ of sorts. In spite of these rather off-putting antics, people shouldn’t simply write off Bitcoin, Blockchain and the cryptocurrency phenomenon more generally. Yes, these fanboys are the economic and financial sector equivalent to those annoyingly off-putting die-hard Rick and Morty fans that basically ruin any enjoyment I could take away from the show, but discount cryptocurrencies at your peril. As many have rightly pointed out, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally represent a shift in how society and individuals view and value currency and the philosophy behind transactions, whilst the Blockchain technology that supports them has the potential to revolutionise trade and create a truly mutual marketplace through the removal the need for a ‘middle man’ in the form of a bank. Indeed, on social media you will find many who are hailing the rise of Blockchain and the various cryptocurrencies that litter the corners of the internet as something that could radically decentralise banking and eliminate the need for banking institutions altogether. The Need to Shift the Cryptocurrency Discourse This piece however shall not focus on the financial side of the cryptocurrency phenomenon. That has been and will continue to be debated on many a message board and Facebook comments section. Indeed, it is precisely those type of pieces — most especially those so-called ‘hot takes’ on Twitter — that usually only ended up alienating many people (including the so-called ‘normie’ writing this) from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when they first began to really take off. The language of ‘mooning’ and ‘hodl’ came off as childishly ridiculous, whilst any criticism of Bitcoin — for example the fact it could represent another ‘ tulip mania ’ phenomenon — was jumped upon and attacked without a second thought; in other words, the whole cryptocurrency sector appeared to be one huge cult rather than something to be taken seriously by both experts and the masses more generally. There is a whole other side to cryptocurrencies and Blockchain that both the critics and the fanboys forget: How Bitcoin’s decentralised nature lends itself to agorism through its ability to undermine the oppressive and bureaucratic state apparatus, freeing people to pursue enterprise in the face of mounting red-tape, or help their families survive in the face of violent statist incursions. Down With Chávez, Down With Maduro: Cryptocurrency-Based Agorism in Venezuela Venezuela, a country that seems like it has been in perpetual crisis mode since 2013 , serves as the perfect example of this. The country has seen inflation skyrocket to around 18,000% with basic foodstuffs like bread and oil, as well as sanitary products and medical supplies all dwindling to the point people can queue for hours on end and yet receive nothing but empty platitudes from state officials who promise the ‘revolution’ will continue under the guise of Chavez’s anointed successor, Nicolas Maduro. Despite Maduro and his statist colleagues blaming the US and vaguely-defined ‘imperialism’ for the socioeconomic crisis Venezuela finds itself in the midst of, the real cause of the country’s turmoil is its lack of some form of open, free-market economy; the state controls nearly all enterprises in Venezuela, and sees things like private control of business as antithetical to the ‘revolution’ and signs of capitalist imperialism. Don’t get me wrong, I’m as opposed to imperialism and pointless US forays into foreign lands as much as the next sensible person, but Venezuela’s economic collapse is arguably one of the few instances in which the US has played little part in the collapse of a foreign social or economic order. Image From Foreign Policy As a result of Maduro’s selfish paranoia, the Venezuelan people have unsurprisingly resorted to drastic measures. Reports of an angry mob breaking into a zoo to eat a horse did the rounds on social media, whilst a recent Last Week Tonight episode revealed that protesters have resorted to using human faeces to create makeshift molotov — or to quote the show’s host, John Oliver, ‘Poop-otov’ — cocktails due to gasoline shortages. Where does Bitcoin fit into this mess? In the form of undermining the country’s currency controls. In what has to be noted as an inspired example of agorism, some Venezuelans have taken to the internet and began to mine Bitcoin in order to pay for goods imported from abroad. The state’s currency controls prevent individuals doing this through state-sanctioned, so-called ‘official’ measures, but Bitcoin and its decentralised nature allow individuals to actively bypass such controls and import much-needed foodstuffs and other basic goods freely by trading the cryptocurrency for real-world Bolivars , with much of the goods coming largely from American port cities in Florida like Miami. This hasn’t stopped the state from doing what it does best: Intervening and oppressing. Maduro and the state police have cracked down on Bitcoin mining since the end of last year, arresting miners on trumped up false charges such as trafficking contraband and undermining the so-called ‘revolution’. In spite of these incursions however, cryptocurrency mining and the real-world humanitarian benefits it brings to those who can grapple with (the largely state-enforced) power outages continue, allowing them not only to be free from pointless currency controls but also free from an oppressive state that has since around 2012 sought to only violate their civil and economic liberties. Breaking The Bureaucrats: Cryptocurrency & The Pursuit of Enterprise in Brazil Image From The Irish Times Brazil is another example that often gets overlooked by both Bitcoin fanboys and detractors alike. The country has one of the most corrupt, overbearing and economically controlling governments in not only Latin America but also the world, ranking 153rd in the world for economic freedom in the latest study by the free-market Heritage Foundation think-tank and both its former and current presidents facing charges of economic corruption and mismanagement . That may surprise you, given that in your school days, Brazil had often been touted by economics and development scholars as an ‘economy on the rise’ and part of the ‘BRIC’ group of countries that were going to economically explode over the next ten or so years! What you may find even more surprising is that according to the same Heritage study, countries like Ukraine (currently in the midst of a civil conflict), Belarus (noted for being Europe’s last dictatorship) and Haiti (you know, the country rocked by a devastating earthquake and corruption), are all economically freer than Brazil. It seems then the free-flowing nature of Brazilian soccer or salsa dancing hasn’t translated into its economic policy. Import tariffs can be abnormally high — upwards of sixty percent depending on the product — thus harming both businesses and consumers who wish to trade and buy from abroad, whilst in comparison to most other developed countries, setting up a business and obtaining all the right permits can take upwards of eighty-three days (in the US for example, Reason notes it can take only up to eight days). Where cryptocurrencies and Blockchain come into this is rather interesting. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies like BitCoin undermines the centralised, overbearing banking system currently present in Brazil, whilst Blockchain is allowing entrepreneurs and business owners to circumvent the organs of the state apparatus and bureaucracy , most especially the country’s notary service that all businesses are required to ‘liaise with’ whenever a new transaction or trade is going to lodged. Instead of having to go through the time consuming process of having to provide birth certificates, titles and contracts to be verified, a company called OriginalMy allows traders, consumers and business owners to upload encrypted copies of important documents — secure in the Blockchain architecture — that are easily retrievable and allow for the authenticity of a document to be verified by comparing it to the copy of the original stored online. Concluding Thoughts In spite of these ingenious examples above, where there is enterprise and freedom there will inevitably be an encroaching state looking to regulate it. Again, don’t get me wrong, regulation is a necessary evil and if enforced properly can both protect consumers and enhance market freedom. The problem is in places like Brazil and Venezuela, the state isn’t simply looking to regulate , it is looking to shut down cryptocurrency markets altogether. However, as has been pointed out both in this piece and elsewhere, how successful the state will be at ‘banning Bitcoin’ and cryptocurrencies more generally is another thing entirely; as Rodrigo Souza, the founder of SurBitcoin, a Venezuelan based cryptocurrency trading platform, stated when Maduro’s regime began to crack down on Bitcoin miners, “ people haven’t stopped mining, they’ve just gone deeper underground ”. Bitcoin, Blockchain and the whole host of other cryptocurrencies and related media have a real shot at not simply being the ‘next big thing’ as their acolytes incessantly seem to preach. They actually can help change peoples lives for the better through circumventing oppressive state bureaucracies and structures in inspired acts of cryptocurrency-based agorism. If those same acolytes, the Rick and Morty superfans of the economics world, could actually put down their phones, stop Tweeting about what is about to ‘moon’ or what people should ‘hodl’ on to, and actually present how cryptocurrencies can change lives for the better, then maybe more people like me — former sceptics and detractors — could actually begin to take Bitcoin more seriously and see it as a viable economic tool for change as opposed to the plaything of white boys consigned to the corners of their parents’ basement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

The cryptocurrency company told clients they would earn substantial returns starting with two percent per day, to 14 percent a week, and eventually 50 percent in a month.\nOn BTC Global's website , they stated that they suspended their services. The note on the site lists Steven Twain as the company's \"primary trader.\" The website also stated that \"until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.\" The admin team left Steven's contact details. While Reuters reached out to Twain's email address, they received no response.\nSouth African police mentioned that \"members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global. Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.\"\nMore important is the fact that BTC Global had already scammed cryptocurrency investors for more than $50 million by March 2018. Related reports indicated that investors \"should have seen that BTC Global was a scam from a mile away\" since their unusually high returns are similar to other cryptocurrency scams like Bitconnect .\n\"This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they've lost money,\" said Yolisa Matakata, a police investigator on the BTC Global Case.\nBTC Global Suspends Services According to the BTC Global website , the \"payment info was sent to Steven Twain on Sunday 18 February 2018 as has been done by the admin team each week since last year. Steven did not acknowledge receipt of the information. Steven has not contacted anyone in leadership or admin team. No payments have been made by Steven. The admin team cannot locate him. If anyone has any information on how we can get in contact with him, please get in touch and let us know.\"\n\"We are as shocked and angry as everyone. But we all knew the risks involved in placing funds with Steven. We all became complacent with Steven. And all of us funded him independently.\"\nA reported 27,000 people were scammed in the heist. While many South Africans were involved, there are reports of other international victims from the United States and Australia. South Africans did, however, lose between 16,000 to 1.4 million rands ($1,280 to $112,000).\nDo Your Due Diligence While many cryptocurrency scams can be very convincing, even novice investors should have been privy to all the red flags on BTC Global's website. By bringing back an archived version, Mybroadband , a regional technology news site, deconstructed the website. They commented that the extremely high returns, referral commissions, and poor web design were factors retail investors should have noted before investing in the company.\n( Source : Mybroadband )\nFurthermore, the fact that BTC Global only has one image of their \"master trader\" drinking a vanilla milkshake is a far cry from any sort of financial legitimacy. There is also very little information online concerning Twain's background knowledge and trading experience.\nThe post South African Authorities Investigate $80 million Bitcoin Scam appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T01:24:45.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1d7fa30279630ce82263fe0fcf7ebacc31d1550", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstwaO1cbxDVWhHE.Sh8wRDM9e1R5gpttJs7So00HvUwjOuokkij6XDvMcu1q0UPxrCLb8XnDpM4jhVByTfttJWE3DQyuulD7TrocAyeiLIQ--", "site_full": "sinister.ly", "site": "sinister.ly", "site_section": "https://www.sinister.ly/syndication.php", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "Sinisterly - All Forums", "title": "Earn crypto with Free4faucet - Bitcoin Faucet | Dogecoin Faucet", "title_full": "Earn crypto with Free4faucet - Bitcoin Faucet | Dogecoin Faucet", "published": "2018-05-27T01:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "LY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1d7fa30279630ce82263fe0fcf7ebacc31d1550", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstwaO1cbxDVWhHE.Sh8wRDM9e1R5gpttJs7So00HvUwjOuokkij6XDvMcu1q0UPxrCLb8XnDpM4jhVByTfttJWE3DQyuulD7TrocAyeiLIQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T01:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn crypto with Free4faucet - Bitcoin Faucet | Dogecoin Faucet", "text": "Earn crypto with Free4faucet - Bitcoin Faucet | Dogecoin Faucet 5 hours ago #1 Earn crypto with Free4faucet - Bitcoin Faucet | Dogecoin Faucet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dogecoin faucet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T06:46:11.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc665b59e87ef5162148c58767e706a8b98451f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBKRLOJ.yiJRZ_X0QhGHLUqR1mIr5KBWbStCuiSOwEW_yrHmXv7t_ytR4_CNdA5cQOY5kZcS5w3LS0-", "site_full": "anynote.co", "site": "anynote.co", "site_section": "https://anynote.co/rss/?id=1", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Latest Blogs", "title": "New Event ICO Event London.

Xapo dominates the institutional cryptocurrency market and is the go-to provider for Bitcoin custodial and security services. The activation of SegWit by Xapo is directly responsible for the rapid rise in the percentage of SegWit transactions on the Bitcoin network this month; there has been a spike from 29% to 38% in just the last 2 weeks.\nBitcoin implemented SegWit via a soft fork on 24 August 2017. A soft fork is similar to a hard fork in the sense that it changes the set of rules used to create blocks, but it is different because it is backward-compatible , older versions of the Bitcoin software are able to recognize blocks produced by the new software. This avoids the problem of a blockchain split that often occurs during hard forks if a significant number of users don’t upgrade their software, which can result in losses of cryptocurrency, and therefore soft forks are much safer for the network’s health.\nSegWit provides a solution for the Bitcoin block size problem. It changes the definition of a block size from 1 million bytes to 1 million units. It separates signature data, i.e. witness data, from the Merkle Tree and puts it after the end of the transaction data. The witness data only counts as 1/4 of a unit , effectively increasing the block size to 1.8 MB from 1 MB. This allows more transactions to fit into a block and reduces transaction fees, making Bitcoin more scalable and improving its usefulness as a currency.\nAnother important thing that SegWit accomplishes is it fixes the transaction malleability problem. In the old Bitcoin protocol a receiver could change the transaction ID and scam the sender into sending more Bitcoin since the original transaction ID would no longer appear on the blockchain. SegWit moves signatures out of the transaction ID, making it impossible to change the transaction ID. This removal of transaction malleability is a crucial step for making the Bitcoin Lightning Network safe.\nDue to the improvements that SegWit provides over the old Bitcoin protocol, its increasing use is a positive step towards Bitcoin becoming a widely used global currency.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bitcoinist.com/segwit-now-comprises-almost-half-bitcoin-transactions/", "https://t.me/bconews", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SegWit", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-wallet-xapo-implements-scaling-solution-segwit/", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://transactionfee.info/charts/payments/segwit", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem#Soft_fork", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "xapo bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T05:36:21.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c5e1e8f20a196d4d1a67ec67242c4fff4fdcc60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRYmOwTRa77Uz6kdXl0sUw0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=217.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Collectibles", "title": "[AUCTION] 0.10 Bitcoin Low serial #18 [ENDING!]", "title_full": "[AUCTION] 0.10 Bitcoin Low serial #18 [ENDING!]", "published": "2018-05-27T01:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1c5e1e8f20a196d4d1a67ec67242c4fff4fdcc60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRYmOwTRa77Uz6kdXl0sUw0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bavicrypto", "published": "2018-05-27T01:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "[AUCTION] 0.10 Bitcoin Low serial #18 [ENDING!]", "text": "Quote: from: Hox on May 26, 2018, 01:49:42 AM Quote: from: bavicrypto on May 25, 2018, 11:31:50 PM Quote: from: polymerbit on May 20, 2018, 11:38:44 AM\nStarting Bid: 0.0025 BTC\nMin.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin…”\nby Michael Snyder of The Economic Collapse Blog\nTaxation and regulation are weapons, and governments often use these weapons to target things that they do not like. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin threaten to shatter the existing paradigm of financial control that the elite have carefully crafted, and that is making government officials all over the planet very nervous. So the latest rumblings about “government crackdowns” on cryptocurrencies in China and India shouldn’t come as any sort of a surprise. Those two governments hate anything that even smells like freedom, and so it was only a matter of time before they pulled the trigger. And the bigger the cryptocurrency bubble becomes, the more national governments around the world are likely to take action to “get it under control”.\nThe reason why I have always been so cautious when it comes to cryptocurrencies is because government intervention is the ever-present elephant in the room. At any time big national governments can step in and ruin the party, and that now appears to be happening in China and India. The following comes from TruNews … China, arguably the biggest market for cryptocurrencies as many citizens aim to avoid the government-controlled economy, recently released a report that showed more than 400 fake cryptos occupying its domestic marketplace. In response the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology signaled it’s going to crack down hard , citing “certain risks that cannot be ignored” with initial coin offerings, pyramid schemes, and fraud. Simultaneous to that bit of bad news, CoinTelegraph reported the Central Board of Indirect Taxes in India is considering an 18 percent tax on cryptocurrency exchanges , deeming the digital currencies as “intangible goods.” Last month the Reserve Bank of India formally banned domestic banks from servicing any cryptocurrency business but that failed to ebb the increase in new exchanges in its marketplace.\nLet’s talk about India first. As I mentioned earlier, taxation is a weapon, and a massive 18 percent tax is being proposed on all cryptocurrency trading…\nThe Indian government is in talks of levying an 18% tax on cryptocurrency trading. The knowledge allegedly comes from people with a direct knowledge of the matter.\nThe news, as reported by Bloomberg, states that cryptocurrencies could be taxed pending their declaration as intangible goods. Even as they are on par with software with respect to their classifications, the source added that their use in illegal activities would have to be regulated using other laws.\nThe proposal is currently under consideration by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs and will be submitted to the GST Council after its finalization for approval.\nNeedless to say, such a tax would absolutely devastate the emerging cryptocurrency industry in India.\nIn China, in addition to cracking down on “fraud”, the government has also come out with a list of their preferred cryptocurrencies …\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information technology of China has decided to release its own ranking sheet, in which it created a list of 28 cryptos. The cryptos were ranked according to three criteria, which include technology, application, as well as innovation.\nAccording to China, the best crypto seems to be Ethereum (ETH), which is dominating the list. It is closely followed by Steem and Lisk, as well as Neo and Komodo . These five are also making the top 5 according to China. It is surprising that Komodo managed to rank this high since it is a lesser-known platform that holds the 58th place according to market cap. Another one that stands out from the rest is Steem, which does not allow for creating smart contracts, while the rest of them do.\nIt turns out that Bitcoin was only number 13 on the list.\nAt least China is not banning cryptocurrencies yet, which many feared that they might do. Cryptos have become wildly popular in China, and even though the Chinese government is one of the most repressive regimes on the entire planet, at least they are trying to be at least somewhat reasonable in this case.\nOf course all of this troubling news was going to have a major impact on cryptocurrency prices, and on Wednesday we witnessed quite a bloodbath …\nDigital currencies were in free fall Wednesday, with some major coins in the red by more than 10%.\nBitcoin, the world’s biggest digital currency, fell through $8,000 late Tuesday and the slide has not abated. Bitcoin tumbled to a multiweek low of $7,442.92. Bounces have been limited, with a single coin last worth $7,528.89, down 7.1% from late Tuesday Eastern U.S. levels on the Kraken exchange.\nThe collapse in cryptocurrencies has seen the total value of all coins fall to $326 billion, down some $50 billion in just 72 hours, according to Coinmarketcap.\nOverall, the value of all cryptocurrencies has fallen nearly 500 billion dollars from a peak of 820 billion dollars in January.\nThat is not just a crash – that is a cataclysm.\nHowever, it is important to note that cryptocurrencies are still way, way up from where they were a year ago at this time.\nSo those that got in early are still big winners.\nAnd there are many that believe that cryptos will do extremely well during a “flight to safety” during the next great economic crisis. Omid Malekan, the author of a new book entitled The Story of the Blockchain: A Beginner’s Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands , is entirely convinced that many will view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as very safe alternatives when a coming crisis forces national governments to impose draconian capital controls … Government officials don’t like cryptocoins because they transfer the sovereignty of money from their control to a decentralized consensus mechanism, a transfer that they view as a downgrade in the quality of money. If our existing system of money and banking was always stable, they would have a point. But every time there is a crisis , it reminds the public that the folks in charge are not as smart as they think they are. When those same leaders respond to the crisis with draconian capital controls (or selective bailouts for their once and future employers on Wall Street) they remind the public that they aren’t as fair as they think they are, either. Bitcoin might be volatile and hard to understand, but it’s always fair, because math does not discriminate, nor does it change the rules when people start to panic.\nIn addition, it is very interesting to note that the Rothschild banking dynasty also appears to be investing very heavily in the cryptocurrency industry …\n“In February, it became known that the Tether accounts of Bitfinex were opened in the Dutch bank ING, owned by The Rothschild Group. At the same time, the profit indicators of this bank have grown significantly. On February 26th, the Fintech company, Circle, the main shareholder of which is Goldman Sachs (also The Rothschild Group), acquired Poloniex , a US-based crypto exchange”, – Zycrypto states.\nIt has recently come to light that not only Rothschilds dynasty invest in cryptocurrency, they are actively preparing several projects of their own. Private discussions have been sparked among large cryptocurrency investors following the leak which subsequently flowed into the open crypto community. One of the Rothschild’s projects name has emerged: IMMO. As Coindoo writes “… the implementation of IMMO is being monitored by Alexandre de Rothschild himself”.\nDo they know something that the rest of us do not?\nIn the end, the debate over cryptocurrencies will rage on. The skeptics will continue to point out that cryptos have no intrinsic value and that national governments can end the party any time that they wish. And advocates will continue to point out that government intervention has not ruined the party so far, and that some national governments and some big financial institutions are actually embracing the cryptocurrency revolution.\nUltimately the jury is still out on whether or not this revolution will be successful, and it will be fascinating to see how everything plays out.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://komodoplatform.com/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-slumps-below-8000-and-the-worst-is-yet-to-come-says-one-analyst-2018-05-23", "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/business/ben-bernanke-will-work-with-citadel-a-hedge-fund-as-an-adviser.html", "https://amzn.to/2IMxgGo", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis", "http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-fed-conflicts-hurt-ability-to-regulate-wall-street-banks-2018-3", "https://ambcrypto.com/18-tax-crypto-indian-government-considers-regulation-ban/", "https://globalcoinreport.com/chinese-govt-ranks-cryptos-eth-is-number-one-btc-at-13th-spot/", "https://themerkle.com/top-6-countries-enforcing-capital-controls/", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "https://medium.com/@omid.malekan/can-bitcoin-become-a-flight-to-quality-asset-c74d9984b7ea", "https://www.coinspeaker.com/2018/05/23/what-is-rothschilds-immo/", "http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/government-crackdowns-in-china-and-india-threaten-to-absolutely-crush-the-cryptocurrency-bubble", "https://www.trunews.com/stream/china-india-crush-cryptos", "https://zycrypto.com/circle-spreading-like-wildfire-after-poloniex-acquisition/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-20/digital-exchange-bitfinex-under-u-s-scrutiny-gets-ing-account", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael snyder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crackdowns in china & india", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cryptos government crackdowns in china & india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T01:05:23.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69a09c1cb4d8d1da6f49dcbb9e4eadfa9fa151bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54G3WVIEz9tN6Ce.a.I7CDi74vEtYafc4tVmPIQ.VaUWWGdUo9neurj6TGcPsbiUrWwfdiitz8pM209q4JbRRIZ1L3pPWvtpclHQ5CqGOnZSwhjHdc9V9jo0-", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "http://www.xbt.money/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "XBT.MONEY", "title": "Boom or Bust: There is no Middle Ground for Bitcoin, Says Crypto Asset Manager", "title_full": "Boom or Bust: There is no Middle Ground for Bitcoin, Says Crypto Asset Manager", "published": "2018-05-27T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-5-26-Historical-Snapshot-May-26-2013-CoinMarketCap-660x294.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69a09c1cb4d8d1da6f49dcbb9e4eadfa9fa151bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54G3WVIEz9tN6Ce.a.I7CDi74vEtYafc4tVmPIQ.VaUWWGdUo9neurj6TGcPsbiUrWwfdiitz8pM209q4JbRRIZ1L3pPWvtpclHQ5CqGOnZSwhjHdc9V9jo0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xbt.money", "published": "2018-05-27T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Boom or Bust: There is no Middle Ground for Bitcoin, Says Crypto Asset Manager", "text": "News teaser\nOn the subject of Bitcoin’s viability, there seem to only two conclusions. Either the number one crypto is either here to stay or it is just a fad. Thus, whether you support the “ bubble ” argument, the “ currency of the future ” notion or any other position, it all inevitably leads to the “boom or bust” conclusion or at least, so says Grayscale Investments managing director Michael Sonnenshein. Two Mutually Exclusive Bitcoin Future Outcomes\nAccording to Sonnenshein, there is no middle ground as far as Bitcoin is concerned. Speaking during a recent interview with Fortune , the cryptoanalyst said :\nAs we begin to look at assets like Bitcoin and the unbelievable adversity it’s faced over the last ten years, every day that Bitcoin doesn’t go away, every day that Bitcoin overcomes a new challenge, for me that makes me feel that Bitcoin will do either one of two things.\nIt will either survive and become all these amazing things that we think it can be, which will cause its price to be a lot higher. Or it is possible something else may come along that will displace it and Bitcoin goes to zero. It likely will have a binary outcome.\nTo emphasize the point, consider the image above. Those were the top ten cryptocurrencies exactly five years ago as cataloged by CoinMarketCap. How many of them do you recognize? Now compare with the image below and see that only Bitcoin and Litecoin are still in the top ten. Where did the others go? Well, Freicoin isn’t even in the top 1,000 coins. Namecoin and Peercoin have also fallen spectacularly over the years as have the others on the list. Bitcoin Should Be Able to Adapt\nThe critical question is where does Bitcoin’s destiny lie? Sonnenshein believes there is hope for the digital currency as long as there are continued improvements upon the technology. The managing director of Grayscale investments said that Bitcoin’s future is tied to its ability to remain relevant in the emerging digital currency landscape which it has historically dominated right from the outset.\nBitcoin does have one crucial advantage – it is an open source protocol. Thus, if a paradigm-shifting technological breakthrough emerges, it should be easy to incorporate at least some aspects of it into the network.\nWhere do you stand on the boom/bust debate? Do you think Bitcoin can adapt to changes in the crypto ecosystem?

Fiat is the biggest scam that I can't help to get rid of. I was debating on buying Gold and BCH but ended up buying just BCH, I smell a different future for Gold since 2009.\nI have to admit that leaving fiat is scary, I've felt that every purchase of Gold I've been doing over the years. The level of brainwashing is so huge that you really feel scary of leaving your scam coin. It feels so weird to have so much crypto in comparison to your beloved token—Euros in my case.\nYour thoughts?\n submitted by /u/Maesitos\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T22:16:25.072+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 19408, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=12800", "requestsLeft": 534}
