Bitcoin Miners Do the Selling\nAccording to independent research boutique Fundstrat, which provides market strategy and sector research, the bitcoin mining boom could potentially send the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization to upwards of $64,000 USD by the end of 2019. States the company’s head of research, Sam Doctor, in a report:\nWe believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range.\nBitcoin is infamously volatile, creating FOMOers and naysayers on what feels like a weekly basis. Nevertheless, Fundstrat believes the economics behind bitcoin mining create key support levels — since bitcoin miners are less likely to sell their rewards during market downturns, and more likely to cash out during bull runs. Explained Doctor in a conference call to CNBC on Thursday:\nThe primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors. We believe breakeven mining costs provide a support level for $BTC , as #miners – main natural #Crypto sellers – reduce selling at low $BTCUSD price. Based on expected computing hashpower and breakeven cost growth, that could imply #Bitcoin price of $36,000 by 2019 year end. pic.twitter.com/CVwIWNz8Lr\n— Sam Doctor (@fundstratQuant) May 10, 2018\nFundstrat has estimated that the current cash break-even price Antminer S7 models is $6,003 USD per bitcoin. The newer and more powerful Antminer S9 , however, features a much lower break-even point at $2,368 USD. Both popular pieces of bitcoin mining hardware are manufactured by Bitmain, which boasted an operating profit between 3 billion USD to 4 billion USD in 2017. Doctor said:\nThe release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.

At the time of that prediction, bitcoin was trading at $2,540.

Several sources said that number would be “a good approximation”– though the price can still be volatile.\nInterestingly enough, with its reputation unmatched by other firms, Xapo has in effect created something more than just a bitcoin vault. It’s essentially the first private bank for rich bitcoiners.\nBecause in addition to its security offerings, Xapo also provides customers with a bitcoin debit card and access to a bitcoin trading desk.\nAlready, the company’s holdings – which constitute roughly 7% of the global bitcoin supply – are higher than 98% of the 5,670 banks in the US.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nFounded by Argentine entrepreneur and PayPal board member Wences Casares, who is widely credited with turning the Valley’s VC billionaires on to bitcoin, the company has amassed a network of underground vaults, including a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nThanks to Cesares’ reputation, Xapo has managed to attract venture investments from some of the Valley’s biggest names, including LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reed Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who is, of course, is in the process of setting up his own crypto “merchant bank” that might end up competing with Xapo.\nIt also has relationships with major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\nXapo’s clients aren’t limited to wealthy individuals. First Block Capital, one of Canada’s first registered crypto firms, chose Xapo to be its custodian – the first sign that the institutional market for crypto custody could some day dwarf Xapo’s private business.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nTo pursue institutional investors, Xapo President Ted Rogers hired Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group and Royal Bank of Scotland Group, to oversee outreach to pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\nThe perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nHowever, there’s one factor that could limit Xapo’s growth, particularly as the crypto market outside of bitcoin grows (assuming the alt-coin universe hasn’t already reached its zenith). The company only works with bitcoin because of Cesares’ belief that it alone will succeed.\nFor everybody who’s not wealthy enough (or too cheap) to pay a third party for an elaborate private-storage scheme, individuals can always store their private keys – the tool that gives them access to their bitcoin – on a hard drive that’s air-gapped from the Internet.\nOf course, no solution is 100% safe from hackers and thieves. And at the end of the day, that reality might be enough to indefinitely stave off the “mainstream adoption” that bitcoiners say is just around the corner.

By Alex Kimani - May 11, 2018, 1:45 PM CDT\nDoes Bitcoin go up or down when stocks climb and vice-versa?\nThe subject of how bitcoin prices are affected by stock movements has fascinated traders since the digital coin gained media attention a couple of years ago. A bitcoin/stocks indicator would be ideal for traders looking to predict the direction of one market or the other.\nIn the early days of bitcoin, daily traded volumes and the overall market were too small compared to the then-$15-trillion stock market. As expected, the correlation between the pair was too weak to be of any significance.\nA Back and Forth Story\nBut then bitcoin finally exploded in 2016/2017, with the market cap growing nearly 45 times bigger.\nYet, bitcoin's relationship with stocks has remained very volatile and inconclusive.\nIt hit an all-time low of -0.15 in November 2017 before climbing to zero in early 2018 then shooting to 0.3 in February. In February, the correlation between bitcoin and stocks remained high with daily percent returns of the leading cryptocurrency and the S&P 500 clocking in at a respectable 33 percent on a 90-day basis. A correlation score of 1 indicates perfect correlation, zero indicates no correlation while -1 is perfect inverse correlation.\nThe long-run average on a 90-day correlation for the pair has been -1 percent--a very weak negative correlation.\nThe correlation between bitcoin and gold has also been erratic just like that between bitcoin and stocks. The one-year rolling correlation between gold and bitcoin returns was mostly positive up until 2015 when it turned negative with a reading of 0.14 during the positive period and -0.2 during the down-leg.\nBitcoin/Stocks = Gold/Interest Rates\nThere's a widely held view that rate hikes are a natural enemy for gold prices, with many investors mistakenly believing that higher interest rates mean lower gold prices and vice-versa.\nThe reasoning here is that rate hikes lead to money flowing from zero-yield investments like gold to high-yielding ones like bonds. Related: Bitcoin Falls After Failing To Break Key Resistance\nYet, the correlation between gold prices and nominal interest rates from 1970-2016 reveals that gold performs equally well during rate-hiking cycles and rate-cutting cycles, with the former lasting 10 months, while the latter lasts 14 months on average.\n(Click to enlarge)\nSource: GoldMoney\nIn fact, gold prices were moving sharply higher in the late 1970s and early 1980s at a time of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed. Curiously, gold did better during periods of rate hikes than rate cuts by climbing 4.85 percent in hiking-cycles compared to 4.0 percent during cutting-cycles.\n(Click to enlarge)\nSource: GoldMoney\nThat's the case because interest rates are just one of several key drivers of gold prices, the others being inflation and changes in central bank holdings.\nThe same reasoning can be applied to the relationship between bitcoin and stocks. Both assets sometimes do show near-perfect correlation.\nRelated: Asian Markets Up On High Oil Prices And Weak Dollar\nFor example, this author has a hypothesis that bitcoin and the Dow Jones are positively correlated. According to the author, the two climbed in near-lockstep on May 4 because institutional traders were using both bitcoin and stocks in carry trades i.e. using cheap money from the Fed to purchase higher-yielding bitcoin and stocks.\nSource: Forbes\nThe author argues that The Dow Jones can be used as a leading indicator for bitcoin in times when excessive liquidity is injected into the markets.\nBut it's just as intriguing to find that the pair showed marked divergence just a few days later, with the Dow continuing its climb, while bitcoin has tanked:\nDow Jones 5-Day Change", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/05/08/bitcoin-price-is-correlated-to-stocks/#4b1f8fd64072"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex kimani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T02:47:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87175890c96d1de38c29478f09bff1f831055b55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTYGs7QS5_Im.iCCSSgz6Bw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "in 2020 wich one will be higher bitcoin or ethereum ?", "title_full": "in 2020 wich one will be higher bitcoin or ethereum ?", "published": "2018-05-12T01:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87175890c96d1de38c29478f09bff1f831055b55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTYGs7QS5_Im.iCCSSgz6Bw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "martinrep", "published": "2018-05-12T01:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "in 2020 wich one will be higher bitcoin or ethereum ?", "text": "It is very difficult to predict such things.

bitcoins sitting in underground bunkers owned by wealth-management startup Xapo has been the subject of intense speculation ever since the company first allowed journalists into the catacombs where the family offices of the world’s wealthiest people stash their digital gold.\nNow, Bloomberg – after conversations with two purported clients – has produced a figure: Somewhere around $10 billion. Several sources said that number would be “a good approximation” – though the price can still be volatile.\nInterestingly enough, with its reputation unmatched by other firms, Xapo has in effect created something more than just a bitcoin vault. It’s essentially the first private bank for rich bitcoiners.\nBecause in addition to its security offerings, Xapo also provides customers with a bitcoin debit card and access to a bitcoin trading desk.\nAlready, the company’s holdings – which constitute roughly 7% of the global bitcoin supply – are higher than 98% of the 5,670 banks in the US.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nFounded by Argentine entrepreneur and PayPal board member Wences Casares, who is widely credited with turning the Valley’s VC billionaires on to bitcoin, the company has amassed a network of underground vaults, including a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nThanks to Cesares’ reputation, Xapo has managed to attract venture investments from some of the Valley’s biggest names, including LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reed Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who is, of course, is in the process of setting up his own crypto “merchant bank” that might end up competing with Xapo.\nIt also has relationships with major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\nXapo’s clients aren’t limited to wealthy individuals. First Block Capital, one of Canada’s first registered crypto firms, chose Xapo to be its custodian – the first sign that the institutional market for crypto custody could some day dwarf Xapo’s private business.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nTo pursue institutional investors, Xapo President Ted Rogers hired Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group and Royal Bank of Scotland Group, to oversee outreach to pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\nThe perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nHowever, there’s one factor that could limit Xapo’s growth, particularly as the crypto market outside of bitcoin grows (assuming the alt-coin universe hasn’t already reached its zenith). The company only works with bitcoin because of Cesares’ belief that it alone will succeed.\nFor everybody who’s not wealthy enough (or too cheap) to pay a third party for an elaborate private-storage scheme, individuals can always store their private keys – the tool that gives them access to their bitcoin – on a hard drive that’s air-gapped from the Internet.\nOf course, no solution is 100% safe from hackers and thieves. And at the end of the day, that reality might be enough to indefinitely stave off the “mainstream adoption” that bitcoiners say is just around the corner.\nvia RSS Read More Here..

Here is a verifiable proof that \"Electrum Pro\", a fake version of @ElectrumWallet , is in fact Bitcoin-stealing malware: https://t.co/FvhkTp29wI\n— Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) May 9, 2018\nDespite protests to the contrary, Electrum Pro clearly intended to trick users into believing that it was an upgraded version of the official wallet. In addition to utilizing a similar domain name, Electrum Pro’s logo and website content gave the impression that the two projects were connected.\nFrom an archived version of the Electrum Pro website:\n“Electrum has been securing payments since 2011and is one of the most popular Bitcoin wallets. ElectrumPro is free software, released using the MIT license. Anyone can run an Electrum server. No single entity controls the network.”\nAdditionally, an advertisement for the copycat website ranked first in Google searches for “Electrum,” which likely diverted many would-be users away from the official website and to its doppelganger.\nThe website has now been taken down and replaced with a message from potentially-pseudonymous Electrum Pro creator Lucas Lofgren.\nLofgren accuses the official Electrum of slandering his project’s reputation and says he and his team have decided to move onto other projects He added that he will sell the electrum.com domain for 25 BTC, worth roughly $215,000 at the current exchange rate.\n“Due to false accusations from electrum.org, they have ruined our reputation and brand of Electrum Pro. They managed to trick several news outlets to slander us,” Lofgren wrote. “We decided to go our seperate (sic) ways to work on different projects. Our domain ELECTRUM.COM is for sale now with a price of 25BTC, non-negotiable.”\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ElectrumWallet/status/994203725429460993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/FvhkTp29wI", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://twitter.com/ElectrumWallet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "electrum pro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "electrum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T01:52:53.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99e32c564013034119dd22932a7efa5e9beefb06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqWysYLz4r.o5FtIRNm41PeP8-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-12T01:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "99e32c564013034119dd22932a7efa5e9beefb06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqWysYLz4r.o5FtIRNm41PeP8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T01:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 11.

The Segwit extension implemented last year brought some relief to clogged mempools and astronomical transaction fees, but nowhere near enough to solve Bitcoin’s scaling problem. The plan to double the block size after Segwit (known as Segwit2x) was abandoned after it became clear that the majority of the miners were not going to support it. After all, as The Economist presciently pointed out some months previously, they had no incentive to do so. To make matters worse, the Bitcoin community has divided into two factions, apparently permanently. A hard fork in August 2017 gave each faction its own coin. The newcomer trades as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), while the continuing chain trades as Bitcoin (BTC).\nBerlin, Germany - April 10: In this photo illustration a coin of the crypto currency Bitcoin stands on a hard disk on April 10, 2018 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)\nEach community insists that its coin is the “true Bitcoin”. Here is what Bitcoin Cash’s website says about the reasons for the hard fork:\nSome of the developers did not understand and agree with the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash that Satoshi Nakamoto had created. Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer.\nMany miners and users trusted these developers, while others recognized that they were leading the community down a different road than expected.\nSo, according to Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin (Core) has abandoned Satoshi’s original vision. By refusing to raise the block size limit, they have prevented Bitcoin’s own blockchain from becoming a serious challenger to existing payments providers. Now, they are compromising Satoshi’s entire concept by adding a second layer of transaction processing off the main blockchain.\nBut Bitcoin Core developers say that the block size limit was imposed by Satoshi himself:\nSatoshi added the 1M consensus limit in 2010, intentionally set above the free market fee range. This artificial ceiling acts against network DoS, raising the cost of attack. Setting the limit above free market range resulted in a safety limit reasonably free from politics.\nWe now know that the limit is no longer “above free market range” – indeed, has not been since about 2015. It is hard to imagine a more politically-charged debate than the fierce argument over whether to increase the block size, and if so, by how much.\nHowever, Bitcoin purists insist that since Satoshi set the limit, it must stay. And other Bitcoin aficionados are perfectly happy for the block size to remain restricted, because they see Bitcoin becoming a scarce valuable asset underpinning a transaction processing layer – a digital gold standard. For this, they claim support from Satoshi’s own writings. Satoshi seems to have disliked fiat currency and preferred a gold standard.\nThus, both factions claim to have Satoshi’s “true vision.” And the fight between them has become bitter and personal. It doesn’t even seem to have much to do with the technology any more. The technology is happily developing along two different paths: Bitcoin developers are briskly proceeding with their second layer, known as the Lightning Network, while Bitcoin Cash, which raised the block size to 8MB immediately after the hard fork, is just about to quadruple it to 32MB. But as the technology diverges, the war of words is becoming ever more intense. Here, for example, are Samson Mow (BTC) and Roger Ver (BCH) biting lumps out of each other at the recent Deconomy conference:\nOn Twitter, the battles are even fiercer. Both sides are evangelical in their commitment to their coin’s cause and utterly intolerant of criticism. Any attempt to discuss the relative merits of the two coins quickly degenerates into name-calling.\nAs Jimmy Song perceptively notes , this is not so much a clash of coins as a fight to the death between two factions with opposing economic ideologies. Reflecting the real-world economic theory that each has adopted, he dubs them “crypto-Keynesians” and “crypto-Austrians.” Crypto-Austrians insist that “sound money” is all that matters, and transaction throughput is subservient to this overriding goal. Crypto-Keynesians insist that transaction throughput is essential if Bitcoin is to have any real-world use and hence any real-world value.\nThis is not the first time that a coin split has been driven by ideology rather than technology. Ethereum’s split in 2016 was so ideologically-driven that it looked suspiciously like a schism . But the turf war between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic died down quite quickly, and the two communities now largely ignore each other. In contrast, the BTC/BCH clash seems to become ever more intense as the technology diverges. The conflict between BTC and BCH looks more like a religious war than a disagreement over technology. Perhaps this is Bitcoin’s equivalent of the Reformation .\nTo Bitcoin atheists like me, the whole argument looks silly. Just as both Protestants and Catholics ultimately wanted the same thing, namely to spread the Christian religion throughout the world, so too both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash want the same thing, namely to spread the Bitcoin ecosystem throughout the world. They just disagree about how to achieve it: Bitcoin Core want a two-layer set-up so they can preserve their commitment to \"sound money,\" while Bitcoin Cash want all transactions to be on-chain so they can preserve their commitment to “peer-to-peer electronic cash.”\nSatoshi’s vision appears to contain elements of both. The fundamental conflict at the heart of Bitcoin was set up by its creator. But it is entirely counterproductive for the two ideologies to attempt to kill each other off like this. The lesson of the Reformation is that schism and factional infighting cannot resolve a fundamental conflict. Ultimately, if the Bitcoin ecosystem is to rule the world, the two factions must learn to coexist peacefully. Otherwise both will become irrelevant.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.history.com/topics/reformation", "https://freedomnode.com/blog/66/21-wise-and-funny-bitcoin-quotes-by-satoshi-nakamoto", "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f1e1fb4bdef878c8fc1564fa418d44e7541a7e83", "http://fortune.com/2017/08/11/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-price-date-why/", "https://www.bitcoincash.org/bitcoin.pdf", "https://medium.com/@jimmysong/segwit2x-post-mortem-divorce-of-crypto-austrians-and-crypto-keynesians-87960b11ce4c", "https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/07/economist-explains-20?fsrc=scn/tw/once", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/roger-ver-vs-samson-mow-passionate-debates-on-bitcoin-scaling-at-deconomy-2018", "https://medium.com/@jgarzik/bitcoin-is-being-hot-wired-for-settlement-a5beb1df223a"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas trutschel/photothek", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "economist", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T20:26:11.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e099ee48b68ccc1c43ba5d55df4d79935e826b9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUOSRk3A4Gr6pwLHeLrSbWh50xa4C6fBrfTlwx1wkcwvxIjF_.JEILlxKGWXabTn8Vp01r3Gg8gH.XJXJo7htXl61QDkcNri_hIKF8I_FsCnP9IDOYE74qo1G9NiH7YIWgM-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "published": "2018-05-12T01:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e099ee48b68ccc1c43ba5d55df4d79935e826b9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUOSRk3A4Gr6pwLHeLrSbWh50xa4C6fBrfTlwx1wkcwvxIjF_.JEILlxKGWXabTn8Vp01r3Gg8gH.XJXJo7htXl61QDkcNri_hIKF8I_FsCnP9IDOYE74qo1G9NiH7YIWgM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Jenn", "published": "2018-05-12T01:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price recently broke below its ascending channel support to signal a downtrend. \\n Price has since pulled back to the broken support and completed the retest. \\n The Fibonacci extension tool shows the next downside targets from here. \\n \\n\nBitcoin price seems to be caving to bearish pressure once more as it broke below the channel and completed the retest. \\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals \\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse. Price has also fallen below the moving averages’ dynamic inflection points to confirm a pickup in selling pressure. \\n\nHowever, RSI looks ready to pull up from oversold conditions to show that sellers are exhausted and ready to let buyers take over. Stochastic is still heading south so bitcoin price might keep following suit, but the oscillator is also dipping in oversold territory. \\n\nSustained selling pressure could take bitcoin price to the next Fib extension level at $8750 or the 78.6% level at $8580. The full extension is located at $8359. A bit of a head and shoulders pattern can also be seen with price already trading below the neckline. \\n BTCUSD 1-hour Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nBitcoin wasn’t off to a strong start for the week as it was dragged down by profit-taking and remarks from Warren Buffet. However, a few positive developments were still reported, such as ICE’s plans to create a bitcoin exchange and another approval for the Winklevoss’ bitcoin plans. \\n\nAnalysts continue to provide bullish forecasts for bitcoin price as well, with Fundstrat estimating that it could reach $64,000 by next year. For now, it looks like risk sentiment is winning out as investors continue to cash in their positions in favor of the dollar. BTCUSD has been unable to benefit from the selloff in the dollar on weak CPI, suggesting that the pair is moving on different dynamics. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis for 05\\/11\\/2018 \\u2013 Are Bears Ready to Take Over Again? appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T17:10:51.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa975d6d9a682f12f9c7c26c642643783427a940", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUMZPvS1i8vp29YB8xiVwXodT.pI7qCX_Q3ehd37AvoJBanfFZKVqnrQDb0reicruJB0ezVC8KGwS5Q6XWuArGMGAxv6yb1Ful0-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to move", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to move", "published": "2018-05-12T01:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.453, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa975d6d9a682f12f9c7c26c642643783427a940", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUMZPvS1i8vp29YB8xiVwXodT.pI7qCX_Q3ehd37AvoJBanfFZKVqnrQDb0reicruJB0ezVC8KGwS5Q6XWuArGMGAxv6yb1Ful0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-12T01:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to move", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price failed to move above the $1,650 resistance and declined sharply against the US Dollar. \\n There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,640 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair has to stay above the $1,500 and $1,480 support levels to avoid more declines. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price trimmed yesterday\\u2019s gains against the US Dollar.

On the upside, there are many hurdles for buyers near $1,580 and the 100 hourly SMA. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,664 high to $1,482 low is at $1,573 to act as a key resistance.

BTC\\/USD may continue to move down as long as it is below $9,000-9,050. \\n Bitcoin Price Analysis \\n\nYesterday, we discussed a major resistance area near $9,450 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price was trading with a positive bias, but buyers failed to push the price above $9,400 and $9,450, which resulted in a downside move. There was a sharp bearish reaction and the price tumbled below the $9,050 and $9,000 support levels. The recent downside break looks real as the price settled below the $9,000 handle and the 100 hourly simple moving average. \\n\nIt traded as low as $8,696 and is currently consolidating losses. An initial resistance is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,465 high to $8,696 low. However, the most important resistance is close to $9,050, which was a support earlier . Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,465 high to $8,696 low is at $9,050 to prevent gains. A push above $9,050 could decrease the current bearish pressure in the short term. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the hourly chart , is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $9,380.

I think that the $9000 level continues to offer support though, and that extends down to the $8800 level. I believe that the market will probably try to build up enough momentum to continue going higher, perhaps making yet another attempt on the $10,000 level. That’s an area that has caused a significant amount of resistance more than once, but I think that we will continue to see this as an opportunity to pick up value on short-term dips. If we break down below the $8800 level, the market could breakdown rather significantly, perhaps down to the $8000 level. $10,000 above is major resistance, so I think that the market will spring to life if we do break above there, perhaps sending the market to the $12,000 level rather quickly. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nBitcoin also fell against the Japanese yen, as we continue to dance around the ¥1 million level. This is an area that is attracted a lot of attention, and I think that there is plenty of support just below, especially near the ¥950,000 level. A breakdown below there, then we will test ¥900,000, ¥800,000, and then eventually ¥700,000. Alternately, if we can break above the ¥1.1 million level, the market should continue to go much higher, perhaps reaching towards the ¥1.25 million level above, as it is the top of the overall consolidation area. This market continues to bang around in both directions, so keep that in mind.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany.

Cryptocurrency Seized\nA recent article from USA Today reports that the London Metropolitan Police managed to seize cryptocurrencies from a prolific hacker. According to the report, Grant West was arrested last year on a train by British police, who were working with Scotland Yard.\nThe British police force was able to seize cryptocurrencies worth $700,000 from the 25-year-old hacker. On the subject of hackers, police investigator Mick Gallagher says:\nThese people generally feel they can operate with impunity, that they can’t be touched. We have now debunked that.\nInvestigators say that West, who went by the online name “Courvoisier,” was behind cyber attacks on more than 100 different companies, including gambling shops, mobile phone companies, and supermarkets. The report also notes that “Courvoisier” used Bitcoin to launder his proceeds from the sale of passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information on the Dark Web.\nAn interesting twist to this cryptocurrency seizure is that the police were able to snag the bitcoins due to the fact that West was still logged into his computer, and investigators found his access keys that were saved on his computer. Cybercriminals and Cryptocurrencies\nMany cybercriminals have used cryptocurrencies to launder their proceeds from illegal activities. Some cryptocurrencies are also massively used in Dark Web markets to purchase illegal goods or services like drugs, credit card information, DDoS attacks, etc. Alex Lakatos, a lawyer from Washington D.C., states:\nWhen it comes to transactions on the Dark Web, (people) nearly universally use cryptocurrency.\nHe also added:\nThe use of virtual currency for illicit purposes has been a huge success.\nSome cybercriminals may believe that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may offer anonymity, but it has been pointed out that investigators often times can track certain cryptocurrencies but cannot tell who owns them.\nAnother point of fact is that the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions are for perfectly legal reasons. However, the media and centralized authorities love to play up the meme of crypto and illicit activity.\nWhat are your thoughts on the cryptocurrency seizure by the London police? Will police be able to enhance their ability to go after hackers or will hackers stay a few steps ahead? Let us know in the comments below! Images courtesy of Shutterstock, iStock, and Pixabay.

The data provided was current at the time of publication. For current information regarding any of the funds mentioned in these presentations, please visit the appropriate fund performance page. May 11, 2018 CEO and Chief Investment Officer U.S. Global Investors\nThis week I had the opportunity to sit down with Marco Streng, the wunderkind bitcoin visionary behind Genesis Mining. Genesis, as many of you reading this might know, is the world’s largest cloud bitcoin mining company, with over 2 million customers worldwide. It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm.\nNext week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation. Tell us how you got started in this industry.\nI’ve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin—it progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it. How would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It’s a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.\nThe conventional banking system really shows its limitations when we try to move money between developed and underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa. There are some serious inefficiencies that, frankly, many of the big banks just aren’t interested in fixing. But with bitcoin, you don’t have to worry about that. You can send money to, say, a coffee farmer in Africa, and he’ll receive it directly.\nMoney transfers are only one among a number of many other uses. Bitcoin is also a store of value. It’s one of the few assets that I would say are uncorrelated to the broader financial markets.\nAs for blockchain, it has innumerable world-changing applications across a wide range of industries. That’s why I believe it’s crucial that people have the right information about blockchain and understand it. If people don’t understand it, and it gets overhyped, I’m afraid it could start going in the wrong direction. We recently mined the 17 millionth bitcoin, leaving only four million left. Explain why it becomes exponentially more difficult to mine coins the closer we get to that 21 million-coin ceiling.\nIt’s not that the mining itself becomes more difficult. To answer this, I think we have to look at two components.\nOne component is the daily supply of bitcoin. At the moment, only 1,800 bitcoins can be generated every day by the whole network, meaning all the miners worldwide. But it’s important to remember that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined, the rewards are halved. What this means is that after the next halving, which I believe is expected sometime in 2020, the number of bitcoins mined a day will fall from 1,800 to 900. And then after the next halving, it’ll be 450. This helps reduce the supply in a natural way. click to enlarge\nThe second component is a measure of how many miners and how much computing power is in the network. If more miners come online, then of course the competition becomes greater. Because the daily supply is already fixed, your market share shrinks. click to enlarge\nThink of it like the California Gold Rush. Mining gold at first was relatively easy because the metal was plentiful and there were few miners. By the end, it became more difficult because the easy gold had already been claimed, and you were competing with far more miners. We’re seeing the same thing happen with bitcoin and other mineable digital currencies. Speaking of computing power, HIVE Blockchain just announced that it expanded to 24.2 megawatts (MW), up from 2.4 MW in August. What’s next in the pipeline for HIVE?\nYes, the last expansion was a massive build-out in Sweden. It was done in three phases. I think this was a remarkable achievement for HIVE, that it could add so much computing power so quickly.\nThis is only the beginning. The year is still long and you can expect to see some bigger expansions on the way. In September, for example, we’re going to ramp up another bitcoin mining facility worth 20 MW, which is very exciting. And from there it goes even further. G20 finance ministers are scheduled to share their plans for more uniform regulation of cryptocurrencies by July. What are your expectations?\nI personally think that this is very good and that it will bring more professionalism into the market. The momentum and adoption has grown so much and so rapidly that there really needs to be some kind of strategy—the world’s economic leaders can’t just leave this space untouched. Anyone who believes otherwise isn’t facing reality.\nHaving said that, regulating this market will not be easy because it’s in a whole other dimension than anything that has come before it. As an analogy, imagine someone trying to regulate flying cars using the same measures that have been written for cars driving on the street. It wouldn’t make any sense. So there will certainly need to be some innovation to get it right. I think it’s also important that the regulators talk to the right people, the industry leaders. They have good input, and I think it could be a very fruitful dialogue. Along those same lines, South Korea’s central bank just announced that it was looking seriously into how the Korean economy might use blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, there’s talk of the country going cashless by 2020. Do you think that’s where the global financial systems are headed?\nI think there’s a natural incentive for governments to go in that direction because, of course, they want to have greater control over their economies. But as is the case with overregulation, too many controls—or going completely cashless—could be harmful to the economy. This is certainly part of a long and interesting debate, and I’m curious to see how it plays out, in South Korea and elsewhere. Where do you see the best application of blockchain technology right now?\nBlockchain’s greatest contribution is its ability to erase boundaries. It completely removes the element of trust—or distrust, I should say—and adds a stabilizing effect to nearly every industry because of decentralization.\nTake the global banking industry, for example. You don’t need to look far to find some serious inefficiencies, as I mentioned earlier. We’re already seeing some very concrete instances where blockchain can be of help here. The banks recognize this and are getting together to make use of this technology to improve their services. What’s been the greatest challenge you’ve faced so far in your journey?\nFor me, the greatest challenge can usually be found in the moment that you’re currently in. I always compare this industry to the beginning of the internet—no one knew where it was headed or what it would eventually look like. Most people had a general idea that it was innovative and could benefit the world, but the full implications were unclear.\nSimilarly, no one knows where blockchain and cryptocurrencies might take us, and having to deal with this constant uncertainty is, I’ll admit, not trivial. You must always be prepared to act quickly in response to another bitcoin fork, a hack or some other unexpected event. These are things that keep you up at night.\nBut it’s exciting. I think what history has shown again and again is that it’s dangerous to be ignorant and to not have an open mind. Not everything was euphoric and wonderful when the internet first emerged. Problems still occur online, but I believe most people would agree that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nNo industry is without its challenges, and as long as you’re willing to address them, it can be very rewarding. As for blockchain technology, I’m very happy and thrilled to be a part of it this early on.\nInterested in learning more?

Domestic Equity Market click to enlarge Strengths Energy was the best performing sector of the week, increasing by 3.75 percent versus an overall increase of 2.31 percent for the S&P 500. TripAdvisor was the best performing stock for the week, increasing 27.15 percent. Nvidia had a stellar earnings report. \"We had a strong quarter with growth across every platform,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the company’s earnings release which showed the chipmaker earned an adjusted $2.05 a share on revenue of $3.21 billion. Weaknesses Utilities was the worst performing sector for the week, decreasing by 2.27 percent versus an overall increase of 2.31percent for the S&P 500. Symantec was the worst performing stock for the week, falling 29.89 percent. Shares of MoviePass owner Helios & Matheson Analytics plunged 22 percent Thursday to a record low of $0.61. The company has lost 71 percent of its value over the last three trading sessions. Opportunities ValueAct has built a $1.2 billion Citigroup stake. Jeff Ubben's activist fund has been building those holdings over the past four or five months, according to a quarterly investor letter. The fund said it believes the bank has about $50 billion it could easily return to shareholders over the next two years. Blackstone is doubling down on industrial real estate by buying Gramercy Property Trust, a warehouse company, in a deal valued at $7.6 billion. With Gramercy trading at a discount to its peers before the takeout, the deal appears to have been a steal for Blackstone and could result in big gains down the road. Small cap stocks are outperforming large caps despite the market's condition, propped up by faster buyback growth, write Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Kevin Kelly. Small caps are buying back shares at a faster pace than large caps for the first time since 2015. Threats Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund could be forced by Parliament to divest gambling stocks. The Labor party's financial spokeswoman Rigmor Aasrud said there's a majority in Parliament that wants to exit the sector and they expect to see something happen. Symantec, the owner of the popular Norton antivirus software and LifeLock identity theft protection service, stunned Wall Street by disclosing that its audit committee is conducting an investigation of the company. The company’s stock plunged 33 percent in early trading Friday on the news. Comcast could become America’s largest corporate borrower and its credit ratings may teeter at the bottom edge of investment grade if it ends up bidding for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets. Assuming the company also completes its acquisition of a 61 percent stake in European pay-TV group, Comcast would come out with a debt load of around $170 billion, surpassing telecommunication giants Verizon and AT&T, according to Andy Stone of Invesco. May 8, 2018 The Economy and Bond Market Strengths The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index continues to point to robust economic activity ahead. The preliminary print for May was unchanged from the previous month, holding at an elevated level by historical standards as benefits from tax cuts offset concerns about the impact of trade tariffs. The U.S. posted its largest monthly budget surplus on record in April, which the CBO said reflected stronger economic activity over the past year. Receipts in April totaled $510 billion, about 12 percent more than the same period last year, while outlays increased by 8.4 percent to $296 billion, the Treasury Department said. The monthly surplus was $214 billion, the highest on record dating to 1968. U.S. small business optimism rose to 104.8 in April, versus the estimated 104.5. About a quarter of employers said they think it's a good time to expand. Weaknesses U.S. consumer prices rebounded less than expected in April as rising costs for gasoline and rental accommodation were tempered by a moderation in health care prices. The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in March. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent after two straight monthly increases of 0.2 percent. Economists had forecast the CPI rebounding 0.3 percent in April and the core CPI climbing 0.2 percent. U.S. household sentiment dropped last week to the lowest level since early February as views of the buying climate and personal finances dimmed, the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index showed. The index declined to 55.8 from 56.5. The buying climate index slipped to an eight-week low of 47.5 from 48.6; down 3.6 points in the last three weeks, while the gauge tracking views of the economy fell to 57.2, the weakest reading since January, from 57.6. The Bloomberg Barclays Treasury Index posted its worst year through May 8 since 2009. This year, the long end has driven the overall weakness, even after duration adjusting the front end outperformed longer-maturity Treasuries. Furthermore, equity and rate volatility have become more aligned this year. Opportunities U.S. companies lifted their outlook for investment this year, while noting that tariffs will raise prices and cause supply disruptions, according to a private survey. The ISM’s semi-annual forecast showed factory purchasing managers see capital spending jumping 10.1 percent in 2018, well above the 2.7 percent projection made in the last report released in December. Service providers project investment will climb 6.8 percent, up from 3.8 percent. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the central bank doesn’t need to raise interest rates further because the policy rate has reached its neutral setting and inflation expectations are at or below target. “By keeping the policy rate steady, the FOMC may be able to appropriately re-center inflation expectations at the target outcome for the next several years,” he said. “The yield curve could invert later this year or early next year if the Committee continues increasing the policy rate and longer-term yields do not move higher.” Municipal bond yields may fall further relative to Treasuries amid strong demand from investors who are set to receive principal payments over the next several months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts led by Philip Fischer wrote in a research note to clients. \"Muni relative performance should be very positive for the next four months,” the note read. Threats In an ominous sign for global earnings forecasts, April data on South Korean exports showed a decline for the first time since 2016. The measure is a “notoriously good global cyclical indicator,” and a great lead indicator of global earnings-per-share growth, according to strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. While 12-month forward EPS estimates for the U.S. and Europe continue to rise, those for Asia and emerging markets peaked at the beginning of April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. click to enlarge Jamie Dimon just got a big-name backer in his bet that benchmark U.S. yields are heading toward 4 percent. Franklin Templeton bond chief Michael Hasenstab predicts rising inflationary pressures, an onslaught of U.S. bond supply and the Federal Reserve’s moves to pare its balance sheet, will conspire to drive up benchmark rates. Given the rise in BBB debt and M&A leverage build-up, as much as $310 billion of investment-grade debt could fall into junk territory this year, according to UBS strategist Matthew Mish. That compares with 2017, which recorded a multi-year low for \"fallen angel\" debt at $29 billion. Sectors like health care, automobiles, media and energy MLPs present the greatest risk, and investors as such should move up in quality there, Mish said. Gold Market\nThis week spot gold closed at $1,318.30, up $2.95 per ounce, or 0.22 percent. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 1.19 percent. Junior-tiered stocks outperformed seniors for the week, as the S&P/TSX Venture Index came climbed 1.38 percent. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar was essentially unchanged by the end of the week. Date Germany ZEW Survey Current Situation 85.2 211k Strengths The best performing metal this week was palladium, up 2.14 percent. Physical demand is tight as holdings in metal backed ETFs are being withdrawn and then lent to users as one-week lease rates are currently at 5 percent, higher than Treasury yields. Gold is set for its first weekly gain in a month as the dollar fell amid speculation that the Fed might be less aggressive in raising interest rates than expected, writes Bloomberg. U.S. consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in April, less than forecasted after a March decline of 0.1 percent, as measured by the consumer price index. Bloomberg writes that used car prices saw their biggest monthly drop since 2009 and airline tickets also fell the most in four years. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets said that they “do not expect the Fed to remain hawkish when it comes to interest rate hikes.” UBS writes that the gold consolidation could continue for now amid a stronger U.S. dollar. Positioning in gold has been cut significantly in the last couple of weeks and last week’s data shows net longs at 35 percent of the all-time high. Joni Teves, UBS strategist, writes that “this is understandable after gold remains capped, failing its attempt to break the $1,350/$1,360 level in April.” Weaknesses The worst performing metal this week was gold, up 0.22 percent. Randgold Resources Ltd. fell to its lowest in 18 months after a labor dispute at its Tongon mine in Ivory Cost will likely prevent the mine from hitting its full-year target, reports Bloomberg. Randgold’s new mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo faces challenges over a new mining code that could threaten profits. Kinross fell 5.3 percent in pre-market on Wednesday after Mauritania rejected one of its exploitation permits for failure to meet feasibility criteria. Newmont Mining’s chief economist Tom Brady gave a presentation at the Mines and Money Conference in New York this week saying that investors continue to favor gold versus gold equities. Brady stated that gold miners have seen “anemic returns” and that ore grades have fallen around 35 percent in the past 20 years. Brady also spoke about senior gold producers reducing debt recently, but that total debt was still around $25 billion in 2017, compared with less than $4 billion in 2000. Bloomberg reports that China’s foreign-currency stockpile, the world’s largest such stockpile, fell $18 billion to a five-month low of $3.12 trillion last month. This is the second monthly shrinkage this year and is likely due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Several large corporations such as Apple, Netflix and Microsoft are no longer reporting on their cash held overseas. This lack of disclosure makes it difficult to calculate whether or not the new tax reform is having an effect on bringing cash held overseas back to the States. With the recent broad market weakness over the last couple months, the surge in the U.S. dollar may only reflect money being brought back to the States to execute stock buybacks as if trying to put a floor on falling technology shares and may not be a fundamental sustaining force for the value of the dollar. Opportunities Epsilon Theory published a report analyzing Bloomberg articles that contain material related to inflation and their sentiment. The study found that from April 2016 to March 2017 there were 1,400 articles published about inflation with most of those referring to inflation as a subsidiary topic. From April 2017 to March 2018, by contrast, there were 2,400 articles published where inflation was mentioned, with the majority of them actually being about inflation. The researchers suggest that because inflation was written about more and had a more cohesive narrative; it became common knowledge and accepted that inflation is indeed rising. Matthew Sigel of CLSA wrote about two reports this week showing how inflation can rise due to changes in demographics. One report documents the stagnation in real wages that occurred from the 1980s to 2000s when manufacturing surged in Asia after China and Eastern Europe were brought into the World Trade Organization, however the wage stagnation is now reversing due to aging populations and rising real interest rates. Sigel also notes how the second report prepared by the Bank of International Settlements connects age demographics and dependents. The author specifically concludes that inflationary pressures rise when the share of dependents increases and, conversely, subsides when the share of working age population increases. Their data predicts rising inflation over the coming decades, which has historically been good for gold. click to enlarge Eily Ong, Bloomberg Intelligence industry analyst, writes that gold production growth will likely slow as a result of falling weighted-average gold reserve grades. Mine life expectancy has declined since 2012 and expectations are that major gold miners may exhaust their current mines’ lives within 19 years versus 25 years in 2012. Ong writes that overall capital spending could drop for gold miners and boost free cash flow to a new record. Falling production and more free cash flow should make way for more mergers and acquisitions as the gold price climbs with rising inflation expectations. Threats South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has submitted wage hike demands in the gold sector of up to 37 percent over a two-year period, reports CNBC. According to a document submitted to the Chamber of Mines, the demands far exceed the current inflation rate of 3.8 percent and suggest potentially tough negotiations with companies that have tried to contain these rising costs in the world’s deepest mines, the article continues. On a similar note, South Africa’s Solidarity Union says that it wants annual pay increases of at least 10 percent from gold-mining companies, reports Bloomberg, as it prepares for the next round of wage negotiations. As supply risks in Venezuela and Iran strain global markets, Bank of America Corp. says that oil prices could rally to $100 a barrel in 2019. “Brent futures, trading near $77 on Thursday, are set to reach $90 in the second quarter of 2019 as world inventories shrink,” the bank said. So what does this mean for gold? If oil prices go up too much, gold mining companies’ margins will be compressed, which is a threat to the industry. Barrick Gold has entered into a subscription agreement to acquire 46.6 common shares of Midas Gold at C$1.06 per share, reports Bloomberg, resulting in Barrick owning about 19.9 percent of Midas. Using a replicating portfolio valuation of other gold mines currently in production of known ounces and grades, the $970 million initial capital expenditure to build the Stibnite Mine implies that about 16 million ounces of gold-equivalent production from the mine would be needed to support the investment. Stibnite currently has 6.4 million gold-equivalent ounces of resources but it is not uncommon for a typical gold mine to produce more than 2x the number of gold ounces on the resource statement over the life of the mins as new ounces are found and incorporated into the mine plan. Blockchain and Digital Currencies Strengths Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performing for the week ended May 11 was Maggie, which gained 120.31 percent. The Hedge Fund Research Blockchain Index jumped 47 percent in April after declining 34 percent in March, reports Seeking Alpha. This helps narrow the year-to-date losses to 19.3 percent. “The HFR index gains in April mirror an earlier study by Crypto Fund Research that predicts total volume of virtual currency fund assets could rise two-fold this year,” the article continues. Blockchain technology could soon be helping Puerto Rico keep the lights on, writes Bloomberg. Australian blockchain technology provider Power Ledger wants to help the island where power was wiped out last year due to hurricanes Irma and Maria. According to the article, Power Ledger is working with factories and regulators to help companies on the island finance so-called micro grid resources such as solar panels and battery storage. Then, using blockchain technology, companies will be allowed to trade power from those resources with one another and also to sell supplies to employees or local communities. Weaknesses Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performing for the week ended May 11 was SRCOIN, which lost 60.27 percent. The price of bitcoin weakened Monday following negative comments by Warren Buffett and his longtime business partner Charles Munger at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting. Buffett colorfully compared the cryptocurrency to “rat poison” while Munger commented that trading bitcoin is “just dementia.” click to enlarge Buffett and Munger aren’t the only billionaires pouring cold water on digital currencies this week, reports MarketWatch. Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said that if there was an easy way to bet against bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he would. “As an asset class, you’re not producing anything and so you shouldn’t expect it to go up,” Gates said. Opportunities Joining the growing list of companies using the digital-ledger technology behind bitcoin, Oracle Corp. will unveil its blockchain software starting this month, reports Bloomberg. President of product development Thomas Kurian said on Monday that the company will introduce a platform-as-a-service blockchain product in May and decentralized ledger-based applications next month. On May 14, the Consensus conference begins in New York and is expected to attract close to 7,000 blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, reports MarketWatch. According to Tom Lee from Fundstrat Global Advisors, there is a seasonality pattern to the conference that could push bitcoin back toward an all-time high. “Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years,” Lee said. Bloomberg has started its own cryptocurrency index, reports Seeking Alpha. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index is owned and administered by Bloomberg and is co-branded with Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Capital Management. The index is designed to track the performance of the largest, most liquid part of the cryptocurrency market, the article continues. Threats According to research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve, bitcoin’s decline following its climb to $20,000 was directly tied to the launch of a futures market in December 2017, reports Seeking Alpha. “It is consistent with trading behavior…the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics,” the report states. Multiple news outlets pointed to a meeting between the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) this week, to determine how cryptocurrencies should be designated and regulated. However, according to TheStreet.com, a call to the SEC’s Public Affairs Office denied that a meeting between the two agencies would take place. The SEC and CFTC have expressed differing opinions regarding the topic, so investors will have to stay tuned for any ultimate decision (and meeting between the two) down the road. Bitcoin is risking a drop below $9,000, reports Coindesk.com, specifically pinpointing the digital currency’s four-day low Wednesday morning. According to technical charts tracking its price action, Tuesday’s downward move “meant the cryptocurrency closed below the 10-day moving average,” thus setting it up for further potential drops. Energy and Natural Resources Market Strengths Natural gas was the best performing major commodity this week, rising 3.8 percent. The commodity rallied after analysts noted the Iran sanctions could make for more expensive natural gas exports as Iran supply is constrained, potentially increasing demand for U.S. shale gas. The best performing sector this week was diversified metals and mining. The group rose 6.9 percent after industrial metals prices rallied on a lower U.S. dollar. The best performing stock for the week was Petrobras. The Brazilian major integrated oil producer rose 18.3 percent after announcing the early repayment of certain debt instruments, as well as benefiting from a rallying oil price. Weaknesses Aluminum was the worst performing commodity this week. The commodity dropped 0.2 percent after market commentators suggested Chinese production can keep the market adequately supplied. The worst performing sector this week was fertilizers and agricultural chemicals. The group rose 0.2 percent, lagging other commodity-related sectors after agricultural data in the U.S. showed farmers have planted less acreage so far this spring owing the weather-related delays. The worst performing stock for the week was Centerra Gold Inc. The Canadian gold and base metals producer dropped 8.5 percent. Opportunities Crude oil has broken out of a deep three-year basing formation, with analysts suggesting prices could rally to $100 a barrel. Technical research conducted by Joseph M. Farrell shows crude has broken out of the year-to-date bullish secondary accumulation zone. This targets minimum technical upside to the 2/3 Fibonacci retracement of the 2014-2016 crash at $76.00. The base itself supports technical upside in excess of $100, according to Farrell. click to enlarge Warren Buffet believes the trade disputes between the U.S. and China will be resolved, averting a possible trade war. According to Buffet, it is unlikely that the two countries would dig themselves into a trade war, suggesting the broad appeal of trade for industry in both countries would prevent an escalation of the conflict. China opened trading in Dalian iron ore futures to overseas investors. It is the second Chinese futures contract open to foreign entities after Shanghai launched crude oil futures in late March. The Asian nation is aiming to increase its pricing influence over the commodities market and increasing liquidity to allow for more accurate price discovery. Threats Iran appears to be ramping up its oil exports ahead of the imposition of U.S. sanctions. Exports have climbed to a post-sanction high of 2.84 million barrels a day. A disorderly liquidation of Iranian crude inventories ahead of the sanctions deadline could result in short-term distortions to global crude and refined products markets. China’s foreign reserves fall more than forecast as the Chinese yuan drops and Chinese regulators show less concern over capital flight. The level of reserves fell almost $18 billion to a five-month low of $3.1 trillion. The devaluation of the Chinese yuan over the recent period has negative implications for commodity demand as raw material imports become more expensive for Chinese buyers. Aluminum posted the lowest close in a week on speculation that the market is well supplied as China ramps up production. “Given the fundamentals, there’s no reason for the metal to trade as high as it has been,” Simona Gambarini, a commodities economist at Capital Economics, said by phone from London. “There was a substantial increase in Shanghai-listed stocks. That’s a sign that the market is well-supplied.” China Region Strengths Hong Kong first quarter GDP crushed expectations. Analysts’ expectations were for a 3.4 percent growth rate, but the actual print came in at a rock-solid 4.7 percent. Chinese import and export data both came in strong. Imports were up 21.5 percent and exports were up 12.9 percent, leaving China with a conspicuous trade surplus of about $29 billion. North Korea freed three American detainees, who returned to the United States on Tuesday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a diplomatic victory for U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of his upcoming meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. President Trump announced that the historic summit will be held in Singapore on June 12. Weaknesses Indonesia’s first quarter GDP reading clocked in at 5.06 percent on a year-over-year basis—just shy of the 5.19 percent expectations. Quarter-over-quarter growth declined by 0.42 percent, also missing expectations for a more modest decline of only 0.30 percent. China’s Foreign Reserves came in lower than expected at $3.125 trillion, down from the prior month’s $3.143 trillion print and below expectations for a $3.131 trillion showing. The FX Reserves number continues, on the whole, to demonstrate relative stability, but the number did come in lighter than expected. Taiwanese exports missed expectations, coming in at a pace of 10.0 percent year-over-year growth, below the anticipated 12.3 percent print for the April period and down from March’s 16.7 percent. Opportunities Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175 HK) had a newsworthy week. The company is reportedly considering floating Volvo Cars—with potential dual listings in Sweden and Hong Kong—and potentially seeking a valuation of up to $30 billion. In addition, Geely released its April sales data, which showed sales volume up 49 percent year over year to 128,817 units. The company is right on track for its 2018 targets, and its new Lynk & Co. 01 hit sales of 9,709 units—a new record for the brand, and a rise of about 7 percent month over month. Credit Suisse upgraded the stock following the update. Despite all the tariff talk and possible headwinds, Chinese auto companies—like Geely—have been expanding globally. Just look at the below map of China’s global auto acquisitions and investments over the last 5 years, courtesy of Bloomberg. click to enlarge Bloomberg Businessweek reported recently that Uber Technologies announced a plan to swap its Southeast Asia ride-hailing business to its rival, Grab, for a 27.5 percent stake in the new business. The “sharing economy” continues apace. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that China’s Premier Li Keqiang is signaling openness to boosting imports of palm oil from Indonesia. Indonesia, together with Malaysia, controls roughly 85 percent of global palm oil supply. Environmental concerns have created a spat between the two palm oil juggernauts and the EU, but China—which already imports some 3.7 million tons of palm oil—is reportedly developing a biofuel that employs 5 percent palm oil. Threats Inflation concerns continue in the Philippines as the central bank stepped in this week to hike rates, even as the country reported a positive first quarter GDP print of 6.8 percent, while revising the prior quarter’s growth down to 6.5 percent from 6.6 percent. While rising energy prices may benefit Malaysia, elections this week have also introduced a degree of uncertainty into the market after 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad led a 4-party opposition coalition to victory on Wednesday, ending the ruling party’s 61-year tenure and unseating Prime Minister Najib Razak, Mohamad’s own former protégé. Mohamad states that he hopes to hand over power in time to another former protégé of his as a successor—the de facto opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. The only problem? Mr. Ibrahim is currently in jail and will need a royal pardon to get out. An exchange-traded fund and proxy for the Malaysian market—the Malaysian market was closed the rest of the week as an immediate holiday—dropped significantly on Wednesday as the election results came in, but partially bounced back a little bit on Thursday and Friday. Change can be good—but fiscal sustainability and stability will be required. Stay tuned. Oh, and by the way, when Mohamad cruised up to his inauguration, he did so in a custom Proton. The New York Times reported this week on the sale of the English-language Cambodian newspaper The Phnom Penh Post, dubbed by the NYT to be a “newspaper widely seen as the last bastion of a free press in Cambodia.” The sale, which was reported Sunday, grants control to “a Malaysian investor with ties to Cambodia’s strongman prime minister” in “a move that critics say further highlights the country’s slide toward outright authoritarianism.” The Times points out that Sivakumar S. Ganapthy, the Malaysian investor, is CEO of a public relations firm that has worked on behalf of the Prime Minister Hun Sen. The Times also notes that, “Intervention in the paper’s editorial decision-making came almost immediately,” and that, “[s]everal senior editors resigned or were fired after they refused to excise a story from the paper’s website about the relationship between Mr. Sivakumar’s firm and the Cambodian government.” Emerging Europe Strengths Poland was the best performing country this week, gaining 3.2 percent. Equities trading on the Warsaw exchange, as measured by WIG20 index, bounced back sharply from last week’s losses. CDR Projekt, a video game maker, gained more than 15 percent, and shares of Bank Zachodni, appreciated by more than 7 percent. PZU, an insurance company, was the only stock that recorded a net loss within the large cap names in the WIG20 index. PZU shares declined by 2.8 percent. The Russian ruble was the best performing currency this week, gaining 1.2 percent against the dollar. The currency rebounded with the price of oil, after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would be exiting the Iran nuclear deal. Crude oil gained 3 percent in the past five days, closing at $77 per barrel. Information technology was the best performing sector among eastern European markets this week. Weaknesses Turkey was the worst performing country this week, losing 70 basis points. Political uncertainly weighted on Turkish equites ahead of the snap election scheduled for June 24. Flap Kongre Toplanti Hizmetleri & Turism A.S., a travel service company, was the biggest loser trading on the Istanbul exchange, down 48 percent. The Turkish lira was the worst performing currency this week, losing 2 percent against the dollar. The lira continues to depreciate as the President of Turkey wants to lower rates in order to stimulate the economy and bring double-digit growth. Falling currency needs a bigger rate hike, not a rate cut. The real estate sector was the worst performing sector among eastern European markets this week. Opportunities JPMorgan says that U.S. sanctions on Russia have had minimal impact on growth. April surveys registered little reaction to sanctions or ruble depreciation. Both manufacturing and service PMIs printed higher than expected, while other business surveys were steady. Early data on electricity consumption and railway turnover showed little change in activity. A report published on Monday by the World Bank shows that the poorest regions in Romania, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria would become richer, on average, than the “lagging regions” of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece by 2025, if the trends of the past decade were to continue. Between 2005 and 2015, the low-growth regions in southern Europe experienced zero growth in GDP per capita compared with the EU average of 2.1 percent annually. By contrast, annual growth in low-income regions of Eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria) averaged 4.6 percent. If these trends were to persist, there will be a radical restructuring in the economic hierarchy, with low-income and low-growth regions having trade position by 2025. According to UNLU & Company research, the earnings cycle in Turkey remains strong despite macro headwinds. Consensus raised 2018 estimated earnings-per-share by 4 percent in cumulative terms in the first fourth months of the year. With the April revisions, the earnings upgrade cycle for Turkish equities was extended to 15 months. Looking at the breakdown, non-banks were the outperformers, with 5 percent year-to-date EPS upgrades versus 4 percent for banks. Threats This week the European Union started to debate on its proposed 2021 to 2027 budget. Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker said the total budget might increase to 1.279 trillion euros from 1 trillion. The commission for the first time proposed linking the payment of EU funds to countries’ independence of courts, acceptance of immigrants and the rule of law. Poland and Hungary, the biggest net recipients of EU funds, could lose some of their funding. In addition, the U.K. who was the second largest contributor to the EU budget, will remove a large portion of funds available for distribution after deciding to exit the EU. click to enlarge The lira has depreciated 12 percent against the dollar year-to-date, and it is the second worst performing currency after the Argentine peso. A weaker currency may push inflation even higher, which has already reached a multi-year high of 12 percent, well above the central bank’s target of 5 percent. A weak lira will also put pressure on the corporate and banking sector. Banks’ domestic loan portfolios are deteriorating and corporate FX mortgage holders may straggle to make debt payments. FX lending to households was banned in 2009. The U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal could stress already strained diplomatic relations with a number of key allies, including European Union leaders in Germany, France and the United Kingdom, all original parties in the 2015 accord. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor of Germany Angela Marker recently visited the U.S. to try and persuade President Trump not to withdraw from the deal. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has implored President Trump in recent days to stay in the Iran nuclear deal.

MAPS focuses on PTSD therapies using psychedelics while GiveDirectly supports the transfer of money to people in need. According to Pine, the fund received tens of thousands of applications from charities around the world.\nSpeaking in the farewell message, Pine expressed gratitude to all who took part in the project, saying:\nI want to thank everyone for supporting this project. Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.\nPositive Bitcoin Contributions to Humanity The efforts of the mysterious donor known only as Pine, through the Pineapple fund shows the positive impact that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can have. In a time when the technology is maligned in the mainstream arena as being an enabler of crime, stories like this help to change the narrative.\nBack in December, Pine promised to donate 5,057 bitcoins to charities, and the donor achieved the target. The donor even surpassed the mark by 47 bitcoins (approximately $430,000).\nWhat are your views on the philanthropic work of the Pineapple fund?

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\nWidespread Losses\nEvery one of the top 25 digital currencies (ranked by total market value) was in the red at the time of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nWhile Bitcoin had fallen 8.2% over the last 24 hours, several major cryptocurrencies had suffered losses close to twice that high.\nStellar, Cardano and EOS, for example, were all down at least 16%, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.\nRipple's XRP token and Bitcoin Cash, while not as far in the red, had dropped 12.8% and 13.8%, respectively.\nSouth Korea Leads The Decline\nSeveral analysts confirmed that the UPBit raid was the driving force behind today's crypto losses.\n\"T he main reason seems to be Upbit news,\" said digital currency investor Marius Rupsys.\n\"Most are talking about it and if you look at prices in Korean exchanges, they are leading the drop.\"\nThis isn't the first time that South Korean raids have caused crypto prices to fall, emphasized Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital .\n\" The last time South Korea raided their 'top exchanges' was on January 10th, and Bitcoin's spot price saw a -7% decline on intraday trading that day as well,\" he noted.\nHe added that:\nAs is so often the case, an event that should rightfully cause turbulence in a specific region seems to be creating shockwaves globally. The Upbit raid is not the first of its kind, and the markets overreacted in past similar instances as well. As the market continues to mature, these events should grow fewer and farther between, and investors will grow thicker skin.\nBitcoin Resilience\nBitcoin was able to hold up better than many other digital currencies because it is more established than its peers, claimed several analysts.\n\"BTC is the anchor crypto that all other cryptos are tied to in terms of price,\" stated Shone Anstey, president and co-founder of Blockchain Intelligence Group .\n\"Bitcoin is the most stable and dominant cryptocurrency with the largest network effect.

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30–40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night's move marked the first new low since the trading range (TR) formed 3 weeks ago:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading Range\nUntil last night's drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR — signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat.\nSometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume View\nAt the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side. The reaction to this lower price range will give us further insight as to the upcoming market movements. This is the first sign of weakness in our current trend, so it stands to reason that we will see a bounce in price to retest the resistance within the TR and further test the supply/demand of the market. Without proper distribution, its unlikely to see a sustained continuation of the downtrend, but at this point we shouldn't rule anything out. On the short term, we can expect a retest of the $8,800s and possibly the lower $9K values.\nA somewhat alarming development is occurring as a consequence of this drop. Shortly after the market saw a golden cross of the 50/200 EMAs on the daily chart, we saw a definitive puncture of that support. Typically, the market doesn't just plunge through the 200 EMA without seeing some sort of resistance, but a daily candle close below the 200 EMA marks a more macro bearish signal. That, combined with a Bollinger Band expansion, gives us an indication that the move downward may, on a macro scale, be a prolonged move over the coming days and weeks:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro View\nSummary: A strong move downward brought the entire crypto market to its knees as bitcoin saw an $800 drop in a few short hours.\nThis move marked the first sign of weakness in our current uptrend\nThe sign of weakness combined with macro signals interacting with the Bollinger Bands and 50/200 EMAs hint toward a possible macro move downward.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

He points to the popular cryptocurrency's resurgence as a sign of its durability.\nKelly offered his views on Bitcoin at the Hoover Institute Monetary Policy Conference. Describing the currency as a serious market , he insisted that things are changing, adding that discussions about cryptocurrency rarely took place at previous established financial conferences. Bitcoin certainly got people talking at this one, however.\nNo longer niche Kelly said that digital currency could no longer be considered niche, now that its audience has grown beyond its core crypto base. Mainstream finance is beginning to take Bitcoin seriously , which suggests that the market has become a hard one to ignore. Kelly said that the attention being given to Bitcoin is well deserved, now that the market cap for cryptocurrency has reached $460bn.\nThe CEO also said that Goldman Sachs' recent moves in the Bitcoin market is evidence of a change in perception. The Wall Street bankers recently confirmed that it would be trading both Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures in the coming months. Goldman Sachs would be the first company on Wall Street to trade cryptocurrency.\nThe real deal When it comes to an asset class being perceived as a viable vehicle for investment, legitimacy is vital. Rana Yared, an executive from Goldman Sachs, has vouched for Bitcoin's legitimacy. Such confidence from a respected firm like Sachs only serves to enhance the virtual currency's reputation among mainstream investors. There have also been reports of a Chinese investor having purchased 10,000 Bitcoins in a bear run earlier this year.\nIt isn't just Wall Street where Bitcoin is being embraced, however. The increased adoption of Bitcoin by online and offline merchants will further encourage the general public to learn what it is, how it works, and how it can be used. While it can seem confusing at first, sites such as bitcoins.net aim to inject some clarity into the subject through its series of guides. With its already growing popularity, along with such readily available information to help its immersion into the mainstream, Bitcoin is looking more and more like a force to be reckoned with, both in the short-term and long-term.\nSEC takes notice\n\" Bitcoin, bitcoin coin, physical bitcoin, \" ( CC BY-SA 2.0 ) by antanacoins\nWith such bodies as the SEC (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) sitting up and taking notice, the general belief is that Bitcoin is largely free from regulatory troubles. Kelly said that this is a factor in the increased price of the cryptocurrency. Reports suggest that the SEC is looking into whether some alt coins are valid securities. Kelly believes that, as for Bitcoin, there's no doubt that it's a currency. The conference proved that he isn't alone in that opinion.\nThere certainly seems to be a buzz surrounding Bitcoin at the moment, which Kelly believes will only heighten, in light of New York's Blockchain Summit Week. Bitcoin Foundation founder Charle Schrem saying that the currency would never again trade under $10,000.\nImage Source: Pixabay\nThe post Bitcoin Here to Stay, Says Brian Kelly (CEO, BKCM LLC) appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bkcm llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoover institute monetary policy conference", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T00:50:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a8a5d335789c3de685e526888087d1f9db71128c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YklapIoEiFwgOpSvFtysoe9pWCIz2YVjI8CsJFxp4RUOCMKNMpfYdZjSNxeQq.n_DDTq_W1tlJVoKrOuEgsqPy2A-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "6-in-1 bitcoin chart for a 1-STOP view.

Here are other life-changing uses you didn’t know about. Bill Gates expressed deep skepticism about the prospects of bitcoin despite faith in the cryptocurrency's underlying technology. Gates told CNBC \"Squawk Box\" journalist Becky Quick on Monday in an interview that bitcoin is \"one of the crazier, speculative things\" he's seen. The technology titan, philanthropist and world's second-richest person declined to reveal insight into a \"fantasy\" investment portfolio that he runs for fun to gauge his ability to beat the market. (His actual net worth is managed by a team of real-life investors.) But he made an exception for bitcoin, which is billed as a way to safely store and exchange encrypted value online. \"I'd short it if there was an easy way to do it,\" he said. \"Shorting\" is a financial way of betting against an asset. If the asset declines in valuation, the investor's bet pays off. If it increases, the bet loses. Bitcoin fell by nearly $30 in the minutes after Gates' comments. Gates said he had been given bitcoin as a birthday gift a few years ago but sold it soon thereafter.

The use of bitcoin as currency really is not possible. But bitcoin is also very good to see as a currency for future payments.\n People make majority, and people have a choice to use Bitcoin as they like.

Roger Ver – who has earned the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus” for his advocacy of Bitcoin from the early years, believes that Bitcoin could lose its leading position in the cryptocurrency sphere.\nHe says cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have better technologies and are well positioned to generate substantial gains in the days to come.\nEthereum coins currently trade around $700 USD with the market capitalization of $69 billion. Its price and market cap is substantially lower than Bitcoin’s price of $9,000 USD and market cap of over $149 billion. Bitcoin Cash stands at the fourth spot in cryptocurrency ranking – with its price of $1,500 and the market cap of $24 billion. How Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash Outshine Bitcoin\nAlthough Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash price appreciated at a faster pace than bitcoin over the last month, both coins are still standing far behind bitcoin.\nRoger Ver says Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash will generate massive gains in the days to come compared to Bitcoins modest gains. This movement will allow ETH and BTC to outshine BTC.\nHe said , “ I see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent,” Mr. Ver told The Independent. “Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year, and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020 .”\nThe Bitcoin expert further claims that the Bitcoin blockchain technology offers slower transaction times and higher fees compared to several other newer technologies. The cryptocurrency market has seen the inclusion of more than 1,500 digital coins since Bitcoin’s commencement in 2009 and each cryptocurrency technology is trying to beat Bitcoin’s flaws.\n>>Bitcoin Price Drops Below $9,000\nHe further claims that utility of Bitcoin Cash would allow it to stand at around $100,000 USD in the future. He added, “It’s not guaranteed, but it is much more likely to happen than not. Bitcoin cash has more than doubled in value in the last month, and big investors are coming in soon could see it double again by next week.

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30–40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night's move marked the first new low since the trading range (TR) formed 3 weeks ago:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading Range\nUntil last night's drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR — signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat.\nSometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume View\nAt the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side. The reaction to this lower price range will give us further insight as to the upcoming market movements. This is the first sign of weakness in our current trend, so it stands to reason that we will see a bounce in price to retest the resistance within the TR and further test the supply/demand of the market. Without proper distribution, its unlikely to see a sustained continuation of the downtrend, but at this point we shouldn't rule anything out. On the short term, we can expect a retest of the $8,800s and possibly the lower $9K values.\nA somewhat alarming development is occurring as a consequence of this drop. Shortly after the market saw a golden cross of the 50/200 EMAs on the daily chart, we saw a definitive puncture of that support. Typically, the market doesn't just plunge through the 200 EMA without seeing some sort of resistance, but a daily candle close below the 200 EMA marks a more macro bearish signal. That, combined with a Bollinger Band expansion, gives us an indication that the move downward may, on a macro scale, be a prolonged move over the coming days and weeks:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro View\nSummary: A strong move downward brought the entire crypto market to its knees as bitcoin saw an $800 drop in a few short hours.\nThis move marked the first sign of weakness in our current uptrend\nThe sign of weakness combined with macro signals interacting with the Bollinger Bands and 50/200 EMAs hint toward a possible macro move downward.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Pine, the anonymous benefactor of the fund, thanked everyone who contributed and supported the project.\nThe Pineapple Fund donated 5,104 bitcoins to about 60 charities around the world. Due to the decline in the value of the crypto since the December 2017, the total amount donated was $55.75 million. Some of the beneficiaries include the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF) , Pencils of Promise, and the Internet Archive.\nThe OMF funds research into complex and chronic diseases. It received a total of $5 million in bitcoin donations from the fund. Pencils of Promise received $1.25 million worth of bitcoin. The organization focuses on improving the education infrastructure in countries like Laos, Ghana, and Guatemala. The Internet Archive is an online library that provides books and software free of charge. It received about $2 million in bitcoin from the fund between December 2017 and May 2018.\nOther beneficiaries include the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and GiveDirectly. MAPS focuses on PTSD therapies using psychedelics while GiveDirectly supports the transfer of money to people in need. According to Pine, the fund received tens of thousands of applications from charities around the world.\nSpeaking in the farewell message, Pine expressed gratitude to all who took part in the project, saying:\nI want to thank everyone for supporting this project. Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.\nPositive Bitcoin Contributions to Humanity The efforts of the mysterious donor known only as Pine, through the Pineapple fund shows the positive impact that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can have. In a time when the technology is maligned in the mainstream arena as being an enabler of crime, stories like this help to change the narrative.\nBack in December, Pine promised to donate 5,057 bitcoins to charities, and the donor achieved the target. The donor even surpassed the mark by 47 bitcoins (approximately $430,000).\nWhat are your views on the philanthropic work of the Pineapple fund?

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30–40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night’s move marked the first new low since the trading range (TR) formed 3 weeks ago:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading Range\nUntil last night’s drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR — signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat. Sometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume View\nAt the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side. The reaction to this lower price range will give us further insight as to the upcoming market movements. This is the first sign of weakness in our current trend, so it stands to reason that we will see a bounce in price to retest the resistance within the TR and further test the supply/demand of the market. Without proper distribution, its unlikely to see a sustained continuation of the downtrend, but at this point we shouldn’t rule anything out. On the short term, we can expect a retest of the $8,800s and possibly the lower $9K values.\nA somewhat alarming development is occurring as a consequence of this drop. Shortly after the market saw a golden cross of the 50/200 EMAs on the daily chart, we saw a definitive puncture of that support. Typically, the market doesn’t just plunge through the 200 EMA without seeing some sort of resistance, but a daily candle close below the 200 EMA marks a more macro bearish signal. That, combined with a Bollinger Band expansion, gives us an indication that the move downward may, on a macro scale, be a prolonged move over the coming days and weeks:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro View Summary: A strong move downward brought the entire crypto market to its knees as bitcoin saw an $800 drop in a few short hours. This move marked the first sign of weakness in our current uptrend The sign of weakness combined with macro signals interacting with the Bollinger Bands and 50/200 EMAs hint toward a possible macro move downward.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

You may soon get the chance.\nFacebook is reportedly considering launching its own cryptocurrency for its more than 2 billion users to make payments worldwide, according to a report from Cheddar .\n“They are very serious about it,” one anonymous source told the news outlet.\nWe don’t know too many details about the rumored currency, but Facebook has supposedly been looking into blockchain , the technology behind secure digital transactions, for the past year. Reportedly joining Morgan Beller, a member of Facebook’s development team, in researching blockchain is the company’s vice president of Messenger , David Marcus, who will lead an expanded team. Marcus, an early Bitcoin investor and board member at Coinbase, interestingly worked at Paypal, a service people can use to make payments on Messenger.\nThe social media juggernaut, which banned cryptocurrency ads earlier this year, confirmed its curiosity in a statement to Cheddar but kept things vague.\n“Like many other companies Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology,” a spokesperson said. “This new small team will be exploring many different applications. We don’t have anything further to share.”\nYou still shouldn’t expect to make digital payments on Facebook or its other platforms for a while—perhaps years. Marcus told CNBC in February that despite his interest in the blossoming technology, it won’t play a roll in the platform anytime soon.\n“Payments using crypto right now is just very expensive, super slow, so the various communities running the different blockchains and the different assets need to fix all the issues, and then when we get there someday, maybe we’ll do something,” he said.

Pine, the anonymous benefactor of the fund, thanked everyone who contributed and supported the project.\nThe Pineapple Fund donated 5,104 bitcoins to about 60 charities around the world. Due to the decline in the value of the crypto since the December 2017, the total amount donated was $55.75 million. Some of the beneficiaries include the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF) , Pencils of Promise, and the Internet Archive.\nThe OMF funds research into complex and chronic diseases. It received a total of $5 million in bitcoin donations from the fund. Pencils of Promise received $1.25 million worth of bitcoin. The organization focuses on improving the education infrastructure in countries like Laos, Ghana, and Guatemala. The Internet Archive is an online library that provides books and software free of charge. It received about $2 million in bitcoin from the fund between December 2017 and May 2018.\nOther beneficiaries include the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and GiveDirectly. MAPS focuses on PTSD therapies using psychedelics while GiveDirectly supports the transfer of money to people in need. According to Pine, the fund received tens of thousands of applications from charities around the world.\nSpeaking in the farewell message, Pine expressed gratitude to all who took part in the project, saying:\nI want to thank everyone for supporting this project. Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry. Positive Bitcoin Contributions to Humanity\nThe efforts of the mysterious donor known only as Pine, through the Pineapple fund shows the positive impact that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can have. In a time when the technology is maligned in the mainstream arena as being an enabler of crime, stories like this help to change the narrative.\nBack in December, Pine promised to donate 5,057 bitcoins to charities, and the donor achieved the target. The donor even surpassed the mark by 47 bitcoins (approximately $430,000).\nWhat are your views on the philanthropic work of the Pineapple fund?

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30–40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night's move marked the first new low since the trading range (TR) formed 3 weeks ago:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading Range\nUntil last night's drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR — signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat.\nSometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume View\nAt the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side. The reaction to this lower price range will give us further insight as to the upcoming market movements. This is the first sign of weakness in our current trend, so it stands to reason that we will see a bounce in price to retest the resistance within the TR and further test the supply/demand of the market. Without proper distribution, its unlikely to see a sustained continuation of the downtrend, but at this point we shouldn't rule anything out. On the short term, we can expect a retest of the $8,800s and possibly the lower $9K values.\nA somewhat alarming development is occurring as a consequence of this drop. Shortly after the market saw a golden cross of the 50/200 EMAs on the daily chart, we saw a definitive puncture of that support. Typically, the market doesn't just plunge through the 200 EMA without seeing some sort of resistance, but a daily candle close below the 200 EMA marks a more macro bearish signal. That, combined with a Bollinger Band expansion, gives us an indication that the move downward may, on a macro scale, be a prolonged move over the coming days and weeks:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro View\nSummary:\nA strong move downward brought the entire crypto market to its knees as bitcoin saw an $800 drop in a few short hours.\nThis move marked the first sign of weakness in our current uptrend\nThe sign of weakness combined with macro signals interacting with the Bollinger Bands and 50/200 EMAs hint toward a possible macro move downward.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

(KFSN) —\nWhat some may name the future of foreign money is sitting in the nook of this CellPros shop in Northwest Fresno on Ashlen Avenue– a Bitcoin ATM.\n“All you need is simply an ID, four quick taps on the display, lower than 60 seconds and you may personal cryptocurrency,” stated Coinme director of selling Dom Garrett.\nIt all starts together with your ID, that goes within the ATM and a profile is created, which acts as a virtual pockets.\n“You don’t have to put in your password, you don’t have to put in any usernames, it is all proper here in your ID,” stated Garrett.\nYou set in your money and congratulations, now you personal some Bitcoin. That foreign money can be used to make purchases at certain online outlets or you can also make an investment.\n“You’ll be able to simply save bit, by bit and be capable of throw 20 bucks in at a time and watch it grow,” stated Garrett.\nTech company Coinme has almost 50 of those across the U.S.– two of those are in Fresno. Garrett stated they added the second machine last month because of elevated curiosity. The first ATM was put within the Tower District last September, in the CellPros on Olive Avenue.\n“And during the last couple of months it has grow to be certainly one of our prime performing machines,” stated Garrett.\nRight now you’ll be able to solely purchase Bitcoin on the ATM, but Garrett stated in the coming week’s individuals will have the ability to change their cryptocurrency for money.\n(Copyright ©2018 KFSN-TV.
