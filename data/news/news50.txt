Moreover, more and more analysts are pointing to some financial crisis after another as each day goes by. Whether it is because of the cessation of QE, or because of the issues in Italy, or trade wars, etc., we are clearly not lacking for any reasons as to why this market should crash.\nThe problem is that most bubble-callers have no objective perspective through which they can determine that any market is in a bubble. As an example, one article I recently read suggests we are in a bubble in the Nasdaq because we have exceeded the 2000 bubble high in the market. Well, along those lines, maybe the Dow should not have exceeded the “bubble high” it struck in 1929!?\nNow, I want to highlight the ultimate intellectual dishonesty and inconsistency in most of their thinking regarding bubbles. You see, many of these same analysts are looking for a massive rally in gold. Yet, one has to wonder why they can logically see gold rally well past its “bubble high” struck in 2011, but they are unable to accept any other market rallying beyond their “bubble highs” struck in recent history? I think one has to start viewing much of the analysis being published today as more emotionally-based rather than analytically-based.\nFor those that have followed my analysis through the years, you know that I use Elliott Wave analysis to provide me with an objective context through which I am able to analyze markets. This methodology allowed me to identify the high in gold in 2011 within $6 of the high struck, as well as buy back into the market right at the lows almost 2 years ago. This same methodology allowed us to catch the lows in the US Dollar in 2011, and called for a multi-year rally in the DXY to the 103.50 region when most everyone else at the time was looking for a dollar crash, especially when you consider all of the QE thrown at the market (another fundamental analysis failure). And, this methodology has kept us on the correct side of the equity market, as we have been looking to exceed 2600SPX for years, when most others were quite certain this bull market was going to end years ago.\nYou see, Elliott Wave analysis provides the context for viewing markets objectively, and in a non-linear fashion. So, just because one views a market as having struck a “bubble high” years ago does not mean that the market will not well exceed those highs in the future. And, the perfect example we are seeing set up like that is in the crypto-world as well.\nWhile many have told me that the fundamentals suggest that crypto’s should be closer to zero than they are today, the structure of the market suggests that we could be setting up for a major rally in 2018. And, anyone who really wants to understand the crypto market’s should be following Ryan Wilday, as he is the most accurate crypto-analyst I have seen. In fact, he nailed the bottom we struck in ETH last week, and is now providing guidelines to determine when that bottom is confirmed.\nWeekly Opportunities In Cryptocurrency: Bottom Held - Can We Go?\nSo, based upon Ryan's analysis, it does not look like it is highly likely that the crypto-bubble-callers will be correct in their assessments.\nAnd, I don’t think the bubble-callers for the stock market will fare any better. You see, the action we have seen over the last several months have been corrective, and support our expectation that the S&P500 is still pointing to 3000.\nLast weekend, I noted that once we break below 2700SPX, it will have us looking down to the 2600-2650SPX region. While I had initially thought we could see one more micro rally towards my ideal target at 2758SPX, the market only reached a high of 2742SPX, so we came up about 16 points short of my ideal target. It certainly reminds me that there is no way one can be 100% accurate when dealing with our non-linear markets.\nBut, the break down below 2700SPX still came up short of our target below as well. This now places the market in a position wherein it will likely tell us in the coming week whether the drop below 2700 has completed all the pullback we are going to see before we rally to 3000, or if we are still setting up to drop to the 2600-2650SPX region.\nAs long as we remain below the 2742/53SPX resistance, the market still retains the potential to drop down to those lower targets. However, if we rally through 2753SPX, then it certainly increases the probabilities we have begun our trek to 3000SPX in 2018.\nSee charts illustrating the wave counts on the S&P 500.\n****", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/scharts/Charts-on-S-P-INX-201806031849.html", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4178947-weekly-opportunities-cryptocurrency-bottom-held-can-go", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avi gilburt", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T17:20:08.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "674adb51023b2a65f1b192b8dabc4dd181842caa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfOC3d3g8ENMild9NjZiD25lk2NKvQbyDzS4IOOTSQ77hgBzN9ec1WLXQ18J9tiCS5sJcDbqcixomU", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "(Repost) Gavin Andresen about Bitcoin", "title_full": "(Repost) Gavin Andresen about Bitcoin : btc", "published": "2018-06-04T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.526, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "674adb51023b2a65f1b192b8dabc4dd181842caa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfOC3d3g8ENMild9NjZiD25lk2NKvQbyDzS4IOOTSQ77hgBzN9ec1WLXQ18J9tiCS5sJcDbqcixomU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ForumSpy", "published": "2018-06-04T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "(Repost) Gavin Andresen about Bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/ForumSpy\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjw5456Uqg8"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T02:20:34.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f09f3c1a9c736cad96e6250eec685e341d830052", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.VZTnariMfKkg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-04T06:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f09f3c1a9c736cad96e6250eec685e341d830052", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.VZTnariMfKkg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kimpena", "published": "2018-06-04T06:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: SirEGB on June 03, 2018, 07:49:07 PM I think, because they see bitcoin is competitor for their business, and bitcoin transaction cant manipulate by the government.

If you have ever transferred BTC (it has to be Bitcoin) from your wallet to any of the major exchanges, like Kraken, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Binance, or any of the other famous ones, then you are eligible, and would be of great help.\n**What's the point of this you may ask?**The thesis statement of my masters project states that not all centralized exchanges have proper storage means for our assets. And through blockchain analysis, I would like to test that claim, but in order to recognize one exchange from another, I need to identify patterns in how they move money around on the blockchain. Therefore I need data from people that regularly trade Bitcoin and put Bitcoin on exchanges.\nData from any time period can be used (even as early as 2010, hehe). I hope this sort of stuff is allowed.\nI am giving away 750$ USD payed in Bitcoin to one of the people who answers. Of course you will remain anonymous, simply state in the thread that you have answered, not when you answered or what you answered.\nOnly a few rules:\nAs many entries as you want, as long as they're relevant.

That’s not all, for us to be confident that Bitcoin buyers would add to the five percent it has in the last week, then volume spikes must accompany that up-thrust.\nIt is true that banks are really finding it hard to adjust to new competition. But, the thing is, what powers their nemesis, cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is not going anywhere anytime.\nIt is changing how things are being done. Unfortunately, playing along is but inevitable.\nSo, over the weekend Bittrex through their CEO Bill Shihara did announce that they now have a new partnership with New York’s signature.

The asset fluctuates below and above the price of $7,500. In other words, it fluctuates between the levels of $7,613 and $7,303. However, if the asset traded above the price of $7,500 it would be resisted at $ 7,613. Similarly, if the asset traded below the price of $7,500, it would fall to the low of $7,303. Today, Bitcoin is currently trading at $7,697.52 and has broken the resistance level attempting to reach the high of $8,000. However, from the 4- hour chart, the price of Bitcoin has broken the trend line and the candlestick closed on the opposite of the trend line. The implication of this movement is that the bearish pressure of the asset might have ended. However, the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average indicating that price of Bitcoin is rising. BTC/USD Short-term Trend: Bullish On the hourly chart, the price of Bitcoin is in a bullish market. Price of the asset fell to the low of $7,039.41 and commenced a bullish movement.

With the tokens kept we will build an fully feautred Airdrop platform and exchange for our token. Our unique platform makes Airdrop campaigns cheaper and more effective for ICOs and almost twice as valuable for users. We want good blockchain projects to achieve their funding goals and reward the users as much as possible for their help to make that happen!\nEveryone wins and at the same time we positively impact the world as we help more good blockchain projects succeed.\nToken Supply, Allocation, and Value Metrics ​\nThe metrics of token creation are proportionally weighted to the project's ratings and the referral tokens estimated value.\nThe value of 1 SHARE token will be Total Asset Pool / Circulating Supply (the rest of the tokens will be locked in cold storage, only released when earned via airdrops, aside from the initial 50,000 SHAREs allocated for start up)\nFor example: We award SHARE tokens at a rate of 1 per $1 est. value of referral tokens.\nThis means they are created with a rough estimated value at $.90+ each, with $.90+ of tokens arriving to the asset pool backing them. The remaining $.10 or less (it scales down as we grow) is used to website/exchange development, marketing partners, etc.\nWe will not attempt to beat the market. Our formula is simple, sell half relatively quickly (but not to harm the price, we will work with ICOs), then sell the rest when in adequate profits. We also may operate a few masternodes. Under this model, the value of our asset pool should only perpetually increase.\nFor TOP RATED ICOs/tokens we award the full amount of SHAREs. Based on average review ratings and our personal interactions with the teams to verify their authenticity.\nFor lower rated projects we will award fewer SHAREs per $ given away to protect the value of our asset pool and tokens with the increased risk.\nWe will NOT be performing an ICO. Instead, in order to initially pay for marketing, development services and launch a small bounty program, we have allocated 50,000 tokens to the circulating supply. These tokens will be quickly averaged out as the asset pool fills via referral actions from the 100,000 active users who seek airdrops daily that will find and use our platform.\nThe Maintenance fees will be variable depending on the qualified users entered for the day\n10k Users or more = 10% Maint. / 90% ref tokens to Pool\n25k Users or more = 6% Maint. / 94% to Pool\n65k Users or more = 3.5% Maint / 96.5% to Pool\n100k Users of more = 2.5% Maint / 97.5% to Pool\nThis ensures we have operational funding regardless of initial qualified user base.\nFor example: 100k users x $10 in airdrops x 30 days = 30,000,000 SHARE tokens distributed and $29,250,000 to the asset pool.\nAsset pool $29,250,000 divided by Circulating supply 30,050,000 = $.973 per token. That's from just one month of operation at full capacity, without accounting for asset pool performance and gains.\nReferral tokens will also be given out initially, so the supply may be up to twice as large if everyone enters our airdrops through someone else's link. But as we capture our audience and reward their loyalty the vast majority of our userbase will enter directly through our channels. They will only be created when value is added to the pool, and proportionally so.\nRoadMap ​\nBefore we can begin to deliver all the features promised in the final version of our web platform, we will focus on forming partnerships for marketing and ICO services. We are not performing an ICO or asking our users for any funds.\nWe have started an Ambassador and Marketing Partner program , as well as a generous compensation package for referring ICOs who need our Airdrop Services. We are actively seeking projects who want perform Airdrops (and save a ton of tokens and headache) by using our services, hosted via our partnered platforms (i.e. Westart.co ).\nOnce our userbase grows and we begin to collect enough tokens to be operational we will hired the necessary web developers to build our website where we will integrate features necessary to properly verify and reward users, host the exchange, bounties, airdrops, etc.\nOur exchange will next on the list. We will build our own exchange where users may exchange their SHAREs for the ETH backing them in the asset pool. A fee will be charged and the token burned. The fee will remain in the asset pool and the circulating supply will diminish, increasing the value of all remaining SHAREs each time this occours\nWe are open for questions.\n-ShareDrop Team", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://westart.co/project/icst-airdrop?ref=64550", "https://www.reddit.com/u/Sharedrop", "https://sharedrops.io/", "https://t.me/ShareDrops", "https://www.facebook.com/ShareDropOfficial/", "https://medium.com/@Share_Drops", "https://steemit.com/@sharedrops", "https://steemit.com/contest/@sharedrops/sharedrop-weekly-update-5", "https://twitter.com/Share_Drops", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/sharedropofficial/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T07:40:56.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35ffa253892a7df5f1a7b299822fcd8745f13b14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTbgpQ0JRvp.3.5MbwAmRSM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "How does Bitcoin change the economy?", "title_full": "How does Bitcoin change the economy?", "published": "2018-06-04T05:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.045, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35ffa253892a7df5f1a7b299822fcd8745f13b14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTbgpQ0JRvp.3.5MbwAmRSM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Evil eye", "published": "2018-06-04T05:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "How does Bitcoin change the economy?", "text": "Bitcoin is currently being used as the medium of exchange for money.

Some skeptics consider Bitcoin to be the tulip bubble of the 21st century, but it’s really not so simple.\nBitcoin: Bubble or New Global Currency? Let’s consider the theory of Hyman Minsky, the U.S. economist whose theories on financial fragility were highlighted during the 2008 collapse of the housing market. , he believed that an asset bubble has five stages: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking, and panic.\nUnder this framework, policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Joost van der Burgt, says that if Bitcoin is in fact a bubble, it’s likely at the beginning of the ‘profit-taking’ stage, meaning that ‘panic’ is not here yet, but is coming.\nLooking back, according to van der Burgt, the ‘displacement’ phase of the bubble came in the years after the release of the Bitcoin white paper in October 2008. In those early stages, the concept of the coin was catching on, but it didn’t happen over night.\nRemember, Bitcoin didn’t trade above $100 until 2013.\nThe next phase was the ‘boom’ phase, which van der Burgt describes as follows:\n“The subsequent ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.”\nIn this stage, fear of missing out (FOMO) saw companies attempting to capitalize on the industry by getting involved with coins and blockchain. In some cases, companies simply added the word blockchain to their names in attempts to stir up interest from investors.\nThen came celebrities, like Steven Seagal and Floyd Mayweather, who attempted to get a piece of the action by endorsing newly developed cryptocurrencies.\nUnfortunately, in most cases, these companies with celebrity endorsements have more often that not been exposed as frauds and subsequently shut down.\nMoving closer to the present, van der Burgt argues that the Bitcoin bubble entered the ‘euphoric’ stage, which he claims parallels the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.\n“The euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments,” van der Burgt wrote. “According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance.”\nNow, after the price of Bitcoin lost more than half its value since peaking in late-December 2017, van der Burgt believes that the market is entering the ‘profit-taking’ stage, a phase where so-called smart money begins to head for the exits, leaving only one step left before the bubble pops.\n“The subsequent ‘panic’ phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and bitcoin’s price would substantially crash,” wrote van der Burgt.\nFortunately, van der Burgt admits that he could be wrong, and that, as we here at NewsBTC believe, the digital coin will (despite the volatility week to week or month to month) continue to rise in value. He writes:\n“Then again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency.”\nWhile it is possible that Bitcoin’s rise is in some ways comparable to a bubble, it’s almost impossible to truly know. One thing worth remembering is that the coin and the underlying blockchain technology have a plethora of real-world applications (tulips, it can be said, are simply decoration), and as van der Burgt states, it could become a “new global currency.” I think that’s much more likely.\nMy Opinion The Bitcoin to me personally isn't anything close to a bubble says Samuel Asingba, the CEO of BitInvestors Club. It's unlike anything we've ever seen and there's no concluding what it'll become whether a global currency (which is more likely to happen or should I say is happening) or a bubble (which I know it's not). Prior to this time, as a Nigerian, I had a lot of restrictions receiving funds and helping people the little way I can just because I was under several political, economical and regional restrictions but right now I can do business with anyone, anywhere in the world. I can now send donations to support any project all around to globe.\nRemember the internet was also seen as another bubble or should I call it a useless, scattered and inefficient system but today we've all bought into that vision.\nThere's no predicting where the Bitcoin would go! In fact, its a risk I'm willing to take personally.... Remember, things always seem impossible until they are done by a strong willed people or person.\nForget all the so called experts in finance, it's a pretty new system and majority of them understands little to nothing on how the system really works (The blockchain technology, Decentralized nature of this crypto economy e.t.c.) The Bitcoin didn't start today, it's been through much and yet survived.\nYou don't understand something doesn't make it jargon.\nAnd about celebrities endorsing cryptocurrencies, truth is; most of them were paid and they know little to nothing about cryptos, They just wanted profits.\nTill now, I and my Team members still invests in some HYIPs and teaches others how to do the same and reducing risk... In fact during the \"Cryptocurrency High Yield Lending Programs\" Saga, I personally recommended programs that didn't work at some point but we didn't lose funds either... After ICOs, We cashed out and discovered that after BitConnect Crashed all the other lending platforms followed the same page and gradually died off...\nDon't miss the Bitcoin opportunity, it'll change your life.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyman minsky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve bank of san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T04:48:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e3b88911f371755b1514a129ba526551d99666e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSW.LqMXGAaDUlyesdE9ZY5BuOYP8SkOt5YQUnVkXTHZd13sZlXcrLh5d3VmUY5aF2Q--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Five years ago, I shared an article to r/silkroad urging people to buy Bitcoin despite the price doubling after the Cyprus bailout.

But rather than coding their own solutions, grin’s contributors are all about adopting technology that’s been reviewed and approved by a circle of experts.\nAs the team wades into their second test stage, preparing to launch a working payment system, they’ve been among the first to implement Schnorr, Bulletproofs and Dandelion, all promising technologies originally intended to improve bitcoin’s scale and privacy, but that just haven’t made it into the hard-to-change cryptocurrency just yet.\nLead grin developer Igno Peverell, named after an obscure Harry Potter character, told CoinDesk:\n“Testnet 2 was and is likely to stay our largest release in terms of new technology.”\nIt’s also ambitious. In turning MimbleWimble into a real, working software for payments, the developer team behind grin has added features that have been years in the making.\n“Signature aggregation,” for instance, has been in the works for bitcoin since 2014 and is one of its most highly anticipated code changes. Pioneered by Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille, the project “MuSig” has the potential to lump signature data together and free up space in the blockchain.\nA working prototype has already been implemented, though it’s unclear when it will be added to bitcoin and if the community will ultimately embrace the change. Scalability boost\nTherein lies one advantage of grin, which is more quickly putting such ideas to the test with real value.\nBitcoin is a living payment system, so developers and the community are particularly cautious when making changes that could be dangerous to its users.\n“Bitcoin developers have working implementations of MuSig, but deploying it on the mainnet will take time. Actually, it must absolutely not be rushed,” said cryptography expert Yannick Seurin, who’s been helping with the cryptography behind MuSig at cybersecurity agency ANSSI.\nBut grin is launching a blockchain from scratch, so it’s easier for the developer team to adopt sweeping changes – at least while the blockchain is still small.\n“Since Grin is more experimental, they can afford testing newer primitives such as MuSig,” Seurin continued.\nIt’s worth noting though that in grin, signature aggregation plays a much more fundamental role. Unlike bitcoin, grin uses signature aggregation by default in transactions to remove data bitcoin normally has to keep to preserve the security of transactions. Privacy boost\nThen there’s bulletproofs, a breakthrough privacy technology unveiled by bitcoin developers late last year.\nThough bitcoin developers are worried about cryptocurrency privacy, and bulletproofs could help significantly with that, there are still major drawbacks. Bulletproof transactions are still too big. Even though the tech is more scalable, bulletproofs require a lot more room on the blockchain than normal transactions. And with users already very concerned about how big existing blockchains are getting, it would probably be pretty difficult to get agreement from everyone to make the change.\nOther blockchains might not care about these downsides though. Privacy-minded monero and litecoin both plan to add this technology soon. And so does grin. Its developers are testing bulletproofs to help with its other main feature: enhancing privacy.\nAnd while bulletproofs might be contentious in bitcoin, grin is a different story. For one, because of the above reliance on signature aggregation, grin is more scalable. So, bulletproofs increasing the size of transactions is not as big of a deal.\nIn fact, MimbleWimble was one use case that drove the innovation.\n“Confidential transactions and Mimblewimble were one of the motivating applications for bulletproofs,” Stanford University PhD student Benedikt Bunz, who pioneered bulletproofs, told CoinDesk.\nThat’s not the only privacy technology they’re adding, however. Peverell contends grin is the first cryptocurrency to adopt Dandelion, a long-proposed privacy addition to bitcoin.\nOnce someone sends cryptocurrency to someone using most blockchains, the transaction is sent to all nodes, without trying to hide where it came from. Because of this, it’s easy to glean the IP address of whoever sent the transaction.\nDandelion introduces a second phase here called “fluffing” the transactions, which “makes it a lot harder to identify where transactions originate from,” Peverell said.\nThough, Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli told CoinDesk he’s optimistic bitcoin will eventually adopt the change, calling it a “pretty important” privacy feature. The reason it hasn’t been implemented in bitcoin is no developers have had time to pick up the task just yet, he argued. Toward reality\nThat’s not to say there won’t be significant hurdles.\nOne rather huge drawback of MimbleWimble’s approach is that in order to get the scalability and privacy benefits, transactions are much simpler than bitcoin’s. That means, it makes it harder to do more complex types of transactions, like requiring two or three people to sign off on a transaction before it can be sent, or to build more scalable infrastructure, such as lightning network, on top of it.\nThere’s still hope, though.\nPeverell is excited about signature aggregation because it can pave the way for still other future technologies, such as scriptless scripts, a technology that could reintroduce a way for users to do these types of complex transactions using grin.\nAccording to Peverell, most of the technical heavy lifting will be out of the way once they finish their second testnet.\nBut there are a number of steps left before they can be sure there aren’t any problems with the payment system and they’re ready to launch. Peverell noted grin is launching yet another testnet (their third) to finalize some changes and stomp out as many bugs as possible.\nThe loose volunteer team also wants to build out the wallet to be more “user-friendly,” since being easy to use is something cryptocurrencies tend to struggle with. And finally, they want a third party to audit Grin’s code.\nThis sounds like a lot, but Peverell hopes they’ll be able to launch the payment system for real by the end of the year, at which point the team can put the experimental concepts its trial to test in a live environment with real funds.\nHe stated:\n“I’m still optimistic for this winter.”\nMicroscope image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If the whales accumulate for a long sideways period, this would give them the ammo they need. So I imagine the next bull run trigger will start with something like that. It could take us spiking down briefly to the $5K range in a flash, before heading back up.\nRunning stops seems to be fundamentally about acquiring product and not so much about effecting the price. Do whales need the coins that are on offer on the exchanges? It seems to me that a whale would interact with an exchange for the purpose of effecting the price more than the purpose of accumulating/liquidating his position. If he were either accumulating or liquidating he would want to do either of those things OTC because if he were accumulating he wouldn't want to drive the price up and if he were liquidating he wouldn't want to drive the price down. So he makes changes to his position OTC but perhaps he tries to use a small portion of his stash to manipulate the price down before making an OTC purchase and vice a verca before making an OTC sale.\nI'm not really trying to argue against you here. I'm mostly just interested in how you will respond to these thoughts.\nI'd think a whale might want run stops to drive down the market price, just to affect the OTC price.

By Telegram\nOn May 11 , the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office reported the arrested of 5 men, with ages ranging from 18 to 21. Local news got a hold of Cpl. Doug Rainwater of the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office who shared the group was planning to rob a local teenager that owned 80 Bitcoins. Authorities Were First Alerted in January 2018\nThe Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office was tipped off to a possible home invasion targeting a man in their county. They were told the suspects would likely be from out of the state and were en route to the forthcoming crime scene. Advertisement\nOn January 29, the Sheriff’s Office responded to a call from a local hotel in regards to an alleged drug operation. The Sheriff’s Office Narcotics Unit was deployed and made contact with four individuals. At the time, there wasn’t enough evidence to keep them in custody. At the scene, Narcotics Detectives found bandanas, zip ties, duct tape and latex gloves.\nMichael McDermont, 18, Jacob South, 21, Trivette Adams, 20, and Matthew Schwartz, 18, were all identified at the scene. Though they were forced to let them go, the Sheriff’s Office Major Crimes Unit continued their investigation.\nLater that night, the Major Crimes Unit successfully established a connection between the four individuals and the earlier tip regarding the robbery. Arrest warrants were acquired, and Detectives started chasing them down.\nCpl. Doug Rainwater corroborated the story in full, saying:\n“Continued investigation by the Sheriff’s Office Major Crimes Unit that night resulted in the connection of the four previously contacted suspects with the planned robbery. Detectives secured arrest warrants for all four suspects and immediately set about attempting to locate them.” Two Caught in Atlanta, Two Fled to Chicago\nOn January 30, all four youngsters went to the Atlanta Airport with the intention to flee the state. However, thanks to a joint effort between the Atlanta Police Department and Forsyth County Deputies, Trivette Adams and Michael McDermont were arrested.\nAuthorities arrived too late at the scene to catch Matthew Schwartz and Jacob South. By the time they reached the airport, they had already fled to Chicago. The Sheriff’s Office then sent two Major Crimes Unit Detectives to Chicago in pursuit.\nOnce there, Forsyth County’s Detectives apprehended both of them, with the assistance of the Chicago Police Department. They were shortly after sent back to Forsyth County, following their arrest. A 5th Suspect was Later Identified\nThough authorities haven’t exactly explained how, they identified a fifth suspect in connection with the Bitcoin robbery, Justin Ellison. Ellison was interrogated in Illinois by Forsyth County’s Detectives at an undisclosed date.\nOn May 10, Justin Ellison was detained by the United States Marshall’s Service in Worth, Illinois. The next day, May 11, Ellison was sent to the Forsyth County Detention Center.\nAt present, all five suspects are detained in the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Detention Center. They’re all being held without bond while awaiting prosecution by the Forsyth County District Attorney’s Office. The Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office Saved the Day\nCpl. Doug Rainwater told local news the initial four suspects had studied the perimeter and knew exactly what they were doing.\n“They knew the premises, knew the routines of the occupants. They had everything figured out,” said Rainwater.\nThe target-victim reportedly had 80 Bitcoins in his possession which, at the time, added up to $800,000.\nRainwater finished with:\n“The Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office is committed to pursuing criminals regardless of where it may take us. Forsyth County is certainly not the place to plan such a criminal act.”\nFollow us on Twitter | Telegram | Facebook Featured Image from Shutterstock.

Sluymer, the chief technical strategist at Fundstrat believes the number one cryptocurrency will soon begin to recover. The crypto analyst pointed to international trade tensions and the developing situation in Italy as some of the reasons behind the imminent Bitcoin revival.\n$7,000 Is The Bitcoin's Bottom Speaking via telephone with CNBC , Sluymer identified $7,000 as the bottom price level for Bitcoin.\nWhen we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen. We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here.\nAccording to Sluymer, Bitcoin has declined several times in 2018 but has hardly ever dropped below $7,000. The only exception was at the start of February 2018 when BTC prices plunged to $6,000, its lowest level since November 2017. Towards the end of May, BTC prices fell to $7,054 but didn’t slide lower than the $7,000 threshold. Sluymer believes this is a positive development for the number one cryptocurrency saying:\nThat’s certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold.\nIf Bitcoin has indeed found a stable bottom price limit, then the next step would be a price rally. In December 2017, BTC prices reached a record high of $19,500. However, 2018 has been a challenging year not just for Bitcoin but the entire cryptocurrency market as well.\nMarket Indicators Show $7,800 as the Next Price Hurdle Sluymer points to market indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as signs that BTC is gaining some momentum in preparation for a rally. Looking at the chart below, Bitcoin’s RSI is currently at 40. Typically, RSI of 30 and above indicate oversold conditions.\nAs a result, Sluymer thinks now is the best time to go long on BTC saying:\nWe [Fundstrat] think the setup is very attractive here. If you’re short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.\nAccording to Sluymer, $7,800 is the next threshold level for Bitcoin to surpass. Since May 23, BTC hasn’t reached the $7,800 mark. Sluymer is confident that all the indicators point to at least a short-term rally in that direction, saying:\nThe next thing that has to happen is to see Bitcoin actually rally through the downtrend and we use the 15-day moving average, it’s very simplistic, but it’s a pretty good proxy across most markets. Its 15-day moving average of roughly $7,800 “will be the next hurdle for it to get through.\nFellow Fundstrat analyst, Tom Lee has on many occasions said that BTC would trade at $20,000 by the middle of the year and even reach the $25,000 by the end of 2018.\nDo you Bitcoin prices have reached their lowest level?

If the upward movement of bitcoin fades and the dominant cryptocurrency is unable to bounce back quickly to the higher end of $7,700, a bleed out to the $6,000 region can be expected. Conditional Rally\nThe corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,700 sparked significant optimism, especially amongst short-term bulls that have predicted the price of bitcoin would rebound back to the $10,000 region within June. While the $10,000 June target is still in play, another correction in the upcoming days will likely occur, given that the corrective rally from $7,040 has stopped at $7,700 and BTC has declined to $7,600.\nA short-term break out to the $8,000 region supported by the corrective rally from $7,040 was conditional, as it required the volume of BTC to spike and the cryptocurrency to sustain momentum at its weekly peak, in the $7,700 region.\nHowever, due to its low trading volume, BTC has failed to test a major short-term support level at $8,000 and fell to $7,600. A drop to $7,500 could result in BTC experiencing yet another minor correction, potentially to the higher end of $6,000.\nWhile the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of BTC is 43.3, it is not demonstrating an oversold condition for BTC. A further drop in BTC would not lead the RSI to drop by large margins and thus, a short-term turn around back to the $7,700 mark if BTC falls to $7,500 is unlikely.\nThe daily candle on June 4 was supposed to be the big short-term break for BTC, rising above the one-month descending trendline from May 6 and effectively establishing a bottom at $7,040. But, the recent decline in the price of BTC will likely send BTC back to the lower end of $7,000 or in worst case scenario, to the $6,000 region. Short-Term Not Important\nDespite the negative price trend of BTC, most multi-billion dollar hedge funds are still extremely optimistic in BTC and the entire cryptocurrency market.\nThe expected decline in the price of BTC is a 5 to 10 percent drop maximum, which could extend to 15 percent at its worst. But, as Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead stated, which oversees more than a billion dollars in cryptocurrencies and digital assets, hedge funds look at the 5 to 10-year trend of the market.\nIn the mid to long-term, Morehead stated that bitcoin is still a screaming buy, adding:\n“As digital tokens continue to multiply and gain wider use, the $400 billion crypto market could balloon to $4 trillion, and even $40 trillion is definitely possible. It’s the 10-year forecast.”\nIf BTC recovers gradually from the $6,000 to $7,000 region and establish major support levels with strong and volume in the upcoming months, the $20,000 to $50,000 BTC targets of large-scale investors can still be in play.\nOften, tokens enjoy a surge in volume and price when the price of BTC is increasing gradually and volume of the cryptocurrency market picks up. If BTC enters the $7,500 region, it is likely that tokens will experience a substantial drop in value, once again.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

It was recently visited by the country’s prime minister who got acquainted with its bitcoin strategy. During his visit, the state secretary bought him a cup of coffee using cryptocurrency. Prime Minister Visits BTC City Miro Cerar.\nThe Prime Minister of Slovenia, Miro Cerar, recently visited BTC City, a sprawling, 475,000 meter-squared commercial business and shopping complex in the capital city of Ljubljana.\nFintech startup Eligma has created a point-of-sale system which is being used in a number of retailers in BTC City, in an effort to convert it into a “Bitcoin City.” Describing the commercial complex as “a business and shopping ecosystem based on the latest technological solutions including blockchain, AI, and cryptocurrencies,” Eligma elaborated:\nThe purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, as well as to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become Bitcoin City.\nDuring the morning meeting, Cerar received “a cup of ‘crypto coffee’ bought for him by Slovenian State Secretary Tadej Slapnik through the Elipay cryptocurrency transaction system,” the startup described. Slovenian Prime Minister Dr. Miro Cerar using Elipay. Photo credit: Eligma.\nThe first successful use of the Elipay wallet at the city was to pay, using bitcoin, at the complex’s waterpark in April. Eligma added that the app would also be able to use bitcoin cash and Elipay’s own loyalty rewards token in the near future. BTC City to Become a ‘Genuine Bitcoin City’\nFounded in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics enterprise, BTC company added many warehouses in the northeast of Ljubljana over time. In 1990, the complex was repurposed as a commercial shopping area and adopted the name BTC City. Ever since it has added large commercial ventures including a hotel, a sports complex, a casino, a multiplex cinema, a water park, and the tallest building in Slovenia, the crystal palace office park. With over 500 retail shops, BTC City’s website describes itself as “famous for being the largest and most popular European business, shopping, recreational/leisure and cultural center” in the country. A panoramic image of BTC City from the north.\nWith the latest initiative is to convert BTC City into “a genuine Bitcoin City,” the company claims that the new entity is:\nThe first of its kind in the world to provide its visitors, consumers and business partners with an ecosystem that will develop and integrate advanced technologies based on state-of-the-art approaches (blockchain, AI, VR [Virtual reality], AR [Augmented reality], ML [Machine Learning] and the world of cryptocurrencies).\nBTC company believes that “Bitcoin City will create an open society which will enable users to pursue their missions as well as develop their business environments in line with their wishes, needs, and operating policies.”\nAccording to the plan posted on BTC City’s website, Eligma’s Elipay is already installed in a number of stores within the city such as Atlantis water park, Al Capone, Babadu, Bijoux modni dodatki, Big Bang, istyle, Vodno mesto San Martino, Sneakers, Minicity, and Kibuba. There are also some one-way cryptocurrency ATMs on the premises, as well as a Blockchain Think Tank and the “biggest crypto mining rig in Slovenia.”\nBTC company emphasized:\nThe development of BTC City into a Bitcoin City is an important step towards the realisation of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with freedom and choice regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.\nWhat do you think of BTC City turning into a Bitcoin City?

That is more than households use in the nation of 340,000 people, according to the national energy authority.\nMining is the name for the decentralised process that underpins the integrity of most cryptocurrencies. Effectively, a bunch of computers engage in a race to burn through the most electricity possible and, every 10 minutes, one wins a prize of 12.5 bitcoin for the effort – still worth more than $100,000, despite recent falls.\nAs the price of bitcoin has risen, so too has the amount of electricity that it is economical to use in order to get the rewards. One recent estimate pegged the energy consumption of the entire network as equivalent to that of the Republic of Ireland.\nBut the news from Iceland is the first time cryptocurrency mining within one nation has overtaken productive uses of electricity. Why is Iceland so popular? The answer is simple: location, location and volcanoes. Volcanoes provide Iceland with a cheap and abundant form of renewable energy. Geothermal and hydroelectric plants abound on the island, driving down the wholesale cost of power, which lets bitcoin miners make higher profits as they run their computers 24/7, 365 days a year.\nThe country’s location, at the northernmost tip of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, provides a second benefit beyond a lot of magma. The Arctic air reduces the need to invest in expensive air-conditioning for the server rooms – crucial, since the specialised chips used to mine most cryptocurrencies produce huge amounts of heat when run at their maximum efficiency.\nOf course, even efficient cooling won’t help miners eke out profits if the price of bitcoin falls too far. But at least one company based in Reykjavik can handle quite a bit more devaluation: Genesis Mining moved there in 2014 from Germany, when the price of bitcoin was well under $1,000. “What we are doing here is like gold mining,” Helmut Rauth, the company’s operations manager, told AP. Of course, gold mines eventually run dry. Who knows if the same will happen to bitcoin ones.

We’re doing this for two reasons: we need to address the threat of ASIC miners coming into the Equihash mining space, and we need to take steps to improve the security of our blockchain in light of the recent 51% / Double Spend attacks . New PoW Algo\nOne important change goes a long way to address both of these issues: a change in our Proof of Work algorithm. We’ll be moving our mining algorithm to a different version of Equihash that we’re calling Equihash-BTG, for now. You can read more detail about it on our Forum .\nMost of the necessary components for the Network Upgrade have been coded, but need more thorough testing. We are still working on improving the mining software so that as many people as possible are free to mine as soon as the Network Upgrade happens. Until the mining software was ready, we weren’t able to thoroughly test the new components on a testnet. We’re now making good progress and expect to be able to establish a firmer timeline for the Upgrade shortly, which we intend to share in another update three days from now. Testing and Go-Live Preparations\nPlease note that we will be providing at least seven days’ notice before the Network Upgrade, and perhaps more, depending on what we hear from our critical ecosystem partners. We want this upgrade up and running as soon as possible, but it doesn’t do any good if we upgrade the software before the wallets, mining pools, exchanges, and others are ready. It’s imperative that any of our partners who haven’t yet done so reach out to us to ensure we have the best methods to contact them with further information. (You can reach out to us via support email , or any of our social media channels.) We’ll also be posting detailed information on our Forum and in GitHub. Attention to Security and Community\nWe’re also working hard on many fronts to improve security, both now and in the future . We’ve developed monitoring systems for our blockchain and our mining network, and have established channels to rapidly communicate risks to Exchanges. We plan to expand these tools and make them available to others. We’re also cooperating closely with other coin development teams to share what we’ve learned, and to work together to improve the safety of the crypto space. The recent Double Spend attacks using ZenCash remind us that we’re not out of the woods, yet.\nWe’ve said before that attacks on part of the ecosystem are attacks on us all. It’s also true that if we all work together, we can fight back against these attacks. We can report that the crypto community is coming together and will be supporting each other as we work to get through these difficult times as quickly as possible.\nEarnestly yours, ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T09:53:48.105+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2627f82a2260763b6ba8860eaf42e416228231c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF7qq3IHIX_O5OxyZk_K.tkk6R3avh6N7YXLcn5W7ILUl", "site_full": "www.marketoracle.co.uk", "site": "marketoracle.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Which Is Developing A Bigger Bubble: Bitcoin Or The Stock Market? :: The Market Oracle ::", "title_full": "Which Is Developing A Bigger Bubble: Bitcoin Or The Stock Market? :: The Market Oracle ::", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.702, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2627f82a2260763b6ba8860eaf42e416228231c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF7qq3IHIX_O5OxyZk_K.tkk6R3avh6N7YXLcn5W7ILUl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Market Oracle Ltd", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Which Is Developing A Bigger Bubble: Bitcoin Or The Stock Market? :: The Market Oracle ::", "text": "By: Avi_Gilburt\nBubbles in Nasdaq, bubbles in financial assets, bubbles in cryptos . . . bubbles are being reported everywhere. Moreover, more and more analysts are pointing to some financial crisis after another as each day goes by. Whether it is because of the cessation of QE, or because of the issues in Italy, or trade wars, etc., we are clearly not lacking for any reasons as to why this market should crash.\nThe problem is that most bubble-callers have no objective perspective through which they can determine that any market is in a bubble. As an example, one article I recently read suggests we are in a bubble in the Nasdaq because we have exceeded the 2000 bubble high in the market. Well, along those lines, maybe the Dow should not have exceeded the “bubble high” it struck in 1929!?\nNow, I want to highlight the ultimate intellectual dishonesty and inconsistency in most of their thinking regarding bubbles. You see, many of these same analysts are looking for a massive rally in gold. Yet, one has to wonder why they can logically see gold rally well past its “bubble high” struck in 2011, but they are unable to accept any other market rallying beyond their “bubble highs” struck in recent history? I think one has to start viewing much of the analysis being published today as more emotionally-based rather than analytically-based.\nFor those that have followed my analysis through the years, you know that I use Elliott Wave analysis to provide me with an objective context through which I am able to analyze markets. This methodology allowed me to identify the high in gold in 2011 within $6 of the high struck, as well as buy back into the market right at the lows almost 2 years ago. This same methodology allowed us to catch the lows in the US Dollar in 2011, and called for a multi-year rally in the DXY to the 103.50 region when most everyone else at the time was looking for a dollar crash, especially when you consider all of the QE thrown at the market (another fundamental analysis failure). And, this methodology has kept us on the correct side of the equity market, as we have been looking to exceed 2600SPX for years, when most others were quite certain this bull market was going to end years ago.\nYou see, Elliott Wave analysis provides the context for viewing markets objectively, and in a non-linear fashion. So, just because one views a market as having struck a “bubble high” years ago does not mean that the market will not well exceed those highs in the future. And, the perfect example we are seeing set up like that is in the crypto-world as well.\nWhile many have told me that the fundamentals suggest that crypto’s should be closer to zero than they are today, the structure of the market suggests that we could be setting up for a major rally in 2018. And, anyone who really wants to understand the crypto market’s should be following Ryan Wilday, as he is the most accurate crypto-analyst I have seen. In fact, he nailed the bottom we struck in ETH last week, and is now providing guidelines to determine when that bottom is confirmed.\nWeekly Opportunities In Cryptocurrency: Bottom Held - Can We Go?\nSo, based upon Ryan's analysis, it does not look like it is highly likely that the crypto-bubble-callers will be correct in their assessments.\nAnd, I don’t think the bubble-callers for the stock market will fare any better. You see, the action we have seen over the last several months have been corrective, and support our expectation that the S&P500 is still pointing to 3000.\nLast weekend, I noted that once we break below 2700SPX, it will have us looking down to the 2600-2650SPX region. While I had initially thought we could see one more micro rally towards my ideal target at 2758SPX, the market only reached a high of 2742SPX, so we came up about 16 points short of my ideal target. It certainly reminds me that there is no way one can be 100% accurate when dealing with our non-linear markets.\nBut, the break down below 2700SPX still came up short of our target below as well. This now places the market in a position wherein it will likely tell us in the coming week whether the drop below 2700 has completed all the pullback we are going to see before we rally to 3000, or if we are still setting up to drop to the 2600-2650SPX region.\nAs long as we remain below the 2742/53SPX resistance, the market still retains the potential to drop down to those lower targets. However, if we rally through 2753SPX, then it certainly increases the probabilities we have begun our trek to 3000SPX in 2018.\nSee charts illustrating the wave counts on the S&P 500.\nAvi Gilburt is a widely followed Elliott Wave technical analyst and author of ElliottWaveTrader.net ( www.elliottwavetrader.net ), a live Trading Room featuring his intraday market analysis (including emini S&P 500, metals, oil, USD & VXX), interactive member-analyst forum, and detailed library of Elliott Wave education.\n© 2018 Copyright Avi Gilburt - All Rights Reserved Disclaimer: The above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading just below $7,500, and Ethereum (ETH) is nearly at $600, a coin.\nNews broke early this morning that open-sourced GitHub will be acquired by Microsoft , and this could very well be the reason the market is in the red. Many developers aren’t happy, but I wouldn’t see them cashing in just yet – this may be just newbie investor reactions.\nLet’s take a look at two coins on the market trending today.\nTron (TRX) Update\nJust five days ago, Tron (TRX) launched its main net, and TRX’s price has been all over the place.\nAs you can see, TRX had a sharp price dip and spike just before its launch but has been all over the place ever since.

READ TRON [TRX] Price | TRON Is Outperforming Other Altcoins\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Update\nOn June 2nd, HandCash released a new updated version of their Android App which allows its users to use handles in transactions to specify the address in which they are trying to send BCH.\nThis app was launched back in February and allows BCH holders to pay with a mobile wallet. IT also enables ‘hand-to-hand’ payments between devices without the need of a QR code or address. This is similar to ‘air drops’ done on iPhones. Currently, the app is in its BETA stage. Instant transactions for way less than a penny. Verified in about a second. Use $handles for convenience.\nThis is HandCash.

If the upward movement of bitcoin fades and the dominant cryptocurrency is unable to bounce back quickly to the higher end of $7,700, a bleed out to the $6,000 region can be expected. Conditional Rally\nThe corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,700 sparked significant optimism, especially amongst short-term bulls that have predicted the price of bitcoin would rebound back to the $10,000 region within June. While the $10,000 June target is still in play, another correction in the upcoming days will likely occur, given that the corrective rally from $7,040 has stopped at $7,700 and BTC has declined to $7,600.\nA short-term break out to the $8,000 region supported by the corrective rally from $7,040 was conditional, as it required the volume of BTC to spike and the cryptocurrency to sustain momentum at its weekly peak, in the $7,700 region.\nHowever, due to its low trading volume, BTC has failed to test a major short-term support level at $8,000 and fell to $7,600. A drop to $7,500 could result in BTC experiencing yet another minor correction, potentially to the higher end of $6,000.\nWhile the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of BTC is 43.3, it is not demonstrating an oversold condition for BTC. A further drop in BTC would not lead the RSI to drop by large margins and thus, a short-term turn around back to the $7,700 mark if BTC falls to $7,500 is unlikely.\nThe daily candle on June 4 was supposed to be the big short-term break for BTC, rising above the one-month descending trendline from May 6 and effectively establishing a bottom at $7,040. But, the recent decline in the price of BTC will likely send BTC back to the lower end of $7,000 or in worst case scenario, to the $6,000 region. Short-Term Not Important\nDespite the negative price trend of BTC, most multi-billion dollar hedge funds are still extremely optimistic in BTC and the entire cryptocurrency market.\nThe expected decline in the price of BTC is a 5 to 10 percent drop maximum, which could extend to 15 percent at its worst. But, as Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead stated, which oversees more than a billion dollars in cryptocurrencies and digital assets, hedge funds look at the 5 to 10-year trend of the market.\nIn the mid to long-term, Morehead stated that bitcoin is still a screaming buy, adding:\n“As digital tokens continue to multiply and gain wider use, the $400 billion crypto market could balloon to $4 trillion, and even $40 trillion is definitely possible. It’s the 10-year forecast.”\nIf BTC recovers gradually from the $6,000 to $7,000 region and establish major support levels with strong and volume in the upcoming months, the $20,000 to $50,000 BTC targets of large-scale investors can still be in play.\nOften, tokens enjoy a surge in volume and price when the price of BTC is increasing gradually and volume of the cryptocurrency market picks up. If BTC enters the $7,500 region, it is likely that tokens will experience a substantial drop in value, once again.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.

( SQ ) are surging and show no signs of slowing down amid the cryptocurrency craze and optimism over the company’s latest acquisition. Having announced last November that users were able to buy and sell bitcoin using its mobile app and more recently announcing plans to acquire e-commerce platform Weebly, shares of the mobile payment solution provider have reached new highs, according to Bloomberg. Reaching New Highs\nSquare, co-founded by Twitter Inc. ( TWTR ) co-founder and current CEO Jack Dorsey, allows users to transfer cash among themselves via its Cash App and helps small businesses to process credit card transactions, track sales and inventory data and even obtain financing. As of late last year, the company now allows users to buy and sell bitcoin, and with the announcement in late April that it will acquire Weebly, Square will be even more well equipped to serve creative entrepreneurs and small business owners. (See also: What is Square Inc.? ).\nOver the past year, shares of the payment solutions provider have climbed nearly 160%, bringing its total market cap to $21.7 billion. Since the start of 2018, shares are up as much as 73% as of 11 a.m, EST Monday. If RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin’s prediction that Square’s gross payment volume could comprise 4.1% of total U.S. payments volume in 2026, then there is still plenty of upside left. Driving Forces\nDorsey was quoted in Bloomberg as saying earlier last month that “the internet deserves a native currency,” indicating his support for cryptocurrencies and hinting that Square will continue to improve its compatibility with the virtual currencies, which have exploded over the past year. If the crypto market continues to expand, Square’s early entrance will help propel its value over the long term. (See also: Square to Soar on Crypto Potential, Say Bulls ).\nBy acquiring Weebly, a company that allows entrepreneurs to create websites on which to launch their business ideas, Square immediately benefits from gaining additional revenue.

The original edition of the draft introduces the same caps for crypto donations as for fiat ones, while limiting anonymous contributions to $20. The move renders the overall picture of individual states’ handling political crypto contributions spottier than ever, as the last few months saw states adopting divergent approaches to the issue. image courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nAlthough a 2014 advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) remains a major reference point for anyone who seeks to boost their chances for election with digital money, this non-regulatory document is barely fit to serve as a definitive guide into the world of crypto campaign finance.\nThe FEC came up with a set of guidelines in May 2014, responding to an inquiry from a Super PAC named Make Your Laws. This entity, which advocates for replacing representative democracy with a more inclusive form of ‘ liquid democracy ,’ requested clarification on whether it could accept BTC donations to fund political action. At that time, Bitcoin was worth some $400, and altcoins were not even considered as a vehicle for campaign finance . The FEC ruled that Bitcoin could be received by campaigns as ‘in-kind donations’– a form of contribution that provides goods and services needed for organizations’ operations rather than the money to purchase those goods and services.\nEffectively, this means that campaigns cannot spend received Bitcoin directly, but rather have to ‘liquidate’ it and then deposit the money to their accounts. As far as donation caps are concerned, the commission was split across party lines, with Democrats advocating for a $100 limit, and Republicans standing for the standard federal $2,700 cap. Since the advisory opinion outlines recommendations rather than rules, GOP support for a larger cap had later inspired some politicians to allow themselves to go with the $2,700 limit.\nGiven somewhat inconclusive federal guidelines, many state authorities have been facing similar inquiries ever since the FEC ruling was issued. Building up to the 2018 wave of primaries and elections, these requests have intensified. Oftentimes it is state governments’ ethics bodies that are tasked with deciding whether crypto donations are appropriate and how they should be governed. So far this year, several state commissions have either ruled against cryptocurrency donations or wavered on the issue , so the Colorado initiative, if successful, might become a precedent for other undecided states to consider.\nIn October 2017, a Kansas candidate for office sought guidance on potential use of crypto contributions from the state’s Governmental Ethics Commission. Shortly after, the office had announced that Bitcoin is ‘too secretive and untraceable,’ and could be used by ‘totally unidentifiable lobbyists’ to influence local elections.\nWisconsin Libertarian Party asked the State Ethics Commission in April to clarify whether it deems the use of cryptocurrency political contributions acceptable. The commission held public hearings and concluded that the issue should be decided by the state legislature . The time frame for the state House to rule on the issue is yet to be announced.\nEmmanuel Wilder, a Republican candidate for North Carolina State House, has approached State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement with a similar request in April. In his letter, Wilder acknowledged that traceability concerns exist, but still advocated for giving voters a choice between fiat and crypto donation formats, as well as supporting the ‘new upcoming financial service.’ The request is still under review.\nIn South Carolina, the issue has been decided in a speedier manner, and not in favor of crypto enthusiasts. Britton Wolf, a 23-year-old Republican candidate for District 71 of the South Carolina House of Representatives in June primaries, asked the state House’s ethics committee whether he could use digital currency donations to support his campaign. The officials responded that he could not, since the definition of a campaign contribution, as provided by the state law, does not include cryptocurrency . Heroes of Crypto-Funded Campaigns\nInstitutional politics is a field permeated by inertia and adherence to the status quo, so there is little wonder that cryptocurrency as a vehicle of political finance is still far from mainstream adoption. Politicians who use it are still vastly outnumbered, and for the majority of those who do, crypto donations constitute a minor share of overall funds.\nHowever, certain brands of politicians, such as firebrand libertarians and technology advocates, are already naturally predisposed to be relying on digital currency donations – accepting digital currency contributions has become an integral part of manifesting their ideology. Increasing mass adoption and surging prices are also factors that nudge more establishment actors to be looking towards crypto. Here are some of the most high-profile U.S. politicians on both federal and state levels who are vocal about their embrace of crypto funding. Andrew Hemingway\nA Republican candidate for New Hampshire governor in 2014, Hemingway has been the first ever contender to the office to use cryptocurrency contributions in his campaign. Bitcoin donations amounted to about 20 percent of his overall funds. Hemingway never advanced to the general election, having lost to Walter Havenstein in the Republican primary. Jared Polis\nU.S. Representative Jared Polis, who is arguably the most outspoken supporter of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology on the Capitol Hill, claims the credit of being the first acting Congressman to accept Bitcoin from his supporters. During his successful 2014 re-election campaign, he collected a modest $2,000 worth of crypto donations . In his 2018 bid for Colorado governor, Polis will surely exceed this figure by a significant margin. Dan Elder\nThe libertarian’s 2016 bid for Missouri House of Representatives has the distinction of being the first campaign ever to be funded entirely in Bitcoin . The result of the experiment turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with Elder carrying just over 10 percent of the vote. In 2018, Elder is running for District 79 of the Missouri House of Representatives again. Rand Paul\nA feature of every list of Bitcoin-friendly politicians, Paul became the first presidential candidate to embrace cryptocurrency donations when he announced his bid for the 2016 election. Back in 2015, this caused quite a stir . Greg Abbott\nIn an apparent move to attract younger and tech-savvy voters, then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced in April 2014 that he will accept Bitcoin contributions for his gubernatorial campaign. The strategy seems to have worked, as in January 2015 Abbott was sworn in as Governor of the state. Austin Petersen\nA Republican seeking election to the U.S. Senate from Missouri this year, Petersen’s embrace of cryptocurrency is grounded in his pro-market ideology. His campaign manager called the use of bitcoin a ‘ no-brainer .’ Petersen’s campaign amassed just south of $10,000 and became renowned for having received the largest ever single cryptocurrency contribution of 0.284 Bitcoin ($4,500 at the time) in December 2017. This figure doesn’t quite add up with the FEC guidelines even for fiat contributions, but the donation page on Petersen’s website gives a hint to how this could be legitimized:\n“The maximum amount an individual may contribute is $2,700 per election. Your contribution (up to $2,700) will be designated for the primary election. The next $2,700 will be designated for the general election.” Patrick Nelson\nDemocratic candidate for Congress from New York, Nelson proclaimed that his is a ‘ 21st century campaign ,’ which readily embraces ‘technology like #bitcoin.’ He later faced crypto fundraising issues when BitPay, a service that his campaign used for processing crypto donations, ran into licensing trouble with the state of New York. Brian Forde\nForde is well situated to become a new political crypto star. A Democrat seeking election to the U.S. House to represent the 45th Congressional District of California this year, he had worked as both head of digital currency at MIT Media Lab and a tech adviser for the Obama administration. His embrace of the technology is explicit, and his electoral chances look solid. The crypto community has already acknowledged its unequivocal support of his candidacy by funneling a record-breaking $66,000 worth of crypto to his wallets in August and September of 2017 alone, while the biggest names in the industry pledged their support .\n* * *\nEven though the weight of cryptocurrency contributions in campaign funds remains modest, the overall upward trend is consistent with the increasing degree of mass adoption. There is little doubt that we will soon see more campaigns funded exclusively by crypto, as well as more successful bids relying at least partly on digital currency contributions. As these processes unfold, the FEC will be compelled to chart clearer rules and grapple with the problem of crypto donations’ limited traceability.\nThis article is brought to you courtesy of ZeroHedge .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "colorado wayne williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler durden", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal election commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T13:12:04.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3dfff5ec6bdc6991df87d3138b87921c29e4243c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2kH3Bsmow.91XxtDOq9O9ZVmuQW177ZOyodKu2eKJ.dTeARxnhBitEOd732OuIVjddYAh80514HjMH__IuhoQyy80eI0GlTA-", "site_full": "www.noobpreneur.com", "site": "noobpreneur.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["marketing", "tech", "business", "media"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Beginner's Guide to Bitcoin Trading", "title_full": "The Beginner's Guide to Bitcoin Trading", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "https://www.noobpreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bitcoin-np.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3dfff5ec6bdc6991df87d3138b87921c29e4243c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2kH3Bsmow.91XxtDOq9O9ZVmuQW177ZOyodKu2eKJ.dTeARxnhBitEOd732OuIVjddYAh80514HjMH__IuhoQyy80eI0GlTA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ivan Widjaya", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Beginner's Guide to Bitcoin Trading", "text": "June 4, 2018 Ivan Widjaya The Beginner’s Guide to Bitcoin Trading\nBitcoin has become a valued commodity. With a lot of media attention and speculative hype, the founding cryptocurrency seems to go from strength to strength with little in the way to stop its path to success. With mining now pretty much impossible, crypto enthusiasts are turning to the opportunity to buy Bitcoin and trade it, with the ultimate vision of making a lot of money in a fairly short space of time.\nThis beginner’s guide will talk you through the dos and don’ts of Bitcoin trading and help you make the most of them. Protect Your Investment\nThe key strategy with any investment is to protect it as much as possible. If you are trading in cryptocurrency, you need to make sure you have the right procedures in place to ensure that your crypto remains safe and out of reach of hackers who will do anything in their power to remove your hard-earned Bitcoin from you.\nTo protect your Bitcoin, it is highly recommended that you purchase a hardware wallet . These store your Bitcoin externally from your computer system and keep it away from an internet connection that hackers use as a window of opportunity. The top 3 hardware wallets for Bitcoin are: Ledger Nano S\nThis is a great all-round hardware wallet designed to hold Bitcoin, Ether and many other altcoins. Connecting by USB, this wallet keeps your crypto securely and double checks any transactions being made out of the wallet when it is hooked up to an internet connection. Ledger Nano S – photo credit: Bitcoinist Trezor\nThe Trezor wallet acts as a multifunctional platform for security. It stores your Bitcoin along with any passwords you may want to keep securely. It also has a recovery seed built in to allow you to recover any Bitcoin that is stolen if you’re unfortunate enough to fall prey to hackers. Ledger Blue\nLike the Ledger Nano S, this hardware wallet has been developed over a number of years to help store your crypto securely. It makes use of both USB and Bluetooth technology to give you easy access to your currency when you need it.\nThere are many good software wallets, but be aware that these are not as secure as an external hardware wallet. Software wallets are free and allow you to store crypto on your computer . Don’t Expect Miracles\nWhile the success stories of Bitcoin are commonplace and many people have made a fortune trading Bitcoin, it is best to go into any investment with a conservative and realistic attitude. Bitcoin is expensive to buy, so when you make your initial purchase you will likely see a big amount of money going from your bank account.\nBitcoin can be volatile , so be prepared for sharp drops as well as sharp rises. The important thing about Bitcoin is to try and spot trends or patterns and prepare yourself to sell on a rise rather than a fall. Don’t expect to become an overnight millionaire through Bitcoin trading, it takes time and perseverance as well as courage to hold onto your Bitcoin long enough to see those kinds of returns. Often those that have made such figures have held onto the currency for a number of years. Buy Lower, Sell Higher\nThe key here is not to wait for Bitcoin to drop further in value before you buy; if you wait for this, you could miss a prime investment opportunity if the market turns sooner than you expected. Conversely, you shouldn’t wait until the coin has reached a peak before selling; oftentimes a Bitcoin peak is followed by a sharp fall as investors scramble to sell the coin quickly . It is best, instead, to sell as the coin is rising and not hold out for a bigger payday.\nOver the years many investors have been stung terribly by waiting too long for a rise to sell, and when they have decided to cash out they have lost significant sums of money. Be prudent with your buying and selling for the best overall results. Don’t Believe the Hype\nBitcoin, as well as crypto in general, has a lot of hype surrounding it. Much of this is perpetrated by crypto founders or investors looking to boost the value of their own investments. Take anything you read with a pinch of salt; as with many things in life, there is always a reason for a story, and it likely isn’t designed to benefit you.\nBe wary of taking investment advice unless you are absolutely sure of an individual’s credibility. Some Bitcoin traders have previously bought currency on exchanges recommended by “investment gurus” only to find that they have been swindled out of a lot of money. Have an End Goal\nSet yourself a target and stick to it. Once you have reached it, put your Bitcoin trading aside. Bitcoin, like many other commodities, will have an upper limit, so setting yourself a target you will be happy with means that when you have reached your trading goal you no longer need to worry about your investments.\nFailing to set realistic trading goals often ends in misery as you will find yourself in a cyclic pattern of continually chasing a profit. Verify the Credibility of Exchanges\nA brilliant exchange to use is CEX.IO . They provide a user-friendly, transparent and low-fee trading service (0%-0.25%), which gives Bitcoin traders freedom to operate in relative security. CEX.IO also offers many tools for traders to derive maximum benefit from their activity; they include API solutions for automated trading, cross-platform capability, stop-loss order functionality and margin trading. Other exchanges are also good, but be wary of exchanges that have little requirements to registration or are not well known.\nInternet forums and review websites are often a good sounding ground when selecting an exchange to trade on, and many seasoned users and traders offer insight to novice traders.\nThis guide should hopefully see you have a lot of Bitcoin success, but remember to keep your money safe!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ivan widjaya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin trading bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T20:09:05.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0ec1ce1cccdabde39da2200cab6f6bf08891824", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJ0.3yf89hQgW2TAHDLcniXM1ilSaEM0rW5YlHIUH6RFQ4L14ziEDNiuT7VbY15ZIBkGcW5JFxRdOw7xS2WnT3tWkzNqsVDwLA-", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com - Top Stories", "title": "Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note", "title_full": "Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note - MarketWatch", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY667_bitcoi_ZG_20171120073849.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0ec1ce1cccdabde39da2200cab6f6bf08891824", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJ0.3yf89hQgW2TAHDLcniXM1ilSaEM0rW5YlHIUH6RFQ4L14ziEDNiuT7VbY15ZIBkGcW5JFxRdOw7xS2WnT3tWkzNqsVDwLA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Hankin", "published": "2018-06-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin begins the week on a sour note", "text": "Digital currencies couldn’t hold on to gains made over the weekend, with all major cryptocurrencies trading in negative territory Monday.\nAfter hitting a 10-day high of $7,768.93 on Sunday, bitcoin, the worlds biggest digital currency, has drifted back toward $7,500 — the level it spent much of last week gravitating around.\nDespite last week being a quiet one on the volatility front, interest in the No. 1 digital currency is not waning. “At the Cboe futures exchange, the bitcoin futures (XBT) contract volume saw a big increase from the previous week,” wrote Peter Lusk, senior instructor at the Cboe.\n“Monday was a U.S. holiday, so the market was closed, but on Tuesday, the front-month contract recorded an all-time high volume, with 8,373 contracts trading that day.”\nCboe XBT weekly futures volume Even with the shortened week, the average daily volume was 5,755 contracts up from 4,490 contracts the week prior.\nThe price of a single bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.06% was last worth $7,496.73, down 3% since Sunday at 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange.\nRead: Bitcoin is definitely a bubble, says Wikipedia founder\nSEC appoints crypto specialist As the regulatory overhang continues to dog the cryptocurrency and coin offering market, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday it had appointed Valerie Szczepanik to run a division specializing in digital assets and innovation.\n“In this newly created advisory position, Ms. Szczepanik will coordinate efforts across all SEC Divisions and Offices regarding the application of U.S. securities laws to emerging digital asset technologies and innovations, including Initial Coin Offerings and cryptocurrencies,” the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a press release .\nThe move comes as the crackdown on fraudulent entities in the crypto industry continues with a number of states handing out court orders for some working entities to cease operations in both the U.S. and Canada over the past two weeks.\nApple co-founder echoes Dorsey’s bitcoin belief Apple AAPL, +0.84% co-founder Steve Wozniak has backed fellow west coast business tycoon Jack Dorsey in calling for bitcoin to be the worlds single currency.
