to transfer loans 19 hours ago\nBERLIN, May 13, (RTRS): German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin. Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighbourhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates. Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month. Most clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T02:20:43.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d990d148c201e720fb3f1d6edc61d6efdf8b4c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.skiIqoCdnby49xxtv4zKxihYPOVVozwxN7s67Lz8I11iJTNAt95l.ZcADLAkUpv1Jw--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female", "title_full": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female", "published": "2018-05-14T00:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d990d148c201e720fb3f1d6edc61d6efdf8b4c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.skiIqoCdnby49xxtv4zKxihYPOVVozwxN7s67Lz8I11iJTNAt95l.ZcADLAkUpv1Jw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T00:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female", "text": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female\nAvi Mizrahi\nA new demographic analysis of people trading in cryptocurrencies has brought up some intriguing results such as that only very few are female, most have little to no previous experience, and many are students or working in sales and marketing roles.\nAlso Read: Israel Tax Authority Hunts for Bitcoin Traders on Social Media\nUnderstanding Trading Demographics Market analysts for the social investing network and multi-asset brokerage, Etoro, have conducted a research of their vast user base to help the company better understand exactly who are bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors.

May 14, 2018\nEthereum [ETH] is the second largest and has the fastest growing economy in the cryptocurrency market. Vitalik Buterin, the Founder of Ethereum has been caught up in controversies recently as witnessed by the social media.\nThe net market capital of the cryptocurrency is $386 billion which has fallen from $450 billion a few weeks back. The crypto-market is close to reaching the half-trillion marker. The leading coins, Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] have experienced a sudden jolt three days back and ever since the prices are falling.\nThe price of ETH was trading at a soaring price of $835 on the 6th of May. In the last 7-day period the price has fallen by 18%. At the time of writing, the ETH trading price is staked at $664. In the last 24 hour mark, the overall remark is negative as prices have dropped more than it has increased. The current market capitalization is $66 billion as depicted on Coinmarketcap.\nManoj, a crypto-analyst responded the bear-fall of Ethereum and other currencies:\n“I say when Bitcoin falls no matter what the currency is all will fall. Ethereum is ranked number two but the net worth is not even close to that of Bitcoin. The Ethereum market will hopefully be on a bull-run by tomorrow evening. The RSI is depicting a major decline in the market as it is indicating a downward movement. The amount of tokens sold is more than the buy rate. There is no way that the bear trend is going to disappear soon, because the market has not experienced something this huge in the recent times.”\nA Redditor says:\n“Not sure that there is any value in Ethereum without the existence of Bitcoin. But there is nothing in Bitcoin tech that Ethereum Can’t handle. Not a fan because that’s a convoluted strategy. They have the ame technology yet dependent.”\nA Twitterati says:\n“The market is a major pump and dump right now.

Looking at data from March 2017 to February 2018, they surveyed the public profiles of those investing in cryptocurrencies using their systems, and extracted demographic insights from age to gender to job sector.\nOne interesting point emerging from the data is that an absolute majority of traders are new in the business with regards to having any investing experience. A whopping 81.96% are at the Novice level, 10.66% are defined as Intermediate level, and just 7.38% qualify as having an Advanced level of experience in the market.\nLooking at the breakdown by occupation, it’s not surprising to see people working in the computer and IT services strongly represented at 15.05%, as well as the finance industry at 8.48%. Less expected is the high share of people working at sales and marketing involved in cryptocurrency trading at 14.49%. Additionally, about 30% of cryptocurrency traders are currently out of the job market, with 13.85% being students, 2.06% retired, and 14.74% just having no job. Crypto Gender Imbalance\nOne demographic issue that keeps coming up with relation to cryptocurrency developers is the lack of female representation, and the same statistics seem to be true for traders. In fact, the data shows that less than a tenth of crypto traders are women, with just 8.5% market share compared with men’s 91.5%. While there could be other factors at play, bitcoin is located at the intersection of technology and finance, both fields that suffer from a severe gender imbalance, so the results are not all that surprising in that context.\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that there are differences between the cryptocurrencies men and women prefer to trade, other than BTC which has 0% gender difference. It appears that Ripple’s XRP skews strongly into the female side, while ETC, BCH and LTC are firmly in male territory. In a note to investors, Senior Market Analyst at Etoro Mati Greenspan, summarized it all with a clear “Women Love ripple.”\nEarlier this year, Etoro was among seven leading cryptocurrency companies operating in the UK that formed an independent trade body tasked with developing self-regulatory standards for the cryptocurrency industry and engaging policymakers. The other founding members of Crypto UK are Coinbase, Cex.io, Blockex, Commerceblock, Coinshares, and Cryptocompare.\nHow cloud the bitcoin community attract more female users?

Looking at data from March 2017 to February 2018, they surveyed the public profiles of those investing in cryptocurrencies using their systems, and extracted demographic insights from age to gender to job sector.\nOne interesting point emerging from the data is that an absolute majority of traders are new in the business with regards to having any investing experience. A whopping 81.96% are at the Novice level, 10.66% are defined as Intermediate level, and just 7.38% qualify as having an Advanced level of experience in the market.\nLooking at the breakdown by occupation, it’s not surprising to see people working in the computer and IT services strongly represented at 15.05%, as well as the finance industry at 8.48%.

Crypto Gender Imbalance\nOne demographic issue that keeps coming up with relation to cryptocurrency developers is the lack of female representation, and the same statistics seem to be true for traders. In fact, the data shows that less than a tenth of crypto traders are women, with just 8.5% market share compared with men’s 91.5%. While there could be other factors at play, bitcoin is located at the intersection of technology and finance, both fields that suffer from a severe gender imbalance, so the results are not all that surprising in that context.\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that there are differences between the cryptocurrencies men and women prefer to trade, other than BTC which has 0% gender difference. It appears that Ripple’s XRP skews strongly into the female side, while ETC, BCH and LTC are firmly in male territory. In a note to investors, Senior Market Analyst at Etoro Mati Greenspan, summarized it all with a clear “Women Love ripple.”\nEarlier this year, Etoro was among seven leading cryptocurrency companies operating in the UK that formed an independent trade body tasked with developing self-regulatory standards for the cryptocurrency industry and engaging policymakers.

I bought into the same mentality for a long time, but I'm changing my tune. In almost every industry, first generation leaders are replaced by competition. From Sears, Kmart, Nokia, Motorola, Yahoo, MySpace, etc. Although Bitcoin is the current crypto reserve currency, I think that its dominance is threatened by ALT coins with faster, cheaper transactions and greater scalability. What do you think? Is it smart to hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment, or are there better choices among the ALT coins like Ethereum or Litecoin?\nThere are a lot more coins out there that are much great at the long term investment but I am not saying that the bitcoins are not great. Theybare great indeed and there are nothing that can beat them yet but I am just saying that there are some altcoins that have much more lower value that are great in very long term investment like for 5 years and above. I am saying that lets give them a chance like the ethereum and other like litecoins. I know that they can be better. But still bitcoins are the best, for me the more investment the better", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T03:47:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab399c9caaf139083d2a1a77d24f791f4ade7388", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMq83byazNePAvAmuSeAmXbLTfWmv3rfccZiDVpAcMxhTvdWrX8zeIivUnOdvh79pssvWB0nk3YMJgMSIuppwFWg", "site_full": "tfrlive.com", "site": "tfrlive.com", "site_section": "http://truthfrequencyradio.com/feed", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "TFR LIVE : Truth Frequency Radio", "title": "The Chris Everard Show – BitCoin Booms for 2018", "title_full": "The Chris Everard Show – BitCoin Booms for 2018", "published": "2018-05-13T23:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://truthfrequency.com/playerimages/chriseverard.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab399c9caaf139083d2a1a77d24f791f4ade7388", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMq83byazNePAvAmuSeAmXbLTfWmv3rfccZiDVpAcMxhTvdWrX8zeIivUnOdvh79pssvWB0nk3YMJgMSIuppwFWg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "chriseverard", "published": "2018-05-13T23:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Chris Everard Show – BitCoin Booms for 2018", "text": "The Chris Everard Show – BitCoin Booms for 2018 >> EPISODE #132 AIRED: 05-13-2018\nNHS MURDERS THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS and hushes it up! 19,000 UNEXPECTED DEATHS in the NHS were NOT reported in the government statistics – BITCOIN, ETHERUEM and EOS NEWS – Plus advice on how to make TAX FREE EARNINGS with an investment of just $50 dollars – UNUSUAL BRILLIANT MOVIES – We review and recommend the movies which Hollywood would rather you knew NOTHING ABOUT – ALSO – HOLLYWOOD BUSINESS GOES BUST – Hardly a single movie in 2017 made a profit – though it looks as if the CIA are co-funding ‘Movies with a message’!

German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin. Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighbourhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the cryptocurrencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. Albrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since. Adoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the US, according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\nClick on Deccan Chronicle Technology and Science for the latest news and reviews .

Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

A &l;a href=&q;http://fortune.com/2017/08/11/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-price-date-why/&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;hard fork in August 2017&l;/a&g; gave each faction its own coin. The newcomer trades as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), while the continuing chain trades as Bitcoin (BTC).\n&l;img class=&q;dam-image getty size-large wp-image-944641014&q; src=&q;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/dam/imageserve/944641014/960×0.jpg?fit=scale&q; data-height=&q;640&q; data-width=&q;960&q;&g; Berlin, Germany – April 10: In this photo illustration a coin of the crypto currency Bitcoin stands on a hard disk on April 10, 2018 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)\nEach community insists that its coin is the &a;ldquo;true Bitcoin&a;rdquo;. Here is what Bitcoin Cash&a;rsquo;s website says about the reasons for the hard fork:\n&l;/p&g;&l;blockquote&g;Some of the developers did not understand and agree with the&a;nbsp;&l;a href=&q;https://www.bitcoincash.org/bitcoin.pdf&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;that Satoshi Nakamoto had created.&a;nbsp;Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer.\nMany miners and users trusted these developers, while others recognized that they were leading the community down a different road than expected.&l;/blockquote&g;\nSo, according to Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin (Core) has abandoned Satoshi&a;rsquo;s original vision. By refusing to raise the block size limit, they have prevented Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s own blockchain from becoming a serious challenger to existing payments providers. Now, they are compromising Satoshi&a;rsquo;s entire concept by adding a second layer of transaction processing off the main blockchain.\nBut Bitcoin Core developers &l;a href=&q;https://medium.com/@jgarzik/bitcoin-is-being-hot-wired-for-settlement-a5beb1df223a&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;say that&l;/a&g; the block size limit was imposed by Satoshi himself:\n&l;blockquote&g;Satoshi&a;nbsp;&l;a href=&q;https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f1e1fb4bdef878c8fc1564fa418d44e7541a7e83&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;added&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;the 1M consensus limit in 2010, intentionally set above the free market fee range. This artificial ceiling acts against network DoS, raising the cost of attack. Setting the limit above free market range resulted in a&a;nbsp;safety limit&a;nbsp;reasonably free from politics.&l;/blockquote&g;\nWe now know that the limit is no longer &a;ldquo;above free market range&a;rdquo; &a;ndash; indeed, has not been since about 2015. It is hard to imagine a more politically-charged debate than the fierce argument over whether to increase the block size, and if so, by how much.\nHowever, Bitcoin purists insist that since Satoshi set the limit, it must stay. And other Bitcoin aficionados are perfectly happy for the block size to remain restricted, because they see Bitcoin becoming a scarce valuable asset underpinning a transaction processing layer &a;ndash; a digital gold standard. &a;nbsp;For this, they claim support from Satoshi&a;rsquo;s own writings. Satoshi seems to have &l;a href=&q;https://freedomnode.com/blog/66/21-wise-and-funny-bitcoin-quotes-by-satoshi-nakamoto&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;disliked fiat currency&l;/a&g; and preferred a gold standard.\nThus, both factions claim to have Satoshi&a;rsquo;s &a;ldquo;true vision.&a;rdquo; And the fight between them has become bitter and personal. It doesn&a;rsquo;t even seem to have much to do with the technology any more. The technology is happily developing along two different paths: Bitcoin developers are briskly proceeding with their second layer, known as the Lightning Network, while Bitcoin Cash, which raised the block size to 8MB immediately after the hard fork, has just quadrupled it to 32MB. But as the technology diverges, the war of words is becoming ever more intense. Here, for example, are Samson Mow (BTC) and Roger Ver (BCH) &l;a href=&q;https://cointelegraph.com/news/roger-ver-vs-samson-mow-passionate-debates-on-bitcoin-scaling-at-deconomy-2018&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;biting lumps out of each other&l;/a&g; at the recent Deconomy conference:\nOn Twitter, the battles are even fiercer. Both sides are evangelical in their commitment to their coin&a;rsquo;s cause and utterly intolerant of criticism. Any attempt to discuss the relative merits of the two coins quickly degenerates into name-calling.\n&l;!–nextpage–&g;\nAs Jimmy Song &l;a href=&q;https://medium.com/@jimmysong/segwit2x-post-mortem-divorce-of-crypto-austrians-and-crypto-keynesians-87960b11ce4c&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;perceptively notes&l;/a&g;, this is not so much a clash of coins as a fight to the death between two factions with opposing economic ideologies. Reflecting the real-world economic theory that each has adopted, he dubs them &a;ldquo;crypto-Keynesians&a;rdquo; and &a;ldquo;crypto-Austrians.&a;rdquo; Crypto-Austrians insist that &a;ldquo;sound money&a;rdquo; is all that matters, and transaction throughput is subservient to this overriding goal. Crypto-Keynesians insist that transaction throughput is essential if Bitcoin is to have any real-world use and hence any real-world value.\nThis is not the first time that a coin split has been driven by ideology rather than technology. Ethereum&a;rsquo;s split in 2016 was so ideologically-driven that it looked &l;a href=&q;https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2016/07/26/ethereum-and-the-old-catholics/#4f7c1eb43536&q;&g;suspiciously like a schism&l;/a&g;. But the turf war between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic died down quite quickly, and the two communities now largely ignore each other. In contrast, the BTC/BCH clash seems to become ever more intense as the technology diverges.&a;nbsp;The conflict between BTC and BCH looks more like a religious war than a disagreement over technology. Perhaps this is Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s equivalent of the &l;a href=&q;https://www.history.com/topics/reformation&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;Reformation&l;/a&g;.\nTo Bitcoin atheists like me, the whole argument looks silly. Just as both Protestants and Catholics ultimately wanted the same thing, namely to spread the Christian religion throughout the world, so too both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash want the same thing, namely to spread the Bitcoin ecosystem throughout the world. They just disagree about how to achieve it: Bitcoin Core want a two-layer set-up so they can preserve their commitment to &q;sound money,&q; while Bitcoin Cash want all transactions to be on-chain so they can preserve their commitment to &a;ldquo;peer-to-peer electronic cash.&a;rdquo;\nSatoshi&a;rsquo;s vision appears to contain elements of both. The &l;a href=&q;https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2017/07/26/the-fundamental-conflict-at-the-heart-of-bitcoin/#51d2de294fdb&q;&g;fundamental conflict at the heart of Bitcoin&l;/a&g; was set up by its creator. But it is entirely counterproductive for the two ideologies to attempt to kill each other off like this. The lesson of the Reformation is that schism and factional infighting cannot resolve a fundamental conflict. Ultimately, if the Bitcoin ecosystem is to rule the world, the two factions must learn to coexist peacefully. Otherwise both will become irrelevant.\n&a;nbsp;", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.history.com/topics/reformation&q;",

Its launch date was January 3rd, 2009. Bitcoin’s total supply is 17,031,912 coins. The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoin and the currency’s Github account can be viewed here . The official website for Bitcoin is bitcoin.org . Bitcoin’s official Twitter account is @bitcoin and its Facebook page is accessible here . Bitcoin’s official message board is bitcointalk.org .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain.

Now, the magazine that receives nearly a quarter of a million views a month , is opening up an exclusive members club.\nBe Part of the Industry Red Carpet\nThe magazine is known for quoting the most prominent members of the industry. Smaller players historically haven’t had the chance to share their expertise, and Coinidol is now offering a rare opportunity for them to become a quoted source, and rise up amongst some of the most valued figures we hear from every week.\nThe club is a competition of minds and ideas – being in the club doesn’t immediately mean that any and every idea or quote provided will make it to the page and the editors at CoinIdol will check and approve only the best. There is a strict code of ethics that members must adhere to; any promotional wording in quotes will be deleted and membership will be then refused for anyone who violates the rules. Coinidol ’s CEO, George Gor, values reputation and trust over money:\n“We keep our ethics. That’s why we do not change anything in our official editorial policy. We refuse publication of any advertising inside editorial articles. If you want to publish any advertising, the only way to do that is to order an official sponsored article, marked with the disclaimer “paid advertising”.\nShould an experts’ club member have their quote approved and published by the Coinidol editor:\n“…it is signed by a list of regalia, including personal name, personal photo, brand name, brand logo, brand website URL, special presentation of competencies of the expert with proofs.”\nExclusive Privileges\nBeing part of the Coinidol experts members club is a one-time-payment privilege , would-be experts aren’t just accepted to into the club because they have money; to fight scammers and keep the calibre of quotes used high, applicants will need to chat with the editorial team and present themselves as potential members.\nOnce in the club, new experts will have the chance to display their competencies and can feature on up to ten articles per months with their quotes. The names of experts in the club and that enter the club will have nearly a quarter of a million eyes a month, from 174 countries from around their world on their quotes; the best of which will be quoted by authors of editorial pieces on Coinidol .\nMembership can be purchased from any Bitcoin PR Buzz Account Manager , by emailing contact@bitcoinprbuzz.com.\nVisit the CoinIdol Official Site – https://coinidol.com/ Follow on Twitter – https://twitter.com/coinidol", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/coinidol", "http://coinidol.com/", "https://coinidol.com/", "https://bitcoinprbuzz.com/services"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinidol.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "industry red carpet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinidol", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larnaca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinidol", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T06:39:39.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0d1ef828db5cfff8c5ecf5dac34bf36f57d240d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.slSNuoCzanLJxhOf.HGp3W.lM.XZgLJqrbEee5fAfKIUCq6OYnTEZrEhFtTIKKkN9w--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Convert2Btc.com is Online!

The cryptocurrency market and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) still dominate discussions about the technology and billions of dollars continue to flow into the space, but the focus has mainly been directed towards blockchain’s use as a money-making technology. People tend to gloss over the possible applications for the public good from deploying blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). And, to quote George Washington, the first President of the United States (U.S.) and one of the nation’s Founding Fathers: “I have no other view than to promote the public good, and am unambitious of honors not founded in the approbation of my Country.”\nNow this could be viewed as quite unfortunate when considering that the security, transparency and immutability that blockchain technology provides makes it a prime tool for such efforts. While Bitcoin was conceived in reaction to the financial crisis of the late noughties (2000s) and slated to be a digital currency free from the influence of financial institutions, not many today are familiar with these roots.\nSo, it should be seen positively that a number of projects are pursuing this “for-the-people” viewpoint and offering mechanisms to promote fairness and equality. To this end a number of initiatives in the space have sprung and appear now to be gaining some traction. And, it all starts by offering an amazing product or service to gain traction.\nPioneering blockchain-based platform Horizon State , for example, recently announced several partnerships where its voting mechanisms will be put to use in an effort to encourage public engagement. And, decentralized social media platform Sapien secured $11 million from its ICO, which is allowing it to pursue its goal of providing equitable means for content creators to publish content.\nElsewhere, projects like Substratum , a U.S.-based software development firm that has architected, developed and deployed software solutions for Fortune 100 companies such as Apple, Disney Facebook and HP amongst others, and the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), which is building an open source decentralized identity ecosystem for people, organizations, apps and devices, aim to provide decentralization to network infrastructures and digital identity, respectively.\nSo, with this in mind here are three areas where these projects are helping address modern societal problems and promote the public good.\n1. Consensus Building\nDespite the growth of democracy worldwide, the mechanisms used to facilitate the democratic process are far from perfect. For example, it is only lately that governments have adopted electronic voting to facilitate elections.\nIn electronic voting, often called “e-voting”, voters use an electronic device to make and record their ballot choices. Voting choices are recorded on the machine itself or the machine generates a token on which the choices are recorded.\nElectronic voting gained popularity in Estonia back in 2001 with the “e-minded” coalition government. The country became the first in the world to hold legally binding general elections over the Internet with their pilot project for the municipal elections in 2005 and in 2014 became the first state to provide e-residency . Further, the Estonian parliamentary election in 2007 also used Internet voting - another world first.\nEven the likes of U.S. President Donald Trump - prior to his Presidential election victory - applied for and was granted Estonian e-residency . Trump’s interest in the e-residency was said to be sparked following a successful covert operation by the Estonian secret service ESSAD.\nTrump was quoted in early 2016 by Estonian World, an online English-language media channel about the country, saying he liked the e-residency as he “likes big ideas”. He added: “I don’t like losers. If you’re going to be thinking, you may as well think big. It is not ripping us off like China or Japan or Mexico.”\nMany countries and localities though still rely on manual paper-based methods, which are vulnerable to manipulation. However, even with the adoption of electronic methods, problems can still arise where software or hardware errors can lead to disastrous results and undermine the integrity of the process.\nHorizon State, for example, promotes the use of blockchain for consensus-building. The venture’s platform enables organizations to vote on matters securely through digital ballot boxes. Votes are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain ensuring permanence and immutability. Voter identity is also kept anonymous and confidential to prevent potential coercion.\nAfter holding a successful ICO last year, Horizon State is now focused on securing more partners that will use its platform. The platform recently made waves in Indonesia where it has formed partnerships including with economist Dr. Marzuki Usman and socio-religious group Nahdlatul Ulama.\nThe platform is also slated to be used in social reform and citizen involvement efforts. It will be used to empower citizens to securely vote on certain campaigns or policies. And, with the underprivileged in developing countries often disenfranchised in the decision-making processes, this gives them the opportunity to be more involved in their civic duties.\nOren Alazraki, CEO of Horizon State with some twenty years of executive experience within the IT sector, commenting late this March said: “We are already seeing a rapid surge of interest in our platform by organizations for engaging members in meaningful dialogue to improve organizational performance through improved decision-making and accountability.”\nHorizon State.

Free Speech\nDemocracy is also under threat today due to the growing influence of certain centralized platforms over free speech and the rampant use of disinformation campaigns on social media. These not only limit what kinds of viewpoints are made accessible to the public but also affect constituent opinion and behavior.\nCentralized social media often exerts authority over the content published on their sites and services. Content producers can even feel exploited since these platforms readily obtain perpetual licenses to user-generated content, which they can monetize solely for their gain. They can also choose to arbitrarily censor and disallow certain content on their platform. Yet, fake news still proliferates throughout these platforms.\nIn response, blockchain-based platforms like Sapien provide alternatives to these centralized platforms. As a social media platform, it encourages free speech and the creation and sharing of high-quality content while discouraging fake news in the process.\nAdditionally, Sapien allows users to switch between public and private browsing to ensure the safety of private data. All chat and personal data are encrypted to prevent leaks.\nAnkit Bhatia, CEO of Sapien, remarking last November stated : “Free speech is undoubtedly one of the most fundamental rights we have as humans. It grants us the ability to express our opinions, critique one another, and have meaningful discourse.”\nHe added: “Speech enables us reflect on the quality of our thoughts and actions. And when we are exposed to contrary evidence, we are given an opportunity to reassess our morals and even amend our understanding of reality.”\nFintechSv.com Ankit Bhatia, CEO and Co-Founder of Sapien at Ankit Bhatia, CEO & Cofounder Sapien making a pitch at a Blockchain Technology panel.

By offering transparency and an inherent rewards mechanism, Sapien seeks to inspire users to focus on quality and interact with each other fairly.\n3. Privacy and Data Ownership\nPrivacy has also become a major issue among users today. Some governments even go as far as monitoring and regulating Internet activities, which limit what citizens can do online. But what can even be more disconcerting is that, when it comes to protecting data, many also failed to display the same zeal they bring to policing user activity. Governments and others have put users and citizens at risk by exposing personal information to cyber-attacks.\nBlockchain projects are touted as seeking to correct this. Substratum, for instance, provides a respite for territories that have repressive Internet access policies. As an open-source network that uses blockchain this venture’s technology allows users to use a distributed infrastructure.\nTheir mission is touted as bringing forth the free and fair Internet of the future by combining what is described as “proven technological building blocks with emergent technologies in an innovative and holistic way to help solve many of the problems that plague the modern Internet.”\nUsers will be able to host and access websites and applications without the need to rely on centralized data centers or use virtual private networks, privacy browsers and onion routers.\nCommenting in relation to Internet censorship, Christian Pope, chief marketing officer (CMO) at Substratum, has posited in relation to Internet censorship: “We will not reach an acceptable outcome through government censorship. Success lies in individual verification, not in government overlap.”\nPope, who has served as VP of Marketing, CMO and a consultant with a key emphasis on B2B Fortune 1,000 and B2C start-ups, added: “What is needed is the ability for the individual to assure their network is trusted as well as the networks of his/her peers. A kind of verified armor carried from network to network ensuring safety and productivity. To maintain a free Internet, we cannot run to Internet censorship like a lamb to slaughter.”\nAside from governments, commercial services are also quite guilty of being quite invasive when it comes to user data. Google and Facebook, for example, rely heavily on the personas they have derived from user activity to fuel their advertising engine.\nAt times, enterprises could even be irresponsible. The massive hack on Equifax that compromised 147.9 million Americans’ personal and financial information underscored the weakness of relying on centralized authorities to comprehensively store and hold such data.\nIndeed, issues surrounding privacy have ratcheted-up and dominated the headlines and consumer interest of late. The recent data scandal that embroiled Facebook through Cambridge Analytica’s clandestine activities may have impacted as many as 87 million Facebook users.\nWith privacy being more important than ever before, users are seeking the utmost anonymity. One cryptocurrency, CloakCoin, has embarked on providing owners with “innate financial freedom” in a simple, practical, economical and virtually instantaneous manner.\nTheir private, secure and untraceable payment system called ENIGMA, ensures users can transmit Cloak privately and securely to each other - with what it has claimed is reduced worry of “unwanted parties spying or hacking.”\nProjects like Decentralized Identity Foundation aim to give users better control over their personal information. Towards that end, DIF is creating a universal verification system that would allow users, applications and devices to validate identities without the need for a centralized party.\nDIF’s initiative allows users to register self-sovereign identifiers (i.e. lifetime portable identities for any person, organization or thing), store identity data securely and choose what information they share to others.\nHaving a self-sovereign identity, which is a smart identity, enables the holder to present verifiable credentials in a privacy-safe way. These credentials can represent things as diverse as an airline ticket or a driver's license.\nDIF’s use of blockchain and Zero-Trust data stores help mitigate breach risks and prevent other parties from exploiting user data for their own gain. The project has now gained strong following even from enterprise blockchain players like IBM as well as the Hyperledger project and various groups in the crypto space.\nIn essence, Zero Trust is a security concept, which is based on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters. They must instead verify anything and everything that seeks to connect to its systems prior to granting access.\nDoing the Right Thing\nThe growth and success of these aforementioned projects should help spread awareness that blockchain is not really just about cryptocurrencies, but it is a tool for public good as well. Blockchain projects continue to challenge the power centralized authorities have over other facets of human activity and ensure the democratic process prevails.\nBlockchain-based voting mechanisms can encourage citizens to participate in elections and the decision-making processes. Even those typically disenfranchised can now confidently participate knowing that their votes count. And, by encouraging decentralization and data ownership, these blockchain platforms also minimize the influence governments and large enterprises typically have over users and citizens. The upshot is that users are given back control over their data, privacy and intellectual properties.\nBlockchain also encourages parties to be accountable for their actions. Transparency and immutability enable concerned parties to readily know the status and history of transactions, making sure that any dubious activities can be monitored and challenged. And, participants are ultimately compelled to do the right thing in their choices.

There are two kinds of wallets for storing keys:\nCold Wallet (wallet which is not connected to internet):\nCold wallet is an offline wallet provided for storing bitcoins. With cold storage, the digital wallet is stored on a platform that is not connected to the internet, thereby, protecting the wallet from unauthorized access, cyber hacks, and other vulnerabilities that a system connected to the internet is susceptible to.\nThe most basic form of cold storage is paper wallet . A paper wallet is simply a document that has the public and private keys written on it. The document is printed from the bitcoin paper wallet tool online with an offline printer. The paper wallet or document usually has a QR code embedded on it so that it can easily be scanned and signed to make a transaction. The drawback to this medium is that if the paper is lost or destroyed, the user will never be able to access his address where his funds are.\nAnother form of cold storage is a hardware wallet which uses an offline device or smartcard to generate private keys offline. The device looks and functions like a USB, and a computer and chrome-based app are required to store the private keys offline. Like a paper wallet, it is essential to store this USB device and smartcard in a safe place, as any damage or loss could terminate access to the user’s bitcoins. Two popular hardware wallets are TREZOR and KeepKey . These are expensive to buy.\nAnother form of cold storage is offline software wallets on desktop or mobile. They are mostly offline and pretty secure as long as your computer is not hacked. Electrum, Exodus and Armory are often quoted as the best offline software wallets in this category.\nHot Wallet(wallet that is connected to internet):\nPrivate keys stored on a hot wallet are connected to the internet are vulnerable to network-based theft. These wallets are known as hot wallets. Here all the functions required to complete a transaction are made from online device. The wallet generates and stores private keys; digitally signs transactions using private keys; and broadcasts the signed transaction to the network.\nIt is considered \"unsafe\" because hackers have easier access to this than a cold wallet. So a minimal amount is stored on a hot wallet. The exchanges are the type of hot wallets. Examples: Coinbase and Blockchain.info\nGenerally as a rule of thumb you should only leave as much money on your hot wallet as you would with a leather wallet that you’d keep in your pocket. Think of it this way, if you were held at gunpoint while holding a leather wallet, then you’d only lose that money in your pocket, and not your entire bank account. If you keep all your money in Coinbase it’s as if you are walking around town with all your money in your pocket.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T23:51:27.081+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c48f5963a1e33444d657102e5e79acce57572c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZQLgZW82gWaPQR7i2YlwkhK9Uc.zKeHAkryS7wAARnTiGJw6c4fI6_iDIQWXOklRo8-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "MMA Title Challenger Mei Yamaguchi Sponsored by Bitcoin Cash Fan Roger Ver", "title_full": "MMA Title Challenger Mei Yamaguchi Sponsored by Bitcoin Cash Fan Roger Ver", "published": "2018-05-13T22:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0c48f5963a1e33444d657102e5e79acce57572c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZQLgZW82gWaPQR7i2YlwkhK9Uc.zKeHAkryS7wAARnTiGJw6c4fI6_iDIQWXOklRo8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T22:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "MMA Title Challenger Mei Yamaguchi Sponsored by Bitcoin Cash Fan Roger Ver", "text": "\nAdvertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nMMA fighter Mei Yamaguchi from Japan is set to fight Angela Lee for the Atomweight World Championship title at One Championship’s ‘Unstoppable Dreams’ in Singapore and, bitcoin cash promoter Roger Ver will be sponsoring her in that match.\nIn a video announcing the sponsorship deal, Ver sat down with Yamaguchi to discuss MMA and cryptocurrencies. He was excited to demonstrate how Bitcoin Cash worked and sent her $1,000 in bitcoin cash (0.0642 BCH) in real time. Yamaguchi, in turn, discussed her MMA career.\n“I am the CEO of Bitcoin.com, and we are proud to sponsor Mei for this fight cause we want the whole world to know what a great athlete she is and she wants the whole world to know what a great currency bitcoin cash is,” Ver said.\nYamaguchi, who grew up in California initially learned karate after being inspired by Jackie Chan films. Then, she began practicing ju-jitsu and went on to become a mixed martial arts fighter. She now has 27 professional fights under her belt, with a 16-10-1 record.\nTowards the end of their sit-down, Roger Ver displayed Yamaguchi’s bitcoin cash address for people to donate. This wallet address is different from the wallet Roger Ver initially sent $1,000, and t the time of writing this article, the wallet only has 23 transactions and a total of 0.053 BCH ($77) in it.\nThis is not the first time a cryptocurrency is being used to sponsor and promote Sports. In January 2018, Dash sponsored MMA fighter Rory MacDonald for his fight against Douglas Lima. Rory was paid 320 DASH ($271,000 at the time) for promoting the coin. He went on to win the fight and claim the Welterweight gold title for himself.\nFans of another cryptocurrency — dogecoin — have crowdfunded multiple athletic sponsorships over the years. In 2014, Dogecoin raised $50,000 for the Jamaican Bobsled Team which had qualified for the Winter Olympics, but could not afford to go to Sochi, Russia. In the same year, the community successfully raised $55,000 to sponsor NASCAR driver Josh Wise. Wise took part in the event in a car which had Dogecoin branding and finished in the fifteenth position.\nFeatured Image from YouTube\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yamaguchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackie chan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mei yamaguchi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mma title challenger mei yamaguchi sponsored by bitcoin cash fan roger", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T11:43:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04f372267238ee71b4c070951af88792fdc7909b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRp6Zm3sBK9L_a1lwOokyrc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum", "title_full": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum", "published": "2018-05-13T22:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "04f372267238ee71b4c070951af88792fdc7909b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRp6Zm3sBK9L_a1lwOokyrc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "berrieswithwine", "published": "2018-05-13T22:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin vs Ethereum", "text": "Because the core promise behind cryptocurrencies is both revolutionary (never been possible before in the history of humankind levels of revolutionary, not breathless Silicon Valley bullshit revolutionary.) and desperately desired by the market at large.\nThe market wants this, badly, it is the final nail in the coffin for the interference of the state in their affairs, maybe even the final nail in the coffin for the state, period.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients who use Bitbond only hold onto the cryptocurrencies for a few minutes before they are exchanged for local currency. This ensures that clients won’t have to deal with the rather volatile cryptocurrency market.\nBitbond was founded in 2013 and has grown into an officially licensed bank with a large number of investors. Currently, Bitbond’s Berlin office employs 24 people from a dozen countries managing loans for about 100 clients. In total, the loans amount to about $1 million each month.\nAlbrecht says that the majority of his customers are small business owners or freelance workers who need a quick and affordable way to handle internationalloans. The loans are fairly small by the standards of most banks, and tend to be around $50,000 at the higher end of the scale.\nWhile Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans in the past, this is the first time that it has been used to facilitate international loans. It makes sense that Germany would be one of the first countries to attempt it, however. Adoption of Bitcoin has proceeded at a rapid rate within Germany. In terms of Bitcoin usage, it is second only to the United States.\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just now beginning to hit the mainstream, they still pose many risks not found in traditonal currencies. The largest is the simple fact that the various currencies tend to sharply fluctuatein value. This can make it risky as a long-term investment, but since Bitbond clients only hold the cryptocurrencies for a short amount of time, that risk is mitigated to some extent.\nFor more information about Bitcoin and the technology that makes it possible, check out our blockchain primer .\nYou may need to pay extra if you want to buy a home with Bitcoin Indian central bank looks to block Bitcoin, while creating its own cryptocurrency How to buy Bitcoin with PayPal\n helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/indian-bank-bitcoin-lock/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-bitcoin/german-online-bank-uses-bitcoins-to-transfer-loans-idUSKBN1ID07Y?feedType=RSS&feedName=technologyNews", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/v/5764135167001/mp4-high/5764135167001.mp4", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/pay-more-with-bitcoin-for-real-etate/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-buy-bitcoin-with-paypal/", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-a-blockchain/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric brackett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitbond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T23:04:57.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cdce0c15ee3948f42cf46d718fd9dda41d9621b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmf9D5U3UZ6.q5NNLnnBGxM0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "How to Secure Bitcoins?", "title_full": "How to Secure Bitcoins?", "published": "2018-05-13T22:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cdce0c15ee3948f42cf46d718fd9dda41d9621b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmf9D5U3UZ6.q5NNLnnBGxM0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "djmixen", "published": "2018-05-13T22:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Secure Bitcoins?", "text": "Securing our bitcoin is in our hand only, no matter how we choose the most secured wallet if we are not aware on some fishing site that will pum up in our computer while we open our wallet it's useless anymore.

He was excited to demonstrate how Bitcoin Cash worked and sent her $1,000 in bitcoin cash (0.0642 BCH) in real time. Yamaguchi, in turn, discussed her MMA career.\n“I am the CEO of Bitcoin.com, and we are proud to sponsor Mei for this fight cause we want the whole world to know what a great athlete she is and she wants the whole world to know what a great currency bitcoin cash is,” Ver said.\nYamaguchi, who grew up in California initially learned karate after being inspired by Jackie Chan films. Then, she began practicing ju-jitsu and went on to become a mixed martial arts fighter. She now has 27 professional fights under her belt, with a 16-10-1 record.\nTowards the end of their sit-down, Roger Ver displayed Yamaguchi’s bitcoin cash address for people to donate. This wallet address is different from the wallet Roger Ver initially sent $1,000, and t the time of writing this article, the wallet only has 23 transactions and a total of 0.053 BCH ($77) in it.\nThis is not the first time a cryptocurrency is being used to sponsor and promote Sports. In January 2018, Dash sponsored MMA fighter Rory MacDonald for his fight against Douglas Lima. Rory was paid 320 DASH ($271,000 at the time) for promoting the coin. He went on to win the fight and claim the Welterweight gold title for himself.\nFans of another cryptocurrency — dogecoin — have crowdfunded multiple athletic sponsorships over the years. In 2014, Dogecoin raised $50,000 for the Jamaican Bobsled Team which had qualified for the Winter Olympics, but could not afford to go to Sochi, Russia. In the same year, the community successfully raised $55,000 to sponsor NASCAR driver Josh Wise. Wise took part in the event in a car which had Dogecoin branding and finished in the fifteenth position.\nFeatured Image from YouTube", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/mma-angela-lee-to-defend-atomweight-title-against-mei-yamaguchi-on-may-18-at-indoor-stadium"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mei yamaguchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yamaguchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackie chan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mma title challenger mei yamaguchi sponsored", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash fan roger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mma", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T22:47:07.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d32fe52e38445bafb9a027b46a5105d415bc9af8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2hKI_aYwoyEw5EObaH.J5W1G0unmYx8DTI6dROBSzw6A0m9CBFKLBAHhGojrY1vljCL.YzOecxcEKETMDHxpBZRusk2R1JcA78CGtjfSRHm1jBpBoa8iG6q2LxRRPC.TVCyKXVOLuiQ--", "site_full": "themeforest.net", "site": "themeforest.net", "site_section": "http://themeforest.net/feeds/new-site-templates-items.atom", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "tech"], "section_title": "ThemeForest new Site Templates items", "title": "ICO Cryptian – ICO, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology)", "title_full": "ICO Cryptian – ICO, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology)", "published": "2018-05-13T22:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s3.envato.com/files/246674485/preview%20image%20copy.__large_preview.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 340, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 17, "comments": 0, "shares": 17}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d32fe52e38445bafb9a027b46a5105d415bc9af8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2hKI_aYwoyEw5EObaH.J5W1G0unmYx8DTI6dROBSzw6A0m9CBFKLBAHhGojrY1vljCL.YzOecxcEKETMDHxpBZRusk2R1JcA78CGtjfSRHm1jBpBoa8iG6q2LxRRPC.TVCyKXVOLuiQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "UIVision", "published": "2018-05-13T22:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "ICO Cryptian – ICO, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Landing Page HTML Template (Technology)", "text": "Add to Collection\nHere Presenting ICO Cryptian the best landing page for every ICO startups, ICO Agency, Bitcoin, Mining ,digital Crypto Currency investment website , blockchain.Digital curency tracker ,Cryptocurrency trading Website.

Bitcoin Press Release: Decentralised token swap site Swap.Online release details of their upcoming protocol.\n11th May 2018, Tallinn, Estonia – Decentralization is the basis for blockchain technologies. Decentralization ensures the security, transparency and integrity of all transactions in the network. But are the popular cryptocurrency exchanges really decentralized, and safe? Most DEX’s are not able to accept BTC without using an unreliable gateway between the two blockchains.\nExploring the Token Swap Ecosystem\nThere are several different types of DEX (Decentralised Exchange) such as pseudo-decentralized, working in the Ethereum network only, for example projects that link blockchains to each other using their own tokens, and decentralized exchanges that use “Hashed Timelock Contracts”.\nEarlier, it was common knowledge that a crypto exchange that did not store user keys, and was decentralized and therefore safe. However, most of these exchanges are built on a single blockchain, which makes them vulnerable – in order to get funds from the Bitcoin network to such a crypto exchange for example, one needs to use a gateway, which takes bitcoin and produces a “holding” kind of bitcoins in another network in return. A similar principle lies with Ethereum-based exchanges, for example, EtherDelta.\nSecurity: Paramount\nDevotees of centralization believe that storing private keys on a secure server is safer than storing encrypted keys in the user’s browser. However, if a central server is hacked, everything will be stolen (as it was with a million bitcoins), and paranoids can remove signing of transactions from the browser into the application on the computer and encrypt it.\nSince all code is executed in the user’s browser, the greatest risk is the intrusion of extraneous scripts into the code. It is likely to be made by the extensions the user installed in the browser, or by a hosting provider.\nTo prevent such attacks, Swap.Online will use cloudflare.com together with Workers, a solution that, in response to any request to the domain, sends a “Content Security Policy” header with the hash of the JS code allowed for execution in the user’s browser. Thus, server hacking and most attacks based on the introduction of malicious code will be eliminated. To understand how this works, see the video of the system operation below, or try to make an exchange yourself at https://alpha.swap.online.\nThe Swap Online Platform\nBy using Bitcoin.js, web3.js, and the libp2p library in IPFS, Swap.Online created a cross-blockchain swap system directly in the browser. The full details of the system can be found below:\nThe solution operates on an average 2 to 10 times faster than the existing stock exchanges (taking into account the time to deposit and withdraw funds). On average, the exchange takes 2 to 3 minutes. Swap Online does not store secret user keys. Moreover, even messages between users do not pass through our servers (we use IPFS). The exchange works right in the browser – users do not need to download or install anything. The platform already works between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, with Tether, and Lightning Network planned. Theoretically, Swap Online is able to work with most cryptocurrencies, except for those where there is no scripting language. Even for currencies like Monero, solutions will be created over time. The source code of the exchange is published in GitHub, and the protocol is distributed as Open Source. The AirDrop is scheduled for June 30th.\nThe Swap.Online team is also engaged in commercial implementation and release of related products:\nFor the B2C market (swap.online): Exchange solution for BTC -> ERC20 (with an orderbook and a reputation system) For the B2B market (b2b.swap.online): Widget in the form of html code, which allows accepting any cryptocurrencies directly in the wallet of the site owner by sending tokens in return. The solution has a confirmed demand both from projects in the crowdfunding stage and from those who are already making a real product. For large holders of cryptocurrencies: Ability to safely exchange cryptocurrency without bringing it to centralized exchanges (by replenishing the account only during the exchange). As part of research, the possibility of using the solution as a bridge for the sidechains is being studied.
