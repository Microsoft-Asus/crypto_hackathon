Bitcoin will continue to bubble and after going for the bull run, it will also fall back to bear market. The price is volatile, and not just volatile, but highly volatile, and that means that it will continue to fluctuate at all times from one direction to another. But the volatility can be reduced, if only there happens to be many investors involved. When the price is very high, one person or a particular group of people wont be able to manipulate the price.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T12:28:41.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2757847e530ed5f504bf887d3c0872e5a4d1ff26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6X71ao3RyXwKY2spfCZlomUkoh_OmFDazW49VHnAwIoB0wsuedQpN68nUe.INyJoqTGgXgLEkRa1dyprr9M58rTvU4lXb2qs-", "site_full": "bitco.in", "site": "bitco.in", "site_section": "https://bitco.in/forum/forums/bitcoin-discussion.2/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion | Bitcoin Forum", "title": "About Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies", "title_full": "About Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies | Bitcoin Forum", "published": "2018-06-07T16:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.036, "main_image": "https://bitco.in/img/opengraph.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2757847e530ed5f504bf887d3c0872e5a4d1ff26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6X71ao3RyXwKY2spfCZlomUkoh_OmFDazW49VHnAwIoB0wsuedQpN68nUe.INyJoqTGgXgLEkRa1dyprr9M58rTvU4lXb2qs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Crypton", "published": "2018-06-07T16:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "About Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies", "text": "Learn more than 99% of the population about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the first crypto\nplatform built on affiliate marketing Stepium.com.

Opinions seem to be quite divided, although that is only natural as the market keeps moving side-ways.\nCloud mining service Coinmint confirmed it would press ahead with opening a Bitcoin mining plant in an abandoned smokestack in Upstate New York, CNBC reports June 5.\nThe move, which authorities greenlighted in January, will see the company invest “up to $700 mln” in the project, which will repurpose the former 1300-acres-large Alcoa aluminium smelting plant by the end of 2019.\nVan Eck Associates Corp. and SolidX Partners Inc. filed a request to list a Bitcoin-linked ETP to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. The fund will be physically-backed, which means it will hold actual Bitcoin, and will be insured against loss or theft of the cryptocurrency, according to the firms.\nBitcoin is not alone in seeing search interest drop off this year. Ethereum has fallen in search frequency by 70%, while ripple is down by 87%.\nSummarizing arguments on social media, Milne, who is known for his bullish long-term views on Bitcoin, forecast last year could be a “warm up” for growth between now and 2020.\nThe views capitalize on growing faith both within and beyond the cryptocurrency industry that Bitcoin will return to its recent former glories, this time with additional regulatory and mainstream investment support.\nMilne picked out Bitcoin as being “still pre-mainstream” as a key factor which could propel it to beat 2017’s figures.\nOverall, the bias in prices is: Downwards.\nNote: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the downside.\nBy the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 8,339.49.\nThe projected upper bound is: 8,565.00.\nThe projected lower bound is: 6,726.82.\nThe projected closing price is: 7,645.91.\nCandlesticks\nWARNING: These prices only contain closing prices. Thus, the candlestick analysis in this expert will be invalid (including the alerts, symbols, and this commentary). To detach this expert, right-click on the NYSE BitcoinIndx chart , choose Expert Advisor, and then choose Detach.\nDuring the past 10 bars, there have been 1 white candles and 0 black candles for a net of 1 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 1 white candles and 0 black candles for a net of 1 white candles.\nA gravestone doji occurred. This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nA rising window occurred (where the top of the previous shadow is below the bottom of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bullish trend. There have been 26 rising windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current rising window even more bullish.\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 84.8976. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a sell 1 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 43.29. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 47 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 1. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a buy 5 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 0 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed up 154.719 at 7,650.070.

The Daily Economist\nSteve Jobs was known as a dreamer more than an innovator, yet the most credit for the rise of Apple during its early days should be given to the true creator of the personal computer, Steve Wozniak. But as with almost all companies, rarely do those who actually create the products earn the prestige and instead the credit is given to CEO’s who are little more than mouthpieces for the business.\nHowever perhaps we should take another look at that ‘dreamer’ label and give Wozniak a little more credence when it comes to his ability to forecast the future. And that is because Wozniak’s new vision is believing that Bitcoin could one day emerge as the world’s primary currency.\nTech legend Steve Wozniak says he is attracted to the “purity” of the idea that people around the world could one day share a single currency, despite being separated by national borders.\nHe echoed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who recently said that he believes bitcoin will become the single currency worldwide.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak told CNBC on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 conference in Amsterdam. – Russia Today Sharing is caring!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.rt.com/business/428760-wozniak-bitcoin-global-currency/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve jobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken schortgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T16:27:45.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd8db279308fb0726e240eeda1fa97c3b6a47d93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpUJTQHmKtmyS6NyvSXGuofSNo.78Wx0GsX05jt.czYEzgw8xKlXSsCKCWfVIZvs2AO1.fZeChBVr2CxAKjw0lW", "site_full": "blog.goyun.info", "site": "goyun.info", "site_section": "http://blog.goyun.info/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "GOYUN.INFO", "title": "Andy Warhol Art To Be Sold Via Blockchain For Cryptocurrency Including Bitcoin", "title_full": "Andy Warhol Art To Be Sold Via Blockchain For Cryptocurrency Including Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-07T16:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd8db279308fb0726e240eeda1fa97c3b6a47d93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpUJTQHmKtmyS6NyvSXGuofSNo.78Wx0GsX05jt.czYEzgw8xKlXSsCKCWfVIZvs2AO1.fZeChBVr2CxAKjw0lW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Goyun Info (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T16:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Andy Warhol Art To Be Sold Via Blockchain For Cryptocurrency Including Bitcoin", "text": "In the latest landmark for Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, a London art gallery will later this month auction a portion of Andy ...\nby via Google Alert -

At mid-morning, bitcoin was up slightly over one percent, with some pundits predicting a breakout may be bubbling if bitcoin can break certain price barriers.\nThe rest of the market was also stirring in response to bitcoin’s upward move, albeit barely, with gains of between one and two percent at mid-morning. Whether the hopes for a major rally are wishful thinking remains to be seen, as the market has been in a narrow trading rut for a few weeks.\nBitcoin market highlights for the 24 hours ending June 7, 2018 at 1:00 pm U.S. Eastern Time\nThe highest price seen was $7,919.87 on the Livecoin exchange at 9:49 pm yesterday. Livecoin saw $13,654,800 of bitcoin change hands.\nThe lowest price seen was $7,412.38 on CoinsBank’s exchange at 12:07 am today. CoinsBank’s 24 hour volume was $13,897,800.\nThe average price on the surveyed exchanges, as weighed by volume, was $7,669.30.\nVolatility was a bit lower than average, with the BlockTribune Volatility Index coming in at 48.6. A higher number indicates greater price volatility with 50 describing an average day.\nThese statistics were consolidated from 16 different exchanges. It includes only BTC/USD trades and only on those exchanges that had at least 1% of the total volume of BTC/USD trades during the measurement period.

The wallet’s address is 1KAt6STtisWMMVo5XGdos9P7DBNNsFfjx7 and it currently possesses 85,947 of the total amount in Bitcoin that it originally had, after selling exactly 8,000 BTC off.\nA member of staff from a Chinese Bitcoin forum shows that an organization called BABI Finance was looking into the wallet’s transactions.\n“BABI financial statistics found that the account tends to buy Bitcoin when it falls. This account has now become the sixth-largest wallet in the Bitcoin network. The top five wallets are all owned by exchanges,” the user wrote.\nAccording to the statistics gathered, this particular wallet got most of its Bitcoin through wholesale transfers from single accounts. Its second-largest source of BTC came from Huobi, a Chinese cryptocurrency exchange.\nFollowing that amount, we see small transfers from smaller wallets, totaling 7,800 BTC. The smallest source of Bitcoin for this wallet is HaoBTC.com, another Chinese exchange.\n“We don’t know who the controller is behind this mysterious account. This is one of the charms of the Bitcoin network. However, with reference to the traditional financial market, the controller of this account may be a long-term investment institution,” the user added.\nThere was also speculation that this could be an exchange setting up a cold wallet, but the theory fails to fly when we look at the fact that the BTC came from two different exchanges.\nWe find it interesting that the mysterious actor chooses to sell its Bitcoin in bulk increments of 2,000, much like how Mt. Gox’s trustees did during the 16,000-BTC sell-off that led to a dip in the price of the coin. ×", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://8btc.com/thread-174887-1-1.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "miguel gomez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babi finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin whale hoarded", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T17:08:04.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86f5acc993afb504794149dabba95edbb808ca98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvSuVh6_UQwW5QavQ.d0dkM3NV1BFocktuvHjm4S3.xAw7_sAyq7kNaoGtpT3HWhVE-", "site_full": "ohhword.com", "site": "ohhword.com", "site_section": "http://ohhword.com/feed", "site_categories": ["fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "Ohhword", "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Should You Buy Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-07T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ohhword.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/xuqcwihm4ndxx5ywj30r.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86f5acc993afb504794149dabba95edbb808ca98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvSuVh6_UQwW5QavQ.d0dkM3NV1BFocktuvHjm4S3.xAw7_sAyq7kNaoGtpT3HWhVE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lifehacker.com", "published": "2018-06-07T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin?", "text": "By Lifehacker.com on June 7, 2018 in bitcoin , cryptocurrency , General , investing , no one actually understands bitcoin , Tech\nWe’ve already told you how to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies .

8:50 AM ET\nJim Chanos, a prominent short-seller famous for his bet on Enron, said Bitcoin would be the last thing he would want to hold when catastrophe strikes.\nThe craze about digital currencies such as Bitcoin is showing traits of a so-called \"fraud cycle\", which are instances of large scale financial fraud over multiple platforms over the last 500 years, Chanos said in an interview published by the Institute for New Economic Thinking this week.\"Fraud cycles\" usually follow the financial cycle because during the improvement in business and financial markets, people tend to be relaxed regarding risk-taking as their sense of disbelief and caution begins to erode, he noted.\n\"We're now nine years into this bull market, same as the '90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate,\" Chanos said. \"I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that.\"\nHe is looking forward to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging.\nChanos, founder and managing partner of the New York-based Kynikos Associates, teaches a course on the history of financial fraud at his alma mater, Yale University, and also at the University of Wisconsin.\n\"This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy,\" Chanos said.\nUnlike fiat currencies, digital currencies do not have a lender of last resort status and no third party adjudicator, he said.\n\"For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that's exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least,\" Chanos said. \"Food would work the best!\"\nBitcoin remains the main tool for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions and that may be the only area that the top cryptocurrency still has utility, Chanos said.\nby Jyotsna V RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and

BITCOIN CAN REPLACE DOLLAR & NOT SECURITY BUT ICOS ARE\nBITCOIN has enjoyed a ringing endorsement from the SEC after the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman announced that cryptocurrencies are not a security and that Bitcoin could replace sovereign currencies such as the dollar, Euro or yen.\nThe chairman was addressing a growing debate over which cryptocurrencies should fall under SEC jurisdiction.\n“Cryptocurrencies: These are replacements for sovereign currencies, replace the dollar, the euro, the yen with bitcoin,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton told CNBC on Wednesday. “That type of currency is not a security.”\nBut he also insisted that the agency will not bend the rules when it comes to defining what is or what isn’t a security.\nA token, or a digital assets used in a fundraising process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO, are securities by Clayton’s definition.\nHe said there will be no adjustment of the rules for initial coin offerings and Clayton underlined that tokens or digital assets used in that fundraising process are securities.\n“A token, a digital asset, where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, and in return for giving you my money I say ‘you can get a return’ that is a security and we regulate that,”SEC Chairman Jay Clayton told CNBC Wednesday in a report by Kate Rooney. “We regulate the offering of that security and regulate the trading of that security.”\nHe explained: “We are not going to do any violence to the traditional definition of security that has worked for a long time.\n“We’ve been doing this a long time, there’s no need to change the definition.”\nThe U.S. has built a $19 trillion securities market, Clayton said, that’s “the envy of the world”.\nICOs have raised $9.1 billion this year alone, according to research by Autonomous Next.\n“If you have an ICO or a stock, and you want to sell it in a private placement, follow the private placement rules,” Clayton said “If you want to do any IPO with a token, come see us.”\nThe SEC is “happy to help you do that public offering” if issuers take the responsibility SEC laws require, he said.\nWhether an asset is a security right now follows the “Howey Test.”\nThe ruling comes from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case that classifies a security as an investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others’ efforts.\nClayton reiterated his position in March when he said that all ICOs constituted securities, saying “if it’s a security, we’re regulating it.”\nBut companies tied to those cryptocurrencies say it should fall under a different category, in many cases because of their utility.\nOn Tuesday, the SEC appointed a leader to its emerging cryptocurrency division.\nValerie Szczepanik has been promoted to Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation.\nBitcoin was valued at $7,699.57 as this report was published on Friday, up 0.99% on the day’s trading.\nBitcoin is worth more than $130 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.\n— Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018 Ledger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon\nLedger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won’t require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore. Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\nBlock Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts\nAnd speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily.\n“One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,” one provider reportedly said. “An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,” the whitepaper provider added. Virtual Crypto Technologies’ New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.” Bitcoin Cash on Money Week\nDominic Frisby, Money Week’s commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of ‘Bitcoin: the Future of Money?’ has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. “I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.”\nAdvising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: “Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

The new ETF was named VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust and will be immune from theft and loss of access to funds. It will also be tied to a new index from Van Eck, which instead of exchanges will collect the price of bitcoin from US-based over-the-counter (OTC) platforms.\nNoteworthy is the relatively high price of VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust shares – their size, as stated in the application, is set at $ 200,000. Thus, it can be concluded that the new ETF will primarily target institutional investors, not retail investors.\nThis was confirmed by SolidX executive director Dan Gallansi, who recalled that representatives of the SEC repeatedly expressed concern that the cryptocurrency market poses increased risks for retail investors.\nAsset management company VanEck Associates Corp and SolidX Management LLC have already applied for Bitcoin-ETF, but they did it separately.\nThe application VanEck was filed in August 2017, but already in September it was withdrawn – the reason was the decision of the SEC not to consider applications for the creation of bitcoin-ETF before the actual appearance of cryptocurrency derivatives in the market into which such funds intend to invest.\nThe application for the launch of ETF on the basis of bitcoin was filed by SolidX Partners Inc in July 2016. It was assumed that the fund will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). After several postponements of the application in March 2017, the SEC finally rejected it.\nIn January, the Commission called for the withdrawal of all applications for the creation of bitcoin-ETF. As then stated in the department, the activities of stock exchange investment bitcoin-funds at the moment will not meet the requirements of the regulator.\nNevertheless, despite the fact that direct discussions with the regulator VanEck and SolidX have not yet been conducted, firms believe that the structure of the new product takes into account the main aspects for which the SEC is concerned, including the lack of transparency of online exchanges, many of which are outside the United States.\n“We did not intend to surrender, ” added Dan Gallanty.

This could reach a consumption of 7.67 GW in the future - close to the energy consumption of Austria (8.2 GW). By the end of 2018, the mining of Bitcoin could be using as much as 0.005% of the entire world’s energy use.\nThe reality is that Bitcoin uses a massive amount of energy. Author Alex de Vries says: “The Bitcoin development community is experimenting with solutions such as the Lightning Network to improve the throughput of the network, which may alleviate the situation. For now, however, Bitcoin is a big problem and it is growing fast.” Why does Bitcoin mining require so much energy?\nThe Bitcoin mining process uses computers with software that can solve complex mathematical problems. A new block is added to the blockchain every time a new problem is solved, rewarding the miner with Bitcoins. This process requires a lot of energy because the computers need to use a ledger for all transactions so that the same coins aren’t spent twice - this takes time and consumes a lot of electricity. How can Bitcoin mining become sustainable?\nDe Vries’ research reveals that if the price of Bitcoin continues to go down, and the amount of energy needed to mine it continues to rise, Bitcoin investment could become uneconomical.\nA report from Elite Fixtures looked at the cost of mining Bitcoin around the world. They found that the cost to mine a Bitcoin varies significantly, from as little as £400 (Venezuela) to a whopping £19,648 (South Korea)! These figures are based on the average electricity rates in 115 different countries. The current value of 1 Bitcoin: £5563 The current estimated cost to mine 1 Bitcoin in the UK: £8402\nAt its current value, it is therefore uneconomical to mine Bitcoin in the UK, as the cost to mine 1 Bitcoin exceeds its potential profit. Popular mining destinations (where miners can make a profit) include Russia and Iceland.\nOne of the ways Bitcoin mining can be made more sustainable is if the world shifts to 100% renewable energy in the years ahead. Although renewable energy still comes with its costs, mining Bitcoin using renewables could make it a more feasible investment into the future.\nFor example, a state-owned wind farm in Estonia opened cryptocurrency mine on Friday, 1 June. The windswept Baltic Sea island is able to harness this unlimited, sustainable energy supply to get a better return and better on their cryptocurrency. But is it possible to go 100% green?\nNew research from Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews journal found that a shift to total renewable energy using contemporary technology is both possible and affordable.\nCo-author of the research, Brian Vad Mathiesen of Aalborg University says: “There are some persistent myths that 100 percent renewable systems are not possible. Our contribution deals with these myths one-by-one, using all the latest research. Now let’s get back to the business of modelling low-cost scenarios to eliminate fossil fuels from our energy system, so we can tackle the climate and health challenges they pose.”\nIt’s not impossible to imagine a world in which Bitcoin is used exclusively, backed by green energy. If there’s one thing we’ve learnt over time, it’s to ‘never say never’...\nAbout the author: Shea Karssing is a writer for Smarter Business , one of the UK’s leading independent consultancies, helping businesses secure the most comprehensive savings solutions from utilities contract management and procurement to business loans and facilities maintenance.

top-preforming cryptocurrency blog founded by the blockchain writer and marketer Andrew Stephen Mailen Jun 7 Current Bitcoin Transaction Volume Same As When BTC was $500.00 The current transaction level of BTC is roughly 210,000 transaction per day while it was at nearly 400,000 in December before Bitcoin’s ATH. The current transaction volume is the same as when BTC was still equivalent to USD $500.00. Does the number of places you can use Bitcoin at directly affect its price, or will application and speculative trading drive the currency? Photo by Chris Liverani on Unsplash D espite Bitcoin’s popularity in the USA being a night and day difference from 2017 to 2018, the use rate hasn’t seemed to change much. In fact, the number of merchants who accept Bitcoin this year is fewer than the amount that accepted Bitcoin last year . One of the reasons that some enthusiasts are so excited for the virtual currency is because of how quick and easy it is to send. However, as the (current) opportunity to use BTC diminishes, will the excitement for virtual currencies fade away as well? Probably not. As provoked in a recent post by Hackernoon , the blockchain revolution is probably more so about new applications and trading… not direct use. The direct use of the currency was much more important at an earlier phase of blockchain and bitcoin when people were still using it to buy illegal goods on the (digital) Silk Road. This phase distributed the token more throughout the world, helping it ascend to its current global platform. In the above graph, the red circle indicates the time when Silk Road closed. Lets circle back to our initial question: will the number of (current) opportunities to use Bitcoin directly effect the price? Since this market place was the most popular choice for BTC to be used at the time of closing, this would mean that the ability to use Bitcoin would have fallen upon the closure of the website (if using the above, bolded logic). Despite the closure of Silk Road, the price of Bitcoin continued to rise throughout 2013, nearly doubling its price in 3 months after trailing sideways for the later part of that summer and early fall. This is one example that illustrates that the number of available opportunites to use Bitcoin does not have a direct consequence on price at these levels. What do YOU think? Will the (current) decline of opportunities to use Bitcoin reflect the future price of the cryptocurrency?

So in today's edition of Bitcoin in Brief we also feature a surefire way to make a quick fortune in cryptocurrency.\nAlso Read: Coinmint to Invest up to $700 Million in New York Mining Center\nHow to Make $120,000 in a Week Are you too cautious to bet on ICOs? Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not.\nThank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.\n— Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018\nLedger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon Ledger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won't require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore.\nQuis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes? Block Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to \"completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.\" The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to \"ensure that fraudulent ICOs don't get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.\" Of course if you are going to trust a \"team of experienced professionals\" to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren't scamming you first.\nStrong Demand for Chinese Ghosts And speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily .\n\"One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,\" one provider reportedly said. \"An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,\" the whitepaper provider added.\nVirtual Crypto Technologies' New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: \"We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.\"\nBitcoin Cash on Money Week Dominic Frisby, Money Week's commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of 'Bitcoin: the Future of Money?' has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. \"I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.\"\nAdvising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: \"Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I'd have to say bitcoin cash.\"\nWhat do you think about today's news updates?

BTC/USD is dancing with $7,000; the level we explored in an earlier publication. The 61.8% Fib retracement level with the last swing high of $8,770 and a low of $7,090 is offering immediate resistance above $7,000.\nWhile on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” segment, Wall Street’s own Warren Buffet and the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon warned investors to be wary of virtual currencies. Warren Buffet said, “Just beware” while Jamie reckoned, “I don’t want to be a Bitcoin spokesman,” The two have been Bitcoin’s critics for a while now, for instance in May this year, Warren said that Bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.”\nBitcoin has suffered the biggest slide from the near $20,000 highs it traded last year in December. The crypto has been unable to break past the long-term resistance at $10,000 for a while now, however, there is a weak bullish trend that began earlier this month. But the general trend is still bearish. The multi-week descending trend is approaching a breakout that could see Bitcoin finally attack $8,000 for the first time in June. The price will find a support at $7,600, but the zone at $7,400 will offer stronger support.

The U.S. stock market doesn’t just help people to gain and lose fortunes domestically, it also impacts forex and other stock exchanges. Bitcoin is different. It’s wholly unique in that there isn’t a steep learning curve. In fact, a student at George Washington University Online is just as likely, and perhaps maybe a little more, than a broker to be able to explain the concept of Bitcoin.\nIt’s a cryptocurrency that was made for computer users to be able to create their own little world. Payments made with Bitcoin are all but untraceable, which isn’t good for world governments. If they can’t get their hands on the source of each bitcoin, how will they be able to tax it? Bitcoin and Dark Web\nThere’s a market for everything, including illegal activities. Drugs and even murder-for-hire are said to be obtainable online via the Dark Web. No government likes the idea of people being able to go online and pay for illegal products and services with no fear of reprisal. Entire societies have fallen by the proliferation of such activities. While stock market exchanges are made out in the open, the Dark Web offers insider trading tips at a premium. The sad part is that many of these kinds of activities are paid with bitcoins. Taxing Online Transactions\nSay that you bought 100 bitcoins two years ago and you just remembered that you had them. Today, you’d be a millionaire and the government is going to want their cut. This is where legislature gets tricky as Bitcoin was created on the web and none of its users want to be tracked or monitored in any way. Any money that you make is subject to tax. On the other hand, how is the government going to be able to tax transactions that can’t even be tracked? This is why countries like North Korea considered doing away with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies altogether. Bitcoin is also popular with George Washington University students because it can be used to pay for all manner of things.\nWhen you want to cash out your stocks, you are responsible for reporting the transaction when you file taxes. It appears the U.S. government wants the same rules to apply to Bitcoin transactions. Tracing Bitcoin Purchases and Sales\nIf you purchase Bitcoin rather than mine it, you need to have a source of funding. Most people just use their debit or credit cards to buy bitcoins and then keep the coins stored in a secure e-wallet. Exchanging bitcoins for cash can be harder. Unlike stocks, bitcoins aren’t really backed by hard currency. Instead, you have to find someone who believes that they are valuable enough to trade for cash and you are going to pay for that service.\nBitcoin doesn’t operate like the stock market, but it can get just as huge, if not bigger, as long as the government allows it. With that said, you shouldn’t invest in Bitcoin if you don’t know how it works. The good news is that you need far less formal trading experience to become a bitcoin miner than a stock trader.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-stop-sites-from-using-your-cpu-to-mine-coins/", "http://www.printfriendly.com/print?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwall-street.com%2Fbitcoin-shaking-global-politics%2F&title=Why%20Bitcoin%20Is%20Shaking%20Up%20Global%20Politics", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2018/02/17/bitcoin-may-have-found-a-bottom/#27f1686f8f96", "http://politicalmanagementmasters.online.gwu.edu/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "george washington university online", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T17:15:22.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eae7d6a98808c111ef856dbe2f018003e6e3afe5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUBZO2eKY6kfiwcjlJNgV6M-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can actually Bitcoin be good for the environment?", "title_full": "Can actually Bitcoin be good for the environment?", "published": "2018-06-07T14:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eae7d6a98808c111ef856dbe2f018003e6e3afe5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUBZO2eKY6kfiwcjlJNgV6M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "troglobait", "published": "2018-06-07T14:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can actually Bitcoin be good for the environment?", "text": "honestly speaking I do not really understand how bitcoin can help the environment.

Will Be Operational In 12 Months\nCoinmint plans to invest up to $700 million in the project, which will create an estimated 150 jobs over the next 18 months. The new center is expected to be fully operational within the next 12 months, the company projected in a statement .\nNot surprisingly, the town of Massena is excited about the jobs the new mining center will create. The plant will be staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year by security personnel, IT technicians, electricians, and operational staff.\n“The thought of 150 jobs and revitalization of the Alcoa East Facility is exciting,” said Steve O’Shaughnessy, Massena town supervisor. “We are ready to provide any assistance we can to move this project to its full potential.” New York state could soon be home to the world’s largest bitcoin mining center. | Source: Pixabay\nThe old Alcoa plant shuttered in 2014, but Coinmint has signed a 10-year lease on the property, signaling its confidence that despite bitcoin’s recent price slump, it believes cryptocurrencies are here to stay.\n“As long as bitcoin networks exist, we anticipate mining to be profitable,” Coinmint’s chief technology officer Prieur Leary told CNBC . “We’ve developed a process to get an edge in the market.” Access to Cheaper Power Sources\nAs CCN previously reported, there has been much scuttlebutt over the high cost of bitcoin mining, which consumes a lot of electricity. As bitcoin prices have plummeted, mining has become less profitable , especially for individual miners.\nBut Coinmint says Massena’s access to cheaper power sources such as hydroelectric and wind will keep mining costs down.\n“The area’s citizens and its hydroelectric power — a green alternative to the less sustainable energies used at other digital asset infrastructure data centers — were the catalyst for our move and will be foundational assets for continued expansion,” said Coinmint rep Kyle Carlton . “The reduced electricity costs will enable us to compete in the rapidly emerging digital currency global marketplace.”\nChina currently has the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining pools. If Upstate New York wants to be the king of bitcoin mining, it may need to battle both China and Russia, where crypto mining has mushroomed .\nDmitry Marinichev, President Vladimir Putin’s internet ombudsman, is currently overseeing the construction of the Russian Mining Center, which he hopes will transform Russia into a cryptocurrency powerhouse, as CCN has reported.\nMarinichev and his partners have invested $10 million into the Russian Mining Center and raised $43 million through an initial coin offering. “This is a new milestone in the development of mankind,” Marinichev gushed.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/eCk4-noi-DA?feature=oembed",

Author Alex de Vries says: “The Bitcoin development community is experimenting with solutions such as the Lightning Network to improve the throughput of the network, which may alleviate the situation. For now, however, Bitcoin is a big problem and it is growing fast.”\nWhy does Bitcoin mining require so much energy?\nThe Bitcoin mining process uses computers with software that can solve complex mathematical problems. A new block is added to the blockchain every time a new problem is solved, rewarding the miner with Bitcoins. This process requires a lot of energy because the computers need to use a ledger for all transactions so that the same coins aren’t spent twice – this takes time and consumes a lot of electricity.\nHow can Bitcoin mining become sustainable?\nDe Vries’ research reveals that if the price of Bitcoin continues to go down, and the amount of energy needed to mine it continues to rise, Bitcoin investment could become uneconomical.\nA report from Elite Fixtures looked at the cost of mining Bitcoin around the world. They found that the cost to mine a Bitcoin varies significantly, from as little as £400 (Venezuela) to a whopping £19,648 (South Korea)! These figures are based on the average electricity rates in 115 different countries.\nThe current value of 1 Bitcoin: £5563\nThe current estimated cost to mine 1 Bitcoin in the UK: £8402\nAt its current value, it is therefore uneconomical to mine Bitcoin in the UK, as the cost to mine 1 Bitcoin exceeds its potential profit. Popular mining destinations (where miners can make a profit) include Russia and Iceland.\nOne of the ways Bitcoin mining can be made more sustainable is if the world shifts to 100% renewable energy in the years ahead. Although renewable energy still comes with its costs, mining Bitcoin using renewables could make it a more feasible investment into the future.\nFor example, a state-owned wind farm in Estonia opened cryptocurrency mine on Friday, 1 June. The windswept Baltic Sea island is able to harness this unlimited, sustainable energy supply to get a better return and better on their cryptocurrency.\nBut is it possible to go 100% green?\nNew research from Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews journal found that a shift to total renewable energy using contemporary technology is both possible and affordable.\nCo-author of the research, Brian Vad Mathiesen of Aalborg University says: “There are some persistent myths that 100 percent renewable systems are not possible. Our contribution deals with these myths one-by-one, using all the latest research. Now let’s get back to the business of modelling low-cost scenarios to eliminate fossil fuels from our energy system, so we can tackle the climate and health challenges they pose.”\nIt’s not impossible to imagine a world in which Bitcoin is used exclusively, backed by green energy. If there’s one thing we’ve learnt over time, it’s to ‘never say never’…\nImage credit: Tiger Pixel\nfrom YouGen Blog http://www.yougen.co.uk/blog-entry/3052/The+Energy+to+Sustain+Bitcoin+-+Part+2/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pwc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T14:21:25.005+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 30808, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=1400", "requestsLeft": 648}
