Decentralization is the Core of Crypto Freedom Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has. Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else. Never believe that a few caring people can’t change the world. For, indeed, that’s all who ever have.\n–Margaret Mead\nCryptocurrency decentralizes financial power down to the most basic unit of society: the individual. It empowers the average person who now has a viable alternative to corrupt government fiat and central banking systems.\nCrypto is profoundly individualistic in other ways. Consider just one.\n“The revolution of rising expectations.” The phrase refers to a situation in which an increase in prosperity and freedom leads people to believe they can improve their lives through their own efforts. The belief makes them demand political changes that allow more prosperity, more freedom. The average person is not a freedom fighter, and their demand for change need not hinge on ideology. They simply want a better life for their children.\nThe phrase arose after World War II had destabilized the power structure of the world. Former colonies from the Far East to Latin America and Africa threw off imperialism and despotism because average people glimpsed another option to conformity: individual freedom.\nThe advent of cryptocurrency is destabilizing the financial structure of the world, and it has caused a second revolution of rising expectations. It does not occur on the national level but within the lives of individuals, who can finally control their own finances in privacy and with confidence. This has deep political implications, of course, because independent people are less likely to obey.\nAnd, yet, voices within crypto deny that the phenomenon is individualistic. Their argument usually runs as follows: cryptocurrencies depend on a cooperative network of miners, nodes, developers, and administrators. In short, it is collective. This reveals a confusion about the meaning of individualism\nWhat is Individualism?\nAs a social theory, it means advocating the freedom of individuals as opposed to the power of a collective, especially the state. As a personal matter, it means people make their own peaceful choices, especially the choice to say “no.”\nIndividualism is often misconstrued as a “rugged” independence from the desire or the need for society. In some cases, that may be true. But usually the opposite applies because human beings seek interaction almost as much as they seek food and shelter.\nIn his masterpiece, Human Action , the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises explained , “If praxeology [the study of human action] speaks of the solitary individual, acting on his own behalf only and independent of fellow men, it does so for the sake of a better comprehension of the problems of social cooperation. We do not assert that such isolated autarkic human beings have ever lived and that the social stage of man’s nonhuman ancestors and the emergence of the primitive social bonds were effected in the same process. Man appeared on the scene of earthly events as a social being. The isolated asocial man is a fictitious construction.”\nInteracting in society or joining a network actually increases individualism because it allows each person to reach his or her potential and to achieve goals that are impossible in isolation. Jointly-produced wealth can be far more abundant than privately-produced wealth, leaving everyone involved richer. It is precisely this sort of social cooperation that has made mankind dominate the planet.\nThe only relevant question is: do they interact voluntarily or against their will? Are they free to say “no”?\nThe value of society depends upon the decentralization of power down to the individual. If power is centralized by a state or another collective, then society can easily become a disvalue. Peaceful acts, such as using drugs, can result in prison; property can be confiscated for violating an unreasonable law; children can be kidnapped by a state agency, whether or not abuse has occurred.\nA Less Obvious Lesson from Satoshi\nA cooperative system is immensely valuable to individuals. In the case of Satoshi, he provided it for free because he wanted to change the world for the better, and freedom is the path to that destination.\nThe revolution offered by Satoshi Nakamoto is a perfect illustration of how genuine individualism works in society. Economic control is vested in the hands of individuals, where it firmly remains. People can store their wealth in private wallets and conduct international trade, without going through a banking system that is an extension of the state. Trusted third parties, such as banks, are replaced by individuals, such as miners. It does not matter if the miners are part of a collective effort. It only matters that each one participates voluntarily and can say “no” at any point. If that is the case, then they remain full individuals who choose to function within a cooperative effort.\nThe decentralization of economic control is reinforced, not contradicted, by the cooperation of a network of people—all of whom act in their own self-interest. That’s as it should be. And, yet, all of the strangers benefit each other, even though they are strangers who might not care for each other should they ever meet. That is true society.\nIt is also the reason why all state efforts to control cryptocurrency revolve around centralization. Central banks attempt to issue their own crypto in order to usurp the market. Centralized exchanges dominate trades, which they report religiously to the state. Privacy renegades are imprisoned, or otherwise slapped down hard. Private cryptos, like Monero, are accused of being “drug money,” even while state-issued crypto is regarded as pure as fresh-fallen snow. Decentralized, or private systems, are demonized when they are actually the true hope for financial freedom. Which, to a statist, probably makes them demons.\nThe free market and individual rights are often blamed for the problems of society. The free market exploits and individuals make the wrong decisions; or, so the story goes. And, sometimes, the story is true. But the free market and individual rights are blamed not for the wrongs they commit but because they pose the greatest threats to social control. The libertarian touchstone, Murray Rothbard, explained the difference between “free market exploitation” and state control.\n“If I cease or refrain from purchasing Wheaties on the market, the Wheaties producers do not come after me with a gun or the threat of imprisonment to force me to purchase; if I fail to join the American Philosophical Association, the association may not force me to join or prevent me from giving up my membership. Only the state can do so; only the state can confiscate my property or put me in jail if I do not pay its tax tribute. Therefore, only the state regularly exists and has its very being by means of coercive depredations on private property.”\nDecentralization of power to the individual, who chooses to buy Wheaties or not, is the acknowledged lesson of Satoshi. The largely overlooked one is that human beings in cooperation with each other is a basic expression of individualism.\nConclusion\n“The revolution of rising expectations.” What people need more than anything else is hope; it drives revolutions that occur despite tremendous obstacles, and it creates peaceful societies in which people prosper. But, sooner or later, hope must be based on evidence that there is reason to do so. Cryptocurrency is not merely evidence, it is proof.\nIt is also individualistic, because nothing inspires individualism as much as the belief that life can become better through effort and merit.\n[To be continued next week.]\nReprints of this article should credit bitcoin.com and include a link back to the original links to all previous chapters\nWendy McElroy has agreed to ”live-publish” her new book The Satoshi Revolution exclusively with Bitcoin.com.

The exchange expects to be licensed in Japan next month, according to the chief executive of Monex, the online brokerage which bought the troubled company last month.\nAlso read: Coincheck Resumes Monero Withdrawals and Sales Coincheck’s US Plans – Part of the Comeback\nRecognizing the need to “study carefully” the legal framework for cryptocurrencies in the US, Japanese exchange Coincheck is planning to expand its operations and its customer base in America, building on top of over 2 million accounts in Japan. No timeframe has been specified yet, but the move is under consideration by the platform’s new management. Its operator, Coin Check Co., became a wholly owned subsidiary of Monex Group in April after losing some ¥58 billion worth of NEM (~$550 million USD at the time) in a hacker attack in January – one of the biggest heists in crypto history.\n“The legal framework for cryptocurrency in the US is somehow wandering right now – money transfer, commodity, security. And, the rules are different state by state. So, we have to study this carefully. But the short answer is ‘yes’,” Monex CEO Oki Matsumoto told Bloomberg in an interview about Coincheck’s future intentions. He also revealed that the exchange, which spent a lot of funds and efforts to improve security and restore confidence, is expecting to receive a license in Japan next month. Matsumoto’s comments indicated that bringing the trading platform to the US is also part of the plans for the comeback.\nFor many observers, the purchase of the notoriously hacked cryptocurrency exchange for $34 million might have looked like a risky investment, but the takeover has so far proven to be a positive move for Monex. Its shares have almost doubled in price since the news of the acquisition broke in April. Doing crypto business in the US may not seem like a great idea either, given that the company comes from Japan, a country known for its much friendlier crypto atmosphere. A Different Perspective of the West\nMatsumoto, however, has a different reading of the situation as he sees favorable conditions forming in the West, including lower taxes and growing interest from institutional money managers. France was mentioned in the interview in the light of last month’s government decision to lower the crypto capital gains tax rate by more than half – to 19 percent, compared to Japan’s 55 percent.\nAnother sign of the warming climate in Paris was the Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire’s statement this week that he was wrong about cryptocurrencies before. “I was a neophyte a year ago, but now I’m passionate. It took me a year, so let’s […] make France the first place for blockchain and crypto innovation in the EU,” Le Maire was quoted as saying at a meeting with entrepreneurs and representatives of the French startup Blockchain Partner. According to Bitcoin.fr , he also assured the members of the French crypto community of his “total support.”\nThe Japanese government does not plan any tax cuts for crypto-related incomes and gains and that, according to Oki Matsumoto, means that cryptocurrency will remain a “plaything for speculators.” Despite legalizing crypto trade last year, Tokyo has yet to determine the status of crypto-related financial products such as futures contracts, which will require some amendments to the Japanese securities law.\n“Japan may seem like it’s one step ahead in crypto, but in terms of deciding what’s a security or a token, and in terms of attracting institutional investors, the US and Europe are moving ahead,” the chief executive of Monex said. In his opinion, the classification of cryptocurrencies in the United States will create regulatory clarity which is necessary to draw more investors. Matsumoto believes that the decisions US regulators take will influence the role of cryptocurrencies, in general, and have a huge impact on the crypto policies in his country, in particular.\nWhat are your expectations for the future of crypto industries in both Japan and the US?

In fact, the market reversed and is now trading at a monthly low! As usual, investors are wondering where the market will go from here. Market Overview\nContrary to popular expectation, Bitcoin failed to rally 69 – 130% after the Consensus conference in New York ended this week. In fact, it pulled back nearly 5% as the cryptocurrency market capitalization sank to $389 billion and it appears that the downtrend is set to continue for the short term.\nFortunately, things still bode well for crypto as: Goldman Sachs is developing a dollar pegged cryptocurrency ( USDCoin ) through Circle which will finally provide an alternative stablecoin to Tether. As Consensus wrapped up, the CFTC and SEC directors shared their view that they have no desire to stand in the path of blockchain development. A platform for institutional investment in cryptocurrencies is gradually concretizing which further supports claims that institutional investors will boost cryptocurrency prices in the future.\nKeeping this in mind, at present there is still more tangibly good news than bad news in the crypto-hemisphere and volatility is nothing new to cryptocurrency investors… though all of the moonshot valuations and promises of tripling market caps may have led us to forget this. Daily Chart\nAfter a nearly 5% drop, BTC briefly touched a monthly low at $7,925 on Bitfinex. As shown on the daily chart, this is a nearly 50% retracement of the pre-April rally low of $6,425.\nOn 18th May BTC had continued a pattern of lower highs and lower lows and the daily chart shows BTC below the 100 and 200-day MA and at the time of writing the RSI sits below the 50 indicating that bears have the advantage. 4HR Chart\nThere is a smidgen of positive news for the short term as around midday Saturday the 5 and 10-day MA changed direction and BTC is close to exiting the recently developed downward channel. On the other hand, both the 20 and 50-day MA are sloping downwards and BTC needs to cross the 50-day MA at $8,400. At the time of writing BTC still trades below the 50-day MA suggesting short term continuance of the bearish trend.\nIf BTC is unable to recover or hold above $8,000, there are long term supports at $7,800 and $7,600 but how likely these are to hold is questionable as $7,784 is at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement. A close below $8,000 means that a reversal favorable to the bears is in place and the ensuing sell off could drop prices to $7,000 or lower. Vision BTC is close to crossing the 50-day MA at $8,400 and a close above the 50 would set BTC outside the recently developed downward trendline. Failure to recover could lead BTC to touch the $7,784 support at the 61.8 percent retracement. Traders are advised to watch from the sidelines as most technical indicators show bears having the advantage.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

The 21-year old mobile phone company headquartered in Taiwan is developing its own Android Smartphone that will be powered by blockchain technology . Exodus not Finney\nAccording to The Next Web (TNW) , the premium smartphone called ‘Exodus’ will come with a universal cryptocurrency wallet and an inbuilt secure hardware enclave that will take care of distributed ledger technology-based apps.\nIn 2015, HTC and Valve Corporation joined forces in creating the Vive virtual reality headset, which has not ceased generating significant returns for the firm since then. Phil Chen was entirely instrumental in the success of the VR headset, as such HTC has made him the head of Exodus, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency-related matters in the company. HTC Blockchain Network on the Cards\nAs per TNW , the company is putting preparations in top gear to launch its native blockchain network which all Exodus phones would be able to connect to and facilitate users’ cryptocurrency trading activities. Also, the phone would offer support for Bitcoin’s Lightning Network protocol , Dfinity, and other blockchains. Chen declared:\n“Through Exodus, we are excited to be supporting underlying protocols such as Bitcoin , Lightning Network, Ethereum , Dfinity and more. We would like to support the entire blockchain ecosystem, and in the next few months we’ll be announcing more exciting partnerships together.” Blockchain Technology’s Unending Ubiquity\nCryptocurrencies would be an accepted payment method for the purchase of Exodus, however, the firm is yet to fix a price for the phone.\nSimilarly, Sirin Labs in collaboration with Foxconn, the world’s largest manufacturer of contract electronics have strategically combined, and they are almost done developing the world’s first blockchain, and Android-powered Smartphone, Sirin Finney .\nOn May 11, Sirin Labs released specifications for the flagship phone and in addition to having blockchain-specific features such as a highly secure cold storage wallet that supports bitcoin and a vast array of altcoins , the $1,000 smartphone also comes with Android 8.1 OS that runs decentralized apps.\nWhile blockchain technology has proven itself in quite many industries across the globe, the mobile phone ecosystem is just warming up to the revolution.\nOn May 11, 2018, BTCManager reported that China’s leading smartphone manufacturer, Huawei, had hinted that bitcoin wallet would soon be available on its AppGallery for hodlers who own the company’s latest smartphones.\nWhile some have criticized the blockchain-powered mobile phones initiative of firms like Sirin Labs, HTC, and Huawei, saying there is nothing extraordinary about blockchain-based handsets as other mobile devices can as well perform same crypto-related functions with the right software. This latest development, however, goes a long way to show that blockchain technology is gradually coming of age and it is just a matter of time before it proliferates into all ecosystems.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phil chen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "htc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "htc blockchain network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valve corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T04:18:13.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "32ea967c9a9fbb0385d1c1e871d46a91412c8beb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54AeSrBsz46qhNmdMOvYRCad1M9hLG1yMfSuXc_H_MMPtvy4lKfOLpZ8UAhySY34j0tzU.Wg_Ul0V1Af9zQgFtt1jBqhqcB1Vjg--", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Tom Lee Explains Why Consensus Failed to Spark the Bitcoin Rally - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "Tom Lee Explains Why Consensus Failed to Spark the Bitcoin Rally - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tom-lee-1920x1200.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32ea967c9a9fbb0385d1c1e871d46a91412c8beb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54AeSrBsz46qhNmdMOvYRCad1M9hLG1yMfSuXc_H_MMPtvy4lKfOLpZ8UAhySY34j0tzU.Wg_Ul0V1Af9zQgFtt1jBqhqcB1Vjg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Osato Avan-Nomayo", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tom Lee Explains Why Consensus Failed to Spark the Bitcoin Rally - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "Tom Lee Explains Why Consensus Failed to Spark the Bitcoin Rally May 19, 2018 20 Views Osato Avan-Nomayo · May 19, 2018 · 6:00 pm\nTom Lee of Fundstrat Global is standing by his $25K end-of-year Bitcoin price despite the failure of Consensus to cause the much-anticipated crypto price rally. In an interview with CNBC , the analyst offered explanations for why the conference didn’t spark an increase in crypto prices. What Went Wrong\nGoing into Consensus, most of the talk featured the expectation that crypto prices will soar during and after the summit. Based on the pattern of the last three years, experts hinged their bet on a big crypto rally .\nAlas, Consensus came and went without any price increase. In fact, the opposite happened. Prices dropped, and the total crypto market cap tanked by $40 billion during the conference in New York City. The Bitcoin price declined by 3 percent by the end of the conference.\nLee began by admitting that perhaps he and other experts were overly optimistic due to the expected large turnout at Consensus . He also said that after months of uncertainty, the gathering of many crypto enthusiasts was seen as a precursor to the reinvigoration of confidence in the market.\nDuring the interview, Lee identified the lack of clarity on regulatory discussions and muted custodial announcements at Consensus as part of the reasons why the conference didn’t produce the expected results. Lack of Regulatory Clarity\n— CNBC’s Fast Money (@CNBCFastMoney) May 18, 2018\nLee pointed out that there was a lack of clarity on the crypto regulatory front. According to him, the conversion on government cryptocurrency regulations didn’t move forward during Consensus .\nThe Fundstrat analyst did state that the issue of regulatory clarity was one that required a nuanced approach. According to him, crypto enthusiasts have certain expectations about the matter. However, many weren’t expecting an exact regulatory outcome, but the lack of any movement on the topic was disappointing, to say the least. CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 rally did not happen, very disappointing. What we needed was a trifecta of progress: (i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed), but we got progress on (i) and (ii). Full text below pic.twitter.com/XcqNhgYgK7\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 18, 2018 Muted Institutional Custodial Announcement\nAnother highly anticipated topic during Consensus was the emergence of institutional custodial tools for crypto. Lee said there were a couple of positive announcements, most notably by Nomura .\nHowever, he maintained that a lot more needed to be done on the institutional front. According to him, even if investment managers buy into Bitcoin , a lot of internal evangelization is required to take things up a notch. Positive Signs\nDespite the lack of a Bitcoin price rally, Lee maintains that there were some positives. Speaking during the interview, he said:\nI think Consensus was a huge success. It is a great conference to bring a lot of people together from around the world. The quality of the people that were there was amazing.\nLee also noted that the impending CME futures contract for Ethereum was most likely to end the security-utility debate for the number two crypto. When asked about his $25k end-of-year Bitcoin price prediction, Lee stuck to his guns saying:\nBitcoin doesn’t have to go up every day to move from $8,000 to $25,000. The ten best days account for all the return of bitcoin in a year. If you didn’t own bitcoin for ten days each year, you lost 25 percent each year.\nSpeaking on Fundstrat’s proprietary misery index , Lee said the Bitcoin misery is now at 30 percent after having dropped to 18 percent in April.\nDo you agree with Lee’s explanation for why Consensus failed to instigate the Bitcoin price rally?

The Floating Island Project is exactly as it reads, only it’s to be an independent government complete with its own cryptocurrency. An idea long thought to be a crazy dream of libertarians is now incredibly close to realization.\nAlso read: Alec Baldwin’s Lambo Movie Backed by Crypto Tech Crypto Floating Island Project Nearer to a Reality\n“A core structural feature of current models of government is centralization,” begins the pitch for an initial coin offering (ICO) pre-sale of Varyon from Blue Frontiers. “Too much centralized authority leads to inefficient bureaucracies and representatives disconnected from the people they are meant to serve. Given a suitable technological solution, governments are ripe for decentralization. That technological solution is seasteading.”\nThe book Seasteading: How Floating Nations Will Restore the Environment, Enrich the Poor, Cure the Sick, and Liberate Humanity from Politicians (Free Press, 2017) caused an immediate media sensation. Written by Joe Quirk and Patri Friedman, it’s the nonfiction account of what seems at the outset to be a sci-fi idea. Dutifully, legacy outlets treated it that way, at times dismissing seasteading as impractical, the stuff of fantasy.\n“Varyon (VAR),” via the Ethereum chain (1 ETH = 14,750 VAR), ERC-20 token, “is a general purpose payment token for the exchange of goods and services in the Blue Frontiers ecosystem, other ecosystems, and between token holders. Blue Frontiers is planning to use the proceeds of the sale to expand its ecosystem and create Seazones and seasteads, and will only accept Varyon (VAR) for its products and services,” Blue Frontiers claims.\nA completely unrelated business proposition put seasteading into perspective. Anglo-Dutch oil and gas concern Shell launched its quarter-century at sea project, Prelude . Assembled in Samsung’s Heavy Industries Geoje shipyard, South Korea, Prelude is Shell’s gamble at taking a refinery to natural gas deposits previously imagined out of reach. Longer than the Empire State Building is tall, Prelude’s hull is among the largest ever built. The enormous project is an inspiring construct, stretching four continents and thousands of people. No Longer Just a Dream\nPrelude is a floating city, and not in the literary license sense. It doesn’t take long to sympathize with Mr. Quirk’s and Mr. Friedman’s vision, even if it’s covered in petroleum-seeking profits at the moment. A floating island, then, isn’t the wacky concept one might be forgiven for at first highly doubting. Combine that real-world use case with modern cruise ships, perhaps linking them together, and it also isn’t terribly hard to consider a country at sea. That’s the idea. Members of the Seasteading Institute , which can count among its members luminaries such as Peter Thiel, created a company bent on making all that theory turn real, Blue Frontiers. Early last year, in fact, the group inked a deal with French Polynesia to effectively use wet territory under its dominion in an attempt to bring to life the Floating Island Project.\n“Blue Frontiers plans to prototype the first seastead with funds raised from the Varyon (VAR) Crowdsale, and to fund additional seasteads through sales,” the project continues . “The Varyon (VAR) Blue Frontiers holds for seastead and Seazone Construction, Development, and Administration will be used only as needed, in order to create seasteads and Seazones and to strengthen the ecosystem of products and services available to Varyon (VAR) holders.”\nThe distribution of VAR follows pretty standard ICO procedures: “The amount of Varyon (VAR) allotted to seastead/Seazone Construction, Development, Administration is inversely correlated with the amount purchased in the public sale. That is, the more Varyon (VAR) sold in the public sale, the less Varyon (VAR) held for seastead/Seazone Construction, Development, Administration,” Blue Frontiers details . Thus, up to 28% is available during public sale; up to 8% presale; up to 6% for seed funders; up to 15% for the team; and the remainder goes to the project itself, up to 72%.” “Seasteading brings decentralization beyond the digital world of bits and into the world of atoms by providing modular, floating structures – seasteads – on which the evolution of new societies and forms of governance can occur,” Blue Frontiers asserts . “Promising solutions can branch off at any time by physically separating to create new seasteads – enabling a high level of evolvability and quick rate of adaptation. Mimicking nature’s time-tested method of variation and selection, the process of decentralizing governance through seasteading will spark the creation and evolution of new advancements in civilization.”\nDid you think projects like seasteading will eventually get off the ground?

A bankruptcy case involving a modest amount of bitcoin has sparked discussions in Russian legal circles. Some say a crypto is nothing more than “a set of characters.” Others, including the justice minister, are categorical – cryptocurrency can’t be anything else but property. Russian Justice Ministry Takes Side in a Legal Argument\nCryptocurrency falls under the legal category of “other property,” Russia’s Justice Minister Alexander Konovalov told reporters this week. With two draft laws on the matter still pending in the State Duma, he also noted that digital coins should not be considered electronic money, at least on this stage.\nA bankruptcy case involving some bitcoin holdings has recently stirred the Russian legal community, which was challenged to provide a provisional answer to the question about the status of cryptocurrencies. In the absence of firm definitions in the current legislation, this question split Russian legal experts in two camps. On one side are those who think that cryptocurrencies have real value, on the other – their colleagues who believe they don’t, if the law doesn’t explicitly say so.\nAccording to Konovalov, his department has adopted a “consolidated opinion” on the legal nature of cryptocurrencies and it supports the view that they should be defined as property. “If digital money is not property, its theft would not be considered criminal offense because there would be no object of the crime,” he warned.\n“If cryptocurrencies are to develop, additional regulation will be necessary. The main point is to ensure that all this does not grow into financial pyramids,” Konovalov added, quoted by Prime . He is convinced that Russia should introduce rigid crypto regulations but also recognizes that the phenomenon is itself a “manifestation of the people’s desire to escape from total dependence.” The Question Will Be Answered by the Duma Soon\nMinister Konovalov’s comments added to the ongoing debate among experts and officials in Moscow on whether cryptocurrency can be considered a property in accordance with the current Russian legislation. The discussions were prompted by a bankruptcy filing from October last year. During the arbitrage proceedings, the debtor protested the trustee’s request to include his crypto funds, less than 0.2 bitcoin (BTC), in his bankruptcy estate.\nAccording to his legal representative, such move is impossible as the term “cryptocurrency” is not mentioned in Russia’s Civil Code at all. The Moscow Arbitration Court accepted this position. “A conclusion can be drawn that cryptocurrency is a certain set of symbols/characters contained in an information system. It cannot be an object of the civil rights,” it said.\nBut then, earlier in May, an arbitration court of appeals overturned this ruling recognizing cryptocurrency as a valuable property, as news.Bitcoin.com reported . On Thursday, the Ninth Arbitration Court of Appeals published its decision on the case. According to the document quoted by Interfax , cryptocurrency cannot be regarded as anything else but property. And, since the current civil law does not contain the notion “other property”, the widest possible interpretation of property is permissible, the court explained.\nThe question about the status of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation will be answered very soon. Two drafts have been filed in the Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, and the one that focuses on legalizing initial coin offerings will have its first reading on Tuesday, May 22 . The second bill is expected to amend the country’s Civil Code in order to regulate crypto payments. According to comments made by the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev this week, the new legislation will refer to cryptos and tokens as “digital money” and “digital rights”, respectively. Whether this means that bitcoin will be accepted both as currency and property remains to be seen.

This week politicians from the Rocky Mountain state are considering allowing political candidates to accept bitcoin and other forms of digital assets. Secretary of State Wayne Williams proposed the new rules in a draft submitted on May 16, 2018. The proposal states:\nA committee may accept contributions in cryptocurrency, up to the acceptable limit for a cash or coin contribution. The amount of the contribution is the value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the contribution. The committee must report any gain or loss after the contribution as other income or receipts. Crypto-Campaign Acceptance: An Accounting Nightmare\nIn an interview with the Denver Post Suzanne Staiert, Colorado’s deputy secretary of state explains the proposal going through is likely to happen. “The FEC is doing it now,” Staiert details. “So we are just going along for the ride.”\nHowever, the FEC advisory’s guidelines are making the accounting process more difficult explains the deputy. The FEC advisory laid out how the organization thinks committees should deal with the accounting aspects of accepting cryptocurrencies. “It’s going to be an accounting problem, potentially, for campaigns who want to use it,” Staiert further noted. Back in 2014, U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, from Boulder Colorado accepted $2,000 worth of BTC for his campaign. Polis thinks politicians who hold cryptocurrencies should also declare their holdings. U.S. Politicians Have Already Accepted Cryptocurrencies in the Past for Campaigns\nA Colorado state official already has accepted donations in Bitcoin Core (BTC) back in 2014 as U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, D-Boulder accepted $2,000 worth of BTC that year. Other bureaucrats have accepted BTC in the past for political campaigns as well such as Rand Paul and Gary Johnson. Further, news.Bitcoin.com recently reported on the largest BTC donation given to a candidate so far this past December. The Republican U.S. Senate candidate Austin Peterson accepted roughly 0.284 BTC which at the time was worth over $4,500 USD.\nThe Colorado Secretary of State is asking state residents to comment on this issue before officials come to a decision on the matter.\nWhat do you think about the state of Colorado allowing politicians to accept cryptocurrencies for political campaigns?

At the moment the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization of all 1,600+ tokens is around $377Bn with around $16Bn worth of 24-hour trade volume. Bitcoin Core (BTC) markets are up 2.3 percent averaging $8,314 per coin while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) prices are up 1.5 percent at around $1,180 per BCH.\nAlso read: “Stablecoin” Trueusd Pumps After Binance Listing The Week-Long ‘Consensus Pump’ Never Came to Fruition\nThe mid-May ‘blockchain week’ Consensus pump never materialized last week even though there was plenty of positive cryptocurrency news. During the course of the week, most digital assets in the top 500 lost a good portion of gains. This weekend is a different story as a bunch of markets are seeing some recovery from the dips. Bitcoin Cash markets are up 2.3 percent averaging roughly $1,188 per BCH at the time of publication. The decentralized currency’s 24-hour trade volume has dropped considerably to $683Mn which doesn’t give traders hope for a bigger weekend push. The top five exchanges swapping the most BCH today include Okex, Huobi, Hitbtc, Lbank, and EXX. BTC pairs with BCH has increased significantly as BTC represents 41 percent of today’s BCH trades. This is followed by tether (USDT 30%), USD (13%), KRW (11%), and the Euro (1.2%). BCH/USD prices on May 19, 2018. BCH/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the BCH/USD four-hour charts on both Bitstamp and Bitfinex shows bulls need to muster up more strength to break upper resistance. The two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) still have a gap with the 100 SMA above the 200 SMA indicating a good path to the upside. However even though there is a gap it looks as though the two trend lines may cross hairs shortly. RSI oscillator levels point towards an oversold region at 38, and the MACd indicates there will be improvement shortly as well. Looking at the order books towards the upside shows bulls have gigantic sell walls to eat through between the current vantage point and $1,250. On the back side if the BCH bears remain in power there are still some solid foundations between now and $1,130. Traders are looking out for some deeper consolidation before the next breakout as positions currently look like musical chairs at the moment. BCH/USD prices on May 19, 2018, Bitfinex $1,880 per BCH. The Top Digital Currencies See Some Recovery\nOverall most cryptocurrencies today are in the green and nurturing the market wounds from the past 72-hours. Bitcoin Core (BTC) prices are doing decent rebounding today at $8,318 per coin but trade volumes are also low at $5Bn. Ethereum (ETH) the second highest valued market cap is doing very well as markets are up 4.3 percent. One ETH is trading at $708 during Saturdays mid-afternoon trading sessions. Ripple (XRP) prices are up 2.1 percent as each XRP trades at $0.68 cents. Lastly, the fifth position held by EOS is doing the best out of the top five contenders as EOS prices are up 5.6 percent — a single EOS today trades for $13.13 per token. The Verdict: Bullish Optimism Wanes\nOptimism is there among cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts but people are becoming skeptical of the positivity and those predicting bullish pumps. Of course, while the dips take place traders are finding shelter in Tether, and True USD while they wait out the storm. For now, there’s a whole lot of consolidation happening until traders decide when the next big move happens which could go either way at this vantage point.\nWhere do you see the price of BCH and other cryptocurrencies headed from here?

There was free beer served from an ID-validating dispenser, Warren Buffet was criticized for his “rat poison” view of cryptocurrency, and there were plenty of business announcements, including news from eToro, Netki, Bitmain and Circle. Catch up on these stories and more in this week’s Bitcoin Magazine review.Featured stories by Amy Castor, Colin Harper and Kyle TorpeyStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here.Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin In his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as “rat poison.” Venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018. The pair of tech investors pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works.Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID CodesBlockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud.Civic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.”Digital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation SolutionLos Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform. The company is adding investor validation to its existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) solution. The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities.Social Cryptocurrency Trading and Brokerage Firm eToro Is Expanding to U.S.eToro is a regulated global brokerage firm located in Israel that trades in cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, ETFs and more. Having recently received $100 million in funding, the company is currently in talks with U.S. financial institutions, regulators and regulatory advisors, and has already registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The company is opening an office in New Jersey and plans launch a crypto wallet later this year.Bitmain Leads Circle’s $110 Million Round; Teams Up to Create Stable CoinBitmain continues to make news. The largest of the Bitcoin mining operations is putting its muscle behind mobile payments and cryptocurrency trading firm Circle by leading a $110 million Series E round of funding, the companies announced at Consensus this week. They are also joining forces to create a “stablecoin,” a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset. The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, managed by CENTRE, but the first will be Circle USD Coin (USDC), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine.\n< ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kyle torpeystay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy castor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T20:00:21.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4fa530b71581b06db83e605415b05ffeda200225", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.zLOD.b7zjUZbHs1pEeaNc-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4fa530b71581b06db83e605415b05ffeda200225", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.zLOD.b7zjUZbHs1pEeaNc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nBecome the person, who referred the largest number of new users till the end of June 1, 2019 and we will give you 0.3 BTC.

This is roughly $200 higher than where it stood yesterday, and the currency has spiked by approximately five percent over the last 24 hours.\nThe prices of cryptocurrencies are exploding as the week comes to an end. Entities like Ethereum are also up, while the cryptocurrency market cap has added roughly $40 billion to its overall worth.\nInterestingly, the Coindesk Consensus Conference – which took place Monday through Wednesday – ultimately failed to give bitcoin the big boost many enthusiasts were expecting. While the price of the currency is rising now, hype surrounding the event did not produce the results several were hoping for, showing that cryptocurrency remains a highly speculative market; that price boosts can occur through unexpected means, and that things remain highly unpredictable when it comes to how certain forms of crypto will behave.\nOne source predicted that bitcoin would sustain support at the $8,200 levels, and that further declines would stop at both $8,100 and $8,000. Thus far, this appears to be coming true. The next target in sight is $8,400 as bitcoin continues to face diminishing selling pressure. Presently, $8,300 is offering newfound resistance for bitcoin’s price, and it is hard to determine when, exactly, $8,400 could come around.\nThe interesting thing about bitcoin is that despite the volatile nature of the coin, it continues to remain popular amongst users, and advocates’ loyalty towards the currency has yet to falter. A new report says that bitcoin mining now uses about as much energy as the entire country of Ireland – and energy demands don’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.\nIreland is a country with a healthy population – considerably larger than that of Iceland, which was the first country that outdid itself with bitcoin mining. It was reported only months ago that bitcoin mining was now using more energy in Iceland than what was necessary to power every residence within the nation’s borders. That’s a lot, to say the least…\nAustria appears next in line to be outdone by bitcoin mining energy. One source explains that bitcoin mining will soon require as much electricity as the entire German-speaking nation by the end of 2018.\nBetween cooling fans, manufacturing hardware and growing energy costs to operate bitcoin mining rigs, the process of extracting new coins will require as many as 7.67 gigawatts of power by the time 2019 is ready to roll along. That’s roughly one two-hundredth of all the electricity used on planet Earth.\nPresently, bitcoin mining requires only about 3.1 gigawatts of power. That means that by the end of 2018, this figure will have more than doubled. Cryptocurrency mining remains a popular past-time, and that popularity is likely to grow exponentially in the coming months as the final count of unmined bitcoins continues to shrink even further.\nThis leaves a lot of open-ended questions on the horizon, perhaps the biggest one being, “What kind of damage can bitcoin mining do to our environment?” This is an argument we’ve heard before, and will no doubt hear again as the energy required for bitcoin mining operations grows over time.

Electrum is a HD wallet, so you will get the same sequence of private keys, public keys, public addresses using the same seed every time.

Last year’s conference saw attendance double from the year before, and this year the attendance also looked set to double from around 2,750 to over 7,000. The event took place from May 14 to May 16, with estimates on the actual attendance now reaching as high as 9,000 .\nPerhaps due to prior performance and the same conditions arising again, Lee predicted that the market would see a major rally during this year’s conference as well. While Lee pointed out that talks of mass regulation may put a damper on things, the overall message was clear:\n“Bottom line: We expect BTC and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus.”\nUnfortunately, it didn’t happen. Not only was there no rally but the market lost over $40 billion in value during the conference, with major currencies losing value across the board. Source: CoinMarketCap\nThe bitcoin price, meanwhile fell 3.25 percent to $8,250 by the end of the conference, even dipping below the $8,000 mark today before recovering to $8,262 at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap\nInvestors have attributed the dip to a number of factors, including the perception that the conference did not seem to be designed to attract the industry’s core supporters. The ticket prices were considered to be unaffordable at $2,000 a head, and the fact that cryptocurrency was not accepted as payment was criticized as a lack of faith in the technology the conference was held to promote.\nThe talks were seen as overly shallow and pandering to an audience of newcomers, which was not in keeping with the high cost of the tickets, one of the reasons Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said he boycotted the event.\nFundstrat’s Thomas Lee called the lack of a rally “very disappointing”, citing a lack of regulatory clarity as the main issue and stated that the space needed major institutions to buy in in order for the space to grow and move past the “ blockchain not bitcoin ” mentality echoed by several major figures in business and finance. CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 rally did not happen, very disappointing. What we needed was a trifecta of progress: (i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed), but we got progress on (i) and (ii).

While Tim Draper believes: \"Bitcoins are opening a space that will create an innovation like the personal computers did in the 1970's or perhaps the internet do in the 1990's\". This kind of article presents 10 reasons why you should be owning Bitcoins:\n1. Central Authority Do not Worry About Bitcoin Because of Its Independence\nBitcoin is a digital currency that originated in 2009 with a software developer called Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoins are independent of any central authority. Therefore, no govt nor central bank guidelines over them\n2 - Its Fee Is Low if You Compare With Other Payment Transferors\nBitcoins come with almost no fees. In addition, all the programs and services which may have been built around the Bitcoin ecosystem, and which the vast majority of end users wrap up using also carry lower fees than any other traditional online payment methods. If you need essay writing services look at writemypapersonline.com/quick-essay-help/ for quick essay help.\n3 - Its Scale Is larger than Other\nBy today, there are lots of cryptocurrency on the internet. Nevertheless, Bitcoins are by even the one with the most significant user adoption and market cap. Therefore, when you have to pick a cryptocurrency, go for Bitcoins!\n4  How Can Europe just regulated it as a com\nmodity exempt of VAT\nEurope has just approved regulations that qualify Bitcoins as a commodity. Therefore, they are really exempt from VAT. The price of bitcoins is described by demand and source. The new regulations probably produce an increase for the necessity of Bitcoins as they are regularized and exempt of tax within the European monetary union.\n5 - High volatility in the equities market\n2015 has proven to be a highly volatile year for the equities as stocks and options markets around the world have been rallying down and up. Bitcoins are seen for some as an alternative to platinum and therefore as a mean to store value. High volatility in the markets can create an inflow involving into Bitcoins. During the coming a few months the markets are likely to be highly risky.\n6 - Every Company are Creating Tools for the Bitcoin Ecosystem\nVenture capitalists have added tons of money in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nDifferent services and programs enabling the finish user are now available for the non-technical consumers. As more products are build and used in the bitcoin ecosystem, the adoption rate for Bitcoins will increase and the demand with it. This kind of mean you may easily switch a few hundred us dollars into a few million dollars with enough increase in demands.\nTo Prevent a Possible Bank run\nYou don't have to go that far over time. Both Perú and Greece have experienced bank runs in the lasts years. Bitcoins can be a way to store riches outside of the standard bank system and therefore staying away from people to panic when bank runs take place.\nThis image dated August 24th, 1929, shows a view of folks rushing to a saving bank in Millbury, Massachusetts as the stock market on Share market crashed, sparking an operate on banks that spread around the world.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://writemypapersonline.com/quick-essay-help/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T07:12:55.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2c7e94ffdff3bbf8bd353371563bcc7305f4ac3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREDx4uhUJXpyAVJwScup3RIlZmB5JwwYppO8wDhdiZsv0GV.Ci0UQP4ET2G7FyJINnXHI6ymMPzR0C8IOVSzhWkGjLnO1FvBaEKm6IHqWPb5CoiY8H3F5YELZ9X03o68Q-", "site_full": "www.valuewalk.com", "site": "valuewalk.com", "site_section": "https://www.valuewalk.com", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "ValueWalk", "title": "EVERYTHING Warren Buffet EVER SAID About BITCOIN And CRYPTOCURRENCY", "title_full": "EVERYTHING Warren Buffet EVER SAID About BITCOIN And CRYPTOCURRENCY", "published": "2018-05-19T02:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17542, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2c7e94ffdff3bbf8bd353371563bcc7305f4ac3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZREDx4uhUJXpyAVJwScup3RIlZmB5JwwYppO8wDhdiZsv0GV.Ci0UQP4ET2G7FyJINnXHI6ymMPzR0C8IOVSzhWkGjLnO1FvBaEKm6IHqWPb5CoiY8H3F5YELZ9X03o68Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jacob Wolinsky", "published": "2018-05-19T02:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "EVERYTHING Warren Buffet EVER SAID About BITCOIN And CRYPTOCURRENCY", "text": "Warren Buffett on (why) Bitcoin (is terrible) in seven minutes – video and informal transcript below\nGet The Full Warren Buffett Series in PDF Get the entire 10-part series on Warren Buffett in PDF.

If you buy an apartment house you're looking at the apartment house of your biopharmaceuticals farmed. If you buy a whole business you're looking at how the business does. If you buy a part of a business why shouldn't you look at how the businesses are going to do it.\nPeople get charmed by buy lots of action and the fact that things are liquid and all of that and it does have repercussions back into the market when you get something like 80 an arrangement on the supercharges on the VIX. I mean where you can lose 90 percent of your money in one day. I mean that really doesn't belong with the word investment. I mean it's just it's gambling in terms of crypto currencies. I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending. Now when it happens or how or anything else.\nI don't know but I know this. I could buy a five year put out every one of the crypto currencies. I'd be glad to do it but I would never short a dime's worth I do think. I think what's going on definitely will come to. And we don't own any we're not sure that they will ever have a position in them. It's out of currency. I mean it does not meet the test of a currency. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not around in 10 or 20 years.\nPeople say well I'll show you goods and the coins but they change the price of those every the price of the dollar changes in relation because they're pricing off the dollar. They could say well I'll sell it to you in barrels of oil but if they every time the price of oil changes they change the number of barrels you have to have that's your oil is not the currency. Well generally non-productive assets remain. If you bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it you know in maybe a couple of tenths of one percent. The it's essentially is not going to deliver anything other than supposing scarcity because only you can only mine so many but so what. I mean what is what does it produces self. You know the check is a wonderful idea.\nJust imagine what it will be without being able to write checks or have wire transfer funds. But it doesn't make the check intrinsically itself worth a lot of money. And if you said you can use something called check with a little piece of paper you do something else to transfer money. I think that any time you buy a non-productive asset you are counting on somebody else later on to buy a non-productive asset because they think they can sell it to somebody for more money. And it's been tried with tulips and it's been it's been tried with various things over time and it does come to a bad ending.\nI mean having you have a hard time you can you can think of the good Rawle and I mean the Louisiana Purchase was say 15 million dollars for eight hundred thousand or so square miles of lighting them back. You're sitting on land that came with the Louisiana Purchase. And and so what we pay we paid 20 bucks a square mile and you know six hundred forty acres and a square mile and you're down to three cents or something. So that was a pretty good purchase of and what was then a nonproductive property but it did depend. But it's very hard. You can buy stamps.\nBill Gross got a wonderful stamp collection and sold for more money in the end. But it depended on somebody else wanting to buy hoping they will sell it for more money and so on. And in the end you make your money out of productive assets if you buy a farm you.\nYou try to estimate what the crops what amount per acre of soybeans or corn or whatever may be raised and how much you have to pay the farmer farms it for you and what your taxes will be various things and you make a conclusion based on what the asset itself will produce over time.\nAnd that's an investment when you buy something because you're hoping tomorrow morning you're going to wake up you know the price will be higher. It's going to be you know you need more people coming into the interleaving and and they and you can get that and that will feed off for a while and some time for a long while and sometimes do extraordinary numbers.\nBut in the end they come to bad endings and crypto currencies will come the bad endings and along with the fact that there are nothing being produced in the way of value from the asset. You also have the problem that it draws in a lot of charlatans and that sort of thing who are trying to create various sorts of exchanges or whatever it may be it. You know it's something where where people who are of less than stellar character see an opportunity to clip people who are trying to get rich because their neighbors are getting rich buying the stuff that neither one of them understands. It will come to a bad ending Charlie. Well I like your broker currencies a lot less than you do. And so to me it's just dementia. And I think if people were professional traders they'd go into trading crypto currencies.\nIt's it's just disgusting. It's like somebody else is trading turds and you decide I can't be left out. To the extent that this writing were being webcast around the world I hope some of our stuff doesn't translate very well. We see your thoughts stay away from a day away from the Mirage. Basically I made that. It's a method of transmitting money. It's very effective way of transmitting money and do it anonymously and all that a check is a way of transmitting money to Chechnya or the whole thing because they can transmit money orders transmit money money order people do it. I hope Bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it but you could replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be and the idea that it has something huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view. Checks are actually drawn. You're drawing upon something that's not there.\nYou're transferring the money dollars on both and the to which is a very fast money order.

In fact, prices started to decline during the very conference. CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 rally did not happen, very disappointing. What we needed was a trifecta of progress: (i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed), but we got progress on (i) and (ii). Full text below pic.twitter.com/XcqNhgYgK7\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 18, 2018\nTherefore, it is better if the digital currencies consolidate the huge gains of 2017 and allow the fundamentals to catch up. The longer time spent in the range, the stronger will be the breakout. Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak believes that the blockchain technology and Bitcoin will reach its full potential in about a decade . However, with many crypto enthusiasts trying to bring the technology to mainstream use, acceptance might come much earlier . As this is a new asset class, there might be a danger of potential scams. According to a study by The Wall Street Journal, about 18.6 percent initial coin offerings (ICOs) were using “deceptive or even fraudulent tactics.” This is why investors should not allow greed to blur their judgment while doing the due diligence. Let’s see if we find any low-risk buying opportunity today? BTC/USD Bitcoin has failed to attract buyers. It has continued to slide and is now at the critical support of $7,941.68. If this level breaks down, the digital currency will plunge to $7,000. The 50-day SMA is flat and the 20-day EMA is turning down, moving towards a bearish crossover. This is a negative development. If the support at $7,941.68 holds, the bulls will attempt a pullback, which will face resistance at the moving averages. We can confirm that the BTC/USD pair is range bound once the price breaks out of the 20-day EMA. As it is yet to bounce off the supports, we are avoiding any buy recommendations. ETH/USD Ethereum continues to outperform the other top cryptocurrencies. It is well above the 50-day SMA and just below the 20-day EMA. It is trying to hold the neckline of the bearish head and shoulders pattern. The pattern will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC) below the neckline, which has a lower target of $418. As the 50-day SMA is still rising and the 20-day EMA is flat, we don’t expect the ETH/USD pair to sink to $418 in a hurry. We anticipate a strong support at the 50-day SMA, which is close to the 50 percent retracement levels of the rally from $363 to $838. The first bullish sign will be a breakout of $745 levels. Until then, every pullback attempt will be met with a strong selling pressure. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has completed the head and shoulders pattern, which gives it a lower target objective of $650. Currently, it is close to the 50-day SMA, which might act as a support and a pullback to the neckline of the bearish H&S pattern is probable. If the bulls fail to scale above the neckline, chances of a breakdown increase. As the BCH/USD pair had risen vertically from $777.5304 on April 18 to $1,590.7825 on April 24, there are no supports in between $800-$1,130. Below the 50-day SMA, the cryptocurrency can plunge to $800 levels where some buying can be expected. We suggest waiting for prices to stabilize before buying. Catching a falling knife can be dangerous. XRP/USD Ripple is trying to hold the May 12 lows of $0.632 but it seems weak as it is not finding buyers even at these levels. A break and fall to the critical support level of $0.56270 looks probable. On the upside, the bulls will have to break out of the resistance zone between the 50-day SMA and $0.76 to exhibit strength. We suggest waiting for the XRP/USD pair to show some strength before initiating any long positions. XLM/USD Stellar has broken below some key support levels and is currently at the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. A break and close (UTC) below the neckline will complete the pattern which has a lower target of $0.2. Even if the neckline support holds, it will be a tough climb for the bulls because the XLM/USD pair will face resistance at the 50-day SMA and the 20-day EMA. The first sign of strength will be on a break out above the May 13 highs of $0.38692920. The longer the price sustains below the moving averages, the weaker it will get. Hence, we are not suggesting any trade on it. LTC/USD Litecoin has been trading below the 50-day SMA for the past three days, which shows a lack of buying even at these low levels. The bulls are trying to defend the $127 levels. If this level breaks, a slide to the $115 levels is possible. On the upside, any bounce to the 50-day SMA or the 20-day EMA will attract selling. We remain bearish on the LTC/USD pair until it shows consistent buying. The trend will change only on a breakout and close above the $170 levels. However, if the digital currency falls to $115 levels and holds, we shall risk a buy. ADA/BTC Cardano has broken below the trendline and the 50-day SMA. It has minor support at the May 12 lows of 0.00002870. If this level breaks, the next support on the downside is at 0.000025. On the upside, the bulls will face stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA and the 20-day EMA. Once these two levels are crossed, the final hurdle will be the horizontal resistance at 0.00003445. We shall turn positive once the ADA/BTC pair sustains above this level. Until then, it remains in a no-trade zone. IOTA/USD IOTA is trying to hold the horizontal support at $1.63, which is just below the 50-day SMA. If the support holds, a move back to $2.2117 is possible but the up move will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and at $2 levels. If the support breaks, the IOTA/USD pair can slide to $1.28 levels. The 50-day SMA is rising while the 20-day EMA is declining. Chances of a range bound action are high. We need to wait for a buy setup to emerge before suggesting any long positions on it. EOS/USD EOS has been attempting to hold on to the 50-day SMA for the past two days. The 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally is also close to the current levels. An attempt to rebound off the supports on May 17 met with selling pressure close to the 20-day EMA. The EOS/USD pair might remain range bound between the 50-day SMA and the 20-day EMA for a few days before breaking out or breaking down from it. The next support on the downside is at $10 levels, while the overhead resistance is at $14. We shall look for buying opportunities once the digital currency sustains above the descending channel.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.
